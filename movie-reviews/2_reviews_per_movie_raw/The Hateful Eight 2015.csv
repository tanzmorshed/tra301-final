"gogoschka-1","Null","1333","1811","26 December 2015"," A stage play of a ""Who-Done-It"" murder mystery - with highly political undercurrents
","OK - if you've already seen the movie and hated it, my review won't change your mind, so move along folks, move along, there's nothing to see for you here, thanks.<br/><br/>Now for you, dear film fan, who is about to watch 'The Hateful Eight', but who is now slightly worried because of some very mixed critical reactions - for YOU I'm writing this 100% spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>Judging from many comments here on IMDb and other forums, I gather that many long-time Tarantino fans apparently don't like his newest film. I had feared such a reaction as soon as I had finished watching the movie. It's obviously Tarantino's least accessible effort yet, and there's a number of reasons for that, not the least of which being that this is simply not the film most people expected (or felt they were promised). So if you haven't seen it yet and you're a bit doubtful because of the negative reviews, let me tell you: you'll likely end up loving it - as I did - IF you prepare yourself juuuust a little. And because I really liked the movie, I would like to help you do that via a short list of recommendations. Ready? Here it goes:<br/><br/>1. Don't go watch 'The Hateful Eight' expecting a ""classic"" Western. It might belong to the Western genre, but if all that talk about Ultra 70mm Panavision had you thinking of lush outdoor scenery, vast landscapes or anything resembling a Sergio Leone movie, you'll end up disappointed. There are a few nice shots showing snowy mountains, but 95% (perhaps more) of the story unfolds indoors (in one single room) - which isn't to say that the cinematography isn't absolutely fantastic. In fact, it's more than fantastic: it's stunning and worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>2. Don't expect any exciting ""action"" scenes (for lack of a better word: I don't mean the 'Fast & Furious' kind of action scenes) every 10 minutes or so; in fact, don't expect anything other to happen between the characters than dialog for a loooooong time. Unlike in Tarantino's previous films where we got almost ""spoiled"" by unexpected over-the-top moments in nearly every scene (except maybe for 'Jackie Brown' and 'Deathprooof'), this film has a very, very slow build. But: that's not to say it ISN'T exciting (or that nothing does happen) - it's just that the excitement and tension result mainly from the dialog and the excellent performances by the cast (at least for roughly two thirds of the movie).<br/><br/>3. Best approach this film as you would theater; for that's what 'The Hateful Eight' really is: a stage play disguised as a movie. A stage play of a ""Who-Done-It"" murder mystery with a touch of Agatha Christie. But then again, that's also a disguise, for the murder mystery is just a ploy to cast a look at a torn society rife with racial tension after the civil war. Which, of course, again serves as an allegory for race relations in modern-day America and as the director's angry commentary on how hateful that situation still is today, on all sides. Now that sounds awfully serious, but don't worry; despite some hard-to-stomach ugliness and the highly political undercurrent, there is plenty of Tarantino's trademark humor throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to find a likable character you can root for. There's a reason for the film's title, and unlike in all his previous films, there is not a single person in Tarantino's latest movie you'll feel any real sympathy for. All the main characters have committed despicable, hateful acts, and they're all beyond redemption - but that doesn't mean they're not compelling to watch (especially given THIS cast: everyone is fantastic, but Jackson, Russell, Jason Leigh and Goggins are just a joy to watch).<br/><br/>5. Don't expect a complex plot. In my opinion, among Q.T's films this is the one with the most straight forward and most simple plot to date, yet at the same time it's arguably his most complex - and most ambitious - film.<br/><br/>So, dear film fan, that's it: adhere to these here 5 ""commandments"", and there's a big chance you'll end up loving Mr. Banana Chin's latest oeuvre as much as I did (mind; you might love the film just as much without taking any of the above advice). I admit, it took me a while to get into this dialog-heavy stage play and would-be Western, but once I did, I never looked back (and I can hardly wait to watch it again). 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","Everything you would come to expect from Tarantino, just on a more confined scale. The original screen play and acting both amaze, it is always refreshing to see some of the banter and slang he comes up with. Yes it is super violent but once again the director makes it so we really don't care, the music fits perfect as well."
"realtab","7","1036","1545","31 December 2015"," Don't believe the 1's and 2's or the 9's and 10's
","The film is too well crafted to get the really low scores, the cinematography is too good, the acting too high caliber, the direction too solid, the score too nice, and the flick too engaging for such ratings.<br/><br/>This also applies to the other end. The ""twists"" are unimportant and add no spice, the pacing just slogs along, the joy too nonexistent, the characters evoke too little emotion either way, the story too light on satisfaction, the story telling too inconsistent, the length too needless,the magic (other than on the technical side) too absent, and the rewatchability too minimal for me to see greatness but maybe a second viewing will change my perspective but it will definitely be on video for me, only the lure of a hot date fixated on going could get me into the theater again other than maybe just for the experience a 70mm screening.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty avid Tarrentino fan but I didn't overly enjoy this effort. I more appreciate it and can't say I wasn't engaged but I also can't say that I'm eager to see it again and worse for the first time I have little inclination to do so with a flick by Q.<br/><br/>A generous 7/10 (rounding up from 6.5) for me but I could see ceiling of 8 and a basement of 4 at the lowest."
"bkoganbing","8","106","153","10 April 2016"," Minnie's Haberdashery, where the elite meet
","You'd have to go back 80 years or so to the film adaptation of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End to find a film where the set qualifies as a living participant of the action. The house in the adaption of the Eugene O'Neill classic Long Day's Journey Into Night also qualifies here.<br/><br/>The action is set up when the stagecoach where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is taking his prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh to the town of Red Rock to be hung. A couple of prairie hitchhikers also come on board another bounty hunter Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins son of a former Confederate general who says he's the new sheriff in the town of Red Rock. Kurt Russell replete with full flowing beard and mustache is one suspicious man. He has those suspicions justified before the film is ended.<br/><br/>80% of the action takes place on set of the 19th century bed and breakfast during the time of a nasty Wyoming winter and does the dialog crackle. If you think you're going to see a western the kind that John Ford or Howard Hawks or Henry Hathaway did back in the old days, then don't watch The Hateful Eight. Hateful is the operating word with these characters, there's nothing really noble about any of them.<br/><br/>Besides the set of Minnie's Haberdashery to recommend it, Quentin Tarrantino selected a truly fine ensemble cast who play beautifully off each other. As the outlaw queen Jennifer Jason Leigh got a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but in my humble opinion she doesn't stand out any more than any of the rest of them. The Hateful Eight also earned Ennio Morricone an Oscar for the best musical score for 2015.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a great western, but it ain't your grandpa's kind of western."
"tcrescenzo-08409","10","1024","1642","31 December 2015"," Everyone seems to be missing the point
","If your willing to jump on the bandwagon and avoid this movie just because a couple of thin skinned reviewers are complaining about all the blood and all the ""n-words"", then you might as well just shovel your money into Disney's pockets and see star wars because that's the movie for you. This is the first real piece of cinema that has come to the theaters this year; with all the audacity, the balls, and the fearless will to show anything on screen that real filmmakers are brave enough to commit themselves to. If all these negative reviewers would just look past the blood and the guts, they would find a truly masterful piece of cinematic art that reflects both the expertise and effort that went into making it. The storyline is a simple one, but it's told in a complex, interesting, and relatively unique way that is guaranteed to keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout the entire 3 hour run time of the movie. Tarantino's direction is unparalleled as usual, and the performance of the entire cast combined with the wonderful cinematography and deeply engaging dialogue make for a remarkably fun time at the theater, if your willing to sit through a lot of grisly violence and mean spirited subject matter. And although many people are complaining about the heavy political undertones of the film's storyline, to me that is one of the main components of this film that stands out the most. The plot of this film serves not only as a compelling metaphor for the racial tension amongst the American people immediately following the civil war, but actually manages to outline the visceral anger and unpredictability of the racial tension that the American people are facing today within society. In a world hell bent on purporting sensitivity and being politically correct, it's nice to see a movie that's willing to raise a middle finger to that social stigma so as to hold a mirror to the racial confrontations that are still plaguing the American people to this very day. Obviously this film is undoubtedly the most sick, twisted, and violent of Tarantino's filmography, and I'm willing to admit that it's not for everybody, but for those of you willing to toughen up, keep your trigger happy insecurities in check, and enjoy a mean, gritty, and badass film that offers no apologies for what it does best I highly recommend this film. And for those of you who are willing to let Tarantino's comments about the police force get in the way of your enjoyment of this film, like I said; Disney is more than willing to take your hard earned money."

","Even tho i was expecting more action, I've found myself at the edge of my seat at times. The characters were nicely developed. The dialogue was as expected from a Tarantino movie. The story is 3 hours long, it takes place mostly in a one single room and it's still not boring. That's something not everyone can do. All of the actors we're perfect for their roles and the acting was great as well as the character design, all of the characters were memorable and well written. The movie is divided into chapters in most of which a small twist takes place that makes you more interested in the movie. I enjoyed the film but my biggest flaws were the length and the spontaneous introduction of a narrator mid- movie, that was a pretty 'out of nowhere' lazy way to develop the back story, but oh well, Tarantino is known for making risks and doing crazy sh*t"
"vaivhav","10","687","1194","30 December 2015"," Go for it. Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!
","This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. <br/><br/>Go damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino style."
"featheredsun","8","77","127","30 January 2016"," Theatric and Detailed
","This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.<br/><br/>The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.<br/><br/>The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other.<br/><br/>The blizzard provides the necessary isolation to the story. These characters are stuck with each other, and this forced closeness is central to the story - they're all Hateful, and that hate reverberates among them, destroying peace and hope. Hate is what brings them together and hate is what tears them apart. The blizzard also provides some interesting incidental elements that are fascinating to watch, like the hardship of a simple task like preparing guidelines, or going to the outhouse, and the cold hell explodes inward at times (when the door is opened) with punctuating effect, providing some breaks to the narrative, and even some needed laughs.<br/><br/>And the bar... This film's action takes place primarily in one large room. It feels very much like a stage play (as another reviewer mentioned), allowing greater intimacy with the characters and their interactions, while providing us with an opportunity to witness multiple scenarios unfolding at the same time. This density of action is very cool. We are afforded third person omniscience without losing connection with the motives and perspectives of the players.<br/><br/>And the stage setting meshes very integrally with the acting. We see the principal actors doing top-notch with not only their primary motivational actions, but nearly every choice in blocking and busy action. The director and production team make a very wise choice in showing the small little details of what's going on here. Attention is paid to realistic procedural actions, and reactions, for these details. The result is that we see characters behaving in reasonable ways to their environments, pausing to disarm a stranger, or undo a shackle, not simply because the plot calls for it, but because it's a reasonable choice that they would make at the time. Very refreshing to see, actually.<br/><br/>On the negative side, Tarrantino's choice to use narration was weakly executed. I don't know if there would have been a way to do this without narration, but the actual usage detracted from the ongoing story. Also, there were a few points in the action where the characters seemed to be a little too accepting of the events that transpire around them. This is purely a fault of direction/writing.<br/><br/>But overall, a very watchable film, that is notably unafraid to portray some very dirty and uncomfortable bits of the human psyche. Some folks seem to have an issue with this last part. My advice to them is to loosen up a bit and accept art that hurts a little. That's one of the things good art can do."
"Randm-1","10","60","101","26 January 2016"," A matured Tarantino delivers social critic
","Finally some real social critic from Tarantino. Not for everyone, not even for all Tarantino Fans i suppose. You need to get and love his rhythmic prose to enjoy this movie. That is because you need to be hooked to this movie which will be the cause to have the desire to look deeper into it. There you'll find something ugly and beautiful at the same time, a critical view of society, justice and yes, humanity.<br/><br/>Spoiler: John""The Hangman""Ruth dies first, as one of the main characters, which is important. He doesn't fit in there, the character could have lived on but not his principle, this needed to be crushed to rise again later, at the end, with full meaning. Job is not supposed to be easy, hm? It's not supposed to be hard either! Well, this sums up living on our planet. On a daily basis you need to make a decision, at least moral people should do that, but it is quite clear immoral people do this as well the decisions just differs. You are able to change your own decisions, keep that in mind when viewing the character Chris Mannix(outstanding acting of Walton Goggins), who might be a sheriff or not, we will never know.<br/><br/>There really is a deeper meaning, but it won't be discovered by every viewer. The decision to have an original soundtrack speaks volumes about how Tarantino himself thought about this.<br/><br/>Technically this is Tarantino's best work till now, from my point of view, Kill Bill his second. But this is not the Tarantino most will expect, this is no Kill Bill or Pulp or Basterds, it's a neatly filmed theater stage play, an ensemble movie, which really defines the word ensemble. Soundtrack is fantastic, no not just that, it's near perfect.<br/><br/>The movie is long, some people will find it boring and i understand that as i said in the beginning you need to be interested, to be hooked perhaps by Tarantino's Style to look deeper. In my twenties I think this movie would not have the same impact as it had now, perhaps I matured with Tarantino. I like that about myself, I really do. Thank you for entertaining me the way i want it to be, Mr Tarantino.<br/><br/>The sad part about it is, that those who really should look behind the violence(which is an art form), behind the offensive speech(which is just a writer doing his job like he should) are not going to do it. <br/><br/>Regardless, I'm giving it a 10, cause the lyrics in this song, oh sorry movie, are phenomenal."
"Jerghal","7","210","388","6 March 2016"," Don't believe the hype, it's okay but Tarantino can do better
","So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work."
"Lolz132","7","119","216","5 April 2016"," Not worth the hype... or hate.
","Let me start off by saying. That anyone giving this film a 1 or 2 is embarrassing themselves and anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm not saying this because I like this movie, I'm saying it because it's true. Hardly any movie in the modern era deserves this rating unless it is shameless schlock without character or plot. The Hateful 8 is not that movie. The acting alone gives this movie a 6.5 because it is so good. If you were bored by this movie, I hope you can at least admit that the people involved with this film are extremely talented. <br/><br/>Now, having said that, I'll get into the meat of the review. I enjoyed this movie. However, I must admit that the main aspect of this film (and biggest cause of disdain), the dialogue, is so prominent that it might as well be the entire first half of the movie. When a movie is this dialogue heavy, it tends to put audiences to sleep. However, the cinematography and musical score is what kept me interested. I'm not usually one to notice music in a movie, but Morricone has done an excellent job of creating atmosphere and tension throughout this film. Without him, it's a real snooze-fest. Not to say that the dialogue wasn't top notch either. The lack of characters allows for more streamlined and focused storytelling. The movie stays away from unnecessary dialogue and story padding and focuses more on character building. It is clear from dialogue alone what every characters motivation is unless it is intentionally hidden. <br/><br/>I respect what this movie tried to do and I think Tarantino succeeded in making the movie he wanted to make. He created an atmospheric and genuinely intriguing mystery movie with a western theme. Now, that movie may not appeal to wide audiences and make tons of $$cash$$, but they tried something ambitious and I believe it payed off."

","This movie was surprisingly good. Tarantino's Old Movies were great too but this was a whole new level. Acting, Musics, Plot were just so good. Only problem was maybe that it was unbalanced, first half was just talking so we thought the whole movie would be like that but it turns out to be a movie that has many action and thrilling scenes. So I think the only people who didn't like the movie was either people who just got bored in the first half and slept or....they probably liked the movie. So in the end the movie being unbalanced just couldn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.

And yes the movie absolutely delivers on the sheer moment-to-moment pleasures fans have come to expect, combined with dynamite dialogue . Armed with vicious humor and an intense story, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is as brutal in its insights into race relations and human nature as it is in its depiction of violence in the old West.<br/><br/>I'm starting to doubt if Pulp Fiction is still his best movie to date."
"NaturaTek","2","105","216","26 December 2015"," An honest review that doesn't really matter
","I'm a Tarantino fan, but this film was difficult to process. I hear some people say he ""..broke the rules by creating 3 hour plus film"" or ""..glorious cinema"" - all in the context of being good. For me, and this is my subjective opinion, is this film is bad. <br/><br/>First, I do not know why Tarantino needed 3 hours to make this film. The storyline was excessive. It feels more like a 3 hour student reel of 70mm cinematography. <br/><br/>In the real wild west, they would have simply shot the bounty hunter, not spend hours planting guns, giving up their *own* guns, cooking, making a fire, and poisoning the coffee. I believe that for me, the story dialogue alone killed the movie. It is simply unrealistic. <br/><br/>What in the world was up with the sole female in the movie being 'facialized' with spit, punches, blood, vomit, and brains? It almost felt like Tarantino had his heart broke and took it out on this character via film. <br/><br/>And heck, watching the movie felt like reading Huckleberry Finn, with ""nigger' in almost all the dialogue. Sure, this is a common trait in many dark films, but damn, it sorta was excessive in this film. Not in a bad way (well slightly), but in a way that it just didn't work. Tarantino has spoken about using his film to *correct* injustices of the past. This is notable in his films; Django - a hero slave who frees other slaves and whips the white man and Inglorious Bastards - kill Nazis. I think Tarantino squeezed some of that Tarantino justice in the Hateful Eight, by showing S. Jackson forcing the head of a helpless White man to deep throat his penis. <br/><br/>I love recurring actors in a director's film, but I think this film killed that spirit, at least for me. Man, the actors in this film appeared lethargic, almost as if they were tired in appearing in another Tarantino film. Well, S. Jackson appeared the most peppy. <br/><br/>I believe this film is almost made for film/cinema/camera buffs; the general audience may not appreciate some cinematic elements in the film. <br/><br/>What is holding this movie on the likability scale is the 70mm use, but using it for this particular story and its narrative was a waste. <br/><br/>This is a slooooooooooow movie. The 3 hours is a testament. But I don't know. I think it's simply a combination of elements that made this movie bad: the acting that appeared fake/tired, the long ass story, the story itself, and the dialogue. My brain just didn't process it and regurgitated the film. <br/><br/>I really wanted to love this film. It simply didn't happen. But does it matter? If you love it, then that's all that matters."
"galaxy472-1","1","90","185","9 January 2016"," WHAT WAS Tarantino THINKING?
","Let me say upfront that I have liked all of Tarantino's Movies up till now. But his latest offering, The Hateful 8, is way below his usual standard! To begin with he shot it in 70mm, which is normally reserved for film- makers making some sort of epic production....this film is no epic production, and is in fact far from it! The movie is way too long, the acting is cringe-worthy, and the amount of dialogue is excessive, and to be quite blunt, boring and unnecessary. I am also fed up seeing Samuel L. Jackson continue to play Samuel L. Jackson! Is Tarantino unaware there are far better black actors in the cinema world? There could have been at least 30 minutes cut from this movie, and maybe, just maybe it may have made it a bit more bearable! Maybe it's time Tarantino takes a break from writing and directing, and starts rethinking his approach to movie making? He may also need to sit down and watch some Coen Brothers movies, just to see that a good movie can be made, without gratuitous violence. I hope he does not have another Western in mind for his next movie, and can move on to the present? I am one very disappointed Fan, and I am sure I am merely one of a long queue?"

Instead of the mysterious and misanthropic tale I was expecting I stumbled upon pure boredom plain and simple. Good performances throughout but a pretty graphic, pointless, violent tale better suited for a graphic novel rather than a movie.I had quite an expectation after ""Jango Unchained"" and I wouldn't have endured this otherwise.

","If you are among those once-discerning viewers who believe that everything QT does is wonderful because he is smart and clever and the rest of us so hobbled we can just barely appreciate his genius, then just hit the NOT USEFUL key and go on about your business. Don't bother with the rest of this review.<br/><br/>For those viewers who still have an ounce of common sense, my comments are: <br/><br/>1. Once again, QT makes an attempt to pay homage to the Italian westerns, using the camera angles and plot lines most associated with this unique genre of film that appeared in the 60s and disappeared in the 70s. Jackson plays the Lee Van Cleef character (and does a very poor job of it) and the rest of the cast, all major talents in their own right, do their best to keep up with the director's ""vision"" - but ultimately fail.<br/><br/>2. For the record, for the six or seven readers who are still with me, I watched all the original Italian westerns in that era. In theatres. Even the ones where the distribution companies could not afford to redub, and used subtitles. All of them. I loved them. I loved the way the tight camera angles and overdone sound effects would set you up for the scenes of explosive violence that followed. There was a unique ""beat"" or cadence to these films -- dialog, character development, slow stretches, explosive action, conflict development, more action, less dialog, less development, much more action, more action, ... and a final culmination.<br/><br/>3. QT, as with everything he does, believes he not only understands the inner workings of these films but can (heavy sigh) improve on them. He should google the term ""hubris."" And his many fans (too many) should re-read the story of the Emperors New Clothes.<br/><br/>4. This film turns the original formula -- which worked -- into an overlong stage play full of hackneyed dialog that doesn't work at all. Some of the best talents in this business are wasted because they are compelled by the script and the director to deliver performances which they instinctively realize are atonal. There is no viewer engagement. There is no audience connection. I feel especially sorry for viewers who never saw the originals and came to the theatre believing, based on the sycophantic reviewers, that they are watching something wonderful and amazing. Like the opera-goers who fall asleep during the performance, and afterwards pretend it was a treat.<br/><br/>I wonder if viewers of the future will look back at the QT phenomenon and wonder what the heck we were smoking?"

"bruiser-92091","1","109","229","9 January 2016"," Absolutely terrible!
","I can't decide which is more sickening. This movie or that there are so many good reviews for it. What is wrong with you people? There is no plot! The only far fetched plot that could possibly be extruded from this movie would be that of Agatha Christies ""And Then There Were None"". If you are still planning to see this movie expect to watch paint dry for the first hour of the movie. Then you can expect two more hours of disgusting/ revolting/ stomach churning bloodshed that doesn't help or propel the plot in any way. It is completely irrelevant and is only there to appeal to the sick minded people who get their rocks off from watching such gruesome acts . To all the normal people out there please don't see this movie. But if you are into steampunk, without a job, and have a Grunge band in your parents basement you'll probably love it!<br/><br/>Seriously please don't see this movie!<br/><br/>Have some class America!"

First hour was one of the slowest most painful in my movie watching career. Sadly, even if it ends in a kick ass way, will be waiting till released on Netflix and can fast forward through the 1.5 hrs previously had to endure to see if actually redeems itself. And to put things straight; asked and received full refunds for tickets. Plot was the most slow to develop of any movie I've seen in last 20years.

","Tarantino has some good movies, some great movies and now a total fecal matter movie. Skip this one and watch Blazing Saddles instead. Blazing Saddles has better use of the n-word, is less boring and has an actual message.<br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/<br/><br/>If you want I'll spare you the interminable three hours and sum up the Tarantino version, here it is >>Spoilers<< Just say niggler minus the l over and over again until you pass out from boredom.<br/><br/>Honestly that word so many times was distracting and just smells of lazy writing. Might as well read a dictionary - at least you learn something. Do not pay money for a piece of fecal matter like that.<br/><br/>The term niggler is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. The senses labeled Extremely Disparaging and Offensive represent meanings that are deeply insulting and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense. It is so profoundly offensive that a euphemism has developed for those occasions when the word itself must be discussed, as in court or in a newspaper editorial: ""the n-word."" Despite this, the sense referring to a ""black person"" is sometimes used self-referentially among African Americans in a neutral or familiar way. The sense referring to other victims of prejudice, especially when used descriptively, as to denounce that prejudice, is not normally considered disparaging—as in ""The Irish are the nigglers of Europe"" from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments —but the other uses are considered contemptuous and hostile.<br/><br/>Niggler in senses 1 and 2 can be found in the works of such writers of the past as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens, but it now ranks as perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English. Its use by and among blacks is not always intended or taken as offensive, but, except in sense 3, it is otherwise a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry.<br/><br/>-NIGGLER<br/><br/>noun 1. Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a contemptuous term used to refer to a black person. a contemptuous term used to refer to a member of any dark-skinned people. 2. Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive. a contemptuous term used to refer to a person of any racial or ethnic origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc. 3. a victim of prejudice similar to that suffered by black people; a person who is economically, politically, or socially disenfranchised."
"TheFilmTruth","1","422","954","23 December 2015"," Tarantino Fires Blanks for Hours!
","To begin, if you want to make it through the whole film in one sitting it's best if you are locked and loaded with caffeine or some form of amphetamine because it is very slow, very long, and very boring. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big QT fan and usually enjoy the great slow, long and creative dialog in his films, but sadly the ""great and creative"" doesn't exist here. Normally I can't wait for his next film to come out, but even after seeing the trailer a couple months back I said ""uh oh, this doesn't look anywhere near up to par."" Little did I know what an understatement of epic proportions that would be.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have pointed out, the single positive aspect was the beautiful wide landscape and horse drawn carriage scenes. Unfortunately they only lasted a few minutes in total.<br/><br/>Here are just a few of the things that really stuck out:<br/><br/><ul><li>Not a single character (of the main eight) was likable in the least bit so it never mattered who got killed. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors and I wanted to like or root for him but even he couldn't save this stinker. After a short amount of time I was wishing everyone would start killing one another so this travesty would come to an end.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>At an early point I got the feeling QT made a bet with someone to see if he could outdo himself by using the ""N"" word more times than in Django. Or, more likely he has a sick fetish and loves to hear the word as often as possible. Needless to say it is overwhelmingly painful having to unnecessarily hear it hundreds of times. ""But wait!"" the blind loyal Tarantino Kool-aid drinking followers will say, ""it was extremely racist back then and he's just being authentic to the times!"" Well in that case riddle me this: how is it that Sam Jackson along with everyone else had perfect straight white Hollywood teeth which we got multiple close- ups on??? If he was trying to be authentic all those pearly whites would have been closer to gruesome than the straight, white perfection we saw. Ever see Barry Pepper's character in the last ""True Grit""? Now that was realistic! There are plenty of other similar things even slightly perceptive viewers will pick up on which were simply wrong and out of place for the times. You'll see for yourself if you decide to mosey on down this steaming poop trail.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of which and it doesn't last long, but as much as I love Zoë Bell her Kiwi accent and NZ background here were also completely out of place and just plain wrong. Not nearly as bad as the pathetic attempt Tarantino made in Django at an Aussie accent but still completely unreal for the setting. (At least he didn't include Jonah Hill in this one.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I don't even know where to begin with the full blown gay BJ scene out in the snow. Many will most likely chalk it up to a typical Tarantino shock value type of situation and he probably believes it's wild and crazy and original, but it ends up as just another sad attempt at trying to be any of those things. Either that or maybe he has more personal fetishes he wants to portray to us (yet again) on screen?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Last but not least, there's a whole narration scene which was so completely unnecessary it was insulting and offensive to the viewers' intelligence. This, along with the regurgitated ""chapter"" style setup appears to be him struggling to get back to the success and originality of Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, but simply ends up firing blanks. There were no surprises in the least bit, everything was completely predictable, and the casual viewers and hardcore fans alike who are honest with themselves will be offended and want their money and 3 hours of wasted life back. That is, unless you passed out like a few others I saw do halfway during my screening.</li></ul><br/><br/>With this spectacular regurgitated catastrophe watching the snow melt for the three hours wasted would have been more pleasurable and exciting than this debacle. Go and see ""The Revenant"" if you want a real masterpiece. Only those who are blind cult followers should gorge for hours on this yellow snow."

"bazooka-jo-152-424620","1","242","535","8 January 2016"," Annoying tedious boring policor piece of crap!
","Reservoir dogs, pulp fiction & jackie brown are timeless classics. Since then every movie QT made got worse and worse. He reached a new low though with this annoying boring policor (politically correct) piece of crap! It became clear to me though that not Uma Thurman, but S.L. Jackson is his muse. And clearly QT has the hots for him which became very clear in this film. <br/><br/>+++spoiler+++ There's this scene where Mr. Jackson tortures a white (hence racist) person to death by letting him walk nude through cold snow for 2 hours. As the dying victim begs for a blanket Jackson gets his big black **** out and forces him to suck it while he laughs sadistically. +++spoiler stop+++<br/><br/>It's very obvious to me that what we're experiencing here is an example of 'mirroring'. QT clearly would love to suck the big black **** of Jackson himself and expresses that by creating this 'shocking' scene which is clearly a depiction of his own sexual fantasy. One really doesn't need a psychology degree to figure that out. Wel Quentin... go ahead and suck big black **** all day long. I couldn't care less. What I do care about though is that you should stop making these annoying boring policor movies.<br/><br/>Explaining the policor accusation: The movie apparently takes place shortly after the civil war in America. Protagonist Jackson kills a lot of people but they're all bad cause they are from the south... hence they are racist and deserve to die. The fact that Jackson himself is a mega racist is not supposed to make us stop cheering for this protagonist though because... well let's face it... he's black so he can't be racist.... and he's black.. so he is cool. To clarify: protagonist Jackson is an a**hole, he annoyed me and I definitely wasn't cheering for him for friggin' 2 hours and 45 minutes!<br/><br/>I could go on for another hour but I made my point and wasted enough time by watching this hyped poor excuse of a movie. This movie was even worse that the stupid nazi movie and the dumb slavery movie he made. I didn't think that would be possible but Quentin... you pulled it off!"

","Okay, the movie is beyond unbelievable. That aside it has a few shining moments. Some of the dialogue is good and there happens to be some good acting. The bad, it drags on. It's almost three hours that could have been cut down to an hour and a half which would have raised it's rating. Quentin Tarantino again loves to flaunt the fact he can use racial slurs. He must feel he gets away with it because he adds black actors, making them main characters many times the hero. <br/><br/>A disturbing part of this film is the graphic detail Samuel L. Jackson gets into describing him raping and sexually assaulting a white man. While Quentin Tarantino makes cameos in his movies he doesn't here, he does for the first time in this movie start narrating right after this descriptive scene. He is lisping with delight as he talks. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh are good and each brutal in this movie. <br/><br/>To sum up, this is a western that takes place 90% of the times in a one room building, the fact they pulled this off is impressive, would be a lot more impressive if the movie was actually better."

","I've been using IMDb for years, and I had never written a review until now. I needed to make the 8/10 rating of this film go down. <br/><br/>I came straight home after seeing the movie; I couldn't function. I was absolutely disgusted. I was disgusted that my friends were in awe of Tarantino... calling him an ""artist"" and telling me how ""appreciative"" they were of his taste in creative value. I was disgusted that a theater full of people were LAUGHING after one of the characters was shot and writhing in pain on the floor. AND I was even more disgusted that the racial slurs were laughed at. Post-civil war, freedom was nothing to joke about. For that matter, it isn't something to joke about today. <br/><br/>I almost walked out of the theater after the MASSACRE of innocent bystanders... for a cause that lacked substance. Yes, it is a movie. It is meant for entertainment. But do we really live in a society where racial slurs are encouraged and unnecessary violence and torture are commended as ""art""? The movie industry, and directors like Quentin Tarantino, are encouraging it. <br/><br/>I'm seriously concerned for anyone who commends this movie, laughs at the suffering of humans, and calls Tarantino an artist."

","I don't write movie reviews or post messages on Internet boards, but I am compelled to comment after seeing Quentin Tarantino's: ""The Hateful Eight"" last night. Take all the graphic violence of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" mix in a double dose of ""Pulp Fiction"" perversion, add a mind-numbing measure of Tarantino's most disgusting, revolting fantasies, dress it all up in Western garb, with an Agatha Christie-like whodunit plot, and you have the essence of this film.<br/><br/>Do you enjoy seeing a handcuffed woman elbowed full force in the mouth, or punched repeatedly until her face is bloody? Do you find it amusing to witness a man take a bullet to the groin, and then scream in agony? Do you go out of your way to watch men in their death throes projectile vomiting blood? Do you find it entertaining to see a guy marched naked at through the snow, and then forced to perform a sex act on his antagonist in the freezing cold? Is it amusing to witness a man's brains splatter on the face of the person in front of him as he is shot from behind? Does the sight of a man standing over a beautiful woman, who lies injured and helpless on the floor, and then blasting her at point blank with dual pistols give you satisfaction? Then you're going to love this movie.<br/><br/>Tarantino's vulgar brand of entertainment eclipses every other film-maker. Danny Boyle, your obsession with toilets (""Trainspotting,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"") dead infants and child abuse (""Slumdog"" and ""Trainspotting""), must step aside. Sorry Mr. Coppola, bloody horse heads and Luca Brasi's piano wire executions are minor league. And Mr. Spielberg, your depiction of soldiers taking bullets in ""Saving Private Ryan"" was bloody and graphic, but you still come up short. Quentin Tarantino stands alone in the genre of gore, perversion and vulgarity. This film doesn't belong in the local cinaplex, it belongs in the porn shop with the private viewing booths and the glory holes. Shame on the Weinsteins for allowing such a title to appear under their patronage. There is zero spiritual value to this film. No underlying moral theme. No snappy repartee. Not a single sympathetic character. Not even any comic relief. Nothing at all to engage your higher mind. Just the vulgar vision of a grown man who still has the mind and character of an adolescent boy.<br/><br/>I could have watched ""Star Wars,"" or ""The Revenant,"" both showing at the same cinaplex, but I was taken in by the hype over Tarantino's use of 70mm film, and expected some sort of visual spectacle. Boy did I screw up. Friends, if I ever talk about seeing another Tarantino movie again, give me a good hard smack to snap me out of it. Quentin Tarantino is not an artist, he's porn purveyor -- a man-child with way too much money who caters to the lowest animal instincts of the most ignorant among us. It speaks volumes about the pathetic state of our modern culture for a spectacle like this to get to the big screen in your neighborhood theatre."

I was expecting wide panoramas and beautiful vistas but Tarantino is done with them within a few minutes at the very beginning and then he sticks a bunch of wisecracking sadists in a one room cabin for the remaining 95% of the film.<br/><br/>What, then, is the damn point of using 70mm?<br/><br/>After listening to endless reels of nonstop clever ""dialogue"", the blood bath finally ensues. It is so drenched in sadistic blood as to become a parody of itself, a farce, a meaningless masturbatory pile of sick nonsense.<br/><br/>Although it takes place in 19th century Wyoming, all the actors have the whitest most perfect teeth on earth. <br/><br/>I won't bother criticizing the actors who do their best under the circumstances, I will say Samuel L.

","I actually only made it through the first half of the movie. Samuels Jackson's character is called Nigeria so many times by all the other characters, it had me wondering what the real purpose to the movie was. I just lost interest at some point. I've had the same experience with movies that use the F word a few hundred times.<br/><br/>Having worked in Watts of Los Angeles for 10 years I can honestly say I never heard a Caucasian use this word against an African American to his / her face. Although I've heard it a LOT being used from one African American to another, usually in playful banter. Many times during a day.<br/><br/>It seemed like Tarantino's whole point to the movie was the degradation of the African American, which I found repulsive and not fitting the facts of our modern world, based on my real life exposure to working with and around a mix of Caucasians and African Americans. I realize that African Americans were probably not treated well back in western times, but it seemed to be very overboard, and felt like it was trying to make a modern point.<br/><br/>A lot of what Tarantino has done in past movies was used in this movie, I guess he was so anxious to push his private agenda that it blinded him to being creative. Unless he has lost his touch, which often occurs with movie guru's.<br/><br/>I also felt that some of the actors were wrong for their parts, things for some of the characters just didn't feel real, lines were spoken as if read off of a billboard out of sight of the camera.

I didn't think the story was clever at all and the dialog really lacked cleverness. To be blunt, it was an uninspired film. The story involves a bounty hunter (Russell) trying to transport a wanted person (Leigh) to Red Rock Wyoming where she is to be hung. However, this culprit is the sister of an infamous gang leader who is suspected to be trying to free her. A rather harsh blizzard forces Russell and his bounty to stop in a haberdashery, where strangers have already amassed. Which ones might be gang members? Who is who? My problem with the film was that I was waiting for some memorable scenes, some great dialog, some neat twist. None of those things ever happened. The film was lacking in, well, everything.

"embedrei","1","185","404","27 December 2015"," Django II - A play for those who'd love to kill
","Another Tarantino movie about a bunch of depraved killers, another three-hour bore-fest by the master of unabashed hate. The plot of TH8 is simple, but told very heavy-handedly, with lots of chitchat & filler scenes; several times, for example, we have to watch people meticulously nailing a door shut, because the lock is broken. This slapstick idea goes surprisingly well with the rest of the movie. Four fifths of TH8 take place in a single big room that looks like a theater stage. Before the violence starts the air of a popular theater play from olden times is not far away. For the TV edition Tarantino should consider to add boo, hiss, laugh, cheer & sob tracks to really give it an authentic ""Calico Playhouse""-feeling and to spice it up with some severely missed emotions.<br/><br/>TH8 is again about bounty hunters, that creepy American institution. The first one, John Ruth, is called ""Hangman"". He doesn't hang his caught ""Wanted Dead or Alive""-guys himself, he just takes them back to town, where an official hangman will do this job. In the Tarantino-universe this is considered to be an irrational, stupid behavior. The desperate captive will try to flee; some companions might try to free him. Why go through all this trouble, if he could just kill them? The debauched answer is: He really loves to see people hang. That's his kink. TH8 tells the story of his journey to get his captive, Daisy D., to a place where she will perform her ""last dance"".<br/><br/>The second bounty hunter, Marquis Warren, is quite obviously an old version of Tarantino's Django. His motivation is rabid racial hatred. He uses every excuse to kill white guys. He is the only character in this movie that is sufficiently described by the adjective ""hateful"". Why don't the white guys consider his permanent bragging about killing whites as a threat to their own lives? They are very modern that way.<br/><br/>While the stage decoration looks genuine, the dialogs are all too frequently anachronistic, very obviously written by a social justice couch potato. They are soaked with features of an obnoxious zeitgeist: historical revisionism, hypocritical race obsession, ignorance of the human nature.<br/><br/>The worst element of TH8 is the violence. Never before has Tarantino celebrated it with such blazing sadism. In the age of exploding zombie heads this might sound silly or like a special accomplishment, but the violence in TH8 is really sickening and repulsive. Its most sordid manifestation is during TH8's only sex scene, featuring a woman and two men, who revel in their vicarious Estragon-&-Vladimir-moment. To what depths of depravation Tarantino's groupies will follow their master?<br/><br/>As for the title: Is ""Eight"" Tarantino's nickname? Or did he ponder: ""The hateful ate my last offerings; they will swallow even more of that stuff."" The answer is revealed at the very beginning of TH8: this is Tarantino's 8th film. How much more hate does the world need?"

If some of his other films were uneven, there were at least scenes that I enjoyed watching back, and I always appreciated his unique dialog. I could complain about the fact that it took place almost entirely in one room, but Reservoir Dogs used a similar narrative device and it is infinitely watchable. I can think of similar films, like The Master or Glengarry Glenross, in which the point is more about the dialog and performances than how the story resolves, and I almost always enjoy these movies. I can't really say why I didn't feel anything watching Hateful Eight--given the talent involved, I should be enjoying it as much as other viewers seem to. For whatever reason, it just left me completely disinterested."
"ViktorDrake","1","323","725","25 January 2016"," Half this film should've been left on the cutting room floor
","This movie just goes to show what happens when a director is given totally free reign in terms of script and running time, purely on account of his name. Tarantino has always been a fan of long conversational sections in his movies, but where they were engaging, entertaining and scalpel-sharp in the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, here they are just interminably long, boring and dull. <br/><br/>For the first time EVER, my girlfriend actually fell asleep in the cinema watching this bore-fest of a film, and that was way before the interval arrived. Talking of which, there was an audible groan that went up from the audience when the interval sign turned up on the screen, and not because everyone was soooo enthralled ; more that everyone was just willing it to end. While we were kicking our heels during the interval, I overheard the guy behind me say, ""this is clearly Tarantino's Phantom Menace"", while another guy was heard to say, ""hmmm, after an hour and half at least SOMETHING usually happens in a movie"". After an intriguing first 15 mins, nothing (and I mean NOTHING) of any note happens for the remainder of the first half of the film. The dialog is also painfully predictable in places. More than once, a conversation would start and I knew how it would end within the first couple of seconds...and yet the characters on screen would take several minutes to get there. Truly painful stuff.<br/><br/>The swearing, the liberal use of the ""N"" word, and the violence (when it eventually arrives after hours of plodding and highly unrealistic chit-chat), are not the problem with this film in my opinion. After all, this is a Tarantino movie which (while coming across as all rather juvenile), is designed for adults, so adult language and themes should surprise absolutely no-one. The problem is purely the fact that it's just too bloody long for such a threadbare plot! If this movie came in at somewhere between 1.5 and 2 hours, then it would've been just about OK (still not great, but OK at best), but at over 3 hours it's just a director's masturbation piece. It desperately needs a NON-Director's Cut to trim at least an hour out of the first half. There's a line in the movie where Samuel L Jackson's character says, ""Let's slow this down. Let's slow it way down""... and at that point I physically curled my toes in my shoes, thinking please god, don't make this any slower! Watching this movie is an ordeal, almost as punishing as what the old General's son has to go through at the ""business end"" of Jackson's ""Johnson""!<br/><br/>Granted, the second half is a little more engaging, but unfortunately by that point the damage has already been done by forcing the audience to sit through the turgid load of garbage that comprises the first half. But just when things are potentially looking up, Tarantino decides to feature an appearance by Zoe Bell who must have a fantastic chance of being crowned 'The Least Convincing Actress Ever To Grace The Silver Screen'! She is a truly atrocious performer, who's apparently picked up no additional acting skills since her abysmal showing in the marginally better Death Proof. If grinning inanely and reading a few lines like a child in a school play is ""acting"" then sign me up for an Oscar please.<br/><br/>By the way, how the hell did this thing cost $62m to make? Apart from a few outdoor scenes, the whole thing takes place in one room in a log cabin! So much for making the most out of the much vaunted 70mm format which is perfect for grand landscape vistas...and entirely wasted on indoor scenes.<br/><br/>In many ways this film comes across as all rather childish. Here Tarantino seems like a first-year film school student who's been given a camera (and a 70mm one at that), free reign to use some ""fruity"" language, and the keys to the fake-blood cupboard. I'm almost surprised he didn't try to shoehorn a couple of naked women into the movie as well...<br/><br/>In short, this is by far and away the worst movie Tarantino has ever made, and if it hadn't been made by him it would have a rating far lower than 8/10 on here. (In fact, after seeing page after page of 1 and 2 star ratings, I'm completely at a loss as to where the (current) 8/10 rating comes from!?). All I can say is if you INSIST on seeing this plodding mess, wait until it comes out on Blu-Ray and watch it in the comfort of your own home over the course of, say, three or four evenings with several espressos. If you're really lucky you may be able to stay awake through the whole lot if you watch it like that. Otherwise....sweet dreams."

","The Hateful Eight is awful. It is another long and angry film portraying white people as evil racists. Samuel L. Jackson plays the character of the noble Negro and in the end he vanquishes the evil white people.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is entirely devoted to character development. It is extremely slow, dull and tedious. Major Marquis Warren, played by Samuel L. Jackson, is the noble Negro character. Some viewers may sympathize with Major Warren because he is a former slave and heroic Union Calvary officer during the Civil War. Major Warren gleefully brags about all the white people that he killed during the war. The other characters play the role of the evil white person, as evidenced by their constant use of the N-word toward Major Warren. The repeated use of the N-word in this film is a failed literary device. Rather than manifest that the white characters are evil racists, the constant use of the N-word becomes a dreadful assault upon one's sensibilities.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film, the plot lumbers along. Major Warren holds the evil white characters at gun point and threatens them with imminent death. He torments an old Confederate General, played by Bruce Dern, who is looking for his lost son. Major Warren boastfully recounts (and the film explicitly shows) how he captured the General's lost son, stripped him naked, marched him through the snow for hours and then forced his captive to perform fellatio upon his ""big black dick,"" before shooting him to death.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has lost the golden touch. Some of his earlier films were worth watching, but The Hateful Eight, is trite, stale and banal."

","This is Agatha Christie for the first two thirds, then a gore fest that tries to compensate for the lack of action in the first part, and goes overboard.<br/><br/>Overall, not a good result. Yes, this is typical Quarantine style: slowly building tension with long drawn-out dialogues until the violence explodes. The problem with TH8 is that it loses its balance and falls flat on its face (with lots of blood spilling all over).<br/><br/>The building up is too long, too boring, too pretentious, not original enough. It is a poor attempt at imitating Christie's style, but with low quality. The dialogues are stereotyped, not creative: it's like a second-rate high-school play.<br/><br/>The last third is more interesting, but tries too hard to deliver violence in a way that is totally gratuitous and adds nothing to the story. It's gore for gore's sake; it gets repetitious and boring, in a different way. Too much of the same is never a recipe for success.<br/><br/>The best thing in TH8 is the musical score, by Ennio Morriconne; however, some of that incidental music seems out of touch with the images... suggesting that Moriconne-Tarantino is a combination that does not work quite as well as Sergio Leone-Morriconne.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a narcissist needing a kick in the ass to get back in form. He should try something different, get out of his own comfort zone, be creative. Of course, creativity was never his forte, since he made his name by imitating great directors."

","I gotta be pretty unimpressed to write a bad review, let alone one for one my favorite directors. But WOW....I paid a pretty penny to see this on opening day and was thoroughly disappointed. I like Tarantino films, I do. I have re-watched countless times Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Django, and others really enjoying picking apart the scenes, score, etc. But I will always critique a great director's blunder films, because we are set up to expect more. Kurosawa's Ikiru and Dodeska-den come to mind, Kubric's Barry Lyndon, Scorsese made Shutter Island and Spielberg directed Hook....sigh. Yes even the greatest director of all time, John Ford (*caugh* How Green was my valley *crap*) made some throwaways. But what irked me the most is how bloated and self-centered Tarantino has become with this last film. Never mind all the hipster-like pedantry surrounding the whole Ultra-Panavision 70 mm roadshow (it was a nice touch for all the outdoor cinematography...all 20 minutes of it), but relying on tiresome slapstick humor and endless ""niggerisms"" for the sake of a few laughs was giving the audience a big middle finger. It's like Tarantino is telling the world in a too-tall-for-his-age-7-year-old-kid's voice....i get to make films and you don't....and LOOK i get to say n***** as much as I want, and parade around a stable of great actors who play out bad jokes for MY entertainment, NOT yours.<br/><br/>BTW....if you could....just watch Leigh's performance...it is Oscar worthy...but not because Tarantino directed, but because it's Leigh. Can't say the same for Tim Roth...who is also directed by Tarantino apparently to be a cheap stand-in for Christoph Waltz. The score is great and so is the cinematography, but why have superfluous narration and a song by the White Stripes? The contradictions simply add to one emperor who has lost all of his clothes.

"Cinnyaste","3","83","172","21 December 2015"," Wild Fun That Comes With A Big Price Tag
","Based on the 168 minute version.<br/><br/>There's no denying Quentin Tarantino's twisted genius and perverse vision. His films are unapologetic challenges to share the roller-coaster as long as one accepts Tarantino run the ride. No one seems to mind. It may be time to challenge that precept. <br/><br/>In a ""Playboy"" interview, Tarantino stated, ""I just don't want to be an old-man filmmaker."" Pure Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" is poetic, profane, laconic, really nasty, bloody as all hell, and meditative; the first half - uncharacteristically old man-y, moody and brooding with meaningful dialogue sharp as a razor. There's promise of a re-think as if Tarantino's voice finally broke to adult from adolescent. Then the film derails to the usual Tarantino / Three Stooges high jinks.<br/><br/>This filmmaker is a master at creating tension; cinematic foreplay teasing and teasing until big, sweet, orgiastic release in blood and guts. He also deconstructs and spins plot twists and turns into gold. That task is easy in, essentially, a stage play with eight trapped in one room. A Tarantino film with social commentary as text, the subject under the microscope is race hatred. Setting the film post-Civil War allows the saying of things unacceptable in contemporary society. Like ""Django Unchained,"" nary a few minutes pass without a ""ni**er."" And the room is divided into North and South.<br/><br/>The length works against this film. At 168 minutes it was quite enough. The added twenty-odd minutes in the roadshow version might make the experience interminable. The film runs out of steam as it plays out and plays out with dialogue between the bang-bang – and there is plenty of blood.<br/><br/>Then there's misogyny. ""The Hateful Eight"" revels in the abuse of Jennifer Jason Lee, even with her portrayal of a scheming, cold-hearted killer. Her multiple beatings and battered face appears as if a domestic violence victim – most unappealing.<br/><br/>The cast does well with the material. There are no standouts, really, but Tim Roth channels Cristoph Waltz who must have been busy.<br/><br/>The cinematography is spectacular. Not necessarily the lighting, but the incredible use of the wide screen frame. The look and feel is evocative of David Lean epics Tarantino emulates even to the use of 'Roadshow', a practice that passed out of favor fifty years ago. Films are no longer shot this way. In this regard it was a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>If Tarantino wished to create the emotion of hate in the audience, he succeeded. The hate spills over the footlights, but there is a fine line between using verbiage and posture to underscore race hatred and making a racist (and misogynistic) film. More than in other films, ""The Hateful Eight"" crosses that line. Racists hide in plain sight and race bait. This film again leads to question Tarantino's personal attitude. He becomes more suspect peppering scripts with ""ni**er"" - even in his contemporary films (joining real life ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters notwithstanding). Every use of ""ni**er"" is another nail in the coffin. Also, his neurotic mentions of big black c**k in several films (here, sucking) skews toward wish fulfillment. As Black critics have said, ""Something is wrong with this guy (Tarantino).""<br/><br/>This is a very ugly, distasteful, caveman film within grand entertainment. That push-pull leads to a zero sum, and self-reflection as to what exactly is entertaining about ""The Hateful Eight."" Given the dichotomy, not a lot."

Unfortunately, it never did.<br/><br/>I've kind of soured on Tarantino over the years, but I was still eagerly anticipating The Hateful Eight. From the opening credits when he bills it as literally ""The eighth film by Quentin Tarantino"" on down, every single thing in this movie is not only done with ineptitude, but is covered with a veneer of arrogance that is more offensive and shocking than Tarantino's gratuitous use of the 'n-word' and blasé attitude about everyone taking turns beating the crap out of a woman.<br/><br/>Better movies than this go straight to cable/Netflix every day."

They are in the cabin for two hours of the movie and you get, like, a total of 10 minutes of screen time to the actual depth of the scenery. <br/><br/>This movie was a disappointment. I honestly don't recommend it. I found it really boring. If you've got time to kill, then watch it. Otherwise I wouldn't waste my time. Its not good and it's not fun, and it's not even enjoyable to watch."
"ludwignicholas","1","198","435","4 January 2016"," Reservoir Dogs, mixed with The Thing, but to seem original, in the 1800s.
","First, let me say this; there are SOME good in this film. Mostly bad, though. I saw it on the 24th of December in a beautiful showing of 70mm. I haven't seen anything quite like that in.. well, forever. Mainly because I'm an eighteen year old high school kid. Nevertheless, that was the one of the few things I enjoyed. I would even consider myself a pretty big Tarantino fan. But let's just get right into the bad, because this is what will mainly be talked about.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) I usually enjoy Tarantino dialogue, but in this film, it was absolutely annoying and pointless. There is a monologue by Tim Roth about ""western justice"". Let me say this, it is absolutely f*cking pointless. But not like the pointless conversations we love in the movie Fargo, but instead, flat out boredom and unnecessary talking. That is actually my main fault with the film. There's too much unnecessary dialogue. The chapter in which we see the Jody Domergue gang set up their ambush at Minnie's. That is way too f*cking long. It's hard to watch on your second watch, let alone your third. So much pointless conversation that all meets dead ends. It truly is horrid. <br/><br/>Next, everyone dies mostly at the same time. Kurt Russell, who I thought was the lead, dies way too early, in my opinion. I also didn't really care about any of the characters except Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). I don't see how great JJL is. She's currently in the lead for best supporting actress in the month of January. How? She really doesn't do anything except scream, give a menacing grin, and get hit in the face. If that's all it takes to be an Oscar front-runner, sign me up. <br/><br/>The score by Ennio Morricone resembles a horror sound. I enjoyed it, but every track sounds (almost) the same. <br/><br/>The only thing that was really worth watching was the 70mm wide and master shots. Even though this film mostly takes place in a small building, the 70mm is used greatly because we get to see most of the characters even though they're not necessarily needed for the shot. It was quite a sight to see.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I thought this film sucked. It had it's moments, albeit, far and few. It's almost as if Tarantino truly ran out of ideas(i think he has) and decided he'd remake a twisted version of Reservoir Dogs mixed with The Thing and set it in a western era, so it could seem ""new"" or ""original"". Well, it's not. Not at all. <br/><br/>In my opinion, it's Quentin Tarantino's worst film. I'm not a fan of it, and was completely let down. 1/10"
"johnbowman-03159","1","56","112","21 January 2016"," If you have a free 3 hours.....watch The Revenant instead!
","I signed up just to write a review of this film. I watched it a few nights ago, knowing Tarantino was a lover of the old spaghetti westerns, as I am myself, I was hoping for a modern version of the good , the bad and the ugly. Something that contained a story and characters as deep and involving as those. Seeing Kurt Russell in a leading role gave me hope. Samuel L Jackson didn't. <br/><br/>I liked Pulp fiction, I liked Reservoir Dogs, I liked Jackie Brown. They were original, the characters were strong. Kill Bill 1 was fairly good, but since then it seems to be a downwards spiral. The recent Tarantino movies have been tongue in cheek comedies, it worked in Django to some extent.<br/><br/>This film never had any depth, the characters were never developed, you couldn't relate to any of them, they were not believable. The story is set in ""Millies Haberdashery"" From the first moment it looked like a stage, a plastic setting, it did not look authentic and this theme continued with the rest of the characters. As was stated by previous reviewers the white teeth of the characters stands out a mile, the blonde female from NZ was completely out of place. Millie herself to me sounds like she should be a hard faced haggard of about 60 years old, instead we get a 20 something pretty black woman when she actually enters the film, plainly ridiculous. The ending is a waste of time, and the only thought you are left with at the end is, did I just spend 3 hours of my life on that? <br/><br/>Tarantino needs to go back to the drawing board, forget his own hype. His fans need to get off their high horses, and stop using his name as a vehicle to show how ""arty"" or ""cultured"" they are. This may have worked with pulp fiction, a truly intelligent and original movie but not with this farce."

","8.1? Looks like the movie studios have spent LOTS of money trying to have people see an 8.1 rating and get people to spend money to see this disaster. This is yet another Tarantino ego film, that's all you ought to know. And it lasts for an eternity. And it is BORING.<br/><br/>The first problem is Tarantino's ego and politics getting in the way. Yes Quentin, we know about how much you hate the police and your perceived need to apologize for being white. What a hero Quentin is. Jackson's character isn't likable and is a racist himself - unlike Django. QT seems to have forgotten that Jackson plays just another dirt bag in the film whom Quentin could suck off figuratively. Out of place and ridiculous. The film sucks, literally. You'll see and cringe.<br/><br/>In Django you understood the character because he's the oppressed taking revenge on the oppressor. But in this film, we are supposed to like a man who takes revenge on ""white people"" as a whole? You'll see what he does, as if it is supposed to be acceptable because it is the civil war. This mentality might work at a black panthers rally or if you're a white person at a KKK rally. But this certainly doesn't fly if you're the average, sensible human being. So QT decides to ram his point home, like it or not.<br/><br/>And then there is the extended boring talky dialogue. It works when you have a brilliant Nazi general and the exchange is amusing and in character. It doesn't work when you throw it in YET AGAIN in places where the characters wouldn't speak this way. Same old trick we have seen 1000 times from Quentin, such as a smart talking wagon driving ""dentist"" we saw in Django. Been there, done that better.<br/><br/>You can see where this is going. Tarantino put together his winning formula: 1. my talky brilliant witty dialogue 2. massive violence 3. outrageous actions 4. I'll have another black hero. But this time, I'm go way overboard to show my contempt for white people in authority and make another statement for the cause.<br/><br/>Nice job Quentin. You have created a total self serving dud that only you could sit through and admire yourself. For almost THREE HOURS."

Jackson pictures and preview/trailer. That was my first mistake, the second was paying money for tickets to see this thing. My son walked out at about 30 minutes. I wish I had too! Go see the Revenant, or watch the Unforgiven again, both are Oscar material. The H8teful Eight is NOT! Of the 4 of us who went to see this not a single one of us liked it at all.

","What can I say? Whoever has given this a high review is obviously being paid by Quentin himself. I started to turn this movie off several times and it did take me three attempts to get all the way through it. The acting was horrible, especially Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson. I can't believe that Channing Tatum would even take a role in this horrendous movie. The only reason I continued watching was in hopes that maybe further into the movie would show me why the rating was so high. But, no, that never happened. It was a movie full of poor acting, foul language and blood flying every where. Humor was attempted but fell short, and I mean way short. And it never really ended. What a shame and pity of a movie.

","Why do people insist on glorifying every pointless, overly-violent, massively cliché, plot devoid, piece of drivel that Quentin Tarantino manages to capture on film? I may never understand how movies this stupid become so popular. You would think that after watching the last several Tarantino films with the EXACT SAME formula that people would eventually get tired of it. Allow me to summarize this movie to demonstrate its resemblance to the rest of Tarantino's collection of crap: Contrived, poorly written dialogue meant to come off as somehow intellectual or witty followed by predictable, graphic violence followed by screaming, end movie.<br/><br/>This is a device which could reasonably be used for one scene in one movie. Not for every scene in every movie. And to those claiming that this film somehow makes a political statement I ask, HOW? By killing off people of different ethnicity and gender in various but equally violent manners? What political theme could you possibly be reading into this film?<br/><br/>The movie doesn't even attempt to be a murder mystery. The setting is merely one of Tarantino's more contrived excuses for aimless bloodbath. It is amazing that Tarantino has convinced so many people that he is a master filmmaker when almost all of his films follow the same tired formula."

No it's not as bad as Django, Grindhouse, or Jackie Brown, but from a man who gave us ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Kill Bill"" this is a big big disappointment. Tararntino's best work is now more than 2 decades old, and the only half decent film he's made in the last decade was ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009).<br/><br/>The film itself is far too long and too much in love with itself, as are the actors who in other films can be quite engaging.

I know it's not real and just Tarantino's fantasy, but what he depicted here is not at all believable, even if you know it's just a movie. He uses a lot of blood and gore, but he doesn't use it effectively, so it just comes across as gratuitous, as a crutch, like in a badly done student film. The way it's shot gives you feeling that you are watching a play, but all of the details of a movie like this don't fit into such a limited frame, so the effect is that it's sloppy. The bottom line is that this movie did not deliver. If I could get a refund, I would."

","Every master film maker knows that 70mm is the best choice to shoot a movie in plain white snow where the gray sky and white ground are almost indistinguishable, but at least it's about 5 minutes of something worthy of being shot on 70mm. After the snow portion of the movie, over two hours take place in a one room cabin... which once again might be boring, but in 70mm...<br/><br/>The 70mm is a complete waste, the lighting inside the cabin looks horrible also, I couldn't stop looking at all the ultra bright tungsten sources above every table although the movie takes place right after the civil war. The moonlight coming through the windows is as bright and harsh as the sunlight in the day scenes; and if that's not enough to take out of the movie, there are at least 10 separate times throughout where the film falls so flat that I had my face in my hands saying to myself, ""what the hell is this?""... ""This is a Quentin Tarantino movie??"" ...""HOW MUCH MORE OF THIS CRAP IS THERE???"" <br/><br/>two of the most obvious are when, after a droning two hours, Tarantino himself starts narrating inside of his own movie, and starts explaining a plot device to the audience as if he's in the pitch meeting instead of the final edit. You'd think somewhere in those two hours, in place of so much bad dialog, he could of found a way to simply foreshadow a clue that the coffee is.. or could be poison... but no, he has to make it ridiculous.<br/><br/>The intermission... it's like him going, ""since we're shooting the first draft of my script, and since we won't be using editing to make this more interesting, go take a break and then you can come back and then try to get through the rest of this."" Because if you went to the bathroom any time other than the intermission, you'd miss SO much by the time you got back.<br/><br/>Another time was maybe the 3rd or 4th time they had to show you that you need two pieces of wood to nail the door shut. Other 3 hour movies use their time to sprawl and show passage of time and distance and development, this one wants you to see them nailing a door shut over and over in real time. <br/><br/>Eventually somewhere around 2:15 into the movie my only thoughts were, ""can someone, anyone on the screen, just kill everyone else so the movie can end!?"""

The movie moves so slow that its hard to pay attention through the whole thing, the only thing that kept me in it was the acting, but great acting in no way makes up for the awful plot. Its almost as if Tarantino tried to remake ""Clue: The Western"" except it was so boring for 2 hours of the 2 hours and 47 minutes of the movie, that I really didn't care who did what by then of it. If you want to watch the movie but don't have a lot of time, skip to the last 47 minutes and you will know enough and get most of the excitement to enjoy the film. As I said, the only reason I am giving this a 4 out of 10 is because the acting really was done very well and the shots and music were also done very well but it does not make up of an awful plot. This is just my opinion though, if you are into slower, non-gripping (uninteresting or boring) who-dun-it films then this will be for you. P.S.

","Until I saw this movie, I thought Quentin was a genius director and writer. After I saw this movie, I think he has never been a genius and recently he went mad trying to be one. He wants me or anyone else, disregarding the skin color that seems to be of so much importance in US, to feel sympathy for Major and see good in his actions when he is just a murderous son of a bitch with no moral code? And what is even more ridiculous that he is a friend with Lincoln and President Lincoln is more than OK with his murderous friend's feats, what's more, he supports him, praises him, says that he is a prideful son of ""black race"" and he is ought to make a change. WTH??? What kind of message is Quentin Tarantino trying to send us? In the beginning it was going smoothly, storm was building up, but then, suddenly Samuel L Jackson is talking about his huge Johnson and how he made general's son to suck it. Now, I don't even care if Jackson's character really did it or not. Even if he lied and even if the general was the worst person to ever live, Major becomes more of a piece of fecal mass than general could have ever been when he provokes father of a deceased son how he made his son suck a dick before shooting him. After this, I lost all the respect towards Samuel L Jackson as well. I know I know, it's in the script and you are an actor, but don't you have any self respect not to take a major part in such a messed up movie that isn't messed up because of its substance, but because it doesn't really have any good message to send and ends up being Weirdo Quentin's fetishes on a big screen? LIKE WTH? I could understand if this movie had a valuable point to deliver, but it doesn't have any. And Quentin, it's not like every white man has a 3 inch long dick and if they have, it doesn't necessarily mean that you should fantasize about having a bigger one in your mouth. That's just messed up my friend. This movie only promotes violence and racism. You might think I am a racist, but I am not the one who thinks blacks and whites or any other color people are of a different races. It's just ridiculous statement that has no scientific back up. Neanderthals where the different race for example. Not black or brown skinned people. For me there is no race. And what is more important, I don't care about enslaving of ""black people"" back in days. My people were enslaved as well but you don't see us crying or demanding a better life because of our ancestors who had it rough. It's just spineless and self-disrespectful thing to do. And get over with the ""n word""(Can't write an actual word because site doesn't allow it). One group of people using a word that another group of people ""aren't allowed to say""? Can you imagine any bigger obstacle in a day to day relationship than that? Anyways, Quentin, the subject of black slavery has dried out even before Django. Now it has become way more noticeable and cringe-worthy. I liked Django, even though it had some flaws of this sort, but this movie? This movie is a total garbage. I can't believe it is the same person who directed Pulp Fiction. I just can't believe it."

If you like movies that try to shock you with the gory violence of blood and brain splatter then you'll like it. Most of us can sit through a certain amount of violence for a great story line, but the story line was weak, making the violence intolerable.

While the experience was great, this is about the film. Why use a large format for a movie that mainly takes place in a single room? The format would have been perfect for the scenery that accompanied many of the outside scenes, but instead we were stuck in a bottle. Add to that the extremely gratuitous use of the n-word, and general absurdity of the plot, and Tarantino playing homage to himself, and I just didn't care for it.

Starting with Inglorious Basterds (a sorry revamp of the great original), wandering through Django Unchained (ditto), and, we hope, ending with Hateful Eight (sorry play on Magnificent Seven in title) he seeks to put his own spin on the greats of the past. While there is some stuff of interest in IB and DU, he sinks to a new low with Hateful Eight surpassing his penchant for violence as a moviemaker. However, in that sense, it is of his path of escalating violence in movie after movie; thus does dear Quentin ride the rim of paradox: escalation to a new low."

","I was excited to see this film - it had everything. Enjoyed past Tarentino films, love Kurt Russll and Janet Leigh and Samuel Jackson - how could this possibly be bad? Not sure how he did it, but Tarentino took an outstanding cast and wasted their performances on boring dialogue and mindless action. <br/><br/>At almost 3 hours in length, you are dedicating quite literally an afternoon or evening. I kept watching, thinking something good is just around the bend. I kept telling myself that for the entire 3 hours. I left the theater feeling completely ripped off and wondered how in the world a critic would rate this film highly unless they were paid by the studio - that was how boring this film was to me. I guess critics feel they must rate a film highly if they say the ""N"" word as many times as they do in this film and if they tank it, they may be viewed as racist. <br/><br/>Positives? A couple. The performances were good, especially Leigh's, which I think might just get her some Oscar consideration. The cinematography was also gorgeous. That's really about it. <br/><br/>Personally, I view this film as a lesson learned. Just because the director and cast is good doesn't automatically mean it will be an entertaining film. This film taught me to research films before I spend my time and money. <br/><br/>I give this film a 2/10 for cinematography and Leigh's performance - other than that, it is a complete waste of time."

","This film is a simple mystery that was stretched about an hour and a half longer than it really needed to be. An extremely long time was spent developing three characters at the beginning of the story only to more or less dismiss one of them for the rest of the film. I didn't feel any of the other characters were developed beyond naming them, and the entire thing suddenly exploded in showers of blood and gore. The story itself was simplistic and not deep at all, leaving the actors to breathe what life they could into their parts. I will say that the acting itself was well done and was the only reason I stuck around until the end. Furthermore, several characters seem to have come directly from other Tarentino films: Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained kept coming to mind while watching this and that was extremely distracting.

","Typical Tarantino gore fest - as a Director he simply has not progressed beyond the mental age of 14. Even if you like loads of gore, the story in the Hateful Eight simply does not hang together as well as a film like Reservoir Dogs for example. It appears that Tarantino has been in a downward spiral ever since Reservoir Dogs in any case. The best thing about the Hateful Eight is the Wyoming scenery and the weather. <br/><br/>Take the central story line - a group of desperadoes have taken over a stage coach stopover (Minnie's Habadashery) to rescue the sister of one of them who is chained to a bounty hunter taking her to justice in Red Rock. There is a blizzard outside, when Kurt Russel (the Bounty Hunter) kicks open the door of the haberdashery to get inside with Daisy Domergue his captive, he has to hammer the door closed (the catch is broken) - perfect opportunity for the outlaws to pounce and kill him, but they don't - would end the tale without everyone getting their heads blown off in typical Tarantino fashion."

It's definitely not a western, despite the stagecoach and the horses.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>Sheesh...where to begin? There was just so much wrong with this movie that it made you wonder if Tarantino started out making a parody, but changed his mind and made it a gore-fest pseudo-crime drama instead.<br/><br/>But hey, what do *I* know, eh? (Hint: probably the same as everyone who highlighted the enormous amount of anachronistic ""goofs"" under the ""Goofs"" heading...just sayin'...)<br/><br/>The plot progression was slow. Now this could be overlooked, if you are going for the spaghetti western style which, given the 1970s look to the title and the fact that even the score was done by Ennio Morricone, made me initially excited to see where it was going (even though I physically groaned as soon as I saw that it was a Tarantino film).<br/><br/>Still, hey! Kurt Russel, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh...it looked like it had promise!<br/><br/>And then the complete gratuitous overuse of the ""N"" word, just for shock value apparently? A few utterances, okay, but dozens? In nearly every scene? We get it...Jackson is black. Gee...who knew? Can we move on now?<br/><br/>No, because first we have to have Leigh get bloodied up to drive home the fact that she's one of the antagonists in the film. And bloodied up. And bloodied up. And...we get it. She's bad. Moving on...<br/><br/>So many scenes should have hit the editing floor and stayed there. No, no, I take that back...they should have hit the shred bin, never to ever be added back to any ""director's cut"" or anything of that caliber.<br/><br/>Case in point: the entire naked white guy being orally raped by the black guy scene...complete with very descriptive narrative...repeatedly...you know, just in case you didn't catch it the first time...<br/><br/>Next comes the massive amount of graphic gore that is completely unrealistic, doesn't advance the plot at all, and is added only for the sake that Tarantino likes juicy, gory splashes. I'm surprised he didn't go for making it 3-D. In a movie like Deadpool, it works. In this? Please...<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on, but I only have a 1,000 word maximum. <br/><br/>Seriously, it started out with the potential for being a great western...until about 20-30 minutes into the three hours when it became more than apparent that it was was just Tarantino being Tarantino again, using slang and other language that would never have been used in that era, with items that didn't even exist until the early 1900s, and turning people's heads into juicy sprays of liquid because of a single bullet (or two, as in the case of Señor Bob).<br/><br/>If you want to watch a western, don't watch this. If you want to watch a horrifyingly graphic gore-fest where people wear cowboy hats and say ""Fu**"" a lot and continuously use racial epithets toward one another (or if you're one of Tarantino's rabid cult followers who have been joyously giving this 10 stars and only doing so to counter honest reviews like mine), then go right ahead and ""enjoy"" this movie.<br/><br/>Or, you know, you could crush your toe with a hammer and laugh at the blood spray and scream the ""N"" word and the ""F"" word while looking at a picture of a horse in the snow...same results, really...it won't take nearly as long, and it'll probably hurt a lot less."

I mean I do see his trademarks: the dialogues, the violence - things he used to be able to use as tools to make an entertaining movie. But it seems like QT is not interested in entertaining even his own fans anymore. What used to be just tools, have become the goal itself by now. He just wanted to make a Tarantino-movie simply for the sake of doing it, and to show the world that he can do whatever he wants. The end result is a long, boring, often disturbing film with hardly any redeeming qualities. After the first hour and a half I started wondering what the actors (Russel, Jackson, Tim Roth) might have had in their mind during the shooting. Whether they already felt that this is not gonna work. My guess is they did feel it, and at times you can even realize it on their faces, especially Kurt Russel's. To say the least, the rating (8,1) is inexplicable and utterly misleading."
"trublu215","7","114","245","21 December 2015"," The most disappointing film of 2015...
","The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's latest odyssey into his depraved and (somehow) brilliant mind. Unfortunately, those looking for a repeat performance from Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds will walk away very disappointed. The Hateful Eight is merely a three hour epic dedicated to showing just how great Robert Richardson is as a cinematographer and how full of himself Tarantino can be. It features some of the weakest Tarantino we've seen since Jackie Brown. The film starts by introducing us (slowly) to each of the titular eight, played by Kurt Russel, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins (who steals the show) and Demian Bichir. Among the eight, we're peppered with new faces to Tarantino's world along with some very familiar ones. Along with the familiar faces, we're given a familiar story, one that is closer to Reservoir Dogs with a mix of And Then There Were None... To be completely honest here, The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's worst effort as a writer and a director but it is his best film visually. The film is more of a showcase for Robert Richardson's impeccable cinematography rather than a typical showcase of Tarantino's talents. While there are some truly brilliant (yet bloated) dialog pieces, especially one from Samuel L. Jackson that is AMAZING, the film is so lopsided and uneven that it makes it hard for the audience to fully enjoy what's there to be enjoyed. For the first two hours or so, we are subjected to one bloated monologue after another then for the last hour we're subjected to a blood and bullets fest that is awesome to see but comes too late in the film to care about. The run time is where Tarantino is the most self indulging. Most of these scenes could have easily been cut down to gain a better sense of pace, but Tarantino is so confident that his material is brilliant that he just let's us bask in it. While these performances are perfection, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is absolutely brilliant in this role and deserves any award that they throw her way, the film ultimately suffers from it's best attribute...Quentin Tarantino, himself. The problem here is that this film is nowhere near interesting enough to sustain a three hour run time. The scenes of banter between the nasty eight are scenes that could have used a serious editing session. At best, the film stands as an ode to classical cinema and it succeeds in doing that. Outside of that, The Hateful Eight is a painfully slow film that could have benefited from about 30 minutes of cuts and a director that isn't so self indulging in the way he makes a film. However, at the end of the day, we're left with what we are left with. The Hateful Eight is not only the most disappointing film of 2015, it is also the most bloated. As a Tarantino fan, I was disappointed but I will say this: The Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's worst films...but even his worst film would be any other director's masterpiece so keep that in mind."

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","1","39","76","31 December 2015"," Short Road To A Long Nowhere
","Will attempt not to spoil too much about this epic yet contained and intentionally claustrophobic Western by Quentin Tarantino, but that's after having to disclose it's only a Western in the Civil War time period, rural-rough location, dramatic score, and dusty, cut-throat characters. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a Mystery, and for the most part, could have been set in any century involving an eclectic roomful of people, and, as already known/shown in the Samuel L. Jackson-led expository trailers, somebody's not who they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>The first act overrides Tarantino's last venture simply by looking and feeling like we're really outdoors as opposed to a contrived exterior set, which DJANGO UNCHAINED, especially during the chain gang sequence following the opening credits, really seemed like. With gorgeous wide shots of snowy mountainous regions and a soundtrack by none other than Spaghetti Western guru Ennio Morricone, HATEFUL sounds like the real thing while you can genuinely feel the freezing cold as a stagecoach full of our central characters, including Kurt Russell's fitfully nicknamed bounty hunter The Hangman is bringing Jennifer Jason Leigh's grotesque white trash Wanted killer, with more bruises than brains, to the town of Red Rock... alive, not dead... while semi comic-relief Walt Goggins plays a supposedly future sheriff and last but not least, Sam Jackson, as Major Marquis Warren, explains what's up, both on the road and within our central location where 95% of the picture takes place: a barroom/way-station where no one can leave to Red Rock (a sort of geographical McGuffin) since there's a big bad blizzard raging outside. <br/><br/>Although Tarantino has publicly denounced John Ford as any kind of Western Genre influence, leaning more on Sam Peckinpah and of course, Sergio Leone, some of the best and most effective character-developing dialogue takes place inside the vehicle itself, and is reminiscent of what's arguably Ford's best film, STAGECOACH, that catapulted John Wayne's career. And if anyone on board takes the Alpha Male Wayne role it's Russell's no-nonsense John Ruth who, during this three-hour plus cinematic stage play, maintains the best verbal momentum throughout. His anti-chemistry/reluctant-partnership is strongest with Jackson while there should have been more palpable angst towards Leigh's Daisy Domergue – whom he's literally, annoyingly chained to. Yet both seem as if they're in completely different movies, and Russell's is much better... if only he captured anyone else but Leigh, an actress that, despite being otherwise talented, is downright embarrassingly campy here. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, putting the forgettable Ennio soundtrack aside, EIGHT isn't Leone- influenced but more an overlong hybrid of RESERVOIR DOGS, which co-starred two wasted HATEFUL characters Michael Madsen and Tim Roth (the latter doing a pallid Christoph Waltz imitation)... which was Tarantino's first film; set inside a warehouse with a group of crooks while one holds a secret that can change everything... and Agatha Christie since, like mentioned... and why it would be nearly impossible to sit through this a second time – EIGHT is a Mystery Feature, especially during the third and final act where the tables twist and turn so much, you'll wonder if all the previous dialogue and dialogue-driven, camera- wielding suspense was effectively good, bad or ugly since, like any Mystery-based vehicle, the end result makes everything else matter... and ultimately, in this case, nothing and no one matters much at all."
"mlaimlai2","8","69","143","29 January 2016"," It's easy to see why some people would hate 'The Hateful Eight'.
","Before I begin my review, I'd like to emphasise that there are two different versions of Quentin Tarantino's eighth film, the 70mm print which runs for 187 minutes including an overture and intermission, and the 168 minute version I saw which has been released in digital cinemas. Now, on with the review!<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino burst on to the scene with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"". Since his debut effort, he has made only seven other movies over a 22 year period and he insists that he will no longer direct after his tenth film. He has made some excellent films in that time including one of my favourites of 2012, ""Django Unchained"", and 1994's brilliant ""Pulp Fiction"". If you are familiar with his movies then you'll know that he includes terrific, often witty dialogue, and violence that can be stomach-churning. He's at it again with The Hateful Eight, especially with the violence, but not so much with the dialogue which isn't as biting as some of his other scripts, possibly because it loses its impact over such a long running time. In fact this is Tarantino's longest ever movie.<br/><br/>Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter whose progress has been halted by the blizzard-like conditions. He comes across another bounty hunter in John Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is travelling in a stagecoach with a criminal he has captured, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Discovering that Ruth is heading in the same direction as himself, Warren asks Ruth if he can place his captured fugitives on top of the stagecoach to collect his bounty at Red Rock. Along the way, they meet up with the new sheriff of Red Rock, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins). Before they arrive at Red Rock, they stop over at Minnie's Haberdashery, which is being patronised by an assortment of characters including Englishman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and Bob (Demián Bichir).<br/><br/>Most of the film is set inside the haberdashery which promotes a claustrophobic feeling and with the amount of dialogue that takes place, it occasionally lends itself to a theatrical setting. When the outdoor locations are used, the grandeur of the snow-filled landscape provides a sense of remoteness. Both the interiors and exteriors generate the tension that Tarantino's script doesn't always display. There are moments of intensity that are interrupted by a throwaway line. It is a sprawling story that meanders at times so an edit of about half an hour would have resulted in a tighter, more efficient production.<br/><br/>The acting is solid with spectacular moments provided by Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular. It's no surprise she has ended up with an Oscar nomination for her gritty performance. Jackson overacts at times with his grandstanding speeches but he is rather renowned for those in many of his movies. It's fantastic to see Russell in a different type of performance where he isn't embraced by the audience. In fact, the nature of many of the scenes makes it difficult for the viewer to embrace any of the characters so this may affect your opinion of the movie. If you are offended by women being beaten, men engaging in forced oral sex and innocent people being killed, then you will be turned off by several aspects of the story.<br/><br/>At the tender age of 87, Ennio Morricone composes the brilliant score which features his renowned violins and brass. He brilliantly captures the tension of the story and the score is reminiscent of his spaghetti western days. Perhaps that's why Tarantino decided to go with Morricone as this is rather like a western but if you are seeking end-to-end action you will be disappointed. This is more of a character piece with a mystery thrown in. Tarantino may have included too much but you cannot blame him for trying something different. He even includes himself as the narrator in the second half of the film but this was unnecessary and distracting. He is an exciting filmmaker and even if not everything works, he makes sure you have something to think about.<br/><br/>The violent bloodbath and the scene where one character is forced at gunpoint to perform fellatio have resulted in an R rating in Australia. Surely this is enough warning for people who are easily offended not to even bother seeing the movie. However, if you do not see ""The Hateful Eight"", you will be missing an intriguing, although slightly meandering film. It will be shame when Tarantino retires from writing and directing for he has provided some innovative and entertaining films in his time. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review"

","There are many reasons to dislike this film, here are a few:<br/><br/>Storyline: Simplistic, turgid and doesn't go anywhere.

","Being an avid Tarantino fan, this movie was a sad disappointment for me. It was far too slow with a preponderance of dialogue as compared to action. Also the violence seemed to be far too gratuitous, even for Tarantino. <br/><br/>Finally what really spoiled the movie for me was the obvious, suspension of disbelief in that the general's son who was stripped naked by Major Warren (Samuel L. Jackson)and then force-marched out into the snow, knew he was doomed to die because the Major Warren character confirmed as much.<br/><br/>Therefore, in true Tarantino style, why would the general's son not bite off Major Warren's dick instead of sucking it? Or have I been watching too many Tarantino movies?"

","The Hateful Eight is a Hateful waste of a film! Quentin Tarantino can create entertaining, original films. BUT after a few good films, Quentin craps out a real dog of a movie. I like dogs but the Hateful Eight is one ugly dog of a movie. When there is no script, story, etc we have a crap film. A crap film filled with shock, gore, profanity, racial slurs, pushing the limits with abuse, depravity etc, because there is nothing else to show. I wonder what was in the mind of the writer/director? Then again I don't want to know. Hateful Eight gives you a big name like Kurt Russell to suck you in. The only bright spot was Russell's acting and role. Otherwise, slow and slower, then gross shock/stupid. The sub story, and plot twist just look dumb. The Hateful Eight is worse than water boarding. 3 out of 10. Hateful to the viewer!"
"imdb3-3","1","24","44","31 January 2016"," What the hell was this dreck?
","Wow. Believe those who were bewildered by what an awful film this is. To quote Tarantino, those who are giving this film a high rating ""have their mouth on my big ***** johnson"". It's really that terrible.<br/><br/>So you've heard this is a western. Well, it's not really a western. And it's not really historical even though it plays like it is supposed to have some profound insight into the hatred of the black man rooted way back into civil war times. But unlike Django which was just way too long and a bit too ridiculous in its blaxploitation parody in the second half of the film, this one insults the viewer by not even being interesting. 90+ minutes of endless talking that takes place mostly in a stagecoach and a cabin. How this movie cost $62 million is beyond me unless Tarantino was paid by the word.<br/><br/>And like M. Night Shylaman or whatever his name is, Tarantino likes to fit himself into his own films. He's also usually very out of place. This time he completely outdoes himself and provides for an epic WTF moment that lasts a solid few minutes to finally kick this old dog in the rump to move it. You'll know the moment when you see it.<br/><br/>The writing is terrible. You've got a paranoid bounty hunter who is on the extreme end to make sure he doesn't lose his prize. Yet he does some things so absurdly out of character that can only be explained by a need to move the pieces into place. And the film is so poorly navigated that it feels as though Tarantino himself had to step in to steer it in a direction. You have to guess that a test audience must have given them the indication that the film was such a mess that it needed navigation.<br/><br/>And what was just a poor movie that was over the top goes full retard. Only Tarantino would have been given the green light to make this dull, flat, go nowhere ""whodunit"" movie that's like a sad version of Clue. It's painfully funny to read Tarantino fanatics talk about their second and third viewings of this film. This is like a bad parody of bad parodies of bad westerns and Clue bound together with nothing to say except for n*gg*r. This was no period piece like Django was, which was a mediocre and horribly long film saved only by having the best acting talent on the planet saving the film. At least that film had entertaining moments and a story that moved between long fluffy lulls. This entire film could be summarized in one paragraph.<br/><br/>First 95 minutes - introduce the characters. Last 80 minutes - a really slow, ultra talky bad version of clue. And Senor Bob was such a clownish character, you have to wonder whether Tarantino was trying to see how bad of a movie could be made and still watch enough critics say that something happened and that Tarantino's dialogue is entertainingly clever. It's not. <br/><br/>Save yourself. Prepare yourself. The 8.0 rating is faked."

","What's the matter with Tarantino? There's no denying the man's talent, but in his latest film he seems to have lost control, or maybe he just doesn't know when to quit. This film has been referred to as a ""return"", of sorts, to his debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"", but whereas ""Dogs"" was tightly and economically constructed, with nary a wasted moment, ""The Hateful Eight"" is overblown and ridiculously overlong; it should have been half as long. And Tarantino seems to revel so much in violence, ugliness, nihilism and misanthropy (not to mention misogyny) that the film leaves you with a ""bleccch"" feeling. Even the mystery turns out not to matter much, since everyone is guilty anyway! Or maybe we are supposed to take this as a very black, over-the-top comedy. But the dialogue is rarely as witty or as memorable as expected, and when the few laughs do come, the audience's senses are pretty much numbed already. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is super, but the film is little more than an exercise in killing off characters for shock value only. * out of 4."

","This film is bad and here are the reasons:<br/><br/>1 - drawn out chapters where nothing meaningful happens,<br/><br/>2 - scenario that has no back story or deeper characterization of dramatis personae, and<br/><br/>3 - one of the biggest crimes a film maker can do - anti-film language that lacks in virtuosity of mise-en-scène. <br/><br/>So yes, this is an anti-film, a boring theatrical play in which you even do not have interesting movement of actors and camera.<br/><br/>After the initial hype ''oh, I'm watching the Tarantino's film!'' you get sleepy because of boredom, because Quentin is doing his usual anti-film thing where they talk and talk and talk, and at the end of the film all that drawn out intro of first 3 chapters serves absolutely no purpose. <br/><br/>If your criteria for films is low you could not even say that this film is of so-so quality.<br/><br/>Considering what you expect from a film, from any film - do you expect real characters and real situations that have some significance to human existence, by which you can have at the same time fun and be deeply touched by human drama, and enjoying yourself and film because of that drama, because, you see, that is deeper form of fun. <br/><br/>Or you wanna cartoonish buffoonery that is empty and meaningless. This film holds no deeper meaning and even if we accept that and say ''I'm in for the fun, for the ride'' your fun is gonna be ruined to great extent by empty scenario and boring, utterly boring, direction and visual output. <br/><br/>Please take this seriously into account - this is not a film but theatrical play, this is an anti-film, one that is against anything kinetic in cinema. Just imagine masters of the 1940's Hollywood and their masterful command of mise-en-scène in long shots where they conduct a ballet of actors moving combined with delicate tracking shots. In this film you will not find that visual beauty of ''moving'' cinema but anti-film language. <br/><br/>All that proves that film is visually in decadence and decline for decades. If you want fun and at the same time meaning, deepness and poetry stick to visual masters like Peckinpah or Kubrick, even with great craftsmen like Siegel. <br/><br/>The main problem of this film, despite boring film language and scenario, is that you see Quentin and not movie characters. Everything is shallow and forced. You simply do not care for any of those characters in this film, because their back stories are non-existent. You simply do not care will they live or die. <br/><br/>That has nothing to do with ''are the characters likable or not'', are they ''good'' or ''bad''. We know in our lives that ''good'' and ''bad'' are intertwined in every one of us. Great, or at least good, film must have some kind of deeper characterization for us to appreciate the situations our heroes are in. In this film you will not find any. <br/><br/>At the end of this review I will ask you to think about Peckinpah's ''bad'' guys. You see, Peck loves all his characters, even the ''bad'' ones. He does not discards them easily, and if, and when, they die those deaths have some meaning, meaning to the plot, meaning to the characters... Watch Sam's films, I implore you."

I'd say Quentin is getting worse and worse keeping making Tarantino's film. I mean, this new talkie has a glorious opening act though only up to an awful close-up, Samuel L. Jackson's face, as if he had come out fresh from a hairdresser parlor... well, from there on, the movie is just poorly directed. Despite it's been lovingly photographed on heroic 70mm film stock – to me, it's a total lack of empathy, lack capacity for hope, fear, love, hate. Shallow emotions, why bother?

"caseynicholson","3","27","51","12 January 2016"," Tarantino Needs to Learn that ""Less is More""
","I went into ""The Hateful Eight"" fairly blind, having made it a point to not want to let the reviews or my perception of past Tarantino movies spoil the film for me. It started out reasonably strong, but ended poorly.<br/><br/>My big beef with basically all Tarantino movies post-""Jackie Brown"" is that he goes so over the top with the blood and gore and foolishness that it's just not quality cinema. Yes, ""Eight"" has its moments that are interesting. And yes, the plot is relatively intriguing. But Tarantino's style has gone so far overboard in recent years that it's as if he doesn't respect the audience's intelligence. The pattern that started with ""Kill Bill"" and continued on in ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" carries on here, with gratuitous blood and violence. Yes, that's to be expected from a Tarantino flick (or a Coen Brothers movie, for that matter). But the problem is that whereas the early Tarantino knew how to balance shock with a great story and great dialogue, ""Eight"" relies far too much on its more grotesque elements.<br/><br/>And the thing is that that's sad, because this movie, like all the other post-""Jackie"" Tarantino movies, had great potential to be far better than it is. Unfortunately Tarantino just continues to want to make movies for adolescent boys infatuated with violence than he does for adults who care about good entertainment. A different writer or film maker could take this film and remake it into something amazing just by cleaning it up a bit and offering it in a more serious vibe. The film had the potential to be the next ""Unforgiven"". But we don't get that with this movie. We get another ""Tarantino the asinine juvenile with too much fame and notoriety"" movie. And that deserves no better than 3/10 stars."

","Hi, this is my first review written ever here, because I am angry. Angry about this film, and the waste of time, money and good actors.<br/><br/>On the up side, the actors did their best and technically this film is done very well. The Although at the ""what happened before"" scene in the end, I found the acting of Judy quite childish over-acted, but I guess that was for some reason done by QT.<br/><br/>On the down side, this film is so boring that I have to force myself to not turn it off and do something else instead. We all know that QT movies can have quite long dialogs, but in all other QT movies, these dialogs are good - intelligent, bizarre or kind of sarcastic. But here the dialogs are just boring.<br/><br/>So the set is. White snow and the dark room of the bar. No surprises here.<br/><br/>The story is quite predictive, some parts did not make any sense to me (eg. the scene where they put the rope to the rest room - after that scene it is not referenced once). As it is QT movie, you know at least in the end there will be much of violence, so you wouldn't be disappointed for this.<br/><br/>There are no characters to really like in this movie, so you will not care if anybody is killed.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and watch ""The good, the Bad and the Ugly"" another time, it is quite more entertaining than this flick was."

Nothing original, it reminded me of cheap horror movies, let's have the whole film set in one location, and have a small cast who all get killed off, one by one. So nothing new, nothing original, just dialogue, more dialogue, more pretentious dialogue, it wasn't funny, it wasn't saying anything about race, gender, history, it was just garbage.

The entire opening dialogs sounded hollow and fake, like shot on a sound stage. Everything seemed fake: the dialogue, the scenery, the snow. But the worst was the acting . . . amateur like a high school play where actors read from a teleprompter. The initial plot(that's all I saw) was implausible. The plot was fake. The snow was clearly fake. The actors sat in it, wallowed in it, and fluffed it as if it were warm and fuzzy. Finally, at the 30 minute mark, I ran for the exit, and a tick refund.

This movie just appears to be another excuse to show over the top gore and exploit racist sentiments too common in today's pop culture. He attempts to redeem himself as in the past by allying one ""good"" white man with one ""good"" black man, but the whole scenario is just getting old.

","After Django Unchained and now, The Hateful Eight, I'm convinced Quentin Tarantino only makes Westerns so he can use the N-word with impunity and suggest it's ""historical accuracy,"" rather than blind racism. Tarantino is now the Leni Riefenstahl of the KKK. H8 is a rancid stew of racism, misogyny, sexual violence, bad Southern accents and worse acting. Once upon a time, QT's strengths were his direction of actors and his dialogue. Both seem to have died snowblind in this Wyoming blizzard. Whether it's Kurt Russell's blustery ripoff of Jeff Bridge's Rooster Cogburn or Tim Roth's twittery Brit (what were you thinking, Tim?) the acting is universally dreadful. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Southern accent is the worst I've heard since Kevin Costner tried for N'Orleans and flopped. And even Walton Goggin's, who rose to fame as Appalachian white trash in Justified, inflates his accent to the over-ripe. The dialogue is mostly Russell bully-blustering the other actors or endless drippings of Southern fried N-droppings. (In one exchange between Bruce Dern and Goggins, it's tossed back and forth something like 7 times.) Tarantino somehow managed to fail the simple task of creating believable character names. They're either ludicrously unpronounceable (Daisy Domergue; Marquis Warren) or ostentatiously silly (Oswaldo Mobray). And QT has managed to take modern special effects (key to an action movie) to new lows of ineptitude. In the various shootings, the blood seems to wash in waves from the victims, from balloons over-inflated with dollar store red paint, then exploded with firecrackers. For most of his career, Tarantino seemed an unusually gifted, if emotionally arrested artist too easily drawn to the juvenile. Now the juvenile emotions seem to have taken complete hold and left him with an empty bag and no way forward. From the evidence of his last two or three movies, ""no way forward"" may be a good thing."

There are also characters that just can't stop talking about their stupid plans to total strangers, and then hope that they won't reveal anything. The men hate the woman as she is the devil, this is what feeds the minds of men and I think really the mirror of how men see the woman in general. Women just can't win, or save themselves ever. From the several punches in the face she gets (I didn't see any of the male characters get those punches with the same sadistic laughter that follows), to the feeding her, and telling her to shut the f* up (if only all of them had shut up, especially Samuel L. Jackson and his monologues), and making her say ""I got it"" in this submissive non combative way, and the pathetic end. I don't understand why this role even deserved a nomination at the Oscars, it's just a way to promote weak women. I'm glad no high profile actresses agreed to play that. I really prefer when the woman is simply not present, it's way better than seeing her portrayed weak and evil as hell through the masculine lens.<br/><br/>Well, Tarantino you should be glad, the world has not changed !

"moonspinner55","4","11","18","1 January 2017"," Aggressively antagonistic, repugnant and foul...just what Tarantino's fans have come to expect and welcome
","Writer-director Quentin Tarantino's ""8th film"", as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people's idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock's new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter's 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus ""The Thing"" (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino's belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story's context, is welcomed), though the film's 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a ""Chapter Five"" prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson's excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we're snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone's ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****"

At best we are looking at some form of performance art specifically tailored to torture its audience and at worst the disconcerting mental break down of what once was a very promising and upcoming director.<br/><br/>This wasn't a film, this was a masturbatory glorification of pulp writing to send home a single message, namely that Tarantino thinks his fans aren't worthy of his art.

"luke-a-mcgowan","8","49","102","9 January 2016"," Slow to start, but classic Tarantino
","I had to sleep on this movie to deduce what rating I would give it. At the start, it was a solid 6. The end, nearly a ten. So now I've settled at around 8 - a great movie with a few things I'd have done differently.<br/><br/>The first two (even three) chapters of The Hateful Eight are a bit slow going. The roadcoach picks up passengers wandering in the wild and they banter. The dialogue is great but the movie slow. Having watched it without the 70mm film as intended, those long shots of blizzard stricken Wyoming was probably impressive but without them its just very slow going. The highlight of the first two chapters is a scene in which Kurt Russell's John Ruth reads SLJ's Marquis Warren's letter from Abraham Lincoln. Not only can you see the reverence in Ruth's eyes and face, you can feel the tension as you know something bad is going to happen. All throughout this movie, Tarantino knows exactly what to do to build suspense. One such scene, Warren asks Smithers if he can sit. How do you respond? Yes? No? Eff off? I suppose I can't stop you? Dern's cool and dignified ""yes you may"" is the perfect way to keep tension whilst still being a realistic answer from a racist Southern general to a black man.<br/><br/>Once we get to Minnie's the story gets exciting, culminating in an entertaining monologue from Warren to Smithers, taunting him about the fate of his son. The placement of a chess board, white on Dern's black on Jackson's, is a great visual aid considering their war history. It feels almost like a two-sided conversation thanks to Dern's terrific expressiveness in response to Jackson's impeccable delivery. You can feel the words sting him. <br/><br/>Tarantino's big twist is incredible but doesn't feel like a deus ex machina even thought it involves someone hiding beneath the floorboards. It takes us back to probably the best scene in the film, the Four Passengers segment, which is even more tense than the wedding in Kill Bill Volume 2 or the underground poker game in Inglourious Basterds. With Ennio Morricone's creepy score tingling at you, you watch the four cool gang members each line up a victim. The segment also introduces a number of points that make sense to us when we rewatch the film. We really get a sense of how the presence of Marquis and Chris ruined a well-laid plan. The film's climax is thrilling and absolutely wonderful, much better than the original ending in the leaked script.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the movie is wonderful, with classic Tarantino dialogue snapping off between characters. Well-established characters banter about matters that give us context on who they are and it is those differences which spike the tension throughout the movie. Of the Hateful Eight themselves, the standouts are Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggin and Tim Roth. Jackson delivers Tarantino's lines with the same energy that he did back in 1994 with Pulp Fiction. Walton Goggins is having an absolute blast as Chris Mannix, and ends up being the most likable character by the end of the film. He's funny, moronic and angry but you still get a sense that he's trying to prove himself from his father's shadow. Tim Roth delivers a brilliant monologue in the middle of the film, his disarming English accent splendid at making you look the other way. That's not to say that the rest of the 8 are weak links - Bichir probably gets the least to do, but its more than I expected. Dern I've already said is very good. Madsen is solid, and Leigh is excellent when she's allowed to excel. Most of her performance is reaction shots to blood being blasted into her face. At times she plays like a petulant child, at others a sadist. Unfortunately, I never took satisfaction from her demise because she hadn't done anything villainous enough. So she shot a man who was about to die anyway. We never learn about who she murdered - the revelation that she's in a gang is insufficient, because at least the others murder people in the movie. Kurt Russell is hit and miss - excelling in scenes involving the Lincoln letter, whether it's hurt at being deceived or reverence at being able to read it - but mostly he feels a bit like a caricature who does it a bit over the top.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a great movie. I took issue with a few things - much is made of Minny hating Mexicans but she never even blinks when meeting Bob in the Four Passengers, the slow-motion language is a terrible artistic decision for an already slow movie, and the first two chapters could have been trimmed into one. However, the tension is unreal, the violence is sensational and I come away completely satisfied by the end product."

","Throughout his career the revered Quentin Tarantino has developed more than just a genre of himself, but a collection of work that has proved that he is a national treasure transcending being merely a modern cinematic icon but ultimately a classic and timeless figure in cinema.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight has to be his most precise and literary film that accumulates a career of brining together some of the most talented people in their field of work from production design to cinematography to the spellbinding, stellar cast of actors.<br/><br/>First of all, the whole 70mm panovision thing that I expect the large majority of the audience will be uninformed of may wonder if it is some gimmick, as may even the cynics who apparently know what they're talking about. To cut it short, its what makes the hateful eight look so exquisitely textured. every shot; every frame even, is like the most intricate oil pastel paintings like a Baptiste Chardin or Liotard. It is a mouth waveringly, beautifully shot film. An epic format for an epic film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the work of Robert Richardson (cinematographer) who's long lasting collaboration with Tarantino is certainly reflected in this film as a culmination of all the best skill and artistry of the Tarantino collection which makes me happy, because I have seen this man grow into a master. Moreover, the production design by Yohei Taneda and the art department; all of the behind scenes people involved have seriously got their work cut out for them because this film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>What is also great is the fact that this film has some long lasting collaborations in terms of acting and a group of people who are just ,obviously, so in tune with Tarantino's writing that it is just a joy and pleasure to watch them speak the Tarantino language. Every single performance brought a smile to my face and again we are presented with so many quotable lines from a director who's so far embedded into popular culture that when you search the term, you often are given Tarantino as a result. I loved this film, if you have never seen a Tarantino Film then typically what you have is an artistry in violence and at the fore front a script full of witty, philosophical, quotable dialogue.

It's the first time of my life that I wanted to get up of the theater because of how awful that movie was. All of it, from the boring dialogs going on forever about such uninteresting things, the disgusting images and scenes that were presented and the lack of professionalism of this movie, without omitting the real ""mauvais gout"" of the whole thing. The opening scene tells it all. It is already and will be a boring bla bla bla movie until the end. I hated it so badly it got me upset when I got out of the theater. How can such a brilliant filmmaker such as Tarantino could watch this movie and say ""yes people will love it""! I believe that Tarantino has made a bet with his fellow filmmaker friends to see if he could put out any kind of r* and people will still write positive critics about it and the movie will be nominated for rewards and get credit for it. And the worst part is that he WON. That must tell you something. It is a racist, sexist, very disturbing movie (and not in the good way). It has no interest and it is so so so so so so so so so slow that you are actually the one wanting to put a bullet in your heard after seeing it. Or even let's be honest while it's playing. In one word, don't waste your time seeing that movie. Life is too precious."

","QT had been my favorite director till he turned out The Hateful Eight. I don't remember how many times I have seen Pulp Fiction. Even his later works like 'Inglourious Basterds' have left me speechless. His understanding of filmography is transcendental. Consequently, I was totally flummoxed by a film which turned out to be a truck-load of pure manure. If Tarantino has decided that the cause of African-Americans will be furthered by creating films of fictional Black-retribution he is most welcome to do it; but he should do it with more flair, and perhaps more care. It looks like that 'flair' is something which is totally missing in this movie, and has replaced with something like toxic self-indulgence. It looks like that that QT has decided that because he has built such an international reputation,any nonsense he now produces will be lapped up as great cinema. It does have the Tarantino trademarks of occasional great dialogue, competent acting, elaborate dance of blood and gore, and quality music. But where it goes all wrong is a remarkably languorous pace, a ponderous playhouse script, a completely meaningless and insane story, a remarkably linear storytelling (with the characteristic chapter-numbering of scenes laboring as cliché than any cinematic necessity), and a general feeling that QT is doing all this to advance his Black-retribution philosophy than any compulsion to create a compelling saga. If this film was produced as a second rate Hollywood flick by any B-grade filmmaker I would perhaps thought of rating it as passable, and then only if the running-time was kept under two hours. But with a 3 hour running time produced under the QT banner, it can only be called a monstrous waste of time and money, which deserves to be canned; or shown to film students as a case-study of how NOT to make a film. The 2 stars I have awarded is for some occasional good dialogue...otherwise it is such an awful film that I now feel that there should a law against producing such bad films. Best avoided."

","I will give nothing away, but racism works both ways.<br/><br/>Thank goodness I did not have to pay to see this. If this gives anything away, then let it be this:<br/><br/>Imagine a movie that is all about ""bad whitey, bad whitey, talk, kill, blood, kill, talk, kill again"". There, now you saw it. <br/><br/>Quentin is a flake, period. Pulp Fiction was great. Another one or two of his flicks, decent. I do not however get the whole Tarantino craze, especially seeing as how it's basically the same movie every time. Violence? Okay then. 70's meet today? Yeah, got it. Actors in constant dialogue about nothing as they explain every nuance just in case you're too bored to think? Check. Although dialogue in film is great and too few films actually take the time, this is no Heat with DeNiro and Pacino. Like all Tarantino mush, this is just a 3:00 P.M. grade school brown bag of yesterday's pocket-stuffed tator tots and an argument of who gets the monkey bars next. With today's dumbed down average film-goer however, PC society being what it is, the dumber the better I suppose. Guess I'll just stick to reading. More justification to never pay to watch movies. <br/><br/>The fact that this putrid piece of junk has an 8.0 rating is by and large a telltale of paid ""reviewers"" and a whole bunch of folks in serious need of either professional treatment or a strong case to put into law a mandate that would force some members of society to have to start over from 1st grade, even if they're in their 30's. <br/><br/>Tarantino is just a psycho with an audience of like minded fool-- er... sorry, fans, the careful study of who by a methodical actor could lend credence to a successful 2016 remake of Cuckoo's Nest. Oscars all-around! The natives shall dance around a fire and sing praise to the gods of atheism, in who they do not believe, to bring them rain and crops and call them president/s. Welcome to the 21st version of the 7th century. <br/><br/>Folks, whatever your poison, the world's gone nuts and film is dead. If you enjoyed this movie then quit your job and move back in with your parents. Whoops. Looks like I'm too late. How late? If you liked this movie then I have non-brand items I'd like to introduce to you. Try snuggling up with the Snuggie. GLH for thinning hair. Mr. Microphone to liven up parties. Wait, but that's not all! Be your own boss and come to my seminar so you too can change your life. Just $395 and after one hour you'll never again have to hear, ""You're late again."" I digress. <br/><br/>In summary, if you're over 30 and plan on being a Clinton voter, believe that Russia is evil, and like your eggs made of barley or greens hold the eggs, this film is for you!"
"wetlogik-95098","3","30","60","11 January 2016"," Three hours that I will never get back
","As many of the other reviewers have stated, I will start by saying that I was a rabid Tarantino fan since the beginning. The operative word being ""was"" because I can't help feeling that the overstuffed creative genius has lost his mind. This film was at least an hour too long,twice as vulgar as it needed to be, liberally gratuitous with gore, unfulfilled plot lines and unnecessary sexual perversion that added very little, if anything at all, to the story.<br/><br/>To be fair, I thought it started out with great promise in the opening dialog, setup and especially the cinematography. The music was impressive and did not blow out the dialog as many modern films do. But the last 45 minutes undid all of the pleasure I took from the performances by this (mostly) highly skilled cast. Why is Michael Madsen still getting work? He must have a personal services contract with Tarantino, Do we really need chapter headings for a film made in the 21st century? When a movie is this long, every extra second spent in the quiet darkness of a near empty theater house becomes agonizing while waiting for the payoff finale that never quite arrives. Could have saved at least a minute or two by dispensing with that crap.<br/><br/>If this is the kind of message that we want to send about American art, it becomes easy to see why we are under fire from so many cultures. Sorry Quentin, but our divorce is final. By the way, I did enjoy the popcorn."

","If you were hoping for a film about eight notorious killers holed-up in a cabin where the intensity is slowly ratcheted up until everything comes to a head and inevitably explodes into a gunfight of epic proportions and consequences...this isn't that movie.<br/><br/>First, the good...<br/><br/>The cinematography at the beginning of the film was beautiful. The panoramic landscapes were stunning as was a slow motion close up of two horses in full gallop, especially with the Ennio Morricone score playing in the background. It seemed like this film was well on it's way to being a western of epic proportions. <br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh can do no wrong. For most of the film she just reacts to the other characters and the situations, and does it brilliantly. Her sly winks, her laugh, her voice and anything she does makes her character truly memorable. Towards the end of the film her character Daisy Domergue finally opens up and Leigh is very good. It's too bad her character wasn't given a back story, because Leigh could have easily won a trophy or two this awards season if Daisy was a more fleshed- out character.<br/><br/>Tim Roth is good for what little he is also given. He can take a throwaway line, (which there are plenty of in the film), and deliver it in a funny, memorable way. It's too bad his character doesn't do much other than fill up a space so the title can have the number eight in it.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell did 'good'. Now I put that in quotes because he's done better, and in some scenes his lines fall flat and almost seem forced, but being a Russell fan myself, I think he did pretty good for the most part. It's too bad he's not acting as much as he should be.<br/><br/>The bad...<br/><br/>CHAPTER 1 ... Chapters in these films are no longer needed. Normally, I kind of look forward to these because we usually find out something new or shocking, either way you know something is about to happen. In this movie, however, they actually distract from the story.<br/><br/>Narration by some unknown person is also no longer needed in his films. The narrations seem like an after-thought that were added in during the editing process.<br/><br/>The out-of-sequence chapter is pretty standard fare when it comes to Tarantino's films. In this film, the sequence just makes you say. 'Oh. Okay.' and doesn't work at all.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen is 100% a throwaway character. He's given no good lines and could have been left out of the film entirely.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is a another wasted character and was basically used for a laugh, (depending on your sense of humor).<br/><br/>No other actor's talents were wasted more in The Hateful Eight than Bruce Dern's. Dern is given nothing to work with and I feel bad for him and disappointed in Tarantino for not giving him a more deserving part.<br/><br/>Walton Goggins WASN'T BAD. He is listed under the bad section because his character's motivations were all over the place. His cool confidence is what makes him an interesting actor and he wasn't given any of that here.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson. Make no mistake - this was his movie. He is the main character. Forget the title. Out of the Hateful Eight, only four of them were actually given enough material for them to be fleshed-out characters. The rest of the characters are merely bit players to push the story forward.<br/><br/>There were a lot of throwaway scenes I don't even want to get into because it might spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet.<br/><br/>People are comparing this movie to Reservoir Dogs, which is laughable. Reservoir Dogs did a lot more with a lot less. The Hateful Eight is bloated with a lot of unnecessary scenes and dialogue.<br/><br/>The violence is way over the top and unrealistic. Some of it can be seen as an attempt at dark humor. While some of it works, some does not and is needlessly gratuitous.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight was unrealistic in general and most serious westerns try to play as true to historically correct as possible. <br/><br/>Now I will say that Django Unchained was definitely an exception to the rule. You had to suspend disbelief because that was part of the fun of the film. The thought of Django actually being real and doing the things he did and said back in those times was really fun to watch. The hip hop music during the shoot out, for example, put a big smile on your face and had you cheering him on.<br/><br/>However, The Hateful Eight is a serious western with a small bit of comedy relief thrown in, and is pretty far from historically factual in terms of characters and their interactions. <br/><br/>This brings me to the last part of my review...the ugly.<br/><br/>Tarantino has always been given a free pass when it comes to using the n-word, and boy he lets it fly here. Not a little bit, not a lot, not a bit much, but way too much.<br/><br/>Subtle is not a word in Tarantino's vocabulary. Everything has to be loud and in your face. <br/><br/>He's been known for being hip and cool, neither of these words describe this film.<br/><br/>Nobody in this film, aside from Minnie, Sweet Dave or even O.B., were likable at all. Every character was flawed and none of them seemed to live by any kind of code or morality or immorality for that matter.<br/><br/>At the end when you see who is left standing, you really don't care. That was the biggest disappointment for me."

"urthpainter","4","28","57","5 January 2016"," Ax to Grind
","I'm not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I feel the best movie he was a large part of is True Romance, a movie he did not direct. Quentin's need to be a complete film maker is his biggest weakness. It is my opinion that if he truly wants to be involved in a film masterpiece he needs to focus on one thing (writing Or directing), and be humble in his role. Tarantino is not humble, and perhaps the freedom he has gained to make his own movies as dictator is admirable, but it doesn't make him a master. His insistence to insert himself into his films is always a mistake, and generally his presence as actor is the worst part of his films. He is not, never was, and never will be Sergio Leone, the film maker he so often tries to emulate.<br/><br/>Enter the Hateful Eight - Visual media that could only be good if it was a 50 minute cartoon, and even then the cast of unlikable characters could doom the viewer to a short hour that they could never get back.<br/><br/>I've always suspected that Tarantino has used his success to freely unload his racist, misogynistic views on a willing audience who accepts his work as art. The Hateful Eight has not changed this belief. This being said, at times people can do the right thing for the wrong reasons, which gets me to the one of the few redeeming quality of this film: this movie displays a host of iconic villains who live by the gun. The Hateful Eight can be seen to explore the mind set of simpletons who rely on violence as a livelihood and weapons as problem solvers. No matter where one stands on guns, this movie asks some interesting questions in this one regard.<br/><br/>But who cares? Not only are all the characters here unredeeming, they are not compelling, interesting, fun, or worth spending any time around. And we spend A Lot of time with them. A Lot of time. Too Much Time. Way Too Much Time. The amount of time spent with these characters exceeds that which would be useful. How much time would be useful to spend with unlikable, uninteresting, unredeeming, violent imbeciles? I'll tell you tomorrow.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight gets off to an interesting, dynamic beginning where the characters are literally in motion. The location is fun, classic, and helps introduce widely divergent characters into a cramped space where no one can get away from one another. Unfortunately, openings end, and the location of the final 3/4 of this movie symbolizes the stagnant, boring characteristic taken by the vast majority of this film. I'm not ripping this movie because I don't like dialog driven films. Great, witty dialog can make a single location film an incredible experience. That is not what happens here.<br/><br/>Tarantino can't help but insert himself into the film... again, and his presence comes off as flat and uninteresting sequences that would have better been edited out. I'll tell you a solution to getting rid of Tarantino's presence I also don't recommend... more time spent with these characters!<br/><br/>If you want to watch a three hour live action cartoon (that feels like 5) about gun toting morons who can't die quickly enough, The Hateful Eight might be right up your ally. Why did I watch this movie? Because of the makers social relevance, and my occasional enjoyment of his films.<br/><br/>Bad movie: 4 out of 10"

Maybe yes, just because he was young ands less experienced, thats about it.<br/><br/>Now, the movie... Its more than 150 minutes, the first hour is very intriguing, the next half hour gets a little slow and maybe could have been a tad shorter.<br/><br/>But then the last hour is like a full throttle hormone rising epic like you have never seen before. I am 43 and having seen all the movies, from Kurusowa to Cameron to Nolan to Guy Ritchie to Hitchcock, not that my saying matters, but this movie sits Quentin at the very top 3. <br/><br/>Every character is brilliantly crafted, so beautiful, every scene in the movie is epic. I don't understand the 70mm concept of this movie being the last of it, but the camera work and the angles were just perfect.<br/><br/>Rusell, Leigh, Jackson and Goggins were just too good. You also have Quentin's steady arsenal in Madsen and Zoe Bell, cameos from both.<br/><br/>The story... set up in the 19th century, 3 men are taking a outlaw and they rest in a deserted cafe in the midst of a blizzard and there is something happening, you can only sense, but you wont get anything more. And that is the brilliance of Quentin, he unfolds the story in an amazing way, not even giving you any hints, but you know something is just not right abd then...<br/><br/>BOOM! 1 gun shot and then the epic happens, that is the last hour and the first 1 and half hour is just the dosage to build that final BOOM.<br/><br/>If you love movies, if you love art (but mind you, its very very gory, typical Quentin) if you love story telling, if you love screenplay, if you love acting, if you love anything to do with movies, you will love this film.<br/><br/>I am not from America, so if there is apolitical undertone as a reviewer has mentioned, I didn't get it, but undertone or not, this movie is a treat.<br/><br/>And the music,,, oh the music, the background score and all which is always a big factor of Quentin's movie, probably the best of all. <br/><br/>And just to repeat, what an awesome camera work.<br/><br/>Quentin delivers again, even out does himself, I don't know how, but he does"

","First of all: I really liked the Tarantino films I saw so far, so I expected a lot. And every single one of my expectations was kicked to the ground and slowly (oh so very slowly) beaten to death.<br/><br/>The dialog was cheap and badly done, they kept repeating the sentences, everything was redundant. If I ever watch this film again, I will count the following words and phrases and i doubt that any of them will score a number less than 20: ""big black p*nis"" (in other words), ""n*gger"" (without any context)and ""you have to kick it in"" (you will know what I mean.)<br/><br/>There were many stylistic devices used but many of them badly so.

Just lots of pretentious dialogue and several references to a fictitious letter by Abraham Lincoln that is read at the end of the movie after criminal Daisy is hung inside Minnie's Haberdashery.<br/><br/>Being technically competent does not make up for the nastiness in this movie. <br/><br/>The worst sequence being the recounting/flashback by Samuel Jackson's character Major Marquis Warren of his murder and humiliation of the son of Confederate General Smithers. Smithers is played by Bruce Dern, who must really be desperate for any role to be in this angry film.<br/><br/>In that sequence Samuel Jackson tortures and forces the son to perform oral sex upon him, while the son is naked in the wilderness setting before his death. Jackson, who seems to enjoy his torture tale, right out of a maximum security prison for rapists and other perverts, should be ashamed for taking this explicit role and it doesn't jive with his hawking Capital One Credit Card.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is pointless and I really wish Tarantino would take his movie mimicry into another endeavor--- like becoming a permanent movie critic because he does no service to the art form with the likes of this movie and the ""Django Unchained"" shock style of ""movie making."""

Don't get me wrong I don't care either way, however when it starts to effect the quality of the movie it really ruins my wanting to keep watching movies by him. The movie is suppose to be about the story and not some point. The story here simply wasn't that good. This movie was really hard to like. Usually his movies through all the blood and gore usually have some humor to them and some philosophical points. This one no so much, maybe 2 lines in the whole thing that were funny. If anything a lot of it was done in a very distasteful way or very cliché way. The narration of the movie just kills part of the movie and the feel to the movie. It was so disjunctioned from the rest of the move it felt as odd as the narration voice. His use of flashbacks is also no where near what it use to be. He has been known for the way in which he tells the story and pieces it together in all different ways. But his use here just seems bland. I don't know, maybe he got bored and is simply doing these things only for the money now. Or maybe one too many drugs has rotted his mind. But one thing is for sure. He just doesn't write movies like he use to. The story simply isn't up to par for him, the writing wasn't up to par for him, and his ending is simply typical at this point. There were no real plot twists or turns. 5/10 even though i hate to give one of his movies that low of a rating. Support the new bev. save the 8mm films. But for god sakes go back to writing better movies."
"perez-j-alberto","2","10","17","6 January 2017"," If you love violence and the N word watch this movie
","I hated this movie. The gratuitous use of the N words and the blood-splattering aside, the plot is a drawing room drama with guns and the only remotely interesting character is Jennifer Jason Leigh's. There was such opportunity with these actors and the talent behind the camera, but alas, it was not meant to be. QT is like a teenager who only wants the thrill of a cranium exploding or using a forbidden word. There is not much here that holds one's attention. In fact, despite the richness of the set and excellent lighting, I was still bored by the repetitive dialogue that led nowhere significant and I ended up only noticing the use of the N word. If the inspiration for this film was in fact Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" then it is a miserable fail. The characters simply were not fully realized on a script level. The actors did their best, but could not rescue it from the hands of the naked Emperor-Director; and at three hours - tortured is how I felt by the end, especially with no plot twist worthy of the indulgent film. This is a big thumbs down for me."

","Seems a huge pity movies like this even find an audience let alone progress beyond the scripting stage. That people have lowered their expectations to Tarantino's sub-standard content is incomprehensible. Some misguided individuals tend to think sensationalist 'nigger' calling (among endless other perversions) coupled with violence on both sides, acts as a deterrent for racial bias, not so - it's more likely to encourage it! Looking at just one aspect of the technical dept; Producer/distributors like the Weinsteins will foolishly give this hugely overrated movie maker large sums of money to play out his immature fantasies, so they can garner profits from his folly. Who else would be fool enough to indulge him with a budget that allows for Filming in Ultra Panavision 70mm? – especially for a film where up to 90% of story takes place in a dingy snow bound cabin?! It's also little wonder this director covers himself by using the same cinematographer for the majority of his works - without this talented chap to grace his titles they would probably look rather limp. With all this money and talent, technical reality is still thrown away with the obvious over lighting of a set - which in all historic fact, could only have been a dim candle lit situation – sure we all want to see the subject but, such super bright led lighting in the 1800's is rather ludicrous. <br/><br/>Taking a quick look at the moral dept; Further testimonies to a general lowering of standards can be found within some of the analyses written about the subjects of these movies. When third rate hatred and ultra violence replaces intelligent observation or character study - it shows critics and fans have allowed themselves to become blinkered. Some, unbelievably, argue these movies are serious studies of social history, while completely overlooking the simpleton approach taken with dialogue, characterisations, and historical accuracy. Only an industry out to make profits from over the top graphic violence and obscenity would defend these actions - against claims made by numerous health professionals the world over. In one particularly repugnant sequence a victim is stripped naked at gunpoint, forced to walk through snow, then told they would be spared if they performed fellatio while the perpetrator screamed obscenities – only to be shot through the head at the end of the act. What is this if not the writer/director's own perversions being acted out on screen? So much extended moronic nonsense is thrown at the audience including someone being shot between the legs at point blank range, then somehow being able to laugh while they drag a woman's body (dangling at the end of a hangman's rope) up and over a ceiling rafter - with the energy to hold her struggling body in the air till she dies. It beggars belief that anyone could write such trash let alone commit it to film. What's in the minds of those who laud this stuff? - certainly not intelligence or any understanding of morality.<br/><br/>Prolific Italian composer Ennio Morricone said after his first collaboration with Tarantino he would never work with him again. Tarantino knowing the value of having Morricone's name on his credits - simply made an offer he could not refuse, giving even more of the producers finances to entice him back. While the Academy saw fit to award an Oscar to the score, it remains just another re-run of earlier Morricone works and sounds every bit like the composer never saw a frame of the movie (which he didn't!). Morricone was 'too busy' to look at any of the footage and simply sent in a score that, many others agree, was then rather poorly used in the final cut. Such an odd business. Yet again Tarrantino copies Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in the West' (+ others) right down to the over-length 3hr running time (someone should introduce him to the cutting room floor). The endless episodic 'Chapters' and somewhat corny voice-over, at times reduce the pace to a plodding bore. <br/><br/>If this is Tarantino's 8th movie – then spare us the 9th and 10th. Hang up your guns or consider turning them on yourself and spare the world any further sludge."

","I started reading reviews of this movie, but I decided to stop and just give my honest opinion before I'm influenced too much by the occasionally very impassioned arguments for and against this film on this site. I watched through to the end, so that's a plus--so many movies don't hold my attention. The acting is mesmeric--I couldn't take my eyes off Samuel L Jackson for the whole thing; he quite steals the entire movie for me. The dialogue is amusingly weird. There are some very anachronistic moments, however--like the New Zealand actress right in the middle with her bizarre Kiwi accent (err... wouldn't have had one in the mid-1800) doing a bad Calamity Jane impression. But overall I think this film would probably have been better not made. Violence, hate and evil shouldn't be glorified. Don't get me wrong, I love gory, violent movies. But I like my entertainment to have a moral core, a sense of right from which evil deviates. That doesn't exist in this film No one is the fixed point of the compass from which you can judge the events and weigh them in the cosmic balance. This is hell. This is mankind without any possible redemption. This is a vision of the world so bleak that I, personally, don't want any part of it. It's pornographic violence. Dress it up how you like with fancy dialogue and amusing actors (Walton Goggins also steals this movie), this is still pornography. I'm giving the movie three stars because the wrapping was out of this world. Pity the present inside was so corrupt."

","I don't usually do movie reviews, but after watching Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"", I feel compelled to issue a warning. I found this to be a terrible movie on so many levels!!! Where to start? The (thin) plot is tedious much of the time and the characters woefully unredeemable. I would issue a special 'Hang Your Head in Shame' award for deliberately revolting scenes; so many in fact, that they overtake most of the film. In typical Tarantino style, this film is accompanied by extreme violence and plenty of blood and gore. The acting by a select cast was the only decent thing about it. Don't be swayed by the idiotic crop of sadistic QT cult followers who will give it rave reviews for blood lust alone. This same story could have been told differently and been much more deserving of artistic merit. I would guess that Quentin (of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill) is merely trying to cash in on his vintage fame. Don't waste your popcorn on this one folks, I came dangerously close to losing mine!"

I'm blaming the script. It isn't the commentary or the n-words. I like that part. It is the lack of editing. What was said, needed to be said, more succinctly. The constant babbling soliloquies made the film nearly three hours. It gives the impression that Father Quentin was being overly self indulgent. Perhaps it was my fault for going to a movie theater to see it. The seats just don't accommodate a 167 minute film, period.

"Leofwine_draca","5","8","13","21 January 2017"," As Tarantino films go, this one's near the bottom
","The main sensation that one comes away with having watched THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino's newest film, is a sense of disappointment. It's not that this is a particularly poor film - it's far better than DEATH PROOF, for example - it's just that it's so, well, average. Tarantino is capable of so much more and you won't find it here. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is an Agatha Christie-style mystery set inside a snowy cabin with a blizzard going on outside and a cast of suspicious characters inside.<br/><br/>The story sounds interesting and it is. The best thing about it is Tarantino's direction, which is still second to none and really the only reason to keep watching through some of the worst moments. The worst thing about it is Tarantino's own script, which really needed the services of an editor to turn it into something workable. The whole first hour and a half of this movie is a deathly dull set-up in which very little happens and long stretches of boredom threaten to send the viewer to sleep.<br/><br/>I appreciate that Tarantino likes the slow burner, but slow burners need suspense and in that respect THE HATEFUL EIGHT falls far behind similar moments in RESERVOIR DOGS or INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Not only do we have to wait around forever once we get to the cabin, but there's that whole extra first half an hour on the stage coach which is quite ridiculous. Another big problem is a whole half-hour sub-plot involving Bruce Dern's extraneous character which culminates in a crude sexual joke that seems to have been written by Tarantino in the mindset of a teenage boy. All that effort, all that money, and this is the best he can do? Not only that, but it has no relation to the main plot of the film and needed excising, along with Dern himself.<br/><br/>Still, there are flashes of the old Tarantino magic here, and the last part of the film, in which things actually start happening and the cast start dying, is good stuff, reminiscent of RESERVOIR DOGS at its best. There are lots of surprisingly gruesome special effects which seem to have been inspired by those in the EVIL DEAD remake and turn this into a horror film in places. Tarantino has also assembled some great actors including Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson, the latter of whom gives a fine performance which is the best in the movie. It's also good to have Tim Roth and Michael Madsen back from the old days. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a difficult part but comes across well and it's only minor performers like the awkward Zoe Ball who disappoint. Kudos too to Walton Goggins, finally excelling in a main role after years and years of bit parts and minor work."

The black / white historic divide could have been interesting, but overuse of the 'N' word drowned it out, as did the gore to the over-all story. The mid-way narration was weak. I would like to see Tarantino attempt a movie without violence, I think his intelligence is being held back by his weakness for suiting the audiences blood-thirst. Tim Roth's character was an anally retentive Christoph Waltz in 'Django Unchained', and well thats just one persons opinion. I worry about the generations that crave this sort of thing, and how maybe only portraying increasingly graphic violence can fill the gap that such a soulless culture provides. How much more graphic do we now need to shock us other than someone's entire face being blown off?

And then comes a scene so ridiculous and predictable concerning a letter that you're not sure whether this movie is made for MST3K.

"jcbutthead86","10","52","121","22 December 2015"," An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Western. Quentin Tarantino At His Best.
","The Hateful Eight is an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and a memorable score. All of those elements make The Hateful Eight an unforgettable film that is Quentin Tarantino at his best.<br/><br/>Set in post-Civil War Wyoming,The Hateful Eight tells the story of eight people including Major Marcus Warren(Samuel L. Jackson),a bounty hunter,John Ruth(Kurt Russell)another bounty hunter holding fugitive and prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh)and Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins),a man claiming to be a new Sheriff,Bob(Demian Bichir),Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth),Joe Gage(Michael Madsen)and Sanford Smithers(Bruce Dern)who are all in a stagecoach holdover trying escape a blizzard. But all of these strangers will be involved in a mystery with twists and deception.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a brilliant and entertaining Western from Quentin Tarantino and it is a thrilling,bloody,brutal and epic film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western,Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight Tarantino has made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films Inglorious Basterds(2009)and Django Unchained(2012)which are very much alike in scope,look and tone and if you seen those films or Tarantino's other films it has all of the known elements:rich dialog,over the top violence and memorable characters that will stay with you. Like those two films The Hateful Eight is long in length you will not be bored. While a companion piece to both Basterds and Django,The Hateful Eight in terms of structure is more of a call back to Tarantino's classic debut Reservoir Dogs(1992)in which a bunch of strangers are together in one room where there is distrust and paranoia among them but this time set in the 19th century. The screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is well-written and strong,with Tarantino giving the main characters memorable dialog that is funny,interesting and make scenes standout. As for the main characters each one of The Hateful Eight is memorable but the characters Marquis Warren,John Ruth,Daisy Domergue and Chris Mannix are standouts and are classic characters from Tarantino who are going to liked or disliked depending on your point of view but are delightful in true Tarantino style. The photography(which was shot in the glorious 70mm format)by Robert Richardson is beautiful and visually stunning whether it's the shots of snowy mountains or inside shots the movie is amazing to look at. One of the things I love about The Hateful Eight is how it's the story is structure and told with not just the dividing chapters but amazing build-up. The first 90 minutes of the film is a dialog and character driven affair like a stage play where we get to know the main characters about who they are and what they are about and we as a viewer are fascinated. The second to last half of the film takes a different turn and becomes a violent and insane bloodbath mixing together Western violence with an Agatha Christie-style Mystery in the vein of Murder on The Orient Express and Ten Little Indians where there is twists and turns all around and you keep your eyes glued to the screen trying to solve a puzzle and put the pieces together and wondering who will survive this bizarre tale. The Action and violence is riveting and surprising with the blood and gore just coming off the screen at as if you were the movie with the characters. If you love storytelling the structure and mixture of Western and Mystery will be a great watch. The ending of The Hateful Eight is terrific with great Action,dialog and thrills that brings the movie full circle. An amazing conclusion.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing. Samuel L. Jackson is excellent,memorable and at his best as Major Marquis Warren,a bounty hunter. Kurt Russell is terrific as John Ruth,a fellow bounty hunter. Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding as Daisy Domergue,a fugitive in Ruth's capture. Walton Goggins is wonderful as Chris Mannix,a Southern renegade. Demian Bichir does a fine job as Bob,a Mexican caretaker. Tim Roth is amazing as Oswaldo Mobray,a hangman. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage,a Cowpuncher. Bruce Dern is fantastic as Sanford Smithers,s southern soldier.<br/><br/>The direction by Quentin Tarantino is fantastic and stylish with Tarantino bringing his usual flair,look and atmosphere to the film. Amazing direction,Tarantino.<br/><br/>The score by Ennio Morricone is epic,mysterious and intense matching the tone and style of the movie greatly. Sensational score,Morricone.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Quentin Tarantino,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you watch The Hateful Eight,an excellent,thrilling and entertaining Western that Quentin Tarantino at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","The Hateful Eight (2015)<br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's latest has bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) transporting his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) through a blizzard on the way to her hanging. Along the way they pick up Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and soon they're taking shelter in a small room with a number of colorful characters.<br/><br/>Tarantino is one of my favorite writer-directors but THE HATEFUL EIGHT did very little for me. I wish I could point my finger to anyone but Tarantino but sadly he's to blame for this film, which is shockingly boring. I never once thought I'd call a Tarantino picture boring but THE HATEFUL EIGHT clocks in at nearly three hours when it probably would have felt too long at even just ninety minutes. Obviously the biggest villain here is the screenplay, which contains non-stop dialogue that adds up to nothing.<br/><br/>Again, it's hard to believe that this here is a Tarantino screenplay because all of his wonderful talents just aren't on display here. If it wasn't for the ""N"" word constantly being thrown around then I'd be willing to bet the writer had nothing to do with this piece. What's so shocking is that we've got nearly three hours worth of talking going on and very little of it is interesting. I get what Tarantino was going for but I don't think it works on any level. The setting is mostly one room and I'm sure the film was supposed to build suspense throughout but it never does. Once the incredibly graphic violence happens towards the end you're just counting the bodies until the end credits start.<br/><br/>There are some good moments scattered throughout the film. I thought Russell and Jackson were both very good in their roles and they do what they can with the material. The Oscar-nominated Jennifer Jason Leigh easily steals the movie as the racist trash who is hiding a few secrets of her own. With such boring dialogue it really makes you feel that there are too many characters so Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern and Michael Madsen just do what they can. Ennio Morricone's score is another plus the film has going for it and the 70mm cinematography is also extremely good but it also seems wasted being trapped inside a building.<br/><br/>THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a disappointing movie on so many levels. It never really feels like the era that it takes place and I'd argue that it really comes across more of a stage play or, worse yet, a rehearsal for a stage play. While there are some good things scattered throughout the picture, at the end of the day this is a complete misfire."

","Quentin Tarantino's ultraviolent, ultra-talky sorta-Western ""The Hateful Eight"" is an impressive display of film craft and a profoundly ugly movie-so gleeful in its violence and so nihilistic in its world view that it feels as though the director is daring his detractors to see it as a confirmation of their worst fears about his art.<br/><br/>Set in the post-Civil War era, the movie pits a group of criminals and criminally brutal lawmen against each other in a snowbound Wyoming cabin. Tarantino takes his sweet time assembling his core cast. He spends nearly a half-hour on a stagecoach ride that introduces a mustachioed fugitive tracker, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell, talking like John Wayne); his driver O.B. (James Parks); his prisoner, the treacherous outlaw Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who's being escorted to Red Rock for hanging; incoming Red Rock sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a former outlaw that Ruth can't accept as a lawman, and Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), an ex-slave turned anti-Confederate war hero turned bounty hunter whose record of wartime atrocities makes Ruth distrust him and Mannix hate his guts.<br/><br/>When they arrive at the cabin-a watering hole known as Minnie's Haberdashery that seems as improbably vast on the inside as Snoopy's doghouse-they are joined by more characters. There's a furtive and rather cryptic Mexican (Demian Bichir) who calls himself Bob, a former Confederate general (Bruce Dern), a smug and effete British hangman (Tim Roth, filling what might otherwise be the Christoph Waltz part), and a smirking gunman named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen, doing the Michael Madsen thing). The joint's owner, Minnie, is nowhere to be found, and her husband is missing as well.<br/><br/>The character tally actually adds up to nine by this point, if you count the driver, but he's not really hateful, so maybe you shouldn't. And if you've glanced at a poster or trailer or IMDB, you know Tarantino will add more cast members, including Channing Tatum; Zoe Bell; Dana Gourrier of ""True Detective"" and ""Red Band Society,"" and Lee Horsley, who played Archie Goodwin on ""Nero Wolfe."" But Tarantino's never been the sort of director you hold to implicit promises about what you're getting when you buy a ticket.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with playful and curious surprises: not just of the plot twist or character-revelation variety, but what might termed ""formal violations"" that make ""The Hateful Eight"" feel more experimental than classical. This is a director who hires the Mahler of spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone, whose work he's sampled many times, to create an original score, then ladles it onto a film that is not a typically sumptuous revenge Western about characters' relationships to the land they're battling to claim, but something more like a crisply photographed stage play-think of Tarantino's debut film ""Reservoir Dogs,"" most of which took place in a warehouse, but with Stetsons and dropped g's, or a prairie rat cousin of Eugene O'Neill's tailbone-busting four-hour barroom fable ""The Iceman Cometh"" (""The Iceman Curseth""?), but with torture; rape; point-blank gunplay; multiple, possibly false identities, and gallons of blood.<br/><br/>By my stopwatch, four-fifths of ""The Hateful Eight"" takes place indoors, first in the stagecoach traveling to Minnie's, then in the cabin and a nearby barn. Tarantino asked his regular cinematographer, Robert Richardson, to shoot in Ultra Panavision 70mm, a format that has barely been used since the ""road show"" epics of the 1960s, and built an overture and an intermission into his already extravagant running time, yet he's staged most of the film's action away from direct sunlight. This is all fairly perverse, but it's these kinds of choices that make Tarantino more special than the filmmakers who dream of being the next Tarantino.<br/><br/>The problem isn't how Tarantino tells his story, but the deficiencies in the story itself-or maybe we should put ""story"" in quotes, because, more so than any Tarantino film, and this is saying a lot, what's onscreen doesn't feel like an intricately interconnected series of events, all of which feed into and build upon one another, but rather a succession of set pieces, most of which are tediously repetitive. Talk talk talk talk talk talk kill; talk talk talk talk talk talk kill, and so on, and so on. The N-word is sprinkled throughout; Tarantino loves the slur nearly as much he loves bare feet. But its use in ""The Hateful Eight"" is more problematic than in ""Django,"" where the term had a whiplash sting; even if you suspected Tarantino of trying to get away with something, the film's righteous ire (presenting the Confederate South as a little Nazi Germany right here in the good old USA) made you pause before writing him off as an opportunist.<br/><br/>That's not the case here. The in-depth conversations about the Civil War and capitalism and justice vs. frontier justice are superficially interesting, until you suspect they're not there to tie the film's characters to the American Character, but to set the stage for killings. The context of a nasty, brutish time gives the artist permission to be nasty and brutish.<br/><br/>When the violence arrives in ""Hateful Eight,"" it's unmoored not just from any morality espoused by the characters (who are hateful, after all!) but also, it seems, from Tarantino's own moral compass-if indeed he has one, and after this movie I have serious doubts. From ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" through his recent run of movies, he's given us a mix of proudly amoral and morally struggling characters, then shown them working through their hypocrisy and relativism in finely tuned, ping-pong style exchanges (like that final Travolta-Jackson conversation in ""Pulp Fiction""). In ""Hateful Eight,"" for the first time in Tarantino's career-and in contrast to such brutal, semi-exploitive but ultimately mournful films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""U-Turn""-there's no detectable moral framework to speak of. We're just watching a bunch of scorpions in a bucket getting ready to sting each other, then stinging each other-sometimes verbally, sometimes with fists or guns or other weapons: tearing flesh, coating hardwood floors with gore and brains.<br/><br/>Leigh's outlaw, the only woman, gets the worst of it, entering the film with a black eye, taking multiple fists to the face, and spending the final third of the film drenched in blood and missing a tooth. She doesn't wipe the blood off; this is presented as proof of her indomitability, but it plays like sheer provocation: Oh, I'm a misogynist, am I? Tough. Watch me leave the blood on her face, because I can. Like the nonstop barrage of racial slurs, the film's relentless and often comical violence against Daisy never feels truly earned. Saying, ""Well, they're all outlaws, including her, and that's just how women were treated back then"" feels like an awfully thin defense when you hear audiences whooping it up each time Russell punches Leigh in the face, and it dissipates during the final scene, which lingers on Daisy's death with near-pornographic fascination. In a movie filled with selfish, deceptive and murderous characters, hers is the only demise that is not just observed, but celebrated.<br/><br/>The pre-intermission showstopper is Warren's account of forcing the general's son to march naked through the snow, then orally raping him before killing him-an atrocity that might or might not have actually happened. It's so transparently intended as a ""Wow, I can't believe the film went there!"" moment that it makes every past Tarantino statement about feeling solidarity with oppressed peoples seem suspect. The bit where Warren describes his prodigious member to the general is oddly childish. Any pretense of political commentary or historical engagement vanishes, and you're left with a white filmmaker draping himself in a black leading man's mystique, like a kid putting on an Iron Man costume and running around the house telling everyone he can fly.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" arrives when it finally seemed as if Tarantino, dissed early in his career as a brilliant but disreputable pastiche artist, was earning a new reputation as a maker of audacious revenge pictures about underdogs lashing out against oppressors: women in ""Death Proof"" (which feels like a more compact but deeper examination of themes from ""Kill Bill""); Jews in the World War II fantasy ""Inglourious Basterds""; American slaves in ""Django Unchained."" Those three seemed at once kidding and serious, in the manner of such Samuel Fuller melodramas as ""The Naked Kiss"" and ""Shock Corridor"" (see them if you haven't; they're amazing). In ""Death Proof"" and ""Django,"" you could always see what Tarantino was going for even when he didn't pull it off. ""Death Proof"" played identification games by putting a male murderer and female avengers in the foreground in each of its halves, making you think about how a storyteller's choice of protagonist determines who we identify with, while ""Django"" saw its ""Odyssey""-like story through radicalized eyes, treating violence against slaves as one of America's original sins but violence against slaveowners (and anyone who profited from slavery) as a morally justifiable skeet-shoot, because the latter had forfeited their right to be thought of as human beings."

"Gamma-Rat","1","11","20","11 March 2016"," The King is Dead
","In the early 1990s a young Quentin Tarantino set a benchmark for how brilliant and innovative cinema can be. Two decades later, after a string of disappointing attempts to recapture that cinematic magic, he has set a new benchmark .... In how terrible cinema can be.<br/><br/>Its with a heavy heart that I watched this diabolical attempt at film making unfold. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were more than just movies to young people in the 90s, they became pop culture, iconic memories of that decade. Then came Jackie Brown, a decidedly average attempt from a guy who had been so talented that even the scripts he sold on became movie classics. In the two decades that followed the movies he has made have become steadily worse, shallow soulless mimicry of his earlier work. Its truly been hard to watch a legend of cinema very slowly disappear up his own backside, and in this new movie the process was completed.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentleman the king is dead!! <br/><br/>What Tarantino did with such success in his first two attempts at movie making was to enthuse modern movies with an iconic 1970s style. Punchy razor sharp dialogue, black humour, non-linear time lines and innovative characters. Fast forward twenty years and his efforts are an awkward parody of their former selves. They are big budget B-Movies.<br/><br/>So whats so bad about Hateful Eight? Well for a start it isn't a clever who-done-it as some claim, the ""mystery"" lasts about 10 minutes of screen time and isn't really even relevant. That's 10 minutes out of an extraordinarily long and self satisfied 3 hours. There's nothing clever about this plot at all, drawing it out simply thins out an already wafer thin storyline to near nothingness. There's literally no character development either, Im sure Michael Madsen and Tim Roth are only in this movie to make the numbers up to eight for two reasons. 1) It rhymes with hate and 2) Its Tarantino's eighth film .... genius!<br/><br/>Then there is the pointless and very graphic violence and language. Now I'm no prude when it comes to cinema but what makes this cross the line to distasteful is that its all out of context. In Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs the violence was relevant to the story. In this movie its just added in for what I assume is meant to be entertainment, possibly aimed at fans of The Walking Dead? Hearing Samuel L Jackson repeatedly being called the N-word for nigh on 3 hours became almost cringe-worthy. Yes Quentin we understand that racism was rife in the old West but if you want to make your audience think about this very sensitive issue in a constructive way is this really the right format? Wouldn't it be better to challenge these stereotypes rather than contribute to them? Also why is a movie so proudly declaring that its shot in 70mm when its set predominantly inside a little cabin? Why does the cabin look like its made from plastic? Why do they keep fixing the door in real time, its as if this is meant to actually be comical? I could go on and on about this awful catastrophe but ill leave it there.<br/><br/>Tarantino has long stated that he will only ever make 10 movies in his career, after this latest offering I truly dread to think what is coming next."
"declan_david","4","24","51","3 January 2016"," Fantastically disappointing.
","Let me begin by stating that I am a big fan of Tarantino's work. I rate 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill 1&2' and 'Django Unchained' (and even the inconsistent 'Inglorious Basterds'), among some of my favourite films. So why has Tarantino produced this mishmash of completely unlikeable characters meandering their way through a plot that has little point. At the end of this film I immediately thought ""why did he make this?"". Yes, the cinematography is first rate, the actors superb, the sets and costumes excellent and realistic for the period, the direction great the score apt. But surely we go to the cinema for more than an appreciation of technical mastery? I know I do. Essentially the medium of film is a vehicle for telling a story, albeit via the means of the art form of the 20th century. But the point is to engage us, the audience, so that we are moved emotionally or psychologically or taught some lesson of intellectual or moral worth. This film fulfills none of these criteria. Furthermore the script portrays none of Tarantino's usual wit or flair, the dialogue is pedestrian at best and trite and boorish at worst. The plot is predictable and uninspiring. I only ended up feeling some sympathy for one character and that was only because of all the unpleasantness and brutishness that befalls them. In summary, go to see this film only if you are a die-hard Tarantino fan and only then so that you can say that you have viewed all his works, as by contrast this should make you appreciate his other efforts. As a piece of cinema it is a well made yet abject failure. Fantastically disappointing."

Robert Bridge Richardson's cinematography n Ennio Morricone's score adds more flavor.
The film is focused around the dialogues, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces a la Reservoir Dogs.
While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold a la The Great Silence.
The weather in this film is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters.

","The Hateful Eight is a ponderous ""watching paint drying"" kind of a movie where the characters keep yapping and nothing seems to happen. Where the visual of screenplay writing is thrown out of the carriage window and scenes and events are narrated through dialogs - you don't get to see events happen as you would in a movie. The only moments you feel you are watching a movie are the gratuitous snowy wide shots on panavision. Or else it feels like you are watching a play... His worst movie - It's like QT's Waterloo, or in movie terms it is his ""Howard the Duck"" - an eternal nudge-nudge wink-wink of the kitschy mind... Tarantino is over-indulgent, trying to draw constant attention to supposed smart lines and the actors all play out shadows of their own characters from earlier QT movies. He has always relied on brilliant snappy smart dialogs and set pieces - but has always balanced it with action/events/plots - here it seems the dialogue writer erased the screenplay. QT is constantly trying to grab your attention with supposedly smart lines - it feels like the kid who says Look Ma No Hands! And predictably like the kid, this movie too falls on its face! Only from Chapter 4 does the movie become interesting (which is at approx 100 minutes RT) Any slower and this movie would be a Terence Malik or a Mrinal Sen art-house film! It seems like the movie has been made by a wannabe fan-boy trying to be QT with its nudge nudge wink wink moments. It's as if the director has gone through a check-list of his trademark ingredients - Blood and Gore - yes in plenty; Smart lines - yes; surprise cameos - yes; shocks - yes; Favorite characters dying - yes... But it does not come together like it did in Pulp Fiction or in Jackie Browne or Reservoir Dogs. Brilliant Performances by Sam Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell. Brilliant cameo by Tim Roth (as always) and the roles played by Michael Madsen and Channing Tatum could have been played by any A-Grade junior artist at the price of a double shift. It is an attempt to make it a Western version of Reservoir Dogs - but this one does not even wag its tail! The funny thing is sycophantic critics are waxing eloquent about how it takes us back to Sergio Leone and tribute to westerns and blah blah - THOSE movies had stories. Period. A horse carriage, a haberdashery,some snow and a few shootouts DO NOT make a western or a movie! It's like watching a play shot on film!"

","If you absolutely adored Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Django, as I did, then you will most likely feel conflicted about this film. Tarantino films have shaped pop culture for about twenty years now and this film does him no justice. In terms of the dialouge and interactions between characters, it is just exquisite. The characters seem to naturally coexist with one another in Tarantino's film. The conversations and tension between the characters seems to work on every level. They all somehow seem to know each by word of mouth in this tight knit universe that Tarantino has created. This is the strongest characteristic of Tarantino's film. However, this is the only good thing I could say about this chaotic mess of a film. There is this enormous build up throughout the film that ultimately leaves you with such a sour taste. The film is over three hours long for no apparent reason. The plot is thick enough to sustain it for that long, however, about half way through the film it all just unravels and becomes routine. As with every Tarantino film, heads eventually start rolling like bowling balls. You would think this is the most satisfying part of the film, right? Wrong. Every kill leaves you feeling kind of empty, unlike Django where the last part of the film is a phenomenal blood bath done in good taste. I LOVE the Tarantino's Gore fest just as much as the next guy but this film just dragged on for far to long. One of the main reasons I loved Reservoir Dogs was how snappy the film was. It moved along at a great pace and never apologized for it. I desperately wanted this film to be so much more but it just fell short of the high standard I hold Tarantino to. I had anxiously awaited to see Tim Roth and Tarantino work together again but it was just not what I expected unfortunately. This film is probably a seven as a stand alone feature...but considering it was the masterful Tarantino who directed it I feel compelled to compare it along side his other wonderfully crafted films...and...unfortunately it fall's well short."

","'""The Hateful Eight"" 70mm Roadshow pays tribute to the grand film exhibition style popularized in 1950' and 60's and that brought audiences to theatres with a promise of a special event. It delivers a unique experience that hasn't been had in over fifty years.'<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' truly is a unique and special event. Three hours long, including a beautiful musical intro, a ten-minute intermission in the middle and a small souvenir program. This format pays tribute to pictures like Lawrence of Arabia, Gone with the Wind, Ben-Hur and a handful of others that were presented in the same, captivating manner. <br/><br/>The Roadshow Engagement really changes the underlying nature of a modern day cinema experience, making it seem as going to a theatrical performance. The Ultra Panavision 70 format, which was used to shoot the movie, and Tarantino's masterful editing, have greatly enhanced that theatrical feel. The camera provides an incredibly wider and more detailed image. Each scene simply captures more and thus gives the viewer more room to explore the intricate details. Only a handful of movies have ever been made in this format, with the last motion picture (Khartoum) dating 1966.<br/><br/>It seems that Quentin Tarantino is in the best possible way 'indifferent' to critical acclaim, in same magnificent way Coen brothers or Paul Thomas Anderson are, amongst a few others. He is shooting about 'what he truly loves' and his pictures consistently retain an unbelievably unique flair. <br/><br/>It is an incredibly rare example of a director and a writer who is mindlessly comfortable in his own style and given all the means to conceptualize and visualize that style; and yes, that style happens to have controversy, dark humor, raw violence, vivid portrayals of greed, revenge and hatred. <br/><br/>'Eight' might be discredited due to it's seeming 'shallowness'. Many will argue that the dialogues are pointlessly long, the 'N' word is this time aimlessly abused and the bloody violence is not so much out of place as it is simply not qualified for. The Tarantino 'hero' has usually evoked violence based on something noble, like 'The Bride' in 'Kill Bill', 'Django' in 'Django Unchained' or the bastards in the 'Inglorious Bastards'. <br/><br/>Yet these exact arguments could and should be turned upside down. In 'The Hateful Eight' we receive a work of a master that is not afraid to experiment with rare formats and movie plots that contain solely antagonists. Tarantino knows that he can 'get away' with almost anything and he utilizes it to his advantage. He loves to examine ruthless characters motivated by questionably noble causes that are placed in the worst situations that bring out the worst in human nature. While this might at times look and feel 'over the top', this is exactly what makes Quentin one of the most fascinating directors of all time.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight', Tarantino's 8th film is by all means no exception. Containing an incredibly captivating and thrilling storyline, in the best possible way it pays homage to Tarantino's first movie, 'Reservoir Dogs', adding the so- familiar, crime-fueled 'confusion'. In detail, we examine Eight bad guys that 'find shelter' in Minnie's haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard. As events unfold and true motivations are slowly unraveled, we receive a violent, bloody tale fueled by merciless revenge, racial tensions, rage and integrity. <br/><br/>The dialogues are wonderfully smart and satirical, however what truly makes them stand out are the actors. The all-time, old school Tarantino cast seems as comfortable with the director as he is with violence and blood. This results in some of the best performances that a cast could possibly produce. <br/><br/>Legendary Ennio Morricone marks 'The Hateful Eight' as the first Western he has composed music for in forty years, with the last movies being 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', 'Once Upon a Time in America', 'The Untouchables' and many others. His music is fitting to the plot and to the scenery, at times softly flowing with the story and at times doing the exact opposite, adding even more emotion and suspense.<br/><br/>The exceptional 70mm format, that practically transforms us into the freezing, gorgeous, remote, wintery landscapes of 'Wyoming' and the remarkable skill, experience, and thorough knowledge of Quentin Tarantino, all make 'The Hateful Eight' the best Western of the 21st Century as well as one of the best cinema experiences one could ever encounter."

","As a QT fan I have to say that I am disappointed. I was just telling some friends that QT has not had a bad film, though some do not think Jackie Brown was up to snuff. This is just underwhelming from start to finish. I found the writing sooooo very boring and with the exception of Walter Goggins and Sam Jackson, I can't say anyone was vaguely interesting. The story SUCKED. The opening sequence (ode to Sergio Leone???) was terribly long and boring. I didn't really mind the excessive use of the N word, (yes I'm black and the word doesn't really bother me) because he's done it before (Django) but this go round it simply wasn't funny. The other thing that I found unnecessary was the re-telling of what happened prior to the crew arriving at the cabin...at the tale end of the movie. What did it add? NOTHING! It was a lame attempt at God knows what. It's been done to death, put it at the start.<br/><br/>I don't know, I thought it was bad and 4 may be generous."
"drael64","4","34","79","21 December 2015"," Let down by Tarantino's childishness
","It might be reasonably obvious to some that Tarantino kind of wants to be black. And that he has a 14 year old boys fixation with crude jokes, splatter horror. It may also be obvious to some that he takes some joy in sadism, the pain of others.<br/><br/>Basically all of that plays into this film as with all his recents, which sadly suffers for it. What we have in the film is a great set- up, a well conceived plot, some reasonably competent acting of the, as usual comic bookish characters and excellent soundtracking.<br/><br/>The whole thing would hang pretty well - indeed even be a film classic, except that the movie is mired by T's heavy fixation with racism, his complete anachronistic approach to language and characters, juvenile humour, splatter effects without art, realism, or humour, and the ""for a time seemingly absent"" sadism that characterized his recent revenge porn, which returns briefly also in this movie. <br/><br/>I do wonder what he would be like if he were black - probably less fixated with self-depreciating his own race, and characterizing black characters in a cartoonish and vaguely offensive manner. I also wonder what it would be like if he had ever shot a gun, or been in a fight, rather than gained all his knowledge of violence, and human anatomy from unrealistic movies. I mean it's not clear that he intends any realism at all, his movies are comic bookish, but it seems sad for someone so fixated on violence, to have never done it, like a virgin writing ten movies about orgies (and getting everything a little wrong because of it). <br/><br/>I wonder if he will ever do a movie that doesn't have what has become a dull and silly fashion, fixate on low impact splatter/violence. It's not quite ridiculous or interesting enough to laugh, unlike pulp fiction or evil dead, its tired and played out, and lacks the art of manga, or kill bill. No real drama either. It's kind of like. Oh there's T again, I wonder when he will hit puberty, or at least give this shlock any emotional impact. <br/><br/>I keep hoping for the character and story compelling strength of Kill Bill or Jackie Brown, but I fear those qualities may have been imbued entirely by the genre's and movies he was plagurizing. <br/><br/>In summary, this film unlike Django etc, does actually have some redeeming features. Features that could even be considered great. But Tarantino's childishness really interferes heavily. The violence is not funny or truly silly like deathproof or pulp fiction. It's not gritty or realistic or artful. The dialogue is not funny. It's like that charm that all of us thought tarintino had was borrowed, a great imitator, that has yet to show any sign of maturing as a film maker."

Bad Dialogue, boring plot, grossly over-violent (I'm not against violence but this is ridiculous), pointless movie, with no moral or meaning to the story (wait a minute, that's usually what QT does).<br/><br/>If you want to watch Sam Jackson rant and rave for about 2+ hours acting like he's some kinda bad-ass, then this is your movie. I like SJ in a lot of his other flicks but this one will not be one for his resume. Its a movie about nothing in particular, no cinematography, no plot with any substance and boring as hell. I was so bored, i started texting in the theater waiting for the real action to begin,...and i waited for 2hrs before i walked. Nothing happened: unless you call watching someone get their head blown off real drama and action; i personally am not into pointless horror movies which is more of what this was, but i wouldn't even get it that much credit (Halloween was much better than this).

"jarret-f-kerr","3","14","28","21 January 2016"," Certainly Hateful
","*not any spoilers but still covering my butt to be safe*<br/><br/>Huge Tarantino fan. Have always loved his work. As a writer/actor, he's been an influence on my own work, as I know he has been for many others. However, after this film, I do find myself questioning that influence. Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill - all fantastic films in my opinion. For me, my disillusionment with Tarantino started around Death Proof. Kurt Russel was a hoot and the climactic care chase was appropriately engaging, but the rest of the film just dragged. This downward trend has only grown worse with subsequent films. Inglorious Basterds was three brilliant, classic scenes trapped in a lesser film. Django was perhaps one. Hateful Eight? Honestly, there's not much too say that hasn't already been said. <br/><br/>Every scene is a clunker. The dialogue is exhausting and not particularly interesting. Just folks jawing on and on about things that happened in the past or notorious acts committed by other characters. The violence (when it finally does come) is over the top and mean spirited, unleashing itself in geysers of viscous, kool-aid colored viscera. The N-word use is unrelenting and pulls you out of the movie. The movie by the way - it's long, it's way too long. Not that I mind a long film, but it needs to be a better story than this to hold my attention for three sadistic hours. The setting grows old. Every character is unlikeable (I guess what should I expect from a movie called The Hateful Eight?) I suppose Sam Jackson is likable, but he's still a nihilistic, cruel murderer. His performance also feels wayyyyy too modern. Walton Goggins seems like he's in another movie. Kurt Russel does a great John Wayne, but unfortunately doesn't get to be the bad mother we all wanted to see. Demian Birchir is a Looney-tunes style caricature of a Mexican. Jennifer Jason Leigh is essentially a snarling demon, which she does incredibly well, but is equally one note and abrasive. Michael Madsen is barely given anything to do. Bruce Dern is terribly wasted as well. Tim Roth isgood, I guess? I didn't listen to anything he particularly said, but he was there. Zoe Bell shows up in a flashback and manages to deliver in roughly five minutes of screen time the most cloyingly over the top and annoying performance in recent memory. <br/><br/>The good? Is there any? Well, yes. The score is haunting and instantly iconic. The costumes are rich and unique. I couldn't help but feel that every character seemed like a certain type of animal based entirely off of their costumes. Owl, raccoon, bear, crow, bison. That was interesting. That's about all the good. I truly can't recommend this to anyone, not even a Tarantino fan. The guy has became too obsessed with his own ""voice"". Quite Literally. At one point he even begins to narrate the proceedings for you. Why? Because why the heck not? Which is precisely what Tarantino seemed to decide when he wrote this. I doubt that Tarantino will ever read this inconsequential review from one miffed fan, or any of these, or that they would have any bearing on his future work, but if he does, I hope he'll see that the consensus seems to be he needs to reign it in a little bit. I know he has threatened to retire after ten films. I truly hope that isn't the case. I'll always be interested in what he comes out with next. His earlier work has certainly earned him the right to a film lover's attention. But if he makes another three hour film like this one."
"MrMowji","5","8","14","28 October 2017"," Another overrated movie from another overrated Hollywood director
","Hollywood is filled with overrated directors and actors. They do the same thing over and over again and still gets praised. To mention some, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and here, Tarantino. If you saw at least three of his movies you easily understand that he's the master of dialogues and bloody scenes, and that's it. His works don't have story as you expect. They're just filled with gun shots, bloods and long conversations. Pulp Fiction, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds , and this title follow this rule. Django was somehow different. It had a story, even though it was not good and had lots of holes. I'm wondering whether Tarantino is going to make any different work, for example gun shots in Mars! We know that there will be gunshots, we know who will play in it somehow, we really don't need to know the plot because there isn't, but we know that there is lots of conversations.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight isn't anything else. It's about 170 minutes; too much. Its story isn't novel. It doesn't have brilliance. I don't know if actors really have those accents or they were just pretending, but it was annoying. At some points I felt they're playing in a theater or a studio. There are characters that are not necessary and don't add anything to the plot.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Samuel Jackson, cinematography and blood scenes as usual. Some conversations wasn't that annoying. I find it better than Pulp Fiction and Death Proof. I couldn't enlist it in my Worst/Best lists. But it's in my Overrated list. You can watch and enjoy it. But it's not a masterpiece. It will be forgotten easily."

I can't see anything going anywhere: turtle-slow pacing with meaningless lines spoken by actors and actresses, all predictable and boring. Definitely a huge disappointment of Tarantino. Don't go and watch it unless you want to spend nearly three hours to kill time. I just wish honest trailer would make a video of this film to tell someone who thinks watching the Hatefull Eight would be any good idea. Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance was the only reason that kept me till finished. Seriously I have to admit that her voice was just the right choice for the character, Daisy."
"bigmystery23","5","36","85","21 December 2015"," Great presentation. Average movie.
","I'm not going to go too in depth on this review, just point out the pros and cons of the film as simply as I can.<br/><br/>What largely bothered me about this bombastically crafted 3 hour western is that it never felt like a true Tarantino movie. When you look at his filmography, you can see such innovation and creativity in his filmmaking. But here....it's like he recycled his own work and compiled it up to make this movie (aka Django Unchained meets Reservoir Dogs meets Kill Bill Volume II). The dialogue is never as witty as it should be. The plot is a little too over the top for how simple it really is (I saw the end coming the moment the characters step into the cabin). There are only brief moments of Tarantino's violent style (a huge let down compared to Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained). And the N-word is far too gratuitous. Perhaps there's a deeper meaning behind this film, but I honestly did not see it if it was there. <br/><br/>On a good note, Jennifer Jason Leigh is incredible as Daisy and definitely the stand out. The score is undeniably riveting and silly at the same time. The cinematography is gorgeous. The artistic outcome of the film is unique and dazzling. <br/><br/>I guess that's what makes this movie worth seeing: the experience. Tarantino took so much time and effort to present his film in the best possible manner, which is the case (no IMAX experience can beat 70MM film being projected in Panavision). It is great to be able to go back in time and experience new cinema as if you were in old Hollywood. It's truly a glamorous experience."

I don't expect all books or movies to only express my views or thoughts, I actually want more from them than that. So I was glad to see something from the world of entertainment that wasn't cookie cutter writing and directing. Mr. Tarantino did not let us down loved the symbolism and the harsh environment of the blizzard. Glad he did not shelve it. What it did do was work from a plot with intense characterizations of strong people with some twists along the way. Was there room for improvement? Isn't there always?"
"mistoppi","10","23","51","13 January 2016"," A masterpiece - Tarantino never lets you down
","If there is one director who never lets you down, it's Tarantino. His newest film, The Hateful Eight is an excellent thriller with great story, cinematography and music - but who would expect any less? Right from the start The Hateful Eight captures the viewer, even though it has its slow pace.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a very skillful writer. His characters are real, and not just some plain cardboard characters to fill out the blanks between the story. His dialogue is natural and amazing. The story of The Hateful Eight is simple when it's explained shortly, but it has many layers, just like most of his movies. And just like most of his movies, the events aren't in chronological order, but important pieces from before are revealed when needed. The thrill of the story is well built, and the violent action scenes are balanced with slow, calm scenes. <br/><br/>I am glad to see Tarantino doesn't rely on mindless 3D technology to make a mediocre film look better. Many films that don't need 3D use it anyway. The Hateful Eight does look good though - it looks amazing. Every shot has whatever they need, the colours and details are astonishing. <br/><br/>Tarantino's films always have the most amazing soundtracks. The soundtrack of The Hateful Eight has several amazing pieces that shouldn't work with the movie, but they do, and they do so beautifully. One this kind of track is Apple Blossom by The White Stripes. Also L'Ultima Diligenza Di Red Rock by Ennio Morricone - and all the variants played throughout the film - is haunting. It reminds of the beginning of The Shining, except this is way better. That track also seems out of place, because it would suit some classic yet indie horror movie because of the sinister vibes it gives. But it is perfect for this film.<br/><br/>I think I loved every detail of this film. Of course there are slurs thrown around all the time, but it gives the certain effect to the characters: they are far from perfect. I don't think there was one character here that was completely good and pure. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a masterpiece. The rhythm is good, the film is balanced and it's violent in almost a funny way. This is definitely a film I will see in the cinemas again, because the big screen surely shows The Hateful Eight in its full potential."

They make an uneasy truce until they find another, identical character who promises more uneasiness. Then they get to a coach station where more identical characters pile on. Then none of these characters changes in any way, but they explode in the extremely predictable way that has been made obvious since the first scene. The end.<br/><br/>Please tell me what is it that i am missing. Is it the scene where Samuel L Jackson narrates how he got a white man to blow him? Is that what you consider ""badass"" and interesting filmmaking?<br/><br/>If it is, then go watch this masterpiece, you will love it. If instead you prefer a script with an actual story arc, then i suggest you go back to Pulp Fiction, because this film is no better than<br/><br/>my final vote - 6/10, not worth the money of a ticket."

","I've never felt the need to write a review of a movie before, but having been a fan of QT's previous movies, and seeing the rating given to it, I feel the need to warn fellow movie goers to pack something else to do whilst viewing this title.<br/><br/>I don't write this to discredit it completely, it has a certain type of charm to it, the character's are well fleshed out, by the end of the movie you have a good sense about each one of them, and could probably recite most of their back-story.<br/><br/>Almost completely unnecessarily, being the key caveat I want to stress here, there was, for example a scene *SPOILERS* which spends about 10-20 seconds showing an extremely mundane task being performed in the snow, whereupon 2 characters put down posts to string a line between the house and the outhouse */SPOILERS* The plot moves so painfully slowly, I found myself wanting to walk out halfway through, suddenly a bathroom break isn't such a bad thing, as it causes you to get a few minutes of your life back. <br/><br/>The film could have been about an hour, hour and a half shorter and still sent the same message.<br/><br/>I'm not an action junkie, or adrenaline freak, I can appreciate a shows good pacing. So do not take my opinion here as without due merit and consideration, a piece of theater can get slow in my mind, so long as it sufficiently justifies the need for it.<br/><br/>This did not.<br/><br/>I was feeling sleepy before watching it, and I was damn sure ready for bed afterward."

","I've never been a fan of his use of gratuitous violence- but I will always go to see Tarantino's films because they are unique. There were some elements of the 'western' genre that I would have enjoyed seeing more of - but what it tried to achieve, I think it did brilliantly well. This is not a film for anyone who has a short attention span or needs instant gratification. It requires patience to go along for the ride and to wait for the plot to unfold. What I was most impressed by were the in-depth, rich characterisations and there were some superb performances. I did not find that the run-time of the film was too long, nor was I offended by the portrayal of any of the characters or the language they used. Although (love it or hate it) Tarantino's humour frequently refers (both subtly and not so subtly) to the present day, it needs to be taken in the context of when and where the film is set. As for the violence - expect the 'usual', but if you don't let it detract from the rest of the film, you will enjoy it as a very good piece of cinema and the quality of both the cast and the writer/director shines through. There are also some real 'laugh out loud' moments which I wasn't expecting!"
"CineasteWest","6","17","36","31 December 2015"," Eight down, two to go. Do something!
","I just got back from seeing ""The Hateful Eight"" and my head is spinning because it's such a weird movie I'm not sure if it's somewhat good or exceedinly awful. What's sad is that it starts off wonderfully -- I felt myself getting excited by the prospect of Tarantino returning to form for about a half hour -- then keeps getting sillier and sillier until it's nothing but a comedy -- and the comedy is so unsubtle, it might have been made by Mel Brooks or Jerry Lewis on acid. <br/><br/>What's funny is the much touted, rich color of the Panavision stock and the fake cabin interior of ""Minnies Haberdashery (not a hat in sight)"" makes the film look like the over-saturated movies from the sixties like ""Paint Your Wagon"" which always looked vaguely fake to me -- a plastic universe cobbled together on a back lot and lit with huge overhead arc lights. Add big splashes of red blood and it started to look like the garish color of some the 60s Disney films, so there was this bizarre set of associations going through my head.<br/><br/>When the finale of the film turns to grand guignol slapstick in these hyper-pumped colors, I felt like I was having a flashback to a bad 60s Dick van Dyke comedy like ""Fitzwilly"" or ""Cold Turkey,"" and, honestly, I left the theater stunned by the near absurdity of it all. It's as if someone unearthed an awful 60s comedy (Sergio Leone? Hah? That's a laugh) that was buried in the vaults by the studios.<br/><br/>This ""love letter to the cinema"" is really a love letter to himself, as Tarantino riffs off elements of his own movies like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and throws in some steals from Paul Thomas Anderson (it almost sounds like Anderson doing the narration. Narration? Where the $%^& did that come from? Wow, talk about the weakest attempt I've ever seen to clue an audience when some sloppy structuring fails the film.) <br/><br/>The dialogue is Tarantino-lite, like a second-rate writer trying to imitate him (Samuel Jackson's goading of Bruce Dern is probably the worst monologue Tarantino has written) and the story is Agatha Christie with a lobotomy. There are some good performances (Kurt Russell is great as John Wayne) and some awful ones (Tim Roth at his over-the- top worst) but the film itself unravels like a spoonful of spaghetti Western. And this isn't a spaghetti Western, it's a pizza and beer comedy. I'm sure it will be a big hit at frat houses across America. <br/><br/>I'm amazed how some people (known critics, as well) even venture to justify the racial undercurrent as social commentary. Tarantino has never written symbolically or allegorically. He writes character, and that's that. ""The Hateful Eight"" is a ""political statement"" in the same way that ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is an indictment of contemporary religion. Please.<br/><br/>How do I sum this movie up in one word? Well, the one that comes to the top of my head right now is: ""Goofy."" Maybe those big Panavision camera got to Tarantino because he subconsciously started to think he was making a bloody version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""<br/><br/>I need to have a drink. At this rate, I have to say ""thank god there's only two more to go."""

The dialogue, plot, and acting performances were all missing a level of his style of cleverness. Cleverness is replaced with explainable logic and reason due to previous events in the back-story.

","Settling down to sit through Quentin Tarantino's eight film, The Hateful Eight, I was both excited and a little cautious. Excited because Tarantino has made some of my favourite films yet cautious because The Hateful Eight had a three hour runtime and there was a chance it could become a little self-indulgent.<br/><br/>Tarantino has always been a bit of an acquired taste and he certainly has his critics, particularly of his last few efforts however, with The Hateful Eight, Tarantino has struck gold again. It's a tense game of Cluedo that, much like any Tarantino film, brings character and dialogue to the fore.<br/><br/>John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter known as ""The Hangman"" who, with his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is on his way to Red Rock to hand her in and watch her hang. With a heavy blizzard on their tail, they pick up two stragglers in Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), also on their way to Red Rock.<br/><br/>The plan is to make a stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge, and wait for the blizzard to blow over. What wasn't on the cards though was Minnie's being occupied by four strangers; Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), one of them not being who he says he is.<br/><br/>Being a Tarantino film, you should know to expect long drawn out scenes of dialogue and the occasional explosion of violence. Both are very apparent from the film's opening scene and from that very moment, Tarantino holds you in a vice like grip and keeps you guessing at who's who until the final few moments of the film.<br/><br/>It's the quality of writing again from Tarantino that helps make The Hateful Eight such an engrossing experience. His words and exchanges between the characters are so intricately written that switching off could lead to missing out on something pivotal to the film's plot. With The Hateful Eight mainly taking place in one location, it has to be spot on and thankfully it is. Much like Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, this is a dialogue driven film where each of the backstories will leave you guessing just as much as John Ruth and Marquis Warren.<br/><br/>It's clear that Tarantino writes his films for certain actors and he is joined by a number of frequent collaborators such as Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Every member of the cast brings their own qualities to their respective characters and it makes for such great viewing when they're all firing each other like this.<br/><br/>I loved pretty much all of the performances but for me the stand-outs were Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. Jackson performs the words of Tarantino like no other, Leigh doesn't have much to say in comparison yet she shines when she does get a word in and uses facial expressions often to comedic effect, and then there is Walton Goggins. Goggins had a bit part in Django Unchained and has been doing the rounds on television for a while but in The Hateful Eight, he gets his moment in the limelight and he sure as hell makes the most of it. I really enjoyed the performance of Channing Tatum too in his small role that I won't go too much into right now.<br/><br/>I had heard that this was a violent film after its release across the pond on Christmas Day and yes, when it gets violent it really is quite violent however, like both Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, it seems more like a cartoon when the violence begins than in his previous films such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. All the proceedings are accompanied by an original score from the legendary Ennio Morricone, his first complete Western score in 40 years.<br/><br/>It may not be to everyone's taste and I don't quite know yet where it fits in my ranking of Tarantino films but The Hateful Eight is one hell of a treat in the first week of the new year. Don't let the runtime put you off as it simply flies by."
"Parks","3","14","29","22 January 2016"," Another Case of Tarantino Bloat
","Just as with ""Inglorious Basterds"" I can't help but be frustrated by ""The Hateful Eight"". It's like I can almost see a good 90 minute film in here, struggling to get out. Unfortunately, it's buried under a 3 hour bloatfest.<br/><br/>The story, of a bounty hunter trapped in a cabin with his $10,000 dollar captive (brilliantly played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) has some promise. Despite some claims, it is not really a whodunnit in the sense that there is no way of figuring out who's doing what. It's more of a character piece, allowing the actors to explore attitudes in America following the cataclysm of the Civil War.<br/><br/>And it's here where the movie shines as Tarantino rips the scab off the problem with race relations in the US from slavery to Black Lives Matter and makes us look at it. However, it's not exactly succinct - or even coherent. It's just grim, mean-spirited rhetoric that goes on and on and on long past the time when the point was made.<br/><br/>The actors are good, the direction is excellent but oh dear god that script needs a pair of shears taking to it. Why brevity continues to elude Tarantino is a mystery to me as his first, best movie came in at a brisk 100 minutes. He really needs to work on a low budget again."

","Eight strangers, caught in the middle of a blizzard must share a cabin, time, stew and coffee. Everything oppose them, the one thing they got in common is that you can tell the actors had fun playing them, and you can build some of the best acting out of fun.<br/><br/>Meeting in the stagecoach, you have John Ruth,a paranoid bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) handcuffed with a female black-eyed criminal, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) taken to Red Rock to be hanged. And you have a black Union veteran, Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who also happens to be a bounty hunter with three dead men to carry to Red Rock, too much for his horse, rest in peace. The friendly two meet a Lost-Causer named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who happens to be the future Sheriff of Red Rock and has good reasons to see the Yankee with a black eye (lousy pun, sorry).<br/><br/>In the stagecoach stopover, you have Oswaldo Mobray, a suave Englishman (Tim Roth) who happens to be Red Rock's future executioner, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a cowboy who's going to visit his mother although his face screams ""desperado"" more than ""mama's boy"", General Smithers (Bruce Dern), a Confederate veteran with a grumpy menacing look and ""Bob"", a Mexican worker (Damien Bashir) who took the place of the seemingly absent owners, much to Warren's surprise, as he's used to stop at Minnie's famous 'Haberdashery'. So, the least thing that can be said when all the characters are exposed, is that there are too many coincidences to suspend our disbelief, and maybe the two bounty hunters have good reasons to be suspicious.<br/><br/>What follow is a fantastic behind-closed-doors (with nailed boards) mystery drama with as much anger, deceptions, lies and ugliness as in ""12 Angry Men"", ""Sleuth"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" combined, it even has the demographic relevance of Lumet's movie as the whole cast incarnates the entire post-Civil War nation in microcosm. What a great movie finally.<br/><br/>I say ""finally"" because, in all honesty, when I learned that Tarantino was making another Western, with a title à la ""Dirty Dozen"" and ""Magnificent Seven"", I thought it would be another 60's-70's B-movie's remake with some score-recycling and revenge-fantasy plot, that would again appeal on the basis that the director-can-never-go-wrong.<br/><br/>But this time, he didn't, and I don't even know where to start, but I'll try to make it through eight points, after all, eight is the fetish-number and it's like Quentin Tarantino's ""8½"" with all the references made to his previous work, well, the film feels like Tarantino, BACK TO HIS ROOTS and that's for the first strength.<br/><br/>2/ THE SLOW PACING isn't just the usual quiet-before-storm stuff, the film leaves room (literally) for a few seemingly-friendly exchanges that feel like exposition (well they are) but they put you at ease, you know it will pay-off, in a bloody way, but you actually enjoy the long conversations the film features independently from the plot.<br/><br/>3/ TWO STAND-OUT PERFORMANCES: despite the slow placing, there are the usual angry tirades and eloquent storytelling but the quieter moments belong to some of the greatest actors' interactions Tarantino ever directed and on that level, Jennifer Jason Leigh, deservedly Oscar-nominated, and Walton Goggins really stole the show, which is saying a lot.<br/><br/>4/ UNRELIABILITY: basically, you don't know who's the good or bad guy. Think about it, all the previous films had clearly established villains (although charismatic) and heroes (although flawed). ""The Hateful Eight"" strikes by the fact that you never quite know whom to trust, or to believe. Is the story a lie? Is the letter a fake? Is Minnie absent? We're back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" claustrophobic entrapment enhanced by that ugly blizzard going outside as a dark comedy running gag.<br/><br/>5/ VULNERABILITY: There's nothing, no status, no strength, that makes anyone immune to bullets. The violence strikes everyone in its blindest, ugliest and most surprising way, and it's precisely because Tarantino puts some slow and talky moments in the right places that the outbursts of violence really take you off-guard and you never really see them coming, while in his previous movies, where it was all about the good guy taking his revenge, we had a sort of cinematic instinct telling us when it was going to get ugly.<br/><br/>6/ INTELLIGENT SUBVERSION: the film was panned as misogynistic. I think the treatment Domergue got spoke loud statements about the danger she incarnated and that 'embiggened' her aura more than anything. No offense to the Girl-Power trend that affected the action genre with ""Star Wars"" and ""Mad Max"" but I found the two most interesting portrayals of female protagonists in movies this yeas were Jennifer Jason Leigh as Domergue, and Emily Blunt in ""Sicario"", and both happened to be violent yet stylishly realistic and pervert movies.<br/><br/>7/ A BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY <br/><br/>8/ IL MAESTRO: an original score by Ennio Morricone, which shows that, for once, Tarantino took his material more maturely and seriously than usual, though some bits were originally made (but not used) for Carpenter's ""The Thing"", one of the movies that inspired Tarantino, and you can tell, there's something personal in this movie, as it really feels 'different'.<br/><br/>But this difference didn't meet the same acclaim than ""Basterds"" or ""Django"" and the screenplay wasn't even Oscar-nominated. It seems like people are more openly critical toward ""The Hateful Eight"" than any other Tarantino movie, as if all of a sudden, the characters were too mean-spirited, and violence too much to handle, yet it was cool when it was against Nazis and slavers.<br/><br/>For once that Tarantino doesn't go over a simplistic and intelligence-insulting good vs. evil antagonism, he becomes the bad guy, like they say, Nature hates emptiness. Well for ""The Hateful Eight"", I give the 'bad guy' a heartfelt Ten."

"ArtemShishkin","9","20","45","21 February 2016"," The eighth film about eight wretches
","""Eight"" - a western, combining elements of drama, comedy and detective. The director of this picture is a man who needs no introduction - Quentin Tarantino. Each of his film - an event in the world of cinema.<br/><br/>Because of his talent as a scenarist, he twisted a simple story that its simplicity does not prevent you to have fun. Tarantino has always excellent scenarios and ""Eight"" is no exception. Duration of film is three hours and almost all of this time action unfolds in one large room, but the film does not look tired. Sometimes it seems that Tarantino was inspired by such films as "" Dial M for Murder»"" by Alfred Hitchcock and ""Panic Room"" by David Fincher, these movie is also conversational, and filmed in one indoors, but they are very interesting to watch. Tarantino is the king of dialogue, he is one of the few today who can transform an empty chatter into interesting squabbles between the characters that grab more abruptly of any action film. Characters is also very bright and memorable. They rapidly expanded in the course of the film, so you will change the attitude to almost every one of them. But they do not have a particular depth. Because characters are many and everyone is given an equal amount of screen time. Tarantino to the smallest detail described the fleeting attitude of the characters inside haberdashery, but to represent them outside of it very difficult. Their backstory did not have enough time and space, so that about life each one we can judge from the fragmentary information from the dialogues. The script came not perfect, but I was satisfied. Events in the film is so unpredictable that regularly receives gap pattern, enjoying spectacular dialogues, and subtle situational humor was diluted tensed to the limit atmosphere.<br/><br/>As for installation, I liked it in general, but it has its own peculiarities. The film is literally a chamber, scale and wealth of locations is not here, but the room itself is where the action occurs, is very detailed. Brand Tarantino's violence in the film is present, but it also has been minimized. But the music, as always, at height, which was written by a talented Ennio Morricone. The film is very reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"", where the main action takes place in an enclosed space and the main stake was made on the dialogue and the relationship the characters. ""Eight"" is essentially a theatrical production and haberdashery shop is a stage beyond which there is absolutely nothing, but to break away from this play is still impossible, of course, there is a great merit of the actors. Cast in Tarantino movies is a real balm for the soul and the eyes of any movie lover. Michael Madsen is looks briskly. Samuel L. Jackson never fails to fascinate. Kurt Russell is slightly surprised, unusual to see him in such a brutal role, but here he looks like a glove. Jennifer Jason Leigh, perhaps, played a most interesting role. Tim Roth left mixed feelings, on the one hand, he played better than Jackson and Russell, but on the other I have visited many times the feeling that in its place should be Christoph Waltz. But most of all I was impressed by Walton Goggins himself and his character. The whole movie he is so consistent and so cool reveals at the end, that at some point even eclipsed Jackson. In general, in the acting of ""Eight"" - this is the second powerful force after the script, the quality of which is not subject to any doubt.<br/><br/>Overall was excellent dialogue unpredictable film. Yes, sometimes it seems that it is too theatrical, but on the background of all - it is a strong Western, which is worth a look all fans of the genre, film lovers and fans of Tarantino."

The premise of a handful of strangers being snowed in at a location and at least one of them is a murderous crook has already been done in Western shows from the 1970s . If I remember correctly an episode of ALIAS SMITH AND JONES did something similar but an episode of that show lasted 50 minutes not three hours as seen here <br/><br/>Make no mistake this is where the film falls down - it's far too long by at least a hour and the lack of brevity damages the movie greatly . Some people have commentated on THE HATEFUL EIGHT being a medley mega-mix of the director's previous works and they're right . Some plot turns owe a massive amount to RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION but perhaps worst of all it also includes the flaws of IB where some scenes seem to go on forever in a totally self indulgent manner and the story doesn't really get going until halfway through its running time <br/><br/>One positive way to look upon this is that if you've enjoyed most of Tarantino's previous work then you'll enjoy this one .

","Quentin Tarantino has made a career paying homage to cult movies, often casting little known or retired/forgotten actors. Having focused on revenge with ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", he shifts his focus with ""The Hateful Eight"". The setting here is a haberdashery in the snowed-in mountains of Wyoming some time after the Civil War. A group of morally ambiguous people converge on the haberdashery, but all is not what it seems.<br/><br/>Tarantino continues his tradition of snappy, realistic dialogue, and over-the-top violence. To be certain, most of the characters in ""The Hateful Eight"" are smooth-talkers. Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson finally gets a lead role as a bounty hunter with extra insight into the haberdashery (and yes, Jackson does use the word that he pretty much always has to use in movies).<br/><br/>The story has to get seen in the context of the modern United States. Much of the story centers on the tension amongst the characters, in particular as it relates to race. Killings of unarmed black men continue to this day, and Tarantino even attended a rally against police brutality in New York. It's as though this octet represents the worst elements of the United States.<br/><br/>I liked the movie. Even if you don't know any of the references, you gotta love the characters played by Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and James Parks. All are scoundrels in one way or another, but they're determined to ride out this blizzard no matter what (and I do mean no matter what). I hope that it receives some Oscar nods."

I am also more grateful for my front door, warmth, and all of the day to day things we tend to take for granted. I almost fell asleep before half way in. I figured the action and gore would hit eventually, but it was not especially satisfying compared to his previous films. Samuel Jackson lost his mystique after doing credit-card commercials and barely pulls off his role. The talent of Walton Goggins is the only thing that glues this film together enough where I did not walk out before it ended. After Grindhouse, I figured we've seen the last of Kurt Russell in a Tarantino flick, and was not impressed with him here. I'll give it kudos for this being a ""one location"" film, and if it wasn't a Tarantino film I'd be a bit more impressed, but obviously expectations are high.

","A lot of people were excited about Quentin Tarantino's new film The Hateful Eight. There's been a lot of gossip around this film, partly due to the script leaking online. Tarantino was furious and made threats about not making the film at all. Considering his two latest films, Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds' tendencies to violence and blood, I knew what to expect. With a great star cast with names like, Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern, I expected good acting.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is an interesting western with elements of an Agatha Christie crime drama. A lot of different characters together in one small space makes for an exciting ending. I was genuinely interested at first to see how Tarantino would tie it all together. But, something happened about halfway through the film. Tarantino changed tracks and started pulling the film away in different directions. A bad narrative voice, long scenes of the past explaining things we already knew and strange character focus, took up too much space. It feels as if Tarantino has lost what ones made him so great to begin with in films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The ability to trust his audience and not proclaim us dumb by over clarify things and messages.<br/><br/>The Tarantino I got to know as a young cineaste, made films like Pulp Fiction and completely blew my mind. Where is he now? Ever since the Kill Bill films, it feels like he is more interested in violence, blood and subtle one-liners. Still, the thing that Tarantino really did good in The Hateful Eight is the craft of the film itself. The original music by the legendary Ennio Morricone is brilliant and the incredibly beautiful cinematography, especially the snowy climate at the beginning of the film is breathtaking. Also, the acting didn't disappoint. As a whole The Hateful Eight is an OK film but I can't help feel that it could have been much better if Tarantino just would have trusted us as he ones did.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
"bob-the-movie-man","7","15","34","14 January 2016"," Gore aplenty spoils a tense Hitchcokian tale
","I always approach a Quentin Tarantino film with a degree of nervous excitement. The nerves arise since the levels of gratuitous violence in his films is about 2 notches above the level I personally find comfortable. The excitement comes from the fact that the guy is an undisputed genius of storytelling through film.<br/><br/>The Hateful 8, Tarantino's 8th film, is a case in point. Even the opening titles are gripping: Ennio Morricone's insistent and stressful theme just sends a shiver of expectation through you.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell plays John Ruth - a Boba Fett of the old West - famous for always winning his bounty by bringing in his prizes alive for the hangman rather than dead as offered. This time it's the murderous Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) chained to his wrist, heading in a stagecoach to her 'final destination' in Red Rock. Also taking his prizes to Red Rock (in a less healthy state) is fellow bounty hunter Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson). But Red Rock is a good distance away and a blizzard has other ideas. In the middle of nowhere, the group are snowed in at ""Minnie's haberdashery""with an assortment of others including Tim Roth (with an appropriate job) and Bruce Dern (as a former confederate war hero). Are they all who they seem to be? (That's a rhetorical question - you can guess the answer).<br/><br/>I just loved the start of this film. The claustrophobic nature of the stagecoach scenes (a vehicle fitted with the most amazingly smooth suspension for the age!) and the set-up of the lead characters were somewhat reminiscent of John Ford's classic ""Stagecoach"" (but with added violence). There are some glorious shots (an attaboy to Tarantino's regular cinematographer Robert Richardson) of the Colorado landscapes, and Tarantino clearly got a new drone for Christmas: the camera skims through the tree-tops as the stagecoach proceeds through the snowy landscape. A close up of the galloping horses to another piece of classic Morricone music is just breathtaking.<br/><br/>Once we arrive at Minnie's, the tone changes, more akin to classic Hitchcock's like ""Rope"" or ""Rear Window"" and this segment is equally gripping. With dramatic cut-aways and clever editing, the tension builds and you are constantly waiting for the wave to break.<br/><br/>What emerges is just how unpleasant all of the 8 protagonists really are. It takes some of the other cast (the list is not limited to eight) acting 'normally' to make you realize just how inured to the violence and hate you have become.<br/><br/>When the proverbial brown stuff does hit the fan, it hits it big style with gore a-plenty. While the whole thing is done with significant style and Tarantino's usual brand of jet-black humor, in my view it goes way over the top. There are some clips I would wish to ""un-see"", and the film is poorer as a result. It would be fascinating for Tarantino to film a more accessible ""PG"" version of the film, that builds on the mystery and tension of the story rather than his usual crutch of shock factor violence.<br/><br/>The standout performances for me were from Russell and Jason-Leigh, the latter spitting blood, teeth and acidic comments spectacularly. (As an aside of movie trivia, Jason-Leigh is the daughter of Vic Morrow, the marvelous character actor who was so tragically killed by a helicopter during the filming of ""The Twilight Zone"" movie. Her dad would be proud of her here).<br/><br/>The most annoying performance for me comes from Roth, with a highly affected English accent that grates enormously.<br/><br/>If you like big, bold, entertaining yet astonishingly violent spectacles then this is for you. If you are high on the ""Love Actually"" scale, this is one you might like to miss. By the way, if you do go i recommend woolly socks and a jumper - it might not be cold in the cinema, but after getting on for 3 hours of this film with all that snow, you WILL start to feel the cold.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

","I am a big Tarantino fan and loved most of his movies so I anticipated this would be the same. I was surprised and disappointed. The first hour and a half was just plain boring. The actor performance was questionable given the script they had to work with and Samuel Jackson lead the pack on a decent job. I completely blame the script.<br/><br/>My wife nearly dozed off an hour in and that means it was not a normal QT film. The added narrative by Quentin sounded strange and misplaced as well. His normal rushed speak rather than a professional speaker was off of the mark. I listened to interviews with him about the movie and I think he missed the boat this time on what he was trying to accomplish. Wait for cable or DVD IMO because I had free tickets and still felt disappointed. This was no Kill Bill or even From Dusk to Dawn. Not even close.<br/><br/>In summary, the movie reminded me of a bunch of actors sitting around reading their scripts but their hearts were only half in it.<br/><br/>How do some give this a good review? Drugs?"

","This is my first review in almost 7years of using IMDb. I'm really surprised by all the bad reviews people are giving this movie.What's not to like? Simple and fluid plot, good acting, good directing and usual Tarantino visual effects and maybe mediocre cinematography. If you're hating the movie, you should go watch something like avengers. I'm not saying Avengers is a bad movie, but you know what I'm talking about... It's a good movie indeed, if you're a Tarantino fan, you should watch it. If you like movies that happen mostly on a stage, you should also watch it. If you expect to see a western/action movie, this movie is not right for you."

","Don't go into this Quentin Tarantino film and expect it not to be over-the-top bloody. In fact, after the first hour and a half, you think maybe it's not going to be. Guess again. Perhaps Tarantino does this to create suspense during a time in the movie where tension comes merely from his captivating dialogue.<br/><br/>Like a Steinbeck novel, taking several pages to paint the scene and get to know the situation in order to make it live in our heads, The Hateful Eight doesn't rush anything. Some may not like this approach, but it's done in order for us to live in the world that has been created.<br/><br/>The pacing starts off slower than usual, but builds at a consistent pace. Every word that is spoken is positioned very carefully. This is what Tarantino shines at. He doesn't make boring dialogue and he doesn't waste pages. If he makes a three hour movie, it's going to be for a reason.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a western mystery in the style of Reservoir Dogs. Kurt Russell plays a bounty hunter who is bringing his prisoner, Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to the town of Red Rock for her to be hanged. Along the way, he picks up Marquis (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who soon becomes the main protagonist of the film.<br/><br/>Jackson is always at his very best when teamed up with Tarantino--a fact that has been proved time and time again. His tumult matches up perfectly with the director's exploitation style of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Leigh's performance might be this year's best. She does an incredible job, and without saying much, controls the tone of the entire film with her insanely believable machination. You stop and ask yourself if they picked up the actress from the looney bin before filming.<br/><br/>Everything is perfect, from the camera-work to the set pieces to the enthralling musical score. I attended the 70mm Roadshow screening, which is a unique experience in itself, fully equipped with a large program and a 10-minute intermission.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino, you will surely like this movie, but if you're not a fan of his gruesome flair, then be warned that this one is probably his most violent.<br/><br/>It doesn't have quite the same impact as, say, Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained, but it's refreshing to see a neo-Western done so simply, yet not by-the-numbers. It might not be the story you were hoping for following his previous two, but as far as filmmaking goes, The Hateful Eight may be the year's most solid selection.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"
"Ramascreen","5","24","61","21 December 2015"," Very Tarantino
","As a fan of Quentin Tarantino's, I'm genuinely disappointed with his latest film, THE HATEFUL EIGHT. Not that it's not well-made, not that it's not well-written, we all know that nobody writes like Tarantino does, but this is a complete rehash of everything he's ever done. If you've seen Tarantino's previous movies, you've pretty much seen THE HATEFUL EIGHT.<br/><br/>About the 70mm experience, unfortunately the press screening I attended had the screen out of focus and I doubt that what we the press were watching that day was exactly what Quentin Tarantino had wanted for us when he shot this with Ultra Panavision. I'm not an expert on cameras, but it was obvious that it didn't come close because I remember some of the critics were furious during the intermission, rightfully so because the 70mm is supposed to be the film's biggest selling point. Come to think of it, the 70mm is now the film's ONLY selling point to me because it could've been shot in IMAX or 3D or ultra panavision, I personally care more about the story and the characters and THE HATEFUL EIGHT doesn't really offer anything new. That said, I did admire some of the shots that the great cinematographer Robert Richardson took for this film. They make you feel like you're out in the open wide and excruciatingly cold spaces. Much of it also reminds me of Roger Deakins' work on The Coen Bros' western remake, ""True Grit,"" not too long ago.<br/><br/>Starring a few of Tarantino's usual suspects like Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell, plus newbies in the gang like Channing Tatum and Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is set in post-civil war, a stagecoach is struggling through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers are bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner/fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They pick up an African American Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and a self-proclaimed town sheriff, Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) along the way. They seek refuge at a stagecoach stopover called Minnie's Haderbashery where they are greeted by unfamiliar faces. There's something fishy about them, Ruth suspects that one of them may be working with Domergue to help her escape.<br/><br/>Look, I'm not saying that this is an entirely bad movie, I was still entertained by it for the very same reasons why Tarantino movies in general entertain me. THE HATEFUL EIGHT has sharp and long speeches/dialogues that just roll off the actors' tongues proudly. I think every actor would feel blessed for the opportunity to say the lines that Tarantino had written. But as I implied earlier, THE HATEFUL EIGHT has the whodunit mystery ala ""Reservoir Dogs,"" the non-linear timeline ala ""Pulp Fiction,"" the excessive use of N-word ala ""Django Unchained,"" and of course, it also has Tarantino's over the top brutal violence. And it's not really designed or meant to attract new fans either. So if this were to get nominated for best screenplay category, I would very much be surprised by that because we're still fresh from ""Django Unchained"" which did give Tarantino his 2nd Oscar win.<br/><br/>But in any case, just like most of Tarantino's movies, this is also a great opportunity for his actors to really own it and for this one, that goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins, both of whom I think excel the most out of the entire cast. Leigh in particular, despite not having much to say until probably the last couple of hours or so, manages to captivate me. Covered in blood, devilishly angry, there's a commanding force about Leigh so much so that even if you're not on her character's side, you can't help but be in awe.<br/><br/>THE HATEFUL EIGHT is 168 minutes long, it has intermission like back in the old days. If you're planning to watch it via the upcoming roadshow, I highly recommend it, although I'm not sure if the theaters agreeing to this would ultimately get their investment's worth. After all, 70mm film-watching experience hasn't been around since the 60s. Filmmakers everywhere will always try to find the next big thing when it comes to making their films seem more immersive for their audience. The choice is theirs. But if it were up to me, if I was the filmmaker, I'd just hire cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity,"" ""Birdman,"" ""The Revenant"") every single time, he'll get it immersive for ya!"

","While I enjoy some of Tarantino's movies such as Kill Bill I find that the vast majority are over the top. So is this one, while the cinematography is awesome, the dialogue is boring and the concept strange.<br/><br/>Additionally, I can for the life of me not understand his affinity for the usage of the ""N-word"". If Tarantino wants to used it once or twice for effect so be it - but in some dialogues it seems to be almost every other word and then it just gets annoying. I am not sure what he is trying to prove and to whom. It just becomes more about the usage of that word rather than a quality script with essence."

","On the first part of the IMDb page for this movie they have the following: <br/><br/>Anachronisms (9) | Continuity (11) | Errors in geography (2) | Factual errors (5) | Miscellaneous (3) | Plot holes (1) | Revealing mistakes (3) | Spoilers (4)<br/><br/>Except for the spoilers that is a list of basic errors and it speaks towards how bad this movie really is. <br/><br/>Here is my hypothesis as to why Tarantino has put out so many stinkers. At some point Tarantino was praised for the dialogue in his flicks and for sure there were some great back and forth between characters and even some great monologues. This however, is not one of those flicks. <br/><br/>Because of that mindset I believe his movies for the most part now are ego driven, pretentious garbage barges. There is no reason for the movie to be as long as it was and it isn't for any high ideals like not wanting to leave work on the editing floor it is simply this- Tarantino feels his cinematic prowess is so great we are going to love minute after minute of O.B. yelling at the horses, or the horse hooves stepping in to the snow. Or actors stealing glances at each other. I can imagine Tarantino and his lackeys yelling CUT!! and then patting themselves on the back for filming footfalls in the snow or two men struggling against a wind machine to lay out some rope to the outhouse which is where they should have left that horribly painful sequence. Utter pretentious nonsense. <br/><br/>In short, Tarantino got away with wacky dialogue and interesting cinematic displays because in those movies where he received praise they fit and the dialogue for example was part of a good movie. You know I am right- You can forgive the pretentious ""look at me"" cinematic bloviating when the movie is good or great. This movie wasn't and therefore his self congratulatory garbage is unacceptable. The movie is sooo long and there were many times I uttered ""oh for GD sake stoppit!!"" <br/><br/>Anyhow, I didn't like the movie-I don't like that someone like Tarantino putting out movies that the film world adores because they think they are supposed to enjoy it. It was a long movie with a boring premise, you kept waiting for something to happen and most importantly it was a long time to listen to a bunch of late 1880s cowboys using words and overly long sentences in a period where most were just regular men who said regular things with no concept of pretentious look at me directors. <br/><br/>Seriously- utter garbage- even with the over the top cartoonish violence was ridiculous especially the post coffee sequence. It just feels like yeah, its been done, stop making movies that are just revisits of previous recipes. Tarantino will go down as one of those directors that should have stopped after his first few successes. A good John Wayne Western stands the test of time as does a Clint Eastwood movie and even spaghetti Westerns stand up- this won't. Seriously the following is just one of many reasons this movie is garbage go check it out it will show you how lazy it is and how he is spending so much time concentrating on his previous 'done goods' that he failed to do some basic research and editing. <br/><br/>Anachronisms (9)+ Continuity (11) + Errors in geography (2) + Factual errors (5)+ Miscellaneous (3) + Plot holes (1) + Revealing mistakes (3) - Spoilers (4)= big fat zero of a movie."

It's 1 hour too long, lacks a common identity, and is overtly racist to an unnecessary degree. This movie drops the N-bomb repeatedly in order to justify a homosexual, interracial cowboy rape torture scene. It isn't alluded to or suggested, it's the defining moment of the movie. After showing us in graphic detail, he has Samuel Jackson look into the camera and tell the viewers to form the picture of that scene in their minds. He then uses NLP techniques to re-anchor it with viewers using a cleverly framed, pointless narrative right after the scene completes. Tarantino wants you to really get it. No, like, --> Reeeeally <-- get it.<br/><br/>Besides the clear agenda, the movie is substandard, slow and boring. How this movie is rated 8 stars is beyond comprehension and causes me to question the legitemacy of the rating system, especially given the large amount of 1 and 2 star reviews I see.<br/><br/>Either way after this nonsense I've reached the end of my interest Tarantino's work."

","Have you noticed how some people are better suited for a certain age? The teenage jock who was popular with girls looks miserable in middle age, the awkward bookish loner is finally comfortable in an adult skin. Think of Michael Madsen and Mel Gibson as the former. Some people are the best version of themselves early, others late. It's a blessing to be able to transcend self and evolve without qualms so that there's never early or late. <br/><br/>I'm reminded of how immaturely Tarantino has aged every time I see him in interviews and compare with earlier memories. Starting out, he had infectious energy and a boyish charm that bulldozed through formality. He was natural as infant terrible. I'm talking about the person here, but as that factors into the work. Fresh was the word that came to mind to describe both Pulp Fiction and the person who made it. <br/><br/>Now my gut reaction every time I see him is of a churlish, crude 50 year old, bloated in his idea of self-worth, the rock star carelessness of youth now registering as impatient sloppiness. I pick up a sense of combative inadequacy that comes with knowing that the best version of yourself is in your past. As if to make up for it, he's more absorbed with each year with the importance of his own filmic universe. <br/><br/>His lack of growth in a cinematic sense is that he decided he wanted epic scope after a point but never bothered to learn how to use the camera. Leone grafted situational Italian humor only after he had mulled long and hard about the operatic fabric, being a Milanese maestro first and then a Roman joker. Tarantino pressed ahead with just bullish ego, writing, and visual effects. The result, starting with Kill Bill, was these lumbering patchworks of dialogue scenes and separate visual interludes and montages that linked actions. <br/><br/>You will see this on display in very first few minutes of this. A theatric scene of dialogue, and then wholly separate a visual interlude of horses running in slow-motion. The first thirty minutes are colorfully snarled explanations about who each character is one after the other. <br/><br/>But either by consequence or design, he wrote a set-bound story around a few characters this time, and once they hit the cabin, this eliminates most of his weak spots. Now the place imposes limits on how far he can sprawl. Now he doesn't have to be visual more than he was in Reservoir Dogs. This among his late work is the one that most recalls his early days of Dogs and Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>Different characters as unreliable narrators. The whodunit is inconsequential, the thrills come from reinventing characters and story. He is as inflammatory and provocative as ever but a lot of it comes from the swap of stories. A most harrowing scene that rivals Marsellus Wallace at the basement is obviously a story spun to elicit a reaction from the racist general. Offended pundits will be too angry by that point to notice that this Django is later emasculated and has to rely on the Confederate sheriff. <br/><br/>All of the on-screen action is still crude and theatrical. Tarantino doctors viewpoints and has them swapped from the mouths of characters, none of it organic. But I perceive a more honest thing here, structured as it is around storytelling and mediated truth. He even offers a measure of emotional realization by the end; a letter that urges reconciliation in a divided country that he wrote to be able to make his way in a world ruled and bound by stories. It's all in the bittersweet timing of the reading; when he's a broken man who was bushwacked, not a cocky bastard. <br/><br/>But the most marvelous thing in all of this I thought was Jennifer Leigh. Just look at what she does with so few words; it's all body language, face, posture, how she leans in. They're warden and prisoner with Russell but didn't you also get a sense of husband and (abused) wife? That's almost entirely Leigh. She gives a masterclass in embodied acting while everyone else struts like peacocks. <br/><br/>The row about Oscars being white was obfuscation. The tragedy for me is that an actor of her caliber isn't gracing us yearly with works worthy of her. I see that Lynch has nabbed her already for Twin Peaks."

"ellscashncarry","8","11","24","6 March 2016"," Not Tarantino's Finest Work... But If You Like Tarantino, You Should Enjoy The Hateful Eight.
","Well, the 'King of Cool' is back and once again he's created a slick, smart film, which excites all those little nerves that us blokes (and women - no sexism here) find so appealing! Yes there are slick lines, yes there's blood... and yes, as always, there is a shootout... my god, does Tarantino love a shootout!<br/><br/>I don't want to give any spoilers away, and given that we know so little about the film going into it, I fear that saying practically anything will give something away. So in short, The Hateful Eight is about two bounty hunters, heading to Red Rock, Wyoming, to claim their bounties. Not only do they pick up one interesting and suspicious character along the way, but due to a nasty blizzard they are forced to make a pit stop at 'Minnie's Haberdashery' where they run into several more of these types, all of whom may or may not be telling the truth about their identities or their reasons for being there. Our story then revolves around these eight (well nine if you include the driver) characters' stories and how they interact with one another. Think Cluedo/Clue but in a blizzard, in America, in the 1870s.<br/><br/>I know this film has very much split Tarantino fans but for me, if you like Tarantino, you should enjoy The Hateful Eight. The only reason I can think some may be put off, is that it does move significantly slower than much of Tarantino's work. It is much more of a slow burner and revolves more around the characters' actions and dialogue, than the actual scenes themselves. That being said, it had me gripped enough that I wasn't looking at my watch (despite the near 3 hours running time), so it can't be too drab!<br/><br/>So let's do some quick fire bullets to prevent this review getting too lengthy:<br/><br/><ul><li>No this isn't Tarantino's best work. No it isn't close to my favourite of his work. That being said, it is once again a very well made piece of cinema from a director who continues to make films in a way no one else really can. Another engaging, funny, smart story from Mr Tarantino. I can fully understand why The Academy have failed to recognise it however, it may just be a little 'action-gory-type' film for them I expect. It certainly doesn't carry the distinction of say, a 'Revenant'. But I certainly preferred it to The Revenant, Big Short, Brooklyn, Room etc.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting across the board was excellent. One of the major strengths of the film were its characters, each having its own distinct personality and back story. This is not only testament to the actors themselves but also to Tarantino on the writing front. I thought Tim Roth in particular was superb and although no really considered from what I saw 'pre-awards season', can count himself unlucky not to get a Best Supporting Actor nod. I'd certainly place him higher than Christian Bale in The Big Short, that's for sure.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jennifer Jason Leigh played her crazy, but calculated character very well and is definitely worthy of her Oscar nomination.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The film also provides a huge role for Walton Goggins, who I must confess I've not seen before, but will no doubt be cropping up in more feature films now I expect. He did a very good job in this, especially given the actors he was lining up alongside.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And finally, Ennio Morricone... He is very much deserving of the Oscar. And unlike Leo (who deserves it because of his body of work, rather than for his specific role this year), this score would more than be worthy of the win. Despite my love of Thomas Newman's Bridge of Spies score, I have to accept that it was relatively samey throughout whereas the variety of compositions that Morricone has had to put together for this is impressive... more so because each works so perfectly with the scene/s it's attached to. Very Hitchcock-esque... including one part having a hauntingly similar relation to Psycho... which would explain why I appreciated it so much. So yes, although Thomas Newman's Bridge of Spies score is my favourite so far this year, this is probably better in terms of achievement and quality. Besides... how can you deny the composer of The Mission &amp; The Good, The Bad and The Ugly finally receiving an Academy Award?</li></ul>"

","The Hateful Eight is directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern. <br/><br/>Some years after the Civil War, in the cold winter of Wyoming, a hangman and his prisoner stumble upon a bounty hunter looking for a ride in their stagecoach. With conversations had and deals made, they head up a way until they bump into a soon-to-be Sheriff. The only thing these folks seem to have in common is their destination: Red Rock. But on their journey they are forced to hold up at a stagecoach stopover cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery until the blizzard calms. As time passes by, the eight folk start to get a little eager to figure out who each of the men really are...<br/><br/>Firstly, I was lucky enough to attend a special roadshow event for this movie, and I am glad I spent the (now incredibly reasonable) £20 ticket admission price. The movie was presented in Ultra Panavision 70 and projected on the classic Cinerama single-projector system. There was a musical overture to start, with an intermission after the first act of the movie. We were also given programs as memorabilia. This is a roadshow. And since the 50s-60s, hasn't been done in this fashion. Tarantino was very specific and direct in how he wanted to shoot, and present this movie, and has done so, wonderfully. Special thanks to the staff at ODEON Leicester Square; working the projectors - a seamless run, with no problems.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is an experiment, of sorts. Tarantino wanted to see what would happen if he threw eight strange and compelling characters together in a small space and see what would happen. This is reminiscent of his first movie, Reservoir Dogs, yet has so much more strength in character background and screenplay that it completely blows it out of the park. He has a drive to get long, beautiful and interesting shots that can last 30 seconds to 1 minute, with no cuts. The opening shot lasts around a minute or two, with the full credits of cast and crew appearing on screen with haunting music by legendary Maestro, Ennio Morricone. When you're watching a Tarantino movie, you're getting an experience that no one else can deliver quite the same way. <br/><br/>The acting all around is just outstanding. The 'hateful eight' are incredibly strong characters that interact with each other with so much energy that it would be ridiculous if it were to miss out on Awards season. From Russell and Jackson, to Jason Leigh and Roth; the charisma in both taking everything they've got to portray these characters as Tarantino imagined, and delivering lines, was spot-on. They are genuine, realistic performances.<br/><br/>The script is roaring with strength throughout, with quotable lines and humour. This is something that needs to be perfect, or near-perfect in a movie. But with The Hateful Eight, being a dialogue-driven event, it needed to be interesting. Tarantino has worked up a wondrous script with so much life and passion that it completely takes control of the movie and doesn't let up one bit until the credits roll. This is how you make a good western. It has that classic ""who done it"" thriller genre nailed down tightly. There hasn't been one like this for a long time, so it's much needed. <br/><br/>Music by Ennio Morricone is hauntingly beautiful, making a big return to the western scoring front after 40 years, with original music bleeding through the landscapes and performances by all of the cast. I had listened to the score before seeing the movie and was curious to see how it fitted with the picture, but Morricone being the genius that he is completely changed the way I listen to the score. It fits perfectly with the story. This could be one of the last western scores that he releases, and I believe it's a triumphant return.<br/><br/>Visual effects are few and far between but if you're familiar with Tarantino's work then you know there's some violence and gore in there somewhere, which is correct, and it's over the top and extremely bloody. Which I'm a huge fan of, so I was absolutely loving it. There's more I could say but that would eventually mean spoiling and that's something I really try to avoid. <br/><br/>My verdict; The Hateful Eight kicks off 2016 in style, with the largest 70mm release in over 20 years. If you have the chance, get to a cinema that's screening the movie in film, it's absolutely worth the price of admission. Quentin Tarantino is still on his filmmaking high and I'm sure will continue this reign of storytelling for years to come. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight, 10/10."

","I decided that no film ever, never mind another Tarantino film, would surpass Pulp Fiction. I never would believe it. Well, I am not here to lie to you people, but this film unfortunately didn't do it. But I have to say, it definitely delivered in film terms, and definitely didn't disappoint the hungry film goer that I am. The use of chapters makes us know that it's a Tarantino film we're watching, not some boring everyday Western from the '50s. As we watch on and see people being brutalized at every angle and second, Mr. Tarantino creates cliffhangers half way through the film, making us want more before the film is over. I would recommend this film to a lot of people, giving it an honest review that it is a top film. The screenplay is interesting, giving Samuel L. Jackson killer lines as always, and the acting is superb. If you are unsure whether or not to watch this film, just give it a try. It pleased me and I bet other film fans alike"
"jake-law123","8","29","77","31 December 2015"," One of Tarantino's heaviest films.
","This is a Tarantino film that emphasizes every bit of content in this film. The characters, the environment, the food they eat, the liquor they drink, etc. Nothing in this film is not addressed in some point or another. One of his most dialogue heavy films, and one of his most gruesome films as well.<br/><br/>Everybody in this film gave an amazing performance. Has one of my favorite Samuel Jackson characters ever, followed by the phenomenally cast Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kurt Russell, making for a great duo. Michael Madsen and Tim Roth were a little underplayed but still fun to watch. The cinematic view is glorious, even if it is all mostly shot in a cabin. Though few, the shots of mountains with horseback carriages in the distance makes for some beautiful scenery. Once again, this has one of the longest screenplays in any other Tarantino. Every scene has at least five fifteen minute discussions about a backstory, or some food or the cabin or the owners of the cabin. Many critics have considered it one of his slowest movies, though it is filled with story and it makes you feel informed throughout.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight is right, because this is one of the most hateful, mean spirited movies ever, with probably the highest number of N- words in any movie. Even those who have an understanding are at each other's throats in this. There is zero friendliness in here. I will admit I was hoping for less white and black confrontation in this, since that's a big discussion in the film, and it feels worn at this moment in Tarantino's career.<br/><br/>Overall, It's very different from what he's done in the past, and it's better than his two recent films. Even though it isn't perfect, it's a story to remember with some very colorful characters and plot."

","The name Tarantino brings with it a certain reputation. A reputation that in recent years that has started to lose it's shine. Known for his scenes with great dialogue, Tarantino spectacularly fails to delivery with The Hateful Eight. We end up with almost 2 hours of mostly convoluted drivel that thankfully picks up in the film's climax but unfortunately it's not enough to make this film anything more than average. Tatum is completely miscast as are, to be honest, pretty much every other actor in this film. Samuel L Jackson is the stand out star, delivering a stellar performance that we are used to but even he can only carry so much of the film.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about the constant use of 'n igger' in the film. I'm not quite sure why so many people are complaining about this. It's a film set in a very racist time period in American History, with very racists characters so sadly it was the vernacular of the time. If Tarantino was black, a fuss wouldn't have been made.<br/><br/>We'll probably see Tarantino fall back on Kill Bill 3 to try to get some of his shine back after this turkey of a film."
"FelipeCarrillo","10","12","27","29 January 2016"," ""No One Comes Up Here Without A Damn Good Reason""
",""" The Hateful Eight"" fulfills the promise, making his 8th film a real QT project "". <br/><br/>Every human being has the ability to dictate a good or bad verdict regarding a film seen, everyone have the opportunity, 'Star Wars' has its bad and good side but Tarantino films it is impossible to find the negative side. With 52 years of life, "" a film by Quentin Tarantino "" tag is the main reason attend a theater, regardless of history, cast, or none of these, is only Quentin. Relatively this director ever have a bad project, so ""T. H. E."" is one of his best weapons to be dazzled. <br/><br/>Quentin has broken the tradition of 2015 (remakes and a interesting thing) creating a new epic world, but occasionally introducing small variations of ""Reservoir Dogs"". One of the characters most hated, in a cabin, having to wait two sweet hours while a storm passes, What bad could happen? No one there is who appears to be. Like any Tarantino film is remote strictly to the experiences of the odious eight. This man is a master that all can do, and I think more than difficult, unnecessary to create a theatrical piece (possibility) of this beautiful and unique work, serious as adapted Mad Max. <br/><br/>Tarantino is a guy who has been steeped in the world of the cinema since childhood, absorbing every good material that looked to translate it into their own and original projects (directing and writing) so this guy knows what it does. <br/><br/>Beyond a beautiful costume, the details of the time, production design or any of all the perfect items, the established location is the best way to start, a western in the snow.It is very bold picking a desolate place to lock up for some reason a group of strangers. <br/><br/>From the moment in which the film opens, show majestic landscapes, a strong snowfall and a muddy Jesus Christ of snow, we knew that was going to be quite an adventure. It's funny to think that a film's lasting 3 hours and 7 minutes did not come to feel tense and boring, instead of this, its suspicion and intrigue going on the rise, generating in the spectator an enjoyable experience. <br/><br/>Anyone who is seen the 8 films of director, could tell that own merit and as it is logical the first lines are for his most repetitive actor, Samuel L. Jackson who has collaborated with the director for the sixth time. When this black man opens his mouth, already is deserved a nomination for the Award Academy. Throughout history, the film is told in a way that personally I had never seen, making his film a proposal different to all evidenced today in day. As you might imagine, this film has continuity thanks to many matches, that the way in which Quentin implanted it everything looks the way more natural. <br/><br/>One of the most frequent clichés among viewers and modern dramas is to point at first sight a hero implemented as the main character, However, who could be the hero here, where no one is good? He renews this constant with a smart and fresh variation on the rotation of each of the members, being impossible to point to the protagonist. But I feel very subjectively, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson will steal the limelight. Come to a stop (Minnie) really when everything feels strange, creating in the audience, What could happen? <br/><br/>A true lover of the films of this guy can say that one of the primary aspects of atmosphere to empathize more in history are the intractable and typical scores for his films where in this case chose to Ennio Morricone to form tension, achieving very well. <br/><br/>The storm is long and continuous, creating an atmosphere breathtakingly stressful. More of one we share the view to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in this film and ""Anomalisa"" is a complete pleasure. The title is accurate, and not to be the eighth Tarantino film is called ""Eight"" if not for call ""Hateful"". The Quentin formulas can be a little confusing, but it does explain at the end each parameter that seemed difficult to understand at the beginning. There are several scenes of duo for highlighted, one of them is the individualistic ability of Samuel and Dern generate one battle of a sentence against another, a total feast. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Quentin latest invention has become my favorite, the film more Tarantino. Beautifully photographed and directed 'The Eight' hides too much of some characters through shots and hits. Tarantino is one of my best directors capturing all explicitly as it imagines, not afraid to show a nudity, fellatio, and too much blood, just by caring for the rating and not the chance to fill his pockets of money not to allow the entry of young people. Violence in this work is essential and fun, even to look like a gore. This project does not disappoint being shooting in the 70mm majestic. It's outrageous and insolent lack of participation in the 2016 awards season, taking a film gem in their hands. For Tarantino fans, ""The Hateful Eight"" will be the best Christmas gift, because it is one of the best films of the decade, Tarantino and the general film world, <br/><br/>¡Thanks Quentin!"

","Whomever wrote this wasn't very smart. They had all the white people saying the Black people don't like to be called the N-word in the 1880's, which was nonsense, because that's what the African Americans WANTED to be called back then. They were from Nigeria and they told people to call them that. It wasn't till the 60's they thought the word was being used in a hateful way, and decided to be called Colored, then changed it to Negro's, then Black, then African-Americans. I call them what they want to be called.<br/><br/>Also they try to build hatred for the Southern White people, they should be sued for racism. I have sympathy for Southerners, because according to the Constitution the States have a Right to secede from the Union if they want to, and Lincoln didn't want them leaving the Union. Also in those days they thought they were 'Giving them a better life', which is the same mentality used today on bringing in Illegal immigrants. 80% of the Slave Traders were Jews which is a well known fact, and you don't see Hollywood having Black people attacking the Jews after the war. <br/><br/>If you want to see a Cowboy movie, which is what I wanted, this is not it. Hollywood used to be able to produce a good one with a Political message like when Clint Eastwood showed how stupid war was in 'Good, Bad, and the Ugly.' This movie is promoting Hatred with the races, so don't patronize it."
"jbaur-98503","8","11","25","15 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight: Tarantino is back
","First of all, let me say this: Quentin Tarantino is my favorite film director of all time. Yes, even better than Scorsese, Fincher, Spielberg or Kubrick. So, I had pretty high expectations on the Hateful Eight, the new Western by Tarantino. Let me explain you how and why these expectations were met.<br/><br/>All you need to know about the plot of the Hateful Eight has been said in the trailers. Eight strangers are stuck in a lonely cottage, due to a blizzard. You don't need to know more and you shouldn't know more than that, before watching the film. These strangers are played by Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russel, Bruce Dern, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Like in Inglourious Basterds and Pulp Fiction the film is divided into chapters. Most of the movie takes place in said cottage. The story overall is very thrilling and unpredictable. While the first half of the movie consist almost entirely out of dialogues, the second half is more typical Tarantino.<br/><br/>The acting in the Hateful Eight is superb. Especially Sam Jackson, Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh do their job very well. Like people are expecting, when it comes to Sam Jackson, his character is pure badass and Jennifer Jason Leigh even got an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a supporting role. Tim Roth, Kurt Russell and Bruce Dern also play their parts with excellence. Channing Tatum has as well a small role, which he also plays good (Yes, I know it's Channing Tatum, but Tarantino once even managed to make Til Schweiger play OK, so why not Tatum?). The script is brilliant and very quotable, even for Tarantino standards. Sam Jackson's character also has a few very intelligent and interesting monologues.<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated features of the Hateful Eight was the soundtrack. Tarantino is known for using music, composed by Ennio Morricone, since Kill Bill. However, for the first time, apart from one single song in Django Unchained, Morricone composes new original score for a Tarantino movie. Ennio Morricone is, together with John Williams, my most beloved film composer. The soundtrack overall is excellent and fitting. Although I think Star Wars VII, which has great music too, will win the Oscar for Best Original Score, I hope Morricone gets the honor.<br/><br/>I find the Hateful Eight to be Quentin's fourth best film to date, right after Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained and Pulp Fiction. Beautiful visual, amazing and unpredictable story, many characters with unique traits, excellent acting and all the things that are typical Tarantino. 10/10"
"matsac-1","2","5","9","6 January 2017"," Utter disappointment. Better as a radio show.
","This movie was an utter disappointment. Don't expect it to be an action filled western, it's very much the opposite. Nothing wrong with that, but this story and its intrigues would have done just as good as a story on radio. There is nothing visually needed to tell this story, or very little. It's not like other story heavy movies where visuals are an intricate part of the whole story, like The Usual Suspects which is actually a great example of that. To me not even the conversations between the characters is that much interesting. The characters are good with their personalities, but that is all the suspense there is in this movie."

Warm and cold, good and bad, alive and dead... In their reviews, many people are complaining that the film is somewhat lengthy, chatty, and gruesome and all that stuff. Hey, it is Tarantino, baby! As a matter of fact, the movie is so much fun to watch! Every part of it is filled with wit conversations, great acting and suspense. Every word uttered by the cast is well measured and precise. Samuel L. Jackson's lines are mesmerizing and catchy. The best thing about the movie, is that it really makes you wanna see it over again, now that you know what the deal was about... It is kinda cool!) Remember, QT makes the movies that lasts long. And this one will definitely will stay with you. BTW, it is best watched on a cold winter's day, while wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot mug of your favorite drink. Enjoy the QT's masterpiece."
"mtouchprod","7","20","53","23 December 2015"," a movie with no reason for being
","I'm a very big fan of Tarantino's earlier work. I thought Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were, in their way, important movies. He was saying something very relevant to the world of cinema about the difference between movie violence and real violence, especially in the nineties on the heels of the action craze of the eighties.<br/><br/>Indirectly he was saying that we romanticize these types of events and people, but really they're just a bunch of normal guys who tell stupid jokes, talk about nothing, and screw up their job, which are despicable. The hit men in Pulp Fiction aren't superhuman killing machines - they're two jerkoffs who get paid to kill people; sometimes they're cool, and sometimes they're stupid, just like regular guys.<br/><br/>But starting with Kill Bill, it felt like Tarantino had begun to run out of things to say. Those two movies, which would have been one good movie if anyone had the balls to edit him, were really just about themselves. It was more of a series of compelling scenes than it was a single coherent story. But there was a voice in there, and there were things being said.<br/><br/>This movie is the ultimate expression of that trend. It has no reason for existing, other than itself. The story isn't compelling or new, and there's no new angle on it that makes you see things in a different way. The dialogue comes across as extremely self-aware and fake, even for a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Even some of the visuals seem poorly executed and the tone is a little choppy. For example, early in the movie he's apparently trying to create a sense of claustrophobia by cutting between the outside of the wagon, with the tiny shelter of the wagon contrasted with the brutal, all-encompassing blizzard, and the conversation on the inside. But the conversation is kind of ridiculous, and the framing makes it seem almost comical, which completely undercuts the tone that it seems like he's trying to set.<br/><br/>Even if it weren't a pointless movie, it would be far from his best work. But when you take the relatively minor flaws in the structure of the film, and combine them with the fact that the movie has nothing to say, you end up asking yourself why he bothered to make it, and why you bothered to watch it."

","***This review doesn't contain spoilers but does describe a particular scene.*** <br/><br/>I used to love Tarantino movies for the vivid characters and clever dialogue and really anticipated his films. His last few (culminating in this effort) have really lacked the qualities that made his earlier films so great. Some describe this as a ""whodunit"" when really there is zero suspense in this film. You have to care about the characters to wonder who poisoned the coffee, and you just don't care about anyone in this film at all. It's really more of a ""whocareswhodunit? thisisboringanddisgusting."" There is good acting by Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh but it isn't enough to carry the film or excuse that it was even made.<br/><br/>I find it ironic that Tarantino loves to fashion these movies after and pay homage to spaghetti westerns when they really have nothing in common, and he likely would have been arrested if he had created such a film back in the 1960s. Some Hateful 8 apologists think you need judge this film from the point of view of Tarantino...If that's the case what's the point of having any expectations at all? or even an opinion for that matter? Let Tarantino tell us what to think about it. And if he thinks it deserves and Oscar or even a Grammy and a Kid's Choice Award, then I guess it does.<br/><br/>For years Tarantino has been flirting with a revisionist history/revenge porn genre, and this just seems like the culmination of all the dark fantasies that have been rattling around in that skull of his. It's needlessly gory, utterly devoid of any compelling storytelling, suspense, empathy...or anything else that makes one want to go to the movies. Not only are all the story's characters hateful, but you will probably hate yourself for seeing it and for being a person. It feels more like a practical joke perpetrated on a gullible audience that has lost any sense of self respect.<br/><br/>I was asked if I would recommend it after its conclusion, and to what age groups. Even though adults with strong stomachs can handle the material, I just couldn't recommend it to anyone because there's nothing enjoyable about this film that makes watching Samuel L Jackson force another man to perform fellatio on him before murdering him, (then describing the act in detail to the raped/dead man's father, before shooting him as well) -seem worth it. But if that's what you're into, I guess you'll dig it."
"gogga1011","2","6","12","24 April 2016"," One of the worst Tarantino's movies
","I watched almost all his movies, but this ... this is difficult even to call the film. This was merely recycling old themes and sentences from Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and virtually all his other works and putting it in almost two motionless scenes. Blah, blah, blah, shoot, blah, blah, blah, waiting for something, but nothing, blah, blah, shoot, blah again, shoot, hectoliters of blood, guts, and again - stupid, arrogant, tedious sentences about raping and killing. If not from a notorious Tarantino, this would just be easy to call a complete garbage and crap that steals almost 3 hours of your life. The main story is so many times told, and indeed it was tedious to watch and listen to all these stupid and boring dialogues (absolutely unnecessary!) for almost 3 hours. To finale: Tarantino's usual ranting massacre and descriptions of homosexual rape. It seems to me that Tarantino himself has a nasty psychological problems that heals through his films. Thumbs down. Hard to decide which is worst - Inglorious Basterds or this... What really bother me is Tarantino's immaturity. Although he is almost 53, he still makes shallow movies without any deeper analysis of characters and events. Something like those stupid kung fu movies which he adores."

","The magic of Tarantino once again hits the vein with a perfect storm of melodrama, splatter, mystery, western and comedy. Too bad a lot of people, it seems, don't appreciate his masterpiece. But maybe we shouldn't focus on them, and rather just love the movie for what it is - superb in all it's quirkiness.<br/><br/>First I was hesitant to see it in the cinemas, because I'd heard it was very violent, even for Tarantino. And I didn't want a very violent 3 h picture. But as we all know, we who've seen it, it is not very violent, at all really.<br/><br/>The performances of especially Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggings and Jennifer Jason Leigh are great.<br/><br/>So what's not to like about this movie? Well, it's long. That could be negative. The movie is slow (relatively slow), that could be negative. The movie is character and dialogue driven. That could be negative. Most of the movie is inside a cabin. That could be negative. If you on the other hand don't find any of these circumstances to be negative, and you rather like the whole plot, story and premise - well, then you are in for a treat. Tarantino arches the craft to a maximum, and when he touches lightly on the red line it vibrates perfectly.<br/><br/>You will rejoice, laugh and have a really, really, good time.

","HATEFUL EIGHT review by Mike Smith <br/><br/>In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive? Quentin Tarantino does it again!!! This is the 8th film Tarantino has made but it kind of reminded me of his first film Reservoir Dogs. That being said, it is way different as well.<br/><br/>I loved the story from start to finish, betrayal, deception, a bit of humor and action. The classic Tarantino formula is tried and true for some good entertainment and the story is as good as the cast and Hateful Eight has an all star cast. Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson play some of my favorite characters and this film is no different. They have some of the best lines in the movie and they work really well off of each other and I hope to see them together in a film again. Jennifer Jason Leigh was the one person I didn't know much about in this film and from her first line in the movie I enjoyed her character. Walton Goggins had a quick role in Django Unchained but in Hateful Eight his character is a great blend of funny, serious, also a jerk and Goggins shows he can pull it off. Now without giving too much away the rest of the cast (as always) are amazing at bringing Quentin Tarantino's work to life.<br/><br/>The cinematograph is classic 60's - 70's film style that Tarantino brought back to the mainstream. The set feels authentic to the time the film takes place in, but the most stunning part are the landscapes. Ice cold mountain land with the sounds of the snow crunching and the wind blowing, I felt cold and chilly, it all made me immersed in the film.<br/><br/>I knew I would enjoy this film but every time Quentin Tarantino makes a new film it is better than the previous one, it sticks with me for days and I can't get enough of it. Sure, as always, Tarantino films are not for everyone with the strong language, violence and gore that may make some people uncomfortable. Although, I'm not like that so I loved this film. I highly recommend that before the end of this year that you cap it off with this masterpiece and remember life won't suck as long as there is a good movie to watch.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 <br/><br/>Edited by: Samantha Locke <br/><br/>Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/FatMikesMovieReviews/ <br/><br/>twitter: @FatMikeTPK"

There are some mild political spew, it's a distraction at best and the time wasted could have been used to try to save the plot, build at least a little suspense or do something interesting. Wish Hollywood would understand we don't watch movies to be preached at. We get enough of that already, we watch movies to get away from it. At least the preaching was mild even if it destroyed suspension of belief and produced yawns. <br/><br/>The historical mistakes made in the movie were far too many to list. I think you have to lay this dud on the director & writer. Everyone else did a great job with what was a poor script and directing. Maybe Tarantino just needed money or was trying to recapture past glory. He sure missed the mark with this movie. The base concept was a really interesting idea spoiled by poor writing and directing. I am not a big Tarantino fan. Most of his movies are so over the top as to be comical. Every so often he directs a gem. Reservoir dogs was a great movie for example. Pulp Fiction was a pretty good film and Jackie Brown was well worth watching. On the flip side Inglorious Bastards is one of the few high budget WW II films that I didn't like. It was about as pointless and stupid war movie as I've ever seen. Way over the top and so poorly directed you start rooting for the bad guys just so there's something interesting about the movie. Death Proof despite Kurt Russell was another really boring movie. It was one of the few movies staring Russell I did not like."
"pfgpowell-1","4","4","7","8 January 2017"," Ponderous, longwinded, derivative and sadistic - yes, Tarantino's back
","First of all some figures: The Hateful Eight cost $44m to make and in six months had made $145m - over three times as much. Those are the kind of figures producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein like, and while Quentin keeps the box office cash tills ringing, Bob and Harvey, or whoever else Quentin approaches with his latest script, will carry on saying 'yes, Quentin, of course, Quentin, and can I get you another olive for your martini, Quentin?' His previous two stinkers also made a lot of loot: Django Unchained cost $100m and pretty soon returned $425m worldwide; Inglorious Basterds cost $75m and soon brought in $321m worldwide).<br/><br/>Admittedly, those $145m came from someone's pockets, so someone and their friends must like the kind of cack Quentin has been turning out remorselessly since the very good Reservoir Dogs and good, though, not great Pulp Fiction. And you can't argue with such cash figures, you'll be saying. Well, if that's your line, let me remind you of the wisdom to 'eat sh*t, seven trillion flies can't be wrong'. Oh, yes they can.<br/><br/>Elsewhere on this site you will find The Hateful Eight lauded to high heaven and given superlative ratings. But you will also see very low ratings and criticism of various kinds. My advice: ignore the fanboys who might well enjoy gratuitous blood and gore as much as our Quentin. Go by what the naysayers have to say. Despite some initial great photography - not Quentin's department though - this is pretty dire.<br/><br/>To be fair, I don't think The Hateful Eight is quite as bad as Django Unchained, although it, too, has seams of bargain basement political correctness about race and colour running through it of the kind which is actually just as insulting to blacks. But it also has the same faults: an artlessly contrived plot, a horribly uneven pace, superficially clever dialogue which actually sounds only like superficially clever dialogue and an awfully stagey direction.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight, in fact, comes across as a ham mystery play transferred to the screen by someone who has no idea that film has its own imperatives. Heresy? The boy Quentin doesn't know about film, I say. Well, on the evidence of this flat-footed effort, he certainly seems to have forgotten whatever you insist he once knew.<br/><br/>Quentin also manages to elicit from a respectable line-up of actors some pretty wooden performances: they all, even Mr Samuel Jackson, one of my favourite actors, come across as speaking lines from someone's smart script. They all seem to be acting, sometimes acting well, but still acting, and only the director, one Quentin Tarantino, can be blamed for that. He might know how to put together a bloodfest gunfight, but he often seems clueless as to how to give his actors directions.<br/><br/>Other reviews such as this one have tended to mention historical inaccuracies and other infelicities. I was surprised to hear one character describe another as 'paranoid' - what, in mid-19th century Wyoming? I don't think so. But my gripes have nothing really much to do with that.<br/><br/>My gripes have to do with the boy Quentin's filmmaking: he's just not as good as he obviously thinks he is. Not by a long chalk. The characters are stock characters, most of the films consists of series of one-to-one setpieces and his convoluted plots are only convoluted because that is Quentin's schtick.<br/><br/>In The Hateful Eight he even pulls a fast one: two-thirds of the way through we get a narration and a very hamfisted new element is introduced to get the ball rolling again. It's as though busily writing his script he had reached a kind of dead end and didn't quite know where to go next.<br/><br/>What Quentin needs is someone to tell him 'this just isn't very good, laddie, try again'. But while those cash tills keep a'ringin that really isn't going to happen.<br/><br/>The film is almost two and a half hours long, and I wanted to give up after an hour. I only kept going because I knew I would be writing this review, and it was only fair I saw the lot. On the other hand, if you want to give up after an hour, by all means do so. You will really not miss much at all and might even find something more useful to do. And you will even not have to witness a particularly unpleasant scene where a woman is hanged.<br/><br/>By the way: just how did two badly injured men, one of whom couldn't move at all, the other just revived from a fainting fit but who could also barely move manage to rustle up a hanging rope complete with a very professional noose from somewhere and get the hanging done? Oh, and if you do give up - as I advise - you will also be spared a particularly mawkish, not to say dishonest epilogue involving a letter apparently written by Abraham Lincoln to the black character. Oh dear."

","An earlier review by 'gogoschka-1' pretty much sums up what I would have wrote about the film in a much better and detailed review.

I say onto you 'negative reviewer' ""Shut the hell up"" in my Samuel Jackson voice. <br/><br/>Reason 2. These same 'people' said the film was boring.

The other actors were well cast also... BUT what a waste! The plot was simplistic (think Bus Stop in the '50's) and took TOO long to tell the story. Beginning with the opening, about 10 minutes of watching a stagecoach moving through the snow about 5 miles an hour.<br/><br/>The Bloodiness was over-done, and TOO Much (let's have her brother's brains splatter on her face).

","Trust Quentin Tarantino to give us a good time & he does! 'The Hateful Eight' is A Jolly Good Time, thats high on violence, sadistic humour & relentless entertainment. The Performances are Top-Notch, while the Writing & the Direction by the Genius, are purely awesome!<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' Synopsis: In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter and his prisoner find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters.<br/><br/>At 3 hours, 'The Hateful Eight' refuses to slow-down & turns out to be a memorable watch. Watching 8 despicable people come together & go at each-other in 6 brilliant chapters has never been so interesting before. Tarantino nails every bit of 'The Hateful Eight' & celebrates human madness with no filters!<br/><br/>I loved 'The Hateful Eight', because it blends violence, sadistic humour & entertainment, perfectly. This is Typical, Vintage Tarantino showing his powers yet again! His Screenplay is fast-paced & brutal. But it never falters. This is among Tarantino's Finest Screenplays to date. As for his Direction, Tarantino creates a world of unruliness, like only he can! Robert Richardson's Excellent Photography & Fred Raskin's Razor-Sharp Editing compliment Tarantino's twisted vision. A Special Mention for the Awesomely Choreographed Action-Sequences & Ennio Morricone's uplifting Score.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' is filled with Great Performances. Jennifer Jason Leigh takes the lead with a Tour-De-Force performance, thats impossible not to be haunted by. Leigh is unstoppable here, nailing her wicked character to the T. Get The Oscar already, will ya! Kurt Russell is in top-form! And its so good to see the Legend portray such a menacing, violent part. Samuel L. Jackson is absolutely terrific & shines all through his role. Walton Goggins is astounding; easily his best work to date. Demián Bichir is perfectly morbid, while Tim Roth & Michael Madsen are flat-out fabulous. The Legendary Bruce Dern dominates much of the proceedings, adding another highlight in his late film career. Channing Tatum fits in correctly in the Tarantino setting & sparkles in his brief bit.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'The Hateful Eight' is a mighty winner! Do Not Miss!"
"thehellhole","2","7","15","13 February 2016"," Trapped in his private hell
","I want to state a couple of observations concerning this movie, namely aspects that are not obvious the first time around and even less obvious if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend in your arms to spend time together in the cinema. Well, in this case, it is wiser to stay home and do the 1-on-1 in bed rather than to subject yourself to this insane and dumb bloodshed that is called The Hateful Eight. By the way, there are more than 8 people in this movie. Maybe Tarantino didn't like his 8th movie himself but was forced to deliver it.<br/><br/>Sadistic Tarantino-style was evident from the beginning of his career (Reservoir Dogs) but then, his self-hatred was not as big as now. He still had a sense of black humor. With Kill Bill it started to go downhill and every movie got worse and worse. If you open your eyes, you clearly can see that Tarantinos mental health deteriorated heavily. He camouflages the fact that he is full of passive-aggressive tension by talking a lot and describing everything, but that's not the main point although I feel sorry for him. He has his reasons. The bad point is, that he feeds it to the audience.<br/><br/>The first element we see in this movie – when the credits start to roll – is a cross with Jesus on it. The cross is a symbol for ""the world"" and Jesus represents god that incarnated as a human and was displayed to the world. Now we all know how it ended. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Tarantino tries to make a point, but he fails horribly. With a good movie he would have told the most important thing in existence: the sense of being and why the world is like it is. In Tarantinos viewpoint the world is hell, full of betrayal, murder, hate and evil tendencies. Just like in the bible, the world is the playground of an evil spirit. Tarantino has the power to portray his own inner turmoil but is not respecting the audience. So in a way, he is just like his characters in the movie. The trailers don't really tell what this movie is all about, so – in a way – they are even more awful than the flick itself.<br/><br/>Movie is not recommended. Good things though: lighting, camera, parts of the score and the 70mm format."
"pranayjalvi","9","19","52","28 December 2015"," Brilliant Tarantino
","The film was 2hrs 48 mins long and frankly saying, I didn't get bored and practically liked every minute of the film. This was 8th film by Tarantino and damn, he does it again with its western genre and typical Tarantino style. Samuel. L. Jackson was great as a bounty hunter and the ensembled cast was too good. The movie was shot in 70mm camera which was very brave by Tarantino. This 8th outing from Tarantino offers another well-aimed round of signature blend of action, humour and over the top violence. I suggest everyone to watch this western drama. I go with 9/10 for this Tarantino movie and this is my one of the best movies of 2015."
"giovanni-lorenzin","3","8","18","14 February 2016"," We are in 2015, wake up Tarantino
","I will go straight to the point: in 2015 I do not need to be remembered that it does not matter if you are black or white, and that everyone in this world deserve respect.<br/><br/>Tarantino plays the part of South Park's PC-Principal, checking the privilege on everyone in the movie and in the audience.<br/><br/>That said, 70mm for 2mins of arguably beautiful landscapes. Story is something everyone has already seen: a remixed murder on the orient express western version. 3hrs of stereotyped political/geographical characters without any real introspection talking about something that i really do not care anymore. Camera-work is ""basic"" and predictable. The OST by itself is great but its use just does not work well with the scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, costumes are perfect (maybe too much but still a director's choice) and the whole film is enjoyable, normally I would give a 6 but all this politics for me is a nonsense and it makes me think that Tarantino has some really bad problems accepting African-Americans... like someone who still is in the closet but continues to post on FB pictures of naked women.<br/><br/>What more? Another conformist movie from a non-conformist (let me pass this world) ""artist"" that in 3 years could have strengthen a far more interesting film."

I found it an interesting. engaging, enjoyable, humorous, beautifully filmed and choreographed, well acted, story based film, wondering what will happen next as it is full of surprises. It's not a film for those who are not so interested in story but think action is the be all and end all like the last Captain America or the Fast and Furious series, even thought 7 was not too bad. Nevertheless it has quite a few shocks and had my partner clutching my arm a few times. It's definitely a story based film with enough action to satisfy action fans like me."

I don't understand why, its brilliance in its writing with dark humor, great cinematography and all round great performances from the cast, Whats not to love? If you don't like long movies, don't watch it. If you like fully realized original cinema and can stand some violence, then you will love it. There are also a hell of a lot of throw backs to old school cinema and westerns in this, and the 700mm film used for it adds even more to that classic feeling. The score is also amazing, and really brings to life the kind of ""clue"" searching feeling Tarantino was going for with this movie. and as for the pacing, it may start off a bit slow, but the pay off is very well worth it, which is typical of this director."

","The Hateful Eight has no boring scenes throughout the whole movie, you will leave the theater with a gleeful look. The film maybe very violent, but every Tarantino fan will be happy with this movie. The movie does have a bunch of talking, but since it is Tarantino there will be a lot of witty dialogue. Most of the bad reviews are trying to make it get a lower score, if you look at most of the reviews, they are copied and pasted the same review. The movie may shock some viewers with the amount of N words there are, but Tarantino is trying to show how bad it is to use the word, not trying to use , just because he can use it. Some reviews say it is anti feminists, because the lady is beaten around by men the whole movie, yet if you watch the film, she is a powerful lady, and she murdered someone, that is why she is wanted. If you are looking for something very funny, something very interesting, watch this movie and you will be very happy with it."
"aceofspades96","10","20","57","30 December 2015"," Just sit down, and enjoy the movie!!!!
","Right off the bat, I'll go ahead and say that this is unlike any other movie that I've seen before. This truly was a masterpiece of a film! No director handles dialogue quite the way that Tarantino does. This review will be a spoiler-free review of what to expect of this film.<br/><br/>First and foremost, do NOT listen to negativity that you hear on a lot of film sites. The negativity in the film can most be attributed to the fact that Tarantino made a very controversial comment about the NYPD saying that they are all murderers. This gave a lot of former fans of Tarantino a negative and unfair bias of people who are now going into this film to hate it. Put aside your biases, forget that this movie is a Tarantino film. Go into the movie theater with a positive attitude, and be ready to be amazed. <br/><br/>First off, the dialogue in the movie is utterly fantastic! Each character has his or her own dialects and ways of speaking that are each unique to each other. For instance, the southern sheriff has a different way of speaking than a retired war-veteran does. This is captured perfectly in the lines of the people just by the way they speak. It really creates a diverse atmosphere in the film and really shows the difference in characters. <br/><br/>Again with the dialogue, the writer spends as much time as he can putting in subtle exposition-dialogue so the audience can really understand who and what the characters are. He doesn't do this through constant monologues or any other form of cliché per-se. He does this through funny arguments, and simple conversations. Sure the build-up to the climax is very long, and may seem slow, but this is definitely okay in the fact that we fully understand who are characters are. <br/><br/>This was definitely not some cheap screenplay that a movie studio purchased from a back-door writer. This is a high-quality well- written masterpiece. The plot of the film is ingeniously planned out and subtly foreshadowed at the beginning of the film. There are lots of subtle things that we as the audience see thinking nothing of, but actually have bigger meaning than one might think. There are lots of subtle details that we may not notice, but will be brought to our attention by a character. I thought that the writer really showed that he had everything in mind already played out, and wasn't just writing as he went along. I love the fact that the writer really adds an ""everything happens for a reason"" kind of tone to the movie. <br/><br/>This is not your typical western with a typical dueling cowboy soundtrack. The soundtrack of the film sounded very ominous and fit the overall tone of the movie perfectly. Tarantino used this film to his advantage tons of times in the film. He did this especially well in a sequence of the raging blizzard outside; the ominous organ is blaring in our ears and only gets louder when the wind blows harder. Then all of sudden, the shot quickly changes to indoors where it's calmer and warmer. The change from the soundtrack felt like a snap of a finger, and the writer used this masterfully. Just like Jaws, this film has it's own special sinister score that shows when danger is near, and I personally believe that this score should be just as iconic.<br/><br/>Man oh man! The acting was just perfect in the film. Every character was played perfectly by an awesome ensemble cast. These faces are very familiar to fans of QT films. As I said before, each character had different dialects. Not only was the overall tone of the characters masterfully shown in the movie, but the manner of speaking felt very authentic. Frequent QT actor Samuel Jackson played his role perfectly. I figured since this is his 2nd western movie with QT and his 6th movie with QT as well, he'd show a bit of other characters that he played in his movie. However, this was simply not the case. He showed no trace of his other characters and masterfully acted in this film. The character that he plays was suited perfectly for him, and I feel like even Samuel L. Jackson as well as the rest of the ensemble cast loved their characters. <br/><br/>Again as I said before, do not go into this film wanting to hate it. Go into the film with a positive attitude and just sit down and enjoy the damn movie. Who cares about what Tarantino said, who cares about any controversial statements he might have made. As we saw in all of his other movies, Tarantino is a very controversial man, and should just be given to his credit on screen rather than in person. Focus on the awesome dialogue, acting, and overall great film itself! Go out and see it! You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>P.S. I very rarely rate movies a full 10."

Well.. has dialogue and has twists. But nothing to blow up your mind. I find it pretty weak compared to other Tarantino movies. It looks like a single scene expanded in an entire movie. The required purpose could have happened way faster but it was forced into a long theatrical debate about revealing things. Like those evil people that get lost in explaining the evil plot to the good guy, until they get caught on a wrong foot. I'm not sure why this movie was needed. Reservoir Dogs was done before."
"dimomib","5","5","10","1 May 2016"," Shockingly Pointless
","I used to be a Tarantino fan. The guy invented his own post-retro genre and most of his work had actually something to give to the audience. <br/><br/>All that had to be said had already been said with pulp fiction, jackie brown, reservoir dogs, deathproof, inglorious bastards, even django. The drug culture, the hate and human cruelty, the racism were all wrapped up and beautifully presented.<br/><br/>The world nevertheless changes every day and even though we are used to Tarantino's practices I'd love to see this unique director evolve too. <br/><br/>The hateful eight gave me the feeling that it was made for retards. The dialogs were extremely poor and repeated and event though the acting was good I missed the point in it. But then again maybe there was not any. If the movie was about racism, well.. you certainly did a good job of awaking it (and not aware it). If it was about a western story.. you could try a Clint Eastwood film. If it was just a Tarantino fiction story then I'm sorry, you can do better than that.<br/><br/>Mr Tarantino please consider shocking us with positivity next time"
"RforFilm","9","17","48","30 December 2015"," Tarantino's brilliant writing and oddball characters make The Hateful Eight a great western thriller
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers with a unique voice. Most of the time, you could find one of his movies like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained and identify that it's a Tarantino movie right away, even if one were to start watching it in the middle. A lot of it has to do that he clearly writes his characters before the story. It's just that they are so well built as oddballs that are capable of anything given their circumstance that you'd probably want to watch them regardless of what they were doing. Even watching the characters of Reservoir Dogs play poker would be interesting.<br/><br/>By looking at his movies, you'd see that they are slow stories that rely on the characters dialogue then the actual action. That inspiration comes from spaghetti westerns like A Fist Full of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, which contain the same slow pace. Impatient people may see that as a bad thing, but when I go to the movies, the best stories are the ones that are being told by the most fascinating people. Django Unchained had it and so does today's movie, The Hateful Eight. <br/><br/>Some time after the Civil War, bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is trying to get his set of dead bodies to the next town of Red Rock, Wyoming so that he can collect his money. It's cold and a blizzard is approaching, so when a stagecoach arrives, he asks for a ride. Inside the stagecoach is another bounty hunter, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (played by Kurt Russell) who has captured fugitive Daisy Domergue (played by Jenifer Jason Leigh) and is taking her to town to hang. They take Warren, along with a man Chris Mannix (played by Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, and make it to a cabin before the blizzard catches them.<br/><br/>The cabin is a lodge for stagecoaches called Minnie's Haberdashery that's being looked after by a Mexican Bob (played by Demián Bichir) while the owner is out visiting her mother. Also in the Haberdashery is British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (played by Tim Roth) quiet cowboy Joe Gage (played by Michael Madsen) and former Confederate General Sandy Smithers (played by Bruce Dern). The eight individuals are all in for a hard couple of days as the blizzard rages while they discuss the post Civil War and maybe fire off some guns.<br/><br/>Just like Tarantino's previous movies, The Hateful Eight's biggest strength are the characters. They had to be good characters, given that the movie is primarily set (for the most part) in it's one cabin location. Every one of these people are so well constructed that they seem like they have come from other stories and that they have managed to find themselves in this one. I think my favorite had to be Kurt Russell's Hangman bounty hunter as he seemed to be the one most comfortable in being in a western.<br/><br/>With the characters comes a sort of a classic ""who-done-it"" mystery that's so much of a nutty scenario that I'd rather not give it away. I can say that the movie feels like two halves; the first being the introduction and the back stories while the second half is bloodier and the reaction to the reveals. Parts of the first half felt a little too slow (perhaps a few minutes could have been cut from it's three hour running time), but it all pays off later on when things are revealed and were in our seats trying to find out who's going to make it in the end.<br/><br/>I'll give this nine stagecoaches out of ten. The Hateful Eight is definitely not for those that are too squeamish by the violence and language level, but I promise that this is one of the best of 2015. I have yet to see a truly bad movie from Tarantino and this proves he's nowhere close to slowing down."

","imagine the music of bullets in the desolate plains of Wyoming... the bloody smell of despair and bitter taste of hopelessness. I really don't understand the critics of this film. It is Tarantino's classic. too much violence ? really, cause this is the trademark of his films. The violence has to be final, irrevocably omnipresent and nonlinear. It is the same as in Pulp Fiction, there are only 2 squads of us : butchers and the victims. And even in Pulp Fiction there is no way to go beyond the Violence - except the spiritual Way which is only postulated - the miracle is required to change the Way of the World. This film is different - it is more real - as in Inglourious Bastards - the circle of Violence is closed. you can't escape from it. The innocent die and are forgotten. The butchers kill the innocent and than kill themselves in the rage of cruelty. I really liked this film - all characters are rotten and spoiled. All carry the burden of American history - of American North - South War. All are guilty and all are punished by themselves - the only justice is the justice of apocalypse...<br/><br/>Beautiful scenery, great music and nihilism - can it be sth better ?"

Step 4: ask for a big budget that overcompensates the cost, cos sure as heck people are gonna warn their friends not to sit through this piece of crap. Step 5: Profit (without ticket sales).<br/><br/>Never have I been more disappointed or lost respect so quickly for someone I held in such high regard. I'm not a fan of gore, but Tarantino movies usually have very intellectually engaging dialogue. H8 has none of the above. The one plot twist comes at the end of chapter 4 of 6, when the tiny bit of action kicks in. Hell, if you still want to watch it, you might as well skip the first 60 minutes!<br/><br/>If you don't want to lose respect for Tarantino, don't watch this movie.

Some might find the pace to be slow due to the focus on dialogue and lack of changing locations but this what makes the movie great. Because his characters are from several different backgrounds and beliefs (I mean hey its during the reconstruction era) the tension never stops. It is because of this tension, each character is challenged in their own way, and you really get to see what kind of person they are. It will surprise you but you have to pay attention. This is why there is no single protagonist, because all his characters are intricate.<br/><br/>You have to go see it for it completely engages you and rarely have so seen so many complex characters together. In Pulp Fiction you jumped from different character stories and perspectives, here you watch it all at once."

In this movie are just situation they made sense and it was a joy to watch it. Movies are just entertainment for me and with the morricone music it was something I could absorb with my bones...)) I like the way Samuel put fun in his roles (comes with age) and the other actors either. This 3 lines are made for the approval. I like the way that this movie was made. You see just winter, snow, you feel the country and can imagine how the life was in the past.

","This is an instant classic Tarantino film. It's like all of his other movies put into one. He also uses mostly actors from his other movies... well even more than the usual. Admittedly this film can start off slow if you are not a Quentin Tarantino fan or don't know how his movies are. As a fan you watch and wait anticipating a good finally and it doesn't disappoint. He seems to cater this movie to the fans of his previous titles and so the haters are out strong on this one.<br/><br/>Like Django unchained, this film starts off post civil war but doesn't touch on the black and white topic as much. Still though with Samuel Jackson being a black bounty hunter back in those times has its similarities with Django unchained. You will also see major similarities with Reservoir Dogs, but since they are both great movies and he's only copying himself I don't see a problem with that.<br/><br/>As soon as you realize that you are watching a ""who-done-it"" western you can just sit back and enjoy and watch the characters unfold.<br/><br/>The actors all do an amazing job and although not his best... Quentin Tarantino delivers. I gave it a solid 9 out of 10."

This is the western that Tarantino has waited his entire life to make, and boy, does he let you know it. Without spoiling it, it's Reservoir Dogs in the old west, with a murder-mystery that would leave the makers of Clue green with envy. Every performance is heavily committed and excellent. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a crazed wonder, and she nearly stole the movie for me. In 70MM, it looked stunning.

"Wuchakk","7","6","13","17 October 2016"," Creative Western whodunit is an amusing black comedy, but also profane and repugnant
","RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" is a Western about a cruel bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) taking an outlaw woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in to Red Rock, Wyoming, to hang. Along with a black bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the new Sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins), they hold up at a rural haberdashery during a blizzard with several dubious characters (Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum). Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small roles.<br/><br/>This was Tarantino's second Western in a row after 2012's ""Django Unchained,"" which ranks with the best Westerns of all time. This one's not as good, but it certainly has its points of interest, like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere, which is to die for. Moreover, the plot is intriguing. It's basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West. Roughly 90% of the film takes place in the haberdashery and, less so, a stagecoach. It's basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a Western.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score, his first full-length score in over three decades (!). Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantino's strong suit; and so it is here. The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the one-dimensional setting. Everything's SO exaggerated that you can't take it seriously. The movie's intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained; otherwise you'll hate it.<br/><br/>On at least one occasion the overindulgences don't work, like the disgusting fellatio sequence. I get that Marquis (Jackson) was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw, but we didn't need a visual on his fabricated story. It's sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie, except gay porn, but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be ""edgy"" or whatever.<br/><br/>The excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme, which is humanity's fallen condition and dire need of redemption. The title, ""The Hateful Eight,"" is a perversion of ""The Magnificent Seven."" The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious. Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race, gender, sectionalism, faction-ism, envy and rivalry. Furthermore, men divided by hatred of culture and race can unite in hatred of something else, in this case misogyny.<br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 47 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"tarheelpup","9","8","19","15 March 2016"," Best Or Worst Tarantino Film? Neither
","I felt that The Hateful 8 was, if not Tarantino's BEST, it certainly ranks among his best work. Cinematography? Fantastic. The open landscapes slowly closing in by way of the snowstorm until finally we are trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery is enhanced and made more immediate by his choice to use the 70mm Panavision process. Script? Maybe not his greatest, but it certainly was as well written and nuanced as his previous work. Acting? Tarantino has a way of taking less well known and under-appreciated actors and bringing out their best work. Overall it's not perfect, but it is engaging in spite of its length.<br/><br/>What I specifically want to address is the reaction both this film and Django received over the use of certain racial terms and the violence. Although working in a different medium, Tarantino's work strongly resembles Frank Zappa's in one very specific way. Zappa made some of the most important and intricate music of the 20th century and cloaked it in some of the most misogynistic and ugly lyrics ever written. BUT those terms and images were there to make a point and to remove the closed minded in the audience at the start. Tarantino is much the same. If you cannot get past the violence and apparent racism/sexism in his work, you probably won't get or appreciate the rest. Tarantino was making a point about race relations in the US and he did it well. What he said needed saying. And I don't see many minority directors willing to go as far out on a limb as he did to say it.<br/><br/>Also, Tarantino is criticized for ""ripping off"" genres and directors. In my opinion what he is doing is very much the same as DJ and Hip Hop culture sampling earlier works and making something new out of them. By remixing tropes from earlier films, Tarantino is not only making NEW art, he is paying homage to earlier work AND he is satirizing those tropes at the same time.<br/><br/>I honestly don't believe Tarantino's talent will be appreciated in his lifetime. He's too far ahead of most of his audience. More's the pity for them."

","The Hateful Eight (2015): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern: Quentin Tarantino's eighth film plays like Reservoir Dogs in a blizzard cabin. It is an ugly picture of corruption and blood with nobody being who they say. Kurt Russell plays John ""the Hangman"" Ruth who is riding a stagecoach chain cuffed to his prisoner Daisy Domergue, played with fierce intensity by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Ruth has a reputation of bringing his bounties in alive so to watch them hang. Samuel L. Jackson plays Major Marguis Warren, another bounty hunter who hitches a ride with Ruth when his horse died. He has three bodies to deliver, which he ties to the roof. Soon they are joined by a forth person in Sheriff Chris Mannix, played by Walton Goggins. He is also headed to Red Rock but his story of being the new Sheriff draws questions. They arrive at a lodge where they shelter their horses from the blizzard but there are others settled in the lodge. Amongst them is General Sandy Smithers, played by Bruce Dern whose methods of dealing with African Americans during the Civil War draw a conflicting story from Warren. Tarantino presents the tension where nobody can be trusted and motive are questioned. There is extreme violence with blood splattering everywhere including Domergue's face, which is masked in crimson. It presents a small space where personalities clash and trust is scarce. Even more so is the absence of love, which none of these souls have known for a very long time. And it is set to be a very long winter for getting cozy with despair. Score: 9 / 10"

"ericrnolan","Null","3","5","17 December 2017"," I hated ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015)
","""The Hateful Eight"" (2015) might be the first Quentin Tarantino film that I entirely disliked. I'd rate it a 3 out of 10 for being an overlong, overwrought story inhabited exclusively by irritating, overly stylized characters who are constantly shouting. It was alternately boring and grotesque. It even managed to occasionally be glumly depressing, given the violence it depicts against defenseless innocents.<br/><br/>And I'm surprised, because this movie was highly recommended to me by my college-aged nephew - he's a smart kid whose judgment I trust. I certainly hope that he has seen Tarantino's classic ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992), as that movie seems to be this one's direct inspiration. Throughout ""The Hateful Eight's"" lengthy running time (it clocks in at just over three hours), I kept thinking that this was a failed effort to transplant ""Reservoir Dogs'"" story setup to the old west.<br/><br/>That probably was the director's strategy here. You see an attempt to recreate all of the story elements that made the earlier movie a success: quirky characters; idiosyncratic dialogue; unexpected violence; tragedy; and black humor.<br/><br/>Regrettably, it just didn't work. The movie was so long - and so loud - that it even made priceless performers like Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson and Tim Roth come off as annoying.<br/><br/>For me, the movie's sole bright spot was Jennifer Jason Leigh's damned terrific portrayal of the plot-driving, brutal gangster, Daisy Domergue. I had no idea that Leigh had such incredible range (not to mention some Vaudeville-style comic timing). Her performance isn't enough to redeem the movie, but it surprised me and easily stole the show.<br/><br/>Look - if this is the first Tarantino movie you've seen, then please don't let it dissuade you from seeing the man's other work. Seriously, go watch ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) or ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996).<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"
"Tweekums","8","3","5","5 April 2017"," A violent western from Tarantino
","Set in the middle of the winter in Wyoming, this western opens with Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, stopping a stage coach to ask for a ride to Red Rock. Aboard the coach are fellow bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue. Sometime later they pick up another passenger, Chris Mannix, a former Confederate soldier who claims that he is the new sheriff of Red Rock. Unable to get to town before a blizzard strikes they stop at Minnie's Haberdashery. Here they immediately think something is wrong; there is no sign of Minnie and the story told about her absence seems unlikely. Already there are Bob, a Mexican who claims to be running the establishment in Minnie's absence; Oswaldo Mobray, who claims to be the hangman heading to Red Rock; Joe Gage, who claims to be a cowboy going home to visit his mother and General Sandy Smithers, formerly of the Confederate Army.<br/><br/>Here tensions rise as Ruth is convinced that one of those men is there to free his prisoner. There is also tension between Warren, a black, former Union officer, and the two former confederates. It is only a matter of time before these tensions explode into bloody violence. Before the film is over many of those present will end up dead and we will learn what happened before the stage coach arrived at Millie's.<br/><br/>At two hours and forty minutes in length this film is certainly rather long but I never felt bored. The opening scenes did a fine job of introducing the various characters and telling us a little about them that makes the viewer wonder if what we are told is true in some cases it is and in some cases it isn't and not always in the cases we expect. The setting is great; a single room where everybody is trapped for the duration of the blizzard provides a sense of claustrophobia that increases the tension even more. It is very much a film of two halves; the first is tense but gently paced people talk but there is little violence. The second half is far more violent; this violence is very bloody and at times very shocking. The cast does a fine job; most notably Samuel L. Jackson as Major Warren, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue and Kurt Russell as John Ruth. As one would expect from a film from Quentin Tarantino this won't be for everybody and certainly isn't for younger viewers with its extreme violence and frequent use of the racist 'N-word' not that the film is racist, just some characters. Overall I'd recommend this for fans of Tarantino's other films."

Maybe 4 hour movie next time?<br/><br/>Is over the top violence still cool? Somehow he thinks that blowing heads away like in some straight to VHS flick is entertaining.<br/><br/>Did he bet with someone that he can make whites say N word as much as he wants? Seems like he's showing the world that there are things that only he can get away with.<br/><br/>Does he believe in mercy and justice? Bad guy should die just because he's bad despite that he's old and harmless, that's his logic.<br/><br/>All of them die or deadly injured, and all of them did something wrong. All but the sheriff. Did I miss something?<br/><br/>Or maybe the wrong thing about the sheriff is that he's white? <br/><br/>Tarantino can get the actors to act and he can get the cameraman to shoot nice shots, but is it that hard to find a decent script? Doesn't he feel that he's wasting all this talent and valuable 70mm panavision stock on a straight garbage of a story?"

","THE HATEFUL EIGHT: Quentin Tarantino has an imagination like no other. He wrote and directed. His characters are unique and well drawn. His dialogue is profane, earthy and real. His stories are, well, let's just say, 'different.' His direction is pretty straight forward and he lets his actors do what they were hired to do. I can't recall a single false note from anyone. MC may have stated it best when she said, ""After seeing a Tarantino movie, ya just wanna take a shower."" The less you know about the plot, the better because it unfolds rather like an Agatha Christie novel, and early on it had an 'Unforgiven' vibe. It's pretty slow-going for the first hour, but as one character says, ""be very patient"". That may be the operative word here. There is a lot of ground work to be laid, but patience does have its rewards with the last half filled with plot twists and Tarantino (I don't want to give anything away) 'business'. Everyone turns in a very strong performance, but Samuel L. Jackson is a standout followed closely by an unrecognizable Jennifer Jason Lee and a rousing Kurt Russell. An interesting side note: It has an old style opening with upfront credits and the closing credits are on cards instead of the usual crawl. There will probably be Oscar nominations for screenplay and direction and a good possibility for Jackson. Score: 8.5. GO. Best on an empty stomach."

"tjgoalie13","9","16","47","30 December 2015"," A Funny, Gory, Beautifully Shot Western
","Quentin Tarantino, whether you like his films or not, deserves credit as one of the best directors of our age, because his films are so consistently great. Tarantino's ""Hateful 8"" should be experienced as he intended, in 70mm film showings, because average theaters can't quite do the film justice. The Hateful 8 is blood covered fun, with a story that is surprisingly unpredictable, and features truly beautiful cinematography. A note for anybody not aware, Tarantino's films are extremely gory and feature strong language, so if you don't like that kind of subject matter, this film isn't for you.<br/><br/>Tarantino's is notorious for his use of gore and language, but he always finds a way to make it fun. The Hateful 8 is no exception as the film is both extremely gory, and often hilarious. One of the biggest reasons the film is so funny is Tarantino's iconic, and witty dialogue. It is widely discussed that Tarantino is one of the best writers of dialogue and ""The Hateful 8"" is a great showcase of that. <br/><br/>Before seeing the film, I was curious, because the film was advertised as a story of 8 people trapped in a cottage during a blizzard, while that is a part of the story, it is far larger than that. The best example is that entering the film Channing Tatum was confirmed to be in the film, and it seemed unclear what role he could have, however he has a pretty significant role in the film. In many ways the plot unfolds like a game of clue, and the story is unpredictable in what turns the plot will take next. The unpredictable plot helps save the almost 3 hour running time, which is a little too long.<br/><br/>An example of why the run time is just a little too long, is a lot of the film focuses on the cinematography, which is why the 70mm film showings are truly worth the time to see. Most of the film is set in the gorgeous snow covered mountains of Wyoming, and the use of 70mm film gives the entire film a sleek and classical look. While the film could have been tightened up a little, if there wasn't such a focus on the cinematography, the film would lose a little of the spectacle that makes it so special.<br/><br/>In the end The Hateful 8 is a spectacle, that should be experienced the way it was intended to, in a 70mm film showing. The film is beautiful, funny, unpredictable, and extremely violent, but it all blends in a very clean way. Tarantino has once again made a great film, and considering his resume, it seems logical to say that he is one of the best modern directors. If you like Tarantino's previous films, or films similar to Tarantino's it would be a good idea to check out The Hateful 8."

","There was not much to hate about Quentin Tarantino's latest chatty & blood filled cinematic offering ""The Hateful Eight"". The fact is that it's no Pulp Fiction, but ""The Hateful Eight"" is still unchained with plenty of charismatic basterds and unreserved dogly humanoids. Before you want me to kill the bill of puns that I am firing and will continue to fire, please read along so I could provide you my cuento on Quentin's latest. Tarantino returns to the western genre; this time focusing on eight nefarious characters trapped in a Wyoming cabin under a profound blizzard. Kurt Russell plays bounty hunter John Ruth who is chainly transporting a female convict named Daisy Domergue to hang in Red Rock. On their way, they come across a Capital One card and look for Samuel L. Jackson in the vicinity; give me a break, there is lots of cerebral cortex pun dysfunction in my brainy wallet. Anyways, Ruth & Daisy do come across Samuel playing Mayor Marquis Warren who desperately needs transport so he does not die due to the storm. Moreover, on their transport another hateful hitches on for a ride and that would be Sheriff Chris Mannix played by the latest Quentin regular Walton Goggins. So the hateful quarter reach the cabin and inside are the the not-so-better-half of the hateful eight which consists of Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), and Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth). What they are doing in the cabin is something I won't reveal in order not to be a hateful spoiler. Tarantino again delivers with witty and enigmatic direction & screen writing. The entire cast shined but my favorite was Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue; hope all turns out daisy for Jennifer Jason Leigh on Oscar night as she has just been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her exceptional performance. I will cease fire to my hateful puns and complete this review. But make sure your travels take you soon to ""The Hateful Eight"". You will love it! ***** Excellent"

","The Hateful Eight follows four hateful passengers and their stagecoach driver on their way to the town of Red Rock. Because of a terrible storm on their tails, the passengers are forced to stop at Minnie's Haberdashery and stay there for a few nights. There, they encounter four more hateful characters.<br/><br/>Because of how well-rounded this film is in almost all ways, The Hateful Eight deserves the full 10/10. The first half of the film is very character driven, with strong dialogue and great acting to help explain what each character is all about, where they are from, and who they are. The amount of hard work and time that Mr. Tarantino put into this screenplay is very apparent, and should definitely be recognized for creating yet another excellent screenplay. Throughout the entire film, racial issues are addressed and the tension between former union soldiers and confederate soldiers are apparent. Overall, the screenplay was very, very good all around. Mr. Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson did an excellent job capturing the snowy, mountainous surroundings around the Haberdashery, especially beautiful in 70mm film. The acting in The Hateful Eight is probably one of the strongest acting performances by all the characters as a whole that cinema has seen in a while. Samuel Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Demian Blichir, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern, none of them blockbuster names, all did spectacular jobs along with the other characters introduced in the film. Lastly, the original score by Ennio Morricone in this film was fantastic. From the opening shot to the last shot of the film, Morricone's eerie, suspicious music really set the tone throughout the entire film. The Hateful Eight easily could be one of Tarantino's top three films as of 2016.<br/><br/>Direction: 9/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Acting: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Screenplay: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 10/10"

","I went to see Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight last night at the 9:30 showing. With 2 hours and 47 minutes of stellar entertainment, I left the theatre after midnight, walking to my car in the dark parking lot, feeling energized despite the time and the cold of winter. And unlike Roy Orbison's song at the end credits, I wasn't among the many not coming home.<br/><br/>It played in auditorium 6, which has stadium seating and a larger screen. Very ideal for a film shot in the breathtaking 2.76:1 aspect ratio. I would have loved to see the Roadshow version of the film, which is only in select theatres – 50, the last I heard – which are retrofitted with 70mm film projectors. The roadshow version also includes an overture and an intermission. Although I didn't need an intermission; I was too mesmerized by The Hateful Eight's greatness.<br/><br/>As expected, Tarantino has not failed to disappoint. Aesthetically, The HateFul Eight is the best film of 2015. Here's an example: There's a scene at the end with Samuel L. Jackson lying on the bed in the background, and Walton Goggins resting on the floor in the foreground. There is a shallow depth of field, but both characters are in sharp focus. How is this possible? By using a diopter split-focus lens. This makes sense, since John Carpenter's The Thing – which Tarantino said was an inspiration for The Hateful Eight – uses this technique.<br/><br/>This film has one of the best opening credit sequences I have ever seen, and definitely the best for 2015. We see a barren, snow covered landscape, then a closeup of a large, erected Christian cross, then the camera pulls back while the credits are displayed, with a six-horse stage coach running through the frame. This is all scored by Ennio Morricone's ominous music. I agree with Tarantino's Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert comparison. The opening is so awesome, and such a great way to set the mood of the film, and I feel sorry for those who came in late.<br/><br/>Although very different in their techniques, I enjoyed the The Hateful Eight's cinematography more than Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant. Alejandro is also the director of 2014's Birdman, a film that was photographically superior, but with a story that didn't captivate me much. The Revenant is like Birdman with the use of fluid, steadicam shots, with a wide angle lens. <br/><br/>This film is similar to Tarantino's debut Reservoir Dogs, in that most of film takes place inside one room, but a haberdashery for The Hateful Eight rather than a warehouse. Two bounty hunters, a female prisoner, a stagecoach driver, and a future Sheriff make their way to Minnie's Haberdashery, where they meet four other characters. The nine are now shacked up together while they wait for the Wyoming blizzard to pass. They gradually grow more and more distrustful of each other. That's nine characters right there, and there are more to come, so who are The Hateful Eight? It is the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino, but I'm guessing the title is in reference to eight of the characters. Minus the female prisoner, there's eight for the first half of the film. Or if you were to minus the stagecoach driver, there's eight for the first of the film. Who comprises the eight hateful characters?<br/><br/>Filled with a plethora of story-telling and comical dialogue, and sudden bursts of extreme, yet often cartoonish violence, Tarantino's signature trademarks are in The Hateful Eight. The film forces us to multitask by listening to the lengthy talk of its characters while being stunned by the beautiful cinematography, and it's evident that Tarantino hasn't lost his touch. A masterpiece, which I'll be watching again and again.<br/><br/>http://www.stockofbabes.com/"

I was happy to see it in 2.76:1 ratio and it had some great snowy Wyoming imagery, but those two do not justify the hype. It was a mediocre movie from a director who is capable of much more. That said, I disagree with those reviewers who say 70mm is just for panoramic outdoor. It looks great in indoor shots too. Vivid, as QT says.

It *is* beautiful. Beautifully made. But Tarantino has this thing where he gets cocky and makes something boring. Jackie Brown and Death Proof, to be exact.<br/><br/>It's also a hateful movie. The characters of course, as you would expect. But also the tone itself. A great deal of anger against women, especially, and his endless use of the N word, which he should have tired of a long time ago."
"dtrofishon","5","14","40","25 December 2015"," The Roadshow Disappointed
","I'm a fan of Tarantino and appreciate the effort put into his other films. I really enjoyed Django and was hoping for more of the same things he did in that movie. I was excited to see that his Roadshow performance would be here close to me and I eagerly bought tickets early to the first show on Christmas Eve. We received cool collector programs and treated to a short overture, which built my excitement, but unfortunately that was followed by 3 hours of boredom. I think Tarantino's quirkiness was way overboard for this film, none of the characters were believable and the story line was weak. Aside from the stunning cinematography (helped in part by the 70mm format) and the award winning performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh, this was a stinker and I would recommend steering clear of this one. <br/><br/>One other thing...I may have missed it, but I didn't see a Cameo from Tarantino in this film, which I was surprised by."

","I never saw Django Unchained, but I didn't want to miss The Hateful Eight. The title is a play on the western The Magnificent Seven. It was a western and also a murder mystery. Has the story slowly evolves, and the twist and turns. I don't want to tell you anymore, it's one off those movies you half to see to believe.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino really shines here, with such clever dialog, and beautiful western setting. The actors really come alive, Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson shine incredibly, so do Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tim Roth are also good. If you don't like violence, then you should probably stay away. But I was entertained by this. Tarantino pays homage to his film Reservoir Dogs in spots."
"ldbellhayden","8","7","17","2 February 2016"," Unrecognized greatness from Tarantino
","Listen close when I say it is absolutely criminal for this to not have been nominated for more, and of course I know that it was nominated for three Oscars (while I don't think Jennifer Jason Leigh is that deserving of a nomination), but there were so many categories I thought this movie would make it into. First and foremost Tarantino is a bit of a scumbag and conceded, and while it gets annoying when he does interviews about his movies, he is still a brilliant writer, and has such a unique style that is so appreciated, and I think at this point everyone just comes to expect greatness from Tarantino. I am no Tarantino fan-boy mind you, this movie has flaws, for example I think the character of Joe Gage was unnecessary, but man was this written well! And everyone keeps talking about how racist the Oscars are and mentioning Straight Outta Compton, and the lack of non white actors being nominated, and there's a fantastic actor, Samuel L Jackson, just begging for a nomination. A lot of people are really Hateful(pun intended) on this movie when it really is up there with Tarantino's other films, everyone should check it out because it is the best adaptation of Clue we will probably ever see."

"a_chinn","10","4","8","27 July 2019"," Tarantino's bloody western chamber piece is more Agatha Christie than Sergio Leone or John Ford
","Terrific western from writer/director Quentin Tarantino is unexpectedly more Agatha Christie than John Ford. Bounty Hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth, played by the always wonderful and sadly underused Kurt Russell, is taking in wanted criminal Daisy Domergue, the also amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh, to hang. However, a blizzard forces them to hold up at a way station with a band of nefarious types, one or more of whom aren't who they say they are and are likely looking to free Daisy. In ""And Then There Were None"" fashion, character begin to get offed, and to reveal much more of the plot would ruin the fun of the film. Like most Tarantino films, this one is likely not going to be for all tastes, even if the film features a stellar cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson as a fellow bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tarantino even casts Matt Houston himself, Lee Horsley, as a stagecoach driver, great plotting, terrific suspense, shocking moments of violence, and as you would expect from a Tarantino film, some incredibly sharp dialogue. Comparing this film to Tarantino's other work, this one seems closest to ""Reservoir Dogs"" in the sense that it's a bunch of characters stuck in a confined space doing a lot of talking and tough guy posturing, leading up to a bloody climax. And boy it is a wildly bloody climax, courtesy of special effect maestro Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. But since Dogs, Tarantino has matured as a director and continues to top himself each time out, branching out and challenging himself with something new and different with each new film and ""The Hateful Eight"" is no different. Also of note, the film features composer Ennio Morricone's first western score in many years and also his first American film score in quite some time (his last was ""Ripley's Game"" in 2002). It's a strangely moody score when I was expecting a score filled with crazy stings and whistles, ALA Sergio Leone or Sergio Corbucci. Morricone's score is more along the lines of his score for John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" which this film actually uses some tracks from. But the highlight of nearly all of Tarantino's film is his dialogue and this film features more verbal sparring matches than any of his films, which is endlessly delightful. From the his first film, with Mr. White and Mr. Blond facing each other down (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie? Or are you gonna bite?""), it was clear that Tarantino knew how to use dialogue to build tension, and his skills have only gotten better since then. The way characters play with one another, trying to outsmart and outwit one another is endlessly watchable. And upon a second viewing of the film and the dialogue can be reinterpreted and takes on new meaning once the audience knows character motivations and where the story is heading. Thematically, I think Tarantino has always played with genres but with this film is commenting on modern race relations through this tale of violent bounty hunters in a post-Civil War old west. It's the racial tensions following the Civil War that Tarantino uses to put the ugly views on race front and center that you can today hear on cable news or read online just about anytime you want. Of all his films, this one seems his most mature and I think arguable his best. Still, like most of his film, they are not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're a film buff, Tarantino's film vocabulary that he infuses into each of his films is utterly intoxicating."

","I know it is not popular of me to say this. But Tarantino has been going downhill for a long time to me. He can not outdo himself with violence any longer, and his glory days I remember from the 1990s and the early 2000's are just not going to come back. So what does he do ? He takes a western, throws in the classic, ""Who is really who?"" plotline that has been done a thousand times, and he does not provide a good twist with it either. Chances are, you will have it figured out before the last half hour of a pointlessly long film.<br/><br/>To top if off, he has to throw in racial slurs every five seconds. About the millionth time I had to hear it, it was like, ENOUGH ALREADY.<br/><br/>I know Tarentino blabbered with endless justifications in interviews about the ending, but there is no art or point to be made with it. Just Tarentino violence and him trying to out do himself.<br/><br/>It is sad that he took an all star cast, a plot that could have been good, and ruined it. I used to be a fan of Tarantino in the 1990s. Perhaps, I grew up and got mature enough that I actually would rather have substance over pointless vulgarity and violence."
"camp0619","8","12","34","5 January 2016"," C'mon Quentin
","Let me just start by saying that this film is just like boiling a pot of water. It may seem like an odd analogy, but it sums this movie up perfectly. You put it on your stovetop and patiently wait for it to come to a boil. Its boring and uneventful, until those bubbles begin to appear. Except with The Hateful Eight, the pot never reaches its boil. The bubbles begin to appear after a while, but that pot of water never comes to a full boil. Let me just say that I opted for the 70mm screening, which looked beautiful no doubt, and was a cool experience. But man oh man. You better bring a good pillow and a blanket, as this sucker will set you back over 3 hours, 3 hours of boring dialogue and characters with a try too hard plot. Not to mention, the whole thing takes place in a room, minus the first 15 minutes. This would work if the story, script and characters were better. Things do start to sizzle a bit in the third act, but it's still very underwhelming. This movie is so long, there's an intermission. Thats right, you heard it, AN INTERMISSION. This isn't The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It's The Hateful Eight. Which is a pretentious, boring, 3 hour long opus that screams ""Quentin Tarentino trying too hard."" <br/><br/>And OK, all of you are going to say ""you just don't appreciate good cinema"" or ""you just didn't get what Quentin was trying to capture"" blablabla. I'm just as much of a cinema buff as the rest of you, but The Hateful Eight is easily Quentin's worst movie. Stay home, rent it, save the trip and your money. This movie is not nearly as good as his previous movies. In my opinion, maybe Quentin should give his head a shake, dust off ye ol' ego of his, and get back to making great movies that don't rely on hipster 70mm projection gimmicks and roadshow theatrical releases."

","This increasing bloodiness -- and the anticipation of it -- is getting kind of tiresome, as far as I'm concerned, yet Grand Guignol seems to be rising from its grave, rotting and dripping, even as we speak.<br/><br/>This is an episodic Western, chopped up into non-sequential blocks, rather like the bodies on comic display. It's the goriest Western I've ever seen. By the time it's over, not only are all the dead and the few living bodies covered with blood, but the floor of Minnie's Haberdashery, a shabby merchant store marooned in a fierce blizzard atop a snowy mountain, is an inch deep in blood.<br/><br/>People die in various ways. There's the hanging of a woman with the camera on her venomous bloodied face as she strangles to death, a lot of shooting deaths, a black guy gets his head blown off with a shotgun, a man is stabbed to death, two or three poisonings with gallons of gore in each vomit, a man whose head disintegrates under a couple of bullets before our eyes. Some deaths are in slow motion. All are served up with relish. It's kind of ""The Outcasts of Poker Flat"" except everybody winds up mincemeat.<br/><br/>There are wince-inducing anachronisms. The MF word, a couple of expressions, and so forth. Some fine and witty acting can't save this mishmash. The score by Ennio Morricone comes close to it. The story isn't always easy to follow, and someone ought to spank Quentin Tarrantino, but if you want to see people die on screen, this is where the path will lead you."
"blankenshipdk","4","6","14","9 February 2016"," A Left Over Spaghetti Western
","When I saw the Cinerama logo at the start of this film I was reminded of childhood visits to the Cinerama theater to catch classics like "" How The West Was Won "". Any resemblance between vintage Hollywood western epics and this dialog heavy excursion into self indulgence would be purely coincidental. Why 70mm mode would be used for a movie that essentially takes place in one room is baffling. The characters are pastiches of western archetypes, which may be the point, but they eventually grow tiresome from intractable dialog rather than by being fully fleshed out by it. The premise of the story involves an alleged evil criminal as portrayed by the essentially lone female character ( there are a couple of other minor females who are quickly dispatched ) who is systematically abused right up to the conclusion of the saga by her captors, yet the failure to convincingly demonstrate any reason for disliking her actually results in generating sympathy towards her. Based on the budget for this flick, would it have been too much to ask for a flashback to graphically depict her rottenness so we can get on board with the misogyny? Instead we're treated to a vignette from the past that can best be described as soft core gay porn. The cast is first rate and the opening action sequences are impressive, but three hours plus is too much time in a log cabin interior during a snowstorm with this set up. The continuity of the tale is also occasionally jarred abruptly by a narrator which seems to be an afterthought. I could have given this movie 5 or maybe 6 stars but then I found out that a rare old Martin guitar was destroyed during one scene because someone forgot to insert the prop, hence a four star rating is as magnanimous as I can get."

Same 'old man' refused to talk to black guy and ""hates nigaars"" one moment then the next moment he's having a personal conversation with Samuel and reminiscing on the past... Viewers constantly confused by self-conflicting dialogue. Awful script garbage from someone who is supposed to be a world-renowned director.<br/><br/>NOT TO MENTION that the entire motive for the assassin's elaborate plan is simple ""sibling love"". This cliché motive is used in this movie and we as viewers are supposed to believe that four assassins are willing to give their lives to the cause of rescuing this ""captured"" girl and spend an entire day pretending to be other people and lying about their identities until finally just shooting the guy.

The one thing I had a hard time getting around is (Spolier) John Ruth's (Kurt Russel)death early on in the film (about 1hr 35min). The soundtrack was beyond excellent and the dialouge was phenomenal.

","I am sorry that I did not see Hateful 8 in the movie theater even though it was my intention to do so. I had been waiting for it for months and knew it was filmed right here in Colorado and I love Tarantino. But when it did get released, It was dead of winter and we had just seen The Revenant which came out at the same time and to be honest, I really didn't want to see another flick that takes place in the freezing cold. So, we waited until Spring and we saw it on Netflix last night. This man never disappoints to thread together an amazing story. You may have your own opinions about Tarantino's penchant for using ridiculously extreme violence to the point of being silly. You hate it, or love it. I get it. But even that aside, his ability to take you on a journey to meet twisted characters and how their story develops, and his incorporation of novelty and the fun of unanswered questions is truly unparalleled by any film maker out there. Tarantino's films have not gotten the credit due since, let's face it, Pulp Fiction, because Pulp Fiction was his first true masterpiece that just lingers in our brains and leaves a very high bar of expectation. I give this film 10 stars out of 10, not because it is a perfect movie, it isn't. But it is so dang entertaining and such a great and fun tale, it simply is just about as good as entertainment gets."

But it is done SO good, that at running time almost 3 hours i was involved, intrigued and engaged with a story very much. Script is great as usual, acting is electrifying by all involved, music is haunting, directing is very solid. As much as i enjoyed ""Django Unchained"", which is more epic in every way, i have to admit that finally ""The Hateful Eight"" involved me more into the story - sometimes less i better.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie. It has a very simple yet jigsaw type of plot, great performances, amazing and involving writing. ""The Hateful Eight"" is much more serious in tone then ""Django Unchained"" and is much more closer to ""Dogs"". All in all this is a great movie on all accounts."

","Very interesting film, quite liked it. Action was top notch, a bit too naturalism for my taste. Great use of characters and setting. Particularly strong was the Major, played by Samuel Jackson. Somehow he managed to be a foil for every other character in the film, and the actors had great chemistry. This is by far the best partnership between Tarantino and Jackson. Regardless, the rest of the cast were also fantastic, the characters colourful, with plenty to do and plenty to think about. Then there was the action, which let the tension build up gradually to a bloody climax, and it is to Tarantino's credit that he managed to introduce so much violence and draw out the action so much with only a handful of characters."
"will_dale37","4","9","24","9 January 2016"," Some good, some bad & some ugly
","The H8ful Eight starts off with some eerily placid shots of a snow covered landscape. The camera slowly pans over a wooden crucifix stuck in the ground accompanied by a very cool score by Ennio Morricone; full of impending dread, which made me grin with anticipation of the suspense to come. <br/><br/>I'm thinking the artfully tense opener of Inglorious Basterds and the violence foreshadowing in Django Unchained. <br/><br/>Unfortunately most of what follows is slow, uninspired and underwritten. There isn't an ounce of suspense in this flick and therefore it becomes boring to watch and is even quite irritating in parts. The sounds of a stagecoach driver whipping and yelling at his horses and the persistent howling winds could have provided extra stress to ratchet up a tense atmosphere but here it just becomes an annoyance without any semblance of drama to build on. Same goes for the events early on in Minnie's menagerie as the guests are getting themselves acquainted. It's all a bit tedious. The fireside scene between Bruce Dern and Walton Goggins felt unusually dull given that these are good actors reciting a Tarantino script. But without context or suspense this kind of historical dialogue is uninteresting. It's no Jules & Vincent talking about burgers.<br/><br/>A sudden narration by QT himself about halfway in is just weirdly jarring and amateurish. It feels like a lazy way of telling a story. Cheap tricks were never used in Pulp Fiction which instead favoured to respect an audience's intelligence and allow them to figure out the chronology of a scene all by themselves. Perhaps the idea of skipping back and forth in time within the confines of a single room without stabilisers seemed either a stretch too far on the viewers intellect or lack of ability on the storytellers part. Tarantino is far too smart a writer and way too much of a film buff to disrespect his audience like that so perhaps the script leak early on had something to do with lack of refinement, who knows. Recent press interviews with the director suggest this may have been the case.<br/><br/>The over use of the Word 'nigger' once again is becoming childish, not to mention the splatter. But I guess these are now Tarantino hallmarks whether you love it or hate it. And a strange monologue by Sam Jackson's Major Warren in which he recounts a tale of racism and ""retribution"" seemed utterly repugnant when it was probably supposed to feel cathartic. It seemed a lot like Tarantino's awkward way of saying I love black people and all you racists can suck this guys big black d#@k. It's not racial politics it's just Quentin declaring his love for the black man. Quite sweet really when you think about it. I do love the guy actually, He certainly means well which is why I will always watch his films.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is still some fun to be had here what with the stellar cast and quirky dialogue. Samuel L Jackson is very amusing to watch. Tim Roth is cool with a beard and does a nice job too, he's a good actor. But it is Jennifer Jason Leigh that lifts this film, she is quite a menacing presence. Her character has a true evil streak and definitely a lot more could have been made of her part. I would have enjoyed to see her calculatingly slaughter the entire Hateful bunch single handedly. <br/><br/>Other positives include a beautiful stagecoach trundling along. People eating a hearty stew with big wooden spoons, yum. A funny Mexican accent and a deliriously bloody ending. <br/><br/>Go see it if you like QT's films. You probably already have."

Yeah, the scenic shots were beautiful, but ... that was a very small part of the movie.<br/><br/>It ended fine. In the spirit of a typical Greek tragedy, because it was definitely not a comedy. Perhaps his art is lost on me, because I only really like one movie of his. The others are OK, but Pulp Fiction is the only one I'd go out of my way to watch. This didn't add to that list.<br/><br/>I'd rather have gratuitous t&a than the violence. I'm not squeamish, but the poison scene was a little bit on the excessive side.

Quent is famous for his dialogue but nothing memorable here. Some decent performances from the cast got this a 3/10. Shame, as I love a good western"
"danielnikrasov","10","2","3","18 August 2019"," The Magnificent Eight- Credit should be given to maestro Ennio Morricone
","""The Hateful Eight"" always been my Tarantino's favorite film since my first viewing (at home). The atmosphere, the acting, the production design, and most of all is the score by Maestro himself Ennio Morricone. This is kind of (western) noir film you shouldn't miss.<br/><br/>As the film opens, my favorite first scene already gives me creeps. Not gonna lie, Ennio's score at the beginning is the best thing that happened and I'm addicted so bad to ""L'Ultima Diligenza di Red Rock"", a threatening crescendo that is reminiscent of horror movies, and in best Morricone style, towards the middle, it explodes, and transports the central theme he suggested to Tarantino: the ride of a carriage towards an uncertain future, in an atmosphere of menace. The oboes play joyously and add to the creeping up of the coming mayhem. A real Morricone thriller, but not so much in spaghetti western tradition.<br/><br/>This is a thrilling, bloody and brutal film that is a blast from start to finish mixing together genres Western, Mystery and Action. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino made a film that is a companion piece to his previous films like Inglorious Bas. and Django which are very much alike in scope, tone and look and if you seen all QT's pieces, it has all of the known elements: rich dialogues, the top of brutality and memorable characters that will stay with you for the rest of your life. It has also a great companion to Reservoir Dogs in terms of structure to this film, in which a bunch of strangers are together in one place where there is distruct and controversies between the characters but this time take place in the 19th century.<br/><br/>The screenplay and direction by Tarantino is strong and fantastic with bringing his own usual flair, look and atmosphere to the film like his previous.<br/><br/>The cast is magnificent starring: Sam Jackson is excellent as always as Marquis Warren, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins are terrific. Roth, Maddsen, Bichir, Tatum and Dern as a cast ensemble are great in one film.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film 10 out'a 10 because Tarantino hasn't done something like this before (except his style stays the same). Bravo!"

","QT latest is just a rehash of dialog and plot point he has made in his other (and better) films. I don'y mind violence by QT seems to only care about violence and when he can he seems to love to throw in a scene when some gets raped or about to be raped. Can he ever deliver a film that is not violent? <br/><br/>What this film is about<br/><br/>While racing toward the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) encounter another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and a man who claims to be a sheriff. Hoping to find shelter from a blizzard, the group travels to a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass. Greeted there by four strangers, the eight travelers soon learn that they may not make it to their destination after all.<br/><br/>A better film could have been made in 1/2 the amount of screen time. The plot points can all stay the same but QT does not see his limits. <br/><br/>This film did not do great at the Box Office and QT blames Disney for the poor box office. That is really not true. If the film was better it would have gotten more business. ""The Force Awakens"" did not take away the audience. What kept away the audience was a 3 hour long film that offered nothing exciting. The Die Hard QT fans will thumbs down my review. They will never admit that this film was a major letdown!"
"elenaphysics","1","2","3","12 July 2017"," What an epic fail
","I usually like Tarantino's movies. Not all of them. But still I like them because they are fast and interesting. usually. This movie was almost 3 hours long. 3 hours of my life lost, watching this horrible movie. Let us begin. The movie was advertised to bring a new movie experience. But the whole movie is either in the snow or at Minnie's haberdashery. I don't even know what that means. So, you are not going to watch something with at least decent cinematography. The plot is really simple. Really simple. There is no plot actually. People want to save the woman who is about to be hanged. It doesn;t go according to plan. End of story. The only thing Tarantino promised and he accomplished, was creating truly hateful characters. Can I make a break and say that I NEVER NEVER EVER LIKED SAMUEL JACKSON??? I feel that he destroys every movie he is on. He is hateful in any movie he played actually. And the whole thing with the colonel's son was outrageous. Why did Tarantino make such an upsetting scene? No reason to. Anyway, there are 2 actors I actually like in this movie. Kurt Russel ( who doesn't like Kurt Russel?) and Tim Roth. Kurt Russel played in Deathproof . Tim Roth and Michael Marsden were in Reservoir dogs. We can also see Zoe Bell who is most of Tarantino's films. But this movie was stupid. It has nothing to do with reservoir dogs or any other of his movies. But I honestly believe that Tarantino is indeed clever. I believe he intended to make a movie as horrible as this one. It is slow and unwatchable. Still the ratings are good. Why? Because it is a Tarantino movie. A movie he came close to stop shooting it even if he thought of it years ago. So that makes me thinking that the destroyed his own movie on purpose. For me the experience was wtf did I just watch? For those who haven't seen it yet , you are about to watch a dull, boring movie, about people you don't even care what will happen to them because they are hateful.You just hate them. You don't care. And they will all die, the most stupid way possible."

"mtrburrows","6","1","1","4 August 2018"," A wasted opportunity?
","Before seeing the hateful eight, if you were to offer me a Tarantino movie, set in western times about a group of characters trapped inside a cabin and having to bounce off each other with signature Tarantino dialogue and writing, I would have bitten your hand off! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Hateful Eight doesn't get good until the second half of the movie, where Samuel L Jackson delivers an iconic, hilarious monologue that rivals the likes of Jules' ""vengeance"" speech in pulp fiction. After this point, the Tarantino-isms truly kick into gear, and the suspense, the wit, the gore, and the characters truly shining and being some of Tarantino's best work, with Warren and Mannix being the stand-outs. <br/><br/>However, what makes this film so frustrating is the incredibly tiresome, boring, and irrelevant first half, which definitely should have been cut down, not only to make the film better over all, but to increase the rewatch value. Out of all the Tarantino movies I've seen so far, I feel I am least likely to revisit this one, with its nearly 3 hour run time and monotonous first half, which feels like another writer trying to imitate Tarantino's style, rather than an actual Tarantino movie. <br/><br/>If you were to take one thing from this review, I would say completely skip the first hour and 20 minutes or so to where Samuel L Jackson delivers a speech about his ""big black pecker"" and watch the chaos from there! But because of that first half, I feel the Hateful Eight is one of Tarantino's weaker projects, or at the very least the most frustrating."

I would have liked to see a shorter movie and more great use of this old Ben-Hur movie lens outdoor. Do not get me wrong the indoor shoots are great in many ways but after watching Ben Hur and the frames in that movie, well there are no comparison. The movie for me could have been shorter that would have made it more exiting. In hole I do not like this movie but Im going to watch it again maybe I like it more ?"
"darkness_visible","Null","13","39","3 January 2016"," My attempt at an even handed review
","I have had mixed feelings about Tarantino and his films since the outset. I don't like his his world-view (sadists are cool, victims are contemptible) and think he's a one-trick-pony whose every film relies on a single mechanism (manipulating the audience into applauding cruel violence). But, that said, I can hardly deny the fact that Tarantino was a seminal voice of late 20th century cinema, and that some of the fan-boy adulation is warranted. <br/><br/>Regarding Tarantino as a persona, for me the elephant in the room is how sad it is that an obviously gay man is not brave enough (in 2016!) to come out, when he would be celebrated with hysterical adulation were he to do so. Instead he makes film after film that manage to be camp as a row of tents yet grotesquely homophobic at the same time. <br/><br/>On to the film. The old Hollywood saw says that ""a movie with a message is like a gift with the price tag still on"". Well, The Hateful Eight is like a vulgar nouveau riche snob swanning into a poor relative's humble home, bestowing a gift far too expensive to be reciprocated, then going on and on about exactly how much it cost. <br/><br/>We all got the message - America's history of slavery and its relationship to the civil war has cast long shadows that affect black/white relations in the US to this day. The symbolism could hardly be more on-the-nose. All 4 of the horses of the stagecoach for Caucasians were black, but SLJ had a black horse and a white horse working together. And there was a chess board with black and white pieces, but only white men ever sat in the two chairs. And the single Mexican character said people had tried to teach him the rules but they never stuck, nevertheless he wouldn't mind watching from the sidelines etc. etc. <br/><br/>Regarding the overuse of the n word: kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for turning down the role of Daisy. I can sort of visualise that meeting - she took one look at Daisy's first line, ""Howdy n****r"", and said ""Um, what are the shoot dates? Oh no, the thing is, I might have a headache on those days, but thanks for considering me"". <br/><br/>Anyway, the film overall was a fairly entertaining, modestly clever, sensationalist genre film, and usually I like those. If it had been an hour shorter, and shot by some scrappy teenagers on a budget of $90k (or even $350k as an upper estimate) like Raimi's The Evil Dead, I would be praising The Hateful Eight to the skies. But it wasn't made under those circumstances - it was made on a budget of $44 million by a veteran Hollywood darling director with every resource imaginable at his disposal. <br/><br/>What annoyed me most was the preposterous decision to shoot what was effectively a stage play on 65mm film. That's like hiring a supertechnocrane to film a pack shot. There weren't even that many wide shots - whole 15 minute sections of the film were pretty much just MCU singles and 2 shots filmed in studio. <br/><br/>I can only imagine that it was a deliberate industry in-joke that Tarantino decided to make a movie that was almost completely ""tell, don't show"". The script went:<br/><br/>Actor: You don't know about (character X)? Well I'll tell you about (character X).<br/><br/>or,<br/><br/>Another actor: Hey, don't I know you? You're (character Y). Didn't you (blah blah blah) at (blah)?<br/><br/>In fact it was nearly all verbal exposition, right the way through to the end of the film.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting. Well, they're all great actors, so I can only take it that they were delivering their performances as per Tarantino's direction. But the absurd macho posturing by everyone involved (including Jennifer Jason Leigh) ended up looking like a bunch of drag queens throwing shade in a vogue femme dramatics battle. <br/><br/>To paradoxically counter that, the most egregious homophobia in this one was SLJ's goading of Bruce Dern's character with the anecdote (amazingly, some back-story actually shown on screen, presumably to allow Tarantino to get in some ""shocking"" full frontal male nudity) about forcing his son to suck his dick, as if a white man having to suck a black man's cock were the *most* humiliating and shameful thing that any human being has ever had to do. Of course we understand that this is how SLJ's character hoped Bruce Dern's character would consider the scenario, but I don't fully buy it - it seemed more to me like the same projection of Tarantino's own internal homophobia that he has trotted out in pretty much every one of his films so far as a sort of public therapy session on a transparent throwaway account. <br/><br/>I can imagine Tarantino sitting down thinking: OK, I've got grind-house, I've got spaghetti western, I've got blaxploitation. But something's missing I know, let's throw in a chronology shift, a bit of voice-over (uncredited of course, in my new ""manly"" voice that I can pull off for a few seconds at a time), and see something we've already seen, but from a different angle. Ah god, there are no car boots available... oh, I know, let's have that guy Charly hide in the coal bunker so I can get a low angle shot of someone opening the door from the outside. I've got two more films to do to get to 10 which seems like an iconic number - I guess I can stretch these elements out until then - if it worked once, repeat it, that's what I always say (and do). <br/><br/>Overall The Hateful Eight was not bad - acceptably entertaining in fact - but it was certainly not good, and definitely not worthy of its current 8.1 stars. I'm giving it 5 out of 10 because it was just OK and nothing more or less."

","Hateful Eight was more like a stage play than a movie.

Rare for me to exit a movie.<br/><br/>You'll be disappointed if your expecting a ""classic"" Western. This film was shallow and boring. It has a very slow pacing and drags along with pointlessly extensive dialogues,shameless use of the 'N' word. The story-line too inconsistent with no particularly likable character.<br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful,cinematography stellar to say the least.<br/><br/>There are eight bad guys that find shelter at Minnie's haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard. Characters played by Samuel Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and James Parks. All are scoundrels in one way or another determined to ride out this blizzard and fulfill whatever dirty deeds they have in mind. For sure greed,merciless revenge,racial tensions are abounding.<br/><br/>Early on there is one scene that replays 3 to 4 times where different characters have to use two pieces of board to nail shut a door that would otherwise blow open during the blizzard....Boring. No wonder the film was 3 hours long.<br/><br/>In any event I certainly don't regret my decision to leave especially since hearing of the extremely bloody carnage.

When a blizzard hits, they find themselves stuck in a cold tavern with want-a-be Sheriff (Talton Googins - ""Django""), an aging General (Bruce Dern), and several questionable personalities (Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir, Channing Tatum).

Jennifer Jason Leigh is all the buzz here for her performance as she is beat-up, spit out and chewed up time and time again. As 2015 becomes the year of ""ensemble"" work, the cast here is performing at their individual and ensemble all time high. Could this film have been shorter? Yes! Could this film have done without all the usage of the ""N"" word? Yes! Could this film have done without all the blood and guts? Of course! But, then it wouldn't be a Tarantino film.

","Quentin Tarantino is back with his eighth film and his second foray into the world of the western with his typically familiar dialogue driving this thrilling whodunit of sorts, backed up by a score that takes the audience on a time warp to the yesteryear of cinema. To put it simply, this is as good a Quentin Tarantino film as any before it, with every little detail carefully included into the whole spectacle, creating an event for the audience that is both fun and special. I got an awesome surprise when my flatmate came back from Bali with a copy of 'The Hateful Eight', but immediately coming to the conclusion that it was going to be poor quality. I readied myself for a viewing in the traditional manner but with the DVD's quality top shelf I settled in for an afternoon on the couch to witness the three hour extravaganza.<br/><br/>Growing up with Tarantino, his films have become a voice for the X Generation. His way of presenting his work to the audience personifies 'cool', fabricating many memorable scenes that have stayed with all of us throughout our lives. The narratives that have been the linchpin of some truly special movies still submit a strong voice and there isn't a day that goes by without somebody in the big wide world mentioning a Tarantino moment. The great thing about all this is that the iconic Director doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Why would you when you have been at the helm of classics like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" that are now well entrenched in Hollywood folklore and the more recent productions, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"", considered to be his best work.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' is a risky film for Tarantino. He has taken a step into a genre that is a little unfamiliar but with perseverance, simplicity and rising to the challenge, this new installment under the Tarantino banner has just as many memorable moments as the films that have come before it.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' signals its arrival with an eerily sombre score from legendary spaghetti western composer, Ennio Morricone, highlighting the Director's obvious pulling power when it comes to employing the very best. The industry want to work with him and want to be apart of the whole set-up.<br/><br/>Set in a very bitter Wyoming winter just after the American Civil War, a stagecoach is hurling itself through the snow before it is stopped by a bounty hunter going by the name of Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). ""Got room for one more?"" And so it begins with the audience quickly introduced to John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his vicious little prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), with the famous Tarantino banter immediately coming hard and fast. The three actors have fun dishing out the dialogue with Quentin's main man, Sammy L, letting loose to give his character the authentic charm that it commands. Jackson is made for these flavoursome productions and it is his presence that the other talent feed off. Kurt Russell is amusingly brilliant but little Jennifer provides the biggest punch as the very 'polite' Domergue. Ninety percent of the film is shot entirely in a cabin in the middle of nowhere but it provides the perfect backdrop for what unfolds. It is the ultimate showdown for Tarantino's vast array of suspect characters and it provides sparkling and amusing entertainment. Tim Roth and Michael Madsen return to the world of 'cool' playing suspicious men, Oswaldo Mobray and Joe Gage respectively, with Roth particularly watchable, throwing himself into his role. Cameo appearances by 'old timer' Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum round off the star quality but like all of Tarantino films, 'The Hateful Eight's' greatest achievement doesn't lie in the narratives plot; no, no, no. It's the glorious ride that the audience endues. It's the interaction between the awesomely crafted characters that brings the punters to the box office.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' is great viewing. It is quintessentially Tarantino but to some fans it may not be the right fit for their expectations. The film burns slow but with a little patience it does provide the usual violence and gore that we have come to know from a film of this calibre. Look for a wonderful little rendition of an old convict ballad by Daisy Domergue that only heightens my suspicion that the Director is mad about everything Australian. This is a mature film for a mature audience."

","The Hateful Eight is a pretty straightforward film about 9 people stuck in a cabin in the middle of a blizzard in which hilarity and violence ensue. WARNING - the title of this flick accurately describes the personality of the characters. If you do not like films where there is only despicable and horrible human beings, this movie is not for you. This movie is wonderful in the fact that it is presented almost as a play in which there are few sets and heavily dialogue based. Which is the perfect setting for Tarantino to excel in his craft of witty dialogue and it does shine through. I do not want to delve too much into the story because that takes away the fun of watching everything unfold.<br/><br/>THE MAJOR PLAYERS (5 Best):<br/><br/>Director & Screenwriter - Quentin Tarantino (Best 3 Credits - Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill)<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh (Best 3 Credits - Weeds, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and The Spectacular Now)<br/><br/>Walton Goggins (Best 3 Credits - Justified, Sons of Anarchy, and Django Unchained)<br/><br/>Composer - Ennio Morricone (Best 3 Credits - Once Upon a Time in the West, The Thing, The Good The Bad and the Ugly)<br/><br/>Cinematographer - Robert Richardson (Best 3 Credits -Kill Bill, Platoon, Django Unchained)<br/><br/>HONORABLE MENTIONS - Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful in the movie as he is in pretty much everything he does. I love Zoe Bell and honestly believe he is Tarantino's new muse. She was perfect at playing the sweet-hearted Six-Horse Judy. My favorite honorable mention is James Parks who almost stole the movie with his hilarious character.<br/><br/>MVP - Walton Goggins needs to be a bona fide A-Lister after his performance in The Hateful Eight. He was by far the bet aspect of The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT - See it in Theaters as soon as possible<br/><br/>If you like other Quentin Tarantino movies or The Thing (original), you will like this movie as well."

","Apparently there's some unhappy feelings around Quentin Tarantino's 8th motion picture. I can see why. Tarantino's latest movie is a movie specialized for the fans. I can't imagine how weird this movie must feel when you haven't seen movies like Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, because this movie is a gift for the fans of Quentin who loves Ennio Morricone, Samuel Jackson and long, moody dialogs. I can agree that Tarantino doesn't challenge Hollywood and himself as much as he could. But when it's Tarantino i'm watching, i want Tarantino. <br/><br/>Without revealing too much of the plot i can tell that The Hateful Eight circles around 8 strangers. The first one we meet is Major Marquis Warren(Samuel L. Jackson) in the cold. After his horse collapsed, he has to hike with another fellow bounty hunter: John Ruth(Kurt Russell), and his travel companion: the wanted criminal: Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock where they have different kinds of business. On this trip they get another companion, as Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins), a man who claims he's the new sheriff in Red Rock appears in the cold. Because of an ongoing blizzard who concerns the travelers, they have to take shelter in Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive, Ruth, Warren, Domergue and Mannix meets 4 other strangers: Oswaldo Mobray(Tim Roth), Mexican Bob(Demian Bichir), Joe Gage(Michael Madsen) and Sandy Smithers(Bruce Dern). John Ruth on the other hand, suspects that one or more of the other travelers has some desires to stop him of delivering Domergue to the authorities and claim his 10.000 dollars. This and history between some of the strangers, is some of the complications the 8 strangers have to deal with.<br/><br/>The title itself seems like a wordplay of the movie: The Magnificent Seven, but i don't think Tarantino tries to be classic 1930's-western. He is well aware of his own trademarks, and how he uses them. It has also been a long time since i have seen Samuel L. Jackson in this form. His performance as Major Marquis Warren was overlooked at the Oscars, and should be remembered as one of his best performances. Kurt Russell is amazing as John Ruth «The Hangman». Jennifer Jason Leigh got a deserved Oscar-nominee. Walton Goggins is one of the most promising stars in Hollywood right now and does a fine job. Demian Bichir is one of the funniest roles in the movie but unfortunately he gets a bit forgotten because of few lines and the other actors. Tim Roth does possibly the best role in the movie as Oswaldo Mobray, and is both funny and brilliant as one of the most sneaky and interesting characters. Michael Madsen is always a joy in Tarantino-movies, but i feel his role is a bit repetitive and feels almost like his Mr. Blonde-character from Reservoir Dogs in disguise. It's amazing to see Bruce Dern in his age play such a complex character.<br/><br/>The pictures and the soundtrack is like drugs, and is some of the best i've seen in my life. The landscape-pictures in the start, and the whole intro sequence colored by Ennio Morricone's beautiful soundtrack is one of the biggest movie-kicks i've had in many years. Even though this movie has it's flaws, it's still one of the best movie experiences i've had in many years. This is Tarantino's second western-feature, and even though his western- movies has been satisfyingly original and moody but i hope Tarantino doesn't overuse the western-theme. According to the man himself, a gangster-flick similar to Bonnie and Clyde, in Australia. If that's so, that would be the movie i'm most looking forward to of all up and coming movies. Tarantino has said this is his 8/10 movies, which means there's 2 more to go and our generation's best director isn't done.<br/><br/>SORRY ABOUT THE MISPELLING OF SOME WORDS, IM FROM NORWAY ;)"

Baring that in mind, I went in to this film with the lowest of expectations (and also no idea what I was actually getting in to). So it came as quite a surprise to me, that at the end of the day I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It's almost three hours of character and violence exploration, and the movie holds on to you for every MINUTE of the movie. It holds off on having a lot of characters and makes sure you know every one of them, and for that this movie is in the high echelon of Tarantino's films. There are STAND OUT performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russel, and Walton Goggins. All of them hold on to you the entire time, and though you don't know who the killer is throughout, and you don't particularly trust anyone, you can't help but sympathize with each and every one of them.<br/><br/>My only complaint for this movie is Tarantino's treatment of women in it. The main woman character, while played MASTERFULLY to the point you both hate her and pity her. Is brutally abused in this film, and most of the bad things that happen are directed towards her, which turned me away a bit at times.<br/><br/>But all in all this movie is worth watching, even if you aren't a fan of Tarantino."

"stellamerteuil-145-212530","4","8","22","18 January 2016"," How far the mighty have fallen
","Quentin Tarantino has been one of my favorite directors since I first watched Reservoir Dogs on VHS so many years ago. I've loved every one of his movies before this, and I had very high hopes for this movie. That being said, everything past the opening credits was a slow slide downhill with a few bright moments. The opening scene establishes that John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell, with amazing facial hair) is a bounty hunter transporting a prisoner by stagecoach to the town of Red Rock so that justice can be served and she can hang. Because of some misplaced code of honor, he always brings in his bounties alive, no matter how difficult they are, and she is very difficult. His prisoner is Daisy Domergue, (pronounced Dommer-goo, in the first of many, many unfunny moments) a crass, mean character who has a bounty on her head for murder. Jennifer Jason Leigh is somewhat wasted on this character, whose main function within the film is to be as awful, disgusting, and annoying as possible. She's a better actor than this movie allowed her to be, and I pined for the amazing performances she gave in movies like Georgia, eXistenZ, and Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle. This performance, however, was not in the same league as those, mainly because there isn't much to the character. Samuel L. Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren, a former Union soldier-turned bounty hunter, who prefers transporting his bounties dead because it's less trouble. The first time we meet him, he has a stack of bodies on a sled. In the long, long, long opening scene, we learn that Ruth and Warren have met before and after a long, long, drawn-out scene demonstrating that Ruth has trust issues, they decide to form an alliance to protect each other's bounties when a new passenger enters their stagecoach played by Walton Goggins. Goggins plays Chris Mannix, an aw shucks kind of character who may or may not be lying about being the new sheriff or Red Rock. He reasons that if the two bounty hunters want to get paid, they should give him a ride. Tensions rise in the stagecoach as Mannix, a former soldier for the confederacy is seated next to Warren. On top of all this exposition and pointless exercises in trust and loyalty, there is a blizzard coming. The stagecoach can't get to Red Rock in a blizzard, so there is going to be a stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, a small inn in the middle of nowhere. When the group arrives, something is immediately off by the fact that the latch on the door is broken, and it has to be kicked in and nailed shut repeatedly anytime anyone leaves the building (this became less funny every time). Also, the usual innkeepers are mysteriously absent, supposedly leaving the mysterious Senor Bob in charge. Inside Minnie's, there is Oswoldo Mobray, the dandy British hangman, quiet cowboy Joe Gage, former Confederate General Sandy Smithers, and the aforementioned Senor Bob. At this point, the movie takes a turn and becomes a kind of locked room mystery after the coffee is revealed to be poisoned. And pretty much from this point on, I stopped caring altogether. Tarantino is known for his slow burn scenes and his brilliant dialogue. This movie had neither. The wit was absent, the tension nonexistent, and the characters flimsy. Tarantino's movies are all quite long, but this was the first that actually felt long. In the past, I've always relished scenes like the farmhouse scene from Inglourious Basterds. It drags on and on, but it can because the tension is razor sharp, and Christophe Waltz's Hans Landa is so magnetic. The Hateful Eight has no scenes like that, and the ones that do drag on and on feel too long. At one point, my husband turned to me and asked if I was enjoying the movie at all. It was evident from his face that he was not. I told him no, but I had to see it through to the end, give it a fair shot. Well, I gave it a fair shot, and I was disappointed for the first time in my longtime love of all things Tarantino. For years I thought he could do no wrong, but now I know he's human like the rest of us."
"andre_apt","Null","8","22","9 January 2016"," The Hateful 8th – Is There a Mystery Behind the Hate?
","First, this comment doesn't aspire to become a movie review in any proper sense, so I will say nothing about the movie's plot, performances etc. – many others have already done that. Second, devotees of Nietzsche whose ""formula for happiness is a Yes, a No, a straight line"" may also want to skip this piece and save themselves some time.<br/><br/>Having said that  In truth, the first part of the comment's summary above refers to the feelings that QT's latest seems to have largely induced among its audiences rather than my sentiments. Despite the fact that I've never been into this filmmaker (given Chapter Three – NO PUN intended) or due to it, I didn't hate it myself, nor did I find it overlong and boring. I think it runs as long as it should and can make a single viewing fairly entertaining. Unless, you're to suggest that this stuff shouldn't have been made at all. Which leads us to the second major complaint – the movie has no meaning that could really justify its existence. And that's already serious.<br/><br/>But if we look at the complete filmography of QT, as far as I'm concerned, there's only one entry there with which its author actually said something – that's the very first one. The finale of ""Reservoir Dogs"" did create a real drama with a real meaning behind it. Moreover, the latter was compellingly conveyed due to the genuine poignancy of the former. It's too bad that Ringo Lam could slightly paraphrase Kurosawa's remark on Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and say: ""It's a fine finale. But it's MY finale"". Undoubtedly, QT's original dialogue and no less than brilliant rearranging of the dramatic structure, along with subsequent competent directing, lifted Lam's material to another level in cinematic terms. But the meaning and its impact were mainly produced by the last scene. And it was also  hmm  lifted.<br/><br/>""Pulp Fiction"" followed and was moderately interesting as an extreme postmodern experiment with genre-related ""pulp fiction"" cinema. And ""Jackie Brown"" had a glimpse of something truly humanistic. But that's about it. The rest were self-indulgent 'loony toons', stylistic games of different degree of interest (for QT fans) or disinterest (for everybody else). Of course, any of later movies can be seen as making some points or at least trying to do so. However, kind of ""serious"" meaning can formally be ascribed to practically anything – like any Mike Myers comedy, for instance. But ""Godfather"" is about legacy (in a way) and ""Austin Powers"" is about legacy (in a way). Still they do not quite work at the same level, do they?<br/><br/>And here's where the core of the problem lies. QT wants to see his movies as art. But what is art? It's hardly just something capable of being entertaining, even if for whole three hours in a row. I think a work of art is nothing more and nothing less than a necessarily honest and hopefully meaningful utterance on any aspect of reality. And all accomplished ones do deliver such utterances. That's why they are of value. On the other hand, playing with oneself, which QT was primarily engaged in all this time after ""Jackie Brown"", may be an appropriate activity to be exercised in the privacy of one's home.But why a multi-million ""home video"" reflecting on this activity should be of interest to anyone else is a minor mystery.<br/><br/>And now we're to get back to the main one – that of the hateful ""8th by QT"". Since, I believe, in this case pun was definitely intended – what's behind it? Is there anything behind all we have to encounter in the movie? Would it be possible to discern some legitimate meaning there? In principle – yes. Many people stated that they had been put off by the fact that the movie did not have any likable characters. But what if it WAS the whole point? What if implicitly it's not just about racial issues and how the past may be projecting into the present? What if the director is trying to hold a mirror up to our society as a whole – in which if there are innocents they are the first to be gone – and say: ""This is how we look like and this is how we are going to end"" – just because we are what we are? I mean, look around – honestly, would it really be THAT far-fetched? Quite naturally, nobody wants to recognize themselves in this ugly reflection completely lacking any redeeming qualities. Hence – the hatred, kind of divined and 'word-played' into the title.<br/><br/>My own little problem with this theory is that we are dealing with some sort of a 'junk food' version of something like von Trier's stuff then. Because if, for example, Trier's ""quartet for the end of time"" (""Dogville"", ""Manderlay"", ""Antichrist"", ""Melancholia"") was undeniably totally and utterly starless and bible-black, it was also made through applying appropriate cinematic means. The way in which this movie is made, however, simply does not allow taking it or its message dead seriously, if I may put it so in the circumstance – it's way too, errr  absolutely everything and, albeit in its own fashion, probably TOO keen to entertain. So, instead of being edgy, ultimately winds up with the exact opposite. This kind of art turns out to be just like that Lincoln's letter. It's not bad. But it's still a fake.<br/><br/>So QT should probably indeed consider quitting. Or better still rethink his ""I don't care about your dumb movie, I care about my dumb movie"" attitude and become a producer. He has knowledge, experience, leverage. Why not to offer it to those who actually have something to say and not afraid of actually doing so? While himself remaining an integral part of the process that would create REAL art."
"heiller","9","9","26","7 January 2016"," Great movie-going experience
","We paid $17 to see the movie in 70mm on the curved screen. It was worth every penny. At the listed show time, the screen showed a still shot of a cartoon stagecoach. Within five minutes the movie started. No trailers, no advertisements, the movie just started. The pacing of the movie is the opposite of today's norm: non-stop action with no time for reflection. Tarantino makes you look at the opening credits. He makes you contemplate WTF is going to happen. Don't worry, there is action, intense action. There are few locations, the movie feels like a play. I have chatted with other people that have seen it. Some people feel that there are some plot holes. However, I pointed out dialogue that they had forgotten. There is an intermission."

The second time I got to 2 hours and had to switch it off to save my own sanity. Honestly, the most boring film I have ever seen.

","Normally, I wouldn't bother adding a review on IMDb, when so many have already been written. However, this film was shockingly bad, so I wanted to add my two cents as well. As others have previously noted, the problems with this film are numerous: <br/><br/>1 - Length - When I see a bad film that is 90 minutes long, well at least it didn't drag on and on. This film is close to 3 hours, and is endless.<br/><br/>2 - Nothing really happens for 3 hours.<br/><br/>3 - The clever, snappy dialogue that is in most Tarantino movies is missing.<br/><br/>4 - Overrated acting from everyone, including Oscar nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh, who looks like a cross between the possessed Linda Blair in The Exorcist and Sissy Spacek in Carrie. Is this why she's gotten such great acclaim? It can't be for her performance. There was none. Also of little note is Tim Roth in the ""Christoph Waltz"" role.<br/><br/>5 - Over-the-top graphic-ness of violence. I'm not a prude, but in many, many instances, it just wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>I think Pulp Fiction is a great film, and I enjoyed Jackie Brown as well. Since then, I haven't liked much of his stuff, but since I was so pleasantly surprised with Django Unchained, I thought this one could be really good. Boy was I wrong. You think because you have the clout to make a film in Panavision that I should be impressed? Next time, make a good movie to go along with it."
"webcrind","1","5","12","11 April 2016"," Very bad and * spoiler alert*
","I have a rule that when I watch a movie and don't like it in the first 20 minutes, for a variety of reasons, I will turn it off. I did not follow my own rule, I was already bored after 10 minutes since all the scenes were d r a g g e d out, and finished it to the bitter end. One of the reasons why I endured it was to find out how a movie that was pretty much entirely shot for over 90% of the time in a single room could cost 62 million dollars. All I can come up with is that Tarantino spent the money on salaries for the main actors. I have no idea why he did that other than maybe loyalty to Jackson, Russell and Madsen, neither gave good performances but rather the usual and obviously the caliber of said actors wasn't needed. The story was utterly dated and has been done better by worse directors (I think that there is a board game named Clue based on that story). But I digress: the movie is not a serious one, but it isn't funny either, not many scenes are realistic, the plot has holes and the spraying of blood, when someone is either shot or poisoned and vomits, is done in a Chinese-action-movie style. Absolutely gaudy. Pointless. Self-indulgent. And disgusting at times."
"SamBacerra","1","5","12","6 March 2016"," What a Complete Waste of Space this Film Would be Even Just Left on the Cutting Room Floor!!
","I think this film was very, very nasty and it was absolutely horrifying considering the movie theater trailers portrayed it to be some kind of a Western. Surprise! It's probably four or five times more bloody and disturbing than the movie Scream. In my opinion, it is twice as inappropriate as Sin City. So, the filmmakers and directors deserve zero stars for releasing advertising for a movie that attracted countless young children with their parents who probably would not walk out of a movie with their kids out of guilt. In my theater alone there were about ten families with small kids, and I could not have felt any worse for both the children and the parents who found out they were sitting in some kind of NC-17 movie that barely broke the limit for R Ratings. I think growing up and seeing every R rated movie besides horror films known to America from a young age, I do think there was ever an R Rated movie I ever saw between 1990 and 2005 that was ever this bad. So I think the studio itself made an error funding a movie this drastically disgusting and despicable, and I think movies like this are absolutely criminal when they are advertised as R Rated Westerns and become a giant bomb of cheap crap full of profanity to the horror of the ticket purchasers and the guilt of parents, and the plight to children. That being said about the advertising, I do feel I would not have really cared about just a movie that was extremely shady in not having a moral compass at all in any place or small scene if it was advertised that way at all (and I mean at all!) because I have nothing against watching movies like Kill Bill or even Sin City if you know when you buy your tickets that your movie is going to push the R rating to the limit and the moral obligations of anyone at all involved in the release of direction. I think in terms of the moral obligation, I think many reviews have said in the papers and the internet that the critics writing them are not sure if QT has a moral compass at all now. I heartily agree and I think that even the actors themselves have lost my respect for making this movie at all. Number one, I think that they should feel guilt themselves about the way they knew they were signing up for a Western holiday hit that was going to be a bomb of filth and disgust to the shock of their audience. I do not hold it against Bruce Willis or other great actors in Sin City that they were going to be in a pretty nasty movie because they were not participating in a cloak and dagger roller coaster that was not going to be properly advertised, but I definitely hold it against these actors themselves for participating in a perverted movie of this highest degree knowing they were hoping for a big hit and would not tell the audience before seeing it that it really is more gross in many respects than a very nasty horror movie. Additionally, I think the movie fails miserably in having any appeal as basically a movie about the satisfaction of slaughter because it does not even have the thrill of a horror movie experience because it is too grotesque and openly miserable. There is no cheap fun at all even if you are just wanting to see a scary movie, it's basically all about how QT was determined to make a movie that is ultimately about sickened and idiotic bimbos having all the credit in the world for cutting of human limbs and essentially not having moral compasses. So there are two layers of extreme wrong in this film in the horrible advertising versus the real reality of the film and then the theme that fails miserably to even fit into a film genre like thrillers that don't have any sense besides people getting killed. It doesn't make that cut because the killers in this movie are just masturbating in their violence instead of out for predatory or spiritual evil in a way that would make sense. However, the movie continues to fail dreadfully beyond those two unforgivable movie shortfalls. The movie is so, so, so boring. There are literally at least four or five scenes in the movie where you could easily fall asleep and are about three times longer than a scene needs to be to have a sense of real passing or even keep the interest of the audience. So the pacing is the worst I think I have ever seen in a movie. Beyond that, I also must say the violence itself is ultimately extremely repulsive and very sick. A woman likes shooting boogies out of her nose in the movie. She gets beat up by the men throughout the film and her death in the movie is basically trumpeted like a celebration itself. In all honesty, I think I could gladly give up on America just for supporting movies that use the inane slaughter of a woman as it's final joyous climax in a way that shows two numskulls deciding to not kill her with a bullet but let her hang as they enjoy pulling up her hanging rope as they miserably watch her and then masturbate on their bed in a pool of blood. I think it would have been a much better decision to spend my time watching a movie about a documentary of woman being stoned to death in the middle east than watch this movie. Ultimately, I vowed never to watch another QT movie ever again, and I also decided to never watch his original movies I have never seen. This film is only pure trash and filth."
"franmacekzg","10","5","12","3 March 2016"," Tarantino made his best movie since Pul Fiction(spoilers ahead)
","This movie is amazing. I went into the cinema 4 times to watch The Hateful Eight. I don't see where do all this bad reviews come from. Did we watch the same movie? The direction is amazing, acting is brilliant (you know all about Samuel L. Jackson, but surprisingly almost no one talks about Kurt Russel who was the best in the film by my opinion and Tim Roth who presented us to one of those European charming gentle mans which are usually acted by Christoph Waltz in Tarantinos movies), cinematography is amazing despite the fact that we are in one room for the whole movie (one IMDb user said that he doesn't understand why Tarantino used 70mm camera. He did it so we can see the characters behind the ones in the center of the screen, so we can have that sense of claustrophobia).<br/><br/>But what makes this my second favorite movie of all time (behind Pulp Fiction) is the dialogue. It is very different from the ""clever"" Pulp Fiction dialogue. This characters have the ability to make us root for the minerest things to happen (we want that coffee that John Ruth makes to be good for example). There is that post- war tension between the characters. This guys are now in one room drinking coffee together while 10 years ago they would kill each other without a moment of thinking about it. <br/><br/>There is that flashback sequence where Samuel. L. Jackson talks about torturing the generals son and that sequence is very unnecessary. <br/><br/>The problem that I have with Tarantinos more action packed movies (although they are still great) is that he doesn't have the ability to give one movie one mood, every scene has its own mood which is best seen through the soundtrack (one minute there's rap, second minute there's Beethoven). In here he seems to be more careful about the mood of the whole movie then ever before, he sticks to Moricone and his perfect music. We can split this movie very strictly into 2 clear halfs. The first one (despite its perfectness the worse half) is all setup, and I love every second of it. The characters don't kill each other in the first couple of minutes, we get to know them, to root for them (posibly the best thing about this movie is that you have a completely different view on it depending on who you root for. If you are Ruth's fans like I am you will be sad that he died and thought that Quentin wanted to make that scene sad, but if you root for Daisy then you will be happy that John died and you will think that Quentin wanted to make that scene happy). We laugh with them, we hate the other characters with our favorite character and we start to feel like the 9th guy.<br/><br/>The second half is a completely unpredictable murder mystery style payoff where we yell on our screens when someone dies like we're watching a football game. <br/><br/>The only thing that I have trouble with this movie (and it is very minor) is that Quentin (as it usually is in his films) doesn't quit know what we want this characters to do. The best example is the scene where Warren turns into sort of Sherlock Holmes and starts to investigate who works with Daisy. He is sooo awesome in that scene, he is smart, makes great arguments, and is confident in what he is doing (all the things you would say a bada*s has), and then someone shoots him from the basement. We didn't want that! We didn't want too see something happening to this smart, confident guy that he didn't count on!<br/><br/>Anyway an awesome movie, check it out, if you don't like violence than what are you even doing here, you will end up loving this funny, thrilling, simple masterpiece"

Some parts of the film are delivered with purposely slow development, overly slow in fact. Some of the characters are quite boring and so are many of the scenarios. It almost seemed like this was Tarantino's spoiled brat movie, him basically saying a great big, ""F.U., I can do whatever I want now"" to the mainstream audiences that have actually made him a very rich man over the years. And so he can! In that way, the film really made me laugh, as I know many people in the theatre were repulsed by it, and I think I'm not the only one laughing about this, Tarantino definitely is too. However, overall it's a very simple and somewhat dull plot making this one of Tarantino's worst efforts yet in my view, (To me only Death Proof was worse.). I did enjoy the film to some degree for sure, but it's not a film I'd bother to watch again. It is after all quite hard to dispute that this is a very long and fairly dumb film, with little to no point at all except to repulse some prudes, (And that's really the best it can offer.). If you know some uptight prudes you'd like to rile up, recommend them this one for sure, lmao! 6.5/10"

","Yesterday a supernaturally gifted genius has disenchanted himself in my opinion. The director who's responsible for the best and the best and the second-best movie of all times from my point of view, has also made the two worst movies ever. Tarantino can do it only big, just in superlatives, either it's one or the opposite pole. But ""The hateful eight"" is just so damn ordinary that I feel personally offended by it. I doubt that I will ever go watching another Tarantino again.<br/><br/>There's a lot of violence and blood which is a common stylistic device in Tarantino's works. I'm not much bothered by that. After ten minutes you get used to it and overlook it. But in his earlier masterpieces there lay a deeper meaning in all this brutality which I sorely missed in this one. Some parts are so chewy and long-winded that it's enough to put you to sleep. There are plenty of well renown actors as usual but they act without enthusiasm and persuasion. <br/><br/>All in all this movie is not worthy the title Tarantino movie."

Poor story. <br/><br/>Summary: The whole thing just seemed very forced and clunky, I didn't feel engaged at all which is a shame because I had high expectations as I'm sure that a lot of people did and most were disappointed. Quentin Tarantino's films are rich because of how developed his characters are, Hans Landa is a perfect example of that. The film had no pace, people were dying but I didn't care because I had no interest in the characters. Quentin Tarantino should just give this one another go, I think he was on to something but this one just derailed."

It's like the writers forgot to fill you in somewhere in the story telling and are trying to explain why. However, in this movie, Tarantino fills in the gaps in a very clever way that adds to the mystery. You sense that no one trusts anybody and you ask yourself how they are going to last a couple of days, waiting for the end of the storm, locked all together. You further sense the tension which is so thick that you can touch it. Even the ending chapter keeps you trying to guess how it will all end.<br/><br/>This is a real masterpiece by Tarantino.

I wasn't aware it would take 2.5 hours to see that. Then that long stagecoach ride that never ended, the funniest part in that scene was watching Daisy Domergue cop a hook to the face.

"eddynomicks","10","13","42","29 December 2015"," Tarantino at His Finest
","This is a review of the 70mm Roadshow edition of ""The Hateful Eight"". Minor spoilers below.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino, for a long time has been one of my favorite movie directors. Every time one his movies come out I jump at the chance to go see them. If you are not a fan of any of his previous works, then this review will not change your mind. However if you did enjoy every other movie that Tarantino has made, then hopeful this review will encourage you to go see ""The Hateful Eight"". <br/><br/>The film opens with beautiful shots of mountain ranges and snow frosted areas. Then a stage coach is seen hurtling down the road at full speed. The opening sets the tone for the entire move because it is slow moving, yet you are fully engaged by the tension in the dialogue and the musical score. <br/><br/>At first, the movie will be a different pace than other Tarantino movies. It does not jump straight into the action, the action has to be earned, and boy, do you get some action. The only downfall of that is, that the majority of the violence and blood is restrained to the last half of the movie, and was not equally separated between both parts. The violence in this movie is very similar to that in ""Django Unchained"", there are buckets of blood. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very well acted and filmed, giving Samuel L. Jackson, and Walton Goggins the spotlight. The movie is a 10 out of 10. One of the best movies that has been released in quite some time. The actors shine through, and they are able to deceive you at every turn. <br/><br/>My final point is to all of the other critics, who have said that the movie was too slow, or violent, or that the language is to vulgar. I have a question for you: Where the **** have you been? The majority of you say that you have loved Tarantino's previous films, yet you still deny this movie the credit it deserves. Quentin Tarantino movies are made of three things that the majority of you should have learned by now, and if you have not, then there is no reason for others to be seeing that you used to be a Tarantino fan because if you were then you would have understood why the movie is the way it is. The N-word was used excessively,but that is part of what makes ""The Hateful Eight"" great. Those three things about Quentin Tarantino movies will be listed below, but I would like to thank Quentin Tarantino, for making an outstanding movie.<br/><br/>The three things that make a Tarantino movie-<br/><br/>1. Dialogue 2.Over the top violence 3. SOCIALLY INAPROPRIATE!"
"markthom-621-765873","8","13","42","21 December 2015"," Reservoir Cowboy Dogs....Great!
","Another great film by Tarantino. If you are reading this chances are you will have seen some of, if not all of his other movies.....where does this rank amongst the others I hear you ask. Well It's better than Death Proof and Dusk Till Dawn and perhaps as good as Reservoir Dogs.....in fact Mr Blonde ( Michael Madsen ) is in it, wielding a six shooter instead of a razor blade. Tim Roth is also here and the film essentially takes place in one room...a bit like reservoir dogs does. It is different though, as this is more of a whodunit tale along the lines of Agatha Christie's 10 Little Indians. Samuel L. Jackson is on top form and Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is very memorable. Beautifully shot, it has great music by Ennio Morricone and it's funny, violent, shocking and gross in parts......which is what you want!"
"winopaul","5","4","9","20 December 2016"," Unrealistic and self-indulgent
","I have to believe this was written under the influence of methamphetamine. There surely was no research influencing it, not even a trip to the dude ranch in Modern Family where Delmar could have schooled Quentin in the the postmodern Hollywood perceptions of the authentic West.<br/><br/>Its OK that Quentin was the rotten little boy in Junior High School, sitting in the back row, cupping his face into his hands and making fart noises. Its just that most of us grow out of that class-clown attention-whore phase around 9th grade. I am pretty sure that it is the same little boy repeating the N-word a hundred times, with his little prick sadistic grin, claiming its art and he is exposing racism. Hey, watch ""42"" if you want to see racism, this is faux-provocative tripe.<br/><br/>The movie is way too long. What could be a word is a sentence. What could be a sentence is paragraph. What could be a paragraph is a page, and what could be a page is a chapter. We get it QT, stop condescending.<br/><br/>The movie is completely unbelievable. Maybe people behave this way in meth-fueled Platonic Hollywood elitist fever dreams, but not in any planet we inhabit. First of, unlike Hollywood, criminals do not like stress or tension anymore than the rest of us. They would have waylaid the stage and blown off Kurt Russell's head, rather than do a long involved ridiculous mass murder with more moving parts that the Space Shuttle. It was Mad Magazine in the 1970s that showed Hollywood perception was a shoot-out in the street at high noon, while the reality was a shotgun to the back of the head at 4AM as the guy left the saloon.<br/><br/>Kurt would not be keeping his lady prisoner alive for the hangman. That is absurd. In the winter he would have killed her in an instant since the cold would keep her from smelling on the trip to Red Rock. He would have raped her first, bad teeth or no, she was pretty cute.<br/><br/>The people were all cartoon characters as well. First off, not even the Wizard of the KKK would call a black man the N-word to his face, when said black man has two .44 caliber pistols stuffed in his belt. What was Dr. King's expression-- ""pernicious racism""? It would have been far more effective to have a character ""slip"" and say the N-word, only to apologize profusely. That is pernicious racism. This 14-year old neener neener name-calling is pathetic.<br/><br/>The cabin is way too big-- they didn't have the lumber nor the Trane forced-air furnace in post Civil War Wyoming. It should have been the size of a stage, but that would remind us this should be a play. Summer stock at best.<br/><br/>Others have noted all the modern words and expressions, just something else to remind us that every single word in the movie is a lie, including ""the,"" ""and,"" and ""but."" Having hung around the mob and some outlaw bikers, I can assure you that no ass-clown is going to sashay into the clubhouse and start taking people's guns. The allure and beauty of the West is the equality conferred by a gun on your side. Kurt's only option would be to wait out the storm in the barn.<br/><br/>The very Western hardness QT is trying to portray makes it unlikely that some brother is going to stage this complex fiasco out of filial love. Equally unlikely is his gang cronies coming along, when there is no direct financial benefit to them. They would have skedaddled to Mexico a month ago. It would be far more plausible if the gal knew where the loot was buried, and that is why they were trying to save her.<br/><br/>The gang-leader importuning patience. Maybe for a boring movie, but in real life criminals have no patience, that is why they are criminals. Otherwise they would be working for Wells Fargo and contributing to their pension plans.<br/><br/>Pistols. Nobody with any experience would want to have a pistol in a gunfight. The 12-gauge with 00 buckshot is far preferred. Concealing guns under tables and chairs-- puleeze-- how many things do they want to risk going wrong? Criminals are stupid and impatient, this scheming is completely out of character.<br/><br/>Major spoiler, detailed synopsis: Talk talk talk; talk talk; talk talk talk talk. Interracial sodomy rape. Boom. Boom boom boom boom. Boom boom boom boom boom. Roll credits.<br/><br/>The acting was magnificent-- which is what fools some people into thinking this is a good movie. Music was OK, don't know why it got an Oscar. Cinematography was superb as well."

","Exciting, funny, tense, thrilling, original, unpredictable. This film had everything a great movie should. Quentin Tarantino strikes gold again with this wonderful tale of lies, deceit and good old fashioned bloody murder. Directed and acted to perfection the run-time of 2 hours 47 minutes flies by as if it were an hour, truly keeping you entertained and captivated the whole way through. <br/><br/>Its extremely hard to pick fault with this film but the only reason I would give it an 8 is purely based on the fact that the story structure meant it revealed the outcome at around the 2 hour mark leaving no guessing or mystery in the remaining third, However you were still truly engrossed beyond the outcome to see what fate the characters would meet.<br/><br/>A superb story and easily one of the best films I've seen, not a film you would watch multiple times but a must see for all true movie fans."
"starsteamer","8","4","9","18 July 2016"," A movie of a play
","The first thing I would say after watching this movie is that it is very Tarantino but unlike any of his previous movies. It is a character based drama in the Western genre. The focus is on characterisation and morality. Please do not watch of you are expecting an action- packed film. Instead, this is a stage drama: a limited setting that allows exploration of the characters and the interpersonal relationships between them. The setting could almost be a microcosm for modern day America. There are no likable characters within this: they truly are a hateful eight. However, this does not make the viewer disengage. Instead, interest in each of them is heightened as you attempt to work out the truths and lies. A thoroughly enjoyable journey."
"ritanassy","10","4","9","14 June 2016"," This movie was brilliant.
","This movie was a strong commentary on the lives of the people in a racist and hateful society and it shows us who is still the most important of the people. You have a liberal bounty hunter, that once in the company of other whites used the ""n"" word as if it was the black bounty hunters name. How white women, the lowest, disgusting of white women are more important and valuable than all others, especially the two black hardworking women that were murdered. History tells us that disgusting white women have destroyed the lives of many, especially black people. The killing of the old man was brilliant, the message is: take your enemy down but use your head and not your anger or hate and he was taken down and it was beautiful. The murder of the workers and drivers was the most deceptive of actions, those killers came in smiling, laughing and making all relax in comfort, then they killed them all with shock on their faces, the enemy is often never seen coming until it is too late. The movie allows the disgusting women to be hung and I felt that she was hung for all the innocent, victimized people that was hung and her hanging allowed us to know that she was not special or worthy of all the lives she had taken. I loved it and I love that Lincoln was dismissed and reduced to a lie. My favorite movie of the year. Amazing."
"guisreis","6","4","9","3 June 2016"," Not a great Western, just a sick mind
","I expected so much more. There is a beautiful cinematography, nice costumes and a good soundtrack (off course, it's Morricone; though, it is not one of his best). However, the pace is not always the best, the story is kind of meaningless in spite of its surprises and twists, and some disgusting traits as outcomes of Tarantino's sick mind annoyed me very much: lots of crap, misogyny, sadism, and perhaps racism. There is and intention of having stylish characters, but the goal is not fulfilled as in the good spaghetti or contemporary Westerns. The film is not properly bad, but is far from being good as I waited for. It is highly overestimated just because Tarantino was turned into a fashion brand. This simply does not captivate a less biased spectator, besides having the common immoral elements typical from the director's mind."

","The cinematic legend Quentin Tarantino excites his fans in a film that blends all of his greatest talents and characteristics. ""The Hateful Eight"" follows a group of ruthless, ridiculous, and dangerous people who end up stranded in a cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery during a brutal Wyoming blizzard. With returning favorites of Mr.Tarantino such as Samuel L.Jackson and Kurt Russell, to newcomer to the Tarantino universe Jennifer Jason Leigh, to even more Tarantino favorites including Michael Madsen, Walton Coggins, Bruce Dern, and Tim Roth, we get great actors playing out a brilliant and entertaining script that can only erupt from the brilliant mind of Tarantino himself. We get lots of fun bloody and quirky violence that's either comical, awesome, or darn right cringe-worthy, reminding viewers who's film were watching. The action and violence is straight out of a Tarantino film, being both fun and shocking when it occurs. The original score and cinematography date pay tribute to classic spaghetti westerns, and the film overall is played out like a classic film, showing Tarantino's admiration for cinema as a whole. ""The Hateful Eight"" is made to honor the films that impacted Quentin Tarantino deeply, and boy can you tell those films helped him. Tarantino directs each scene with fun and style, giving viewers a chance to dive back into the universe of one of the best filmmakers in history."

","When I first saw the trailer, I wasn't really hyped as much as I wanted to be. Even as a huge Tarantino fan, I had some doubts about how this film was gonna turn out. The concept didn't make me want to count the days for it to release, but after seeing it I'm really surprised I wasn't.<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple, but also pretty complicated like a good detective crime series. Tarantino has a special kind of humor, some like it some don't. I really like the dark, brutal humor in his films. And most of all, this films is a real blast to watch. I was surprised by the fact that it was really funny. Samuel L. Jackson really shines in Tarantino films, and this one is no exception. Samuel manages to perfectly fit the brutal sense of humor from Tarantino. <br/><br/>Fact that it's all pretty much in a single location doesn't make it boring at all, for the ones wondering.<br/><br/>For the ones that like dark and brutal humor, bloody action scenes, detective like development and the brutal satisfaction at the end of Tarantino films (like Kill Bill, Django, Inglorious Bastards) this will be one of the best films you see this year."

"mrstrangerjones","9","3","6","20 September 2018"," Tarantino can (and has) done better than this.
","I finally managed to watch ""The Hateful Eight"". I pretty much hyped myself up for this film (after all, Quentin Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and screenwriters), and I even saw people saying that this is his best film since ""Pulp Fiction""... which is really saying a lot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of this film. I personally felt like Tarantino just tried to reimagine ""Reservoir Dogs"", but set it after the Civil War... and in the winter... and with racists... and a LOT less interesting.<br/><br/>PROS:
<ul><li>The acting in this movie was pretty great overall. I will never say anything bad about Samuel L. Jackson. If he's in a movie, I'm in. If he's in a Tarantino movie, I don't have a choice. And in this movie, he's great as always.</li></ul>I also really liked Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Their relationship was kinda funny to see, even though she hits her multiple times (trust me, she deserves it) and is handcuffed to her the whole movie.
Walton Coggins was also pretty interesting to see on-screen.
<ul><li>As usual, the dialogue in the film was great. There was a lot of witty banter between characters that I thought was really interesting. </li></ul><br/><br/>CONS:
<ul><li>This movie did not have to be as long as it was. It was 2 hours 28 minutes (I saw it on Netflix, so it didn't include the 15 minute intermission) long, and it unfortunately stretched its story thin throughout the film's runtime. And frankly, it kinda sucked.</li><li>The overall twist was kinda lame and anticlimatic. Of course, I'm not going to spoil it for anybody who wants to watch it. All I'll say is that I didn't like it.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, this is the only Tarantino film I've watched (haven't seen ""Jackie Brown"" yet) that I would NOT like to watch another time. All of his other films are so much better than this.
If I had to rank his films from worst to best (excluding ""Jackie Brown"", ""Sin City"", and ""Death Proof""), it would be ""The Hateful Eight"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 2"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Kill Bill: Vol 1"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and then ""Pulp Fiction""."
"jaredspencr","1","3","6","19 March 2018"," Art is not an excuse..
","This movie is creatively written, I'm not going to lie. Tarantino does a masterful job of making you care just enough about even minor characters to make their senselessly graphic deaths even more grating. If you ""enjoyed"" this movie you should probably go to therapy. It's not always a bad thing for a movie to leave you feeling unsatisfied, especially if it has an important message. This movie did not. It was 168 minutes of crafting the most painful, gruesome, disturbing, deaths that it possibly could. For no other reason than to leave the audience either reveling in gore and horror, or, for those of us with a degree of consciousness, in a numb state of shock. We have this idea in western art-culture that immoral attitudes and actions are ok if they're done for art. Why? I've never heard even a half baked argument for this philosophy but it's common place amongst artists, film makers, and comedians. Tasteless is tasteless whether it's from the misogynistic drunk at the bar or the comedian on screen. There's no virtue in rebellion. Commuting sexual acts on a person for money is called prostitution and is considered shameful but if it's for art then ""oh wow! The courage! The bravery!!"". It's asinine. Prostituting your body for money is immoral whether it's done in real life or on camera. It's the same with celebrating darkness and pointless violence. Morbid fantasies are gross and should be avoided not celebrated, whether they're the act of an actual killer or a director. To try to argue otherwise is simply to excuse our own perverse curiosity as an audience."
"iquine","3","3","6","17 November 2017"," An Uninteresting Bloodbath
","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>There was a lot of dialog in this which is usually a strong point for Tarantino films but here it dragged, especially with a hefty 3:07 run time. Sure a few interesting quips now and then but nothing close to or as slick and clever as the diner coffee scene in Reservoir Dogs. The story has a little timeline shifting as with his classic films yet not so clever story twists and turns in my opinion. Then throw in some fairly pointless chapter title cards. This of course being a Tarantino film, there is the expected Tarantino over the top bloody moments and cold blooded killing that were nasty gross at times. Part of what took me out of the film was the overly accurate sound effects that didn't feel authentic as well as scenes with rich details that also felt fake and obviously a stage. On to the plot: a stagecoach rumbles through a rural land during a winter in the Civil War era with a bounty hunter and his apprehended female bounty. He is taking her in for an old fashioned hangin'. Yet not everyone wants her dead. Will she get rescued and by whom? Who will end up with the upper hand? How many gallons of blood will Tarantino spill and splatter this time around? Overall, this should and could have been much better. Needed a better and smarter script."

","Quintin, oh Quintin - what have you done!? This is predictable tedious rubbish. It's actually boring!! The pity of it all is that here we have assembled some good acting talent, some good possibilities, and, actually, a talented writer and director. It's all lost though. Lost in the meaningless, predictable posing and tripe. Shame!<br/><br/>As with Inglorious Basterds, this film totally overdoes itself. (Please also see my review of that film here).<br/><br/>We don't, or at least, I don't, want to watch silly macho posing. I don't want to listen to dialogue that, frankly, I could write myself. I don't want to accurately predict the outcome of the film by the end of the first ten minutes. I don't want to sit and have Tarantino waste my time as I watch his silly sense of humour unfold with such monotonous nonsense.... Yawn!<br/><br/>Only two things save this film from a rating much lower than the one I've given it here. 1) The original score by Ennio Morricone is excellent. And, 2) The setting in a frozen Wyoming is good - harsh and beautiful.<br/><br/>But that's all folks!"

"ms-52486","7","3","6","11 June 2016"," Trapped
","The film opens with wide shots of snowy North American mountain ranges, and I thought that Tarantino might have discovered his sense for landscapes. I felt that he might be paying homage to Sergio Leone, too. But these are just a few opening shots, and for most of the remainder, the movie stays indoors.<br/><br/>The dialog in the coach, on it's way to Minnie's cabin, feels rather slow, especially because it is at the very start of the story.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, these things indicate that Tarantino had a lot of time, a lot of film rolls and total freedom in terms of decision-making. The scene with the door and the nails is hilarious at first, simply BECAUSE it drags on way too long, but when it gets repeated for the third time or so in full length, any editor or playwright or producer would have objected, I guess.<br/><br/>The story in Tarantino's films was always rather simple, but it didn't matter because they were a tour de force of sharp dialog and good acting. Reservoir Dogs, my favorite QT film, even deliberately ignored the story and instead focused on the intense chemistry and the funny statements of the characters, and it worked brilliantly. The dialog in The Hateful Eight is not as exceptional as we might have expected, and since the story is extremely simple and unfolds in one location only, the only thing that keeps us interested is the acting, really. It is mostly well done, even when Madsen seems to be totally trapped in his way of walking and talking, and Roth coming across as an imitation of Waltz at one point. Russel and Jason Leigh as the odd couple stand out and create much of our interest in the plot in the beginning. Some character's development seems unlikely, especially the swift conversion of the more racist ones.<br/><br/>Takeshi Kitano said in an interview that he finds Tarantion's films to be very well produced B-movies, and I think there is a truth to that. Like the movie characters that are stuck in the cabin, Tarantino seems to be a bit stuck with his semi-trashy, comic-like way to tell a story. He explored this in 8 films now. He could start to use landscapes or create characters that have motivations that go beyond a bag full of money, and I really wonder what his power as a filmmaker could do with those other aspects of the medium. But I guess that's not his thing, and he obviously is not reinventing himself. He does add a new facet to it though with a few political statements here and there.<br/><br/>Never mind the violence, which is just a lot of fake blood and bits and parts flying around, but never shocks us with its realness. If you would like to explore what violence looks like outside of the world of a comic book geek, I suggest movies like Gomorrah by Matteo Garrone. The fellatio scene has it's equivalent in the basement scene of Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>All this might sound harsh, maybe too harsh. I wasn't bored throughout the almost 3 hours running time, but I have to say that I have been watching a lot of slow movies recently, so my patience has been trained. There were a few twists and turns in the second part of the movie, and the end was somewhat interesting, but it also felt a bit weak after a 3 hour buildup. No reason for a 1 star rating, since the acting, the costumes, the sets etc. are too good for that. I give it a 7."
"z1113415","8","3","6","15 May 2016"," The movie cracked me up with classic Tarantino style, but the length and the eccentricity of Channing Tatum kills it.
","As many Tarantino's films, I love how there is no actual protagonists but just great actors stealing thunders from one another. However, I do have to complain that Tatum fails in many ways. First off, he looks like a guy who's trying to act tough but who is really soft. Who the hell made him the leader of that gang? Besides, the other actors successfully creates that kinds of mysterious atmosphere in the first half of the movie, but Tatum just ruins it the moment he shows up. What is up with that pretty-boy, refreshing look? And please work on your speaking tone and accent, would you? How come your ""beloved"" sister is speaking in a strong southern accent and you're not? Enough with Tatum's acting, now it's time for the good part. Samuel L. Jackson pulls out that relentless yet willy impression of an African American in Civil War time, and it is something different from Django. I love how he describes the scene of a white boy sucking his black Jackson as if it really did happen to him, or he really wishes that to happen. It is something you can't steal."
"Mr-Fusion","5","3","6","8 May 2016"," Inglorious self-indulgence
","In all honesty, between the first-rate cast, the lavish presentation and the fact that it's a high-profile western, my hopes were right up there with ""The Hateful Eight"". To those ends, it's pretty great. Thick with mountain atmosphere, nice photography and Tarantino's zeal for violence. My problem is the pacing. The movie is overloaded by setup that takes forever, and the patience is rewarded with more sluggishness. I like the idea of backstories unfurling during a snowed-in stopover, and the cast is a varied roster of seasoned players going to town on that dialog (Goggins, Russell and Jackson, especially), but, truth be told, it's one of the longest 3-hour movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Actually, a good way to think about this is comparing it to ""Reservoir Dogs"" but without any energy. <br/><br/>This just wasn't doing it for me.<br/><br/>5/10"

Oh yeah, the scenery and cinematography is OUTSTANDING. Looks like the modern day settings of Eastwood westerns.

"groomeschase12","10","11","35","1 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight (2015)
","As soon as the opening credits began on Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight,"" I knew I was in for a unique cinematic experience. The credits themselves appear old-fashioned and the great Ennio Morricone's score is playing as they roll, the expansiveness and desolation of the snowy area is shown, and then all of a sudden, Samuel L. Jackson appears on screen, ""Got room for one more?"" He asks the stagecoach driver as he sits in the middle of the path covered in snow. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" stars a lot of Tarantino alum including the aforementioned Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Kurt Russell, and a slew of others and is directed by the always interesting Quentin Tarantino. It centers around a group of people being stuck in a haberdashery in the middle of a blizzard in Wyoming, and when things go awry, suspicion grows and the whole thing turns into a version of ""Clue"" that few would expect to see coming. Much like Tarantino's other films, ""The Hateful Eight"" cherry picks items from movies past and uses them in his own unique ways, to everyone's benefit. Albeit this time, an original score was composed, not a foul move. Morricone's score was his first western score in some forty years, and it is a truly memorable one at that, one that surely matches the shifty-eyed characters and fits the suspicion element all too well.<br/><br/>While Tarantino himself usually takes the spotlight from his actors with his dialogue and signature direction style, and sure this one may be no different, this time he has some hefty competition for the spotlight of this movie with one Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. As a movie fan, I've seen a lot of Jackson in my lifetime, and I do mean a lot, though never seemingly like this. A while back I recall watching ""Jackie Brown"" (another Tarantino contribution that also starred Jackson) with a friend of mine and he said to me during it, ""Samuel L. Jackson always seems to play the same sort of characters the same way in his movies, only slightly different sometimes,"" a valid statement. Though, that is not the same Jackson in ""The Hateful Eight,"" it is an ensemble cast but he is certainly the lead and leads this film he does. While what he says is usually riveting, it elevates to a level I was not prepared for, and the physical comedy and the delivering of his lines must be spoken of as part, be on the lookout for that monologue. Jackson isn't the only noteworthy performance, as it would be criminal to not include Kurt Russell's ""John Ruth"" and Jennifer Jason Leigh's ""Daisy Domergue.""<br/><br/>Right on cue, Tarantino has written another dynamite script that has something for all film fans. Every moment of the runtime is spent contemplating, laughing, or studying these characters and their actions - past, present, and future, and that is a credit to serious writing. I've seen a whodunit, I've seen a western, and neither has hit the subtle comedic strides ""The Hateful Eight"" hit. He seemed to have combined this movie as a blend from some of his previous works, this movie reeks of the same ingredients of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a group of violent, untrusting individuals in an isolated area and ""Django Unchained,"" the Civil War era setting and the western feel. <br/><br/>Much like a lot of westerns, Tarantino dedicates time to setting. We get several beautiful shots and pans of the landscape to solidify the isolation of the area we are put into, leaving us never to ask ""Why don't they just leave?"" It doesn't just end there. Once everyone has arrived at the haberdashery, Minnie's, it is such a claustrophobic area that we are shown very fluently, we know where everyone is, know where every item is (the fireplace, coffee pot, dinner table) and that only helps place us into the mystery and allows us to keep an eye on everyone, because if you're watching the movie too, you're suspicious.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" contains a great deal. It contains more than just Tarantino fan service, the violence and witty dialogue, it contains a captivating mystery wrapped in a western shell. It isn't weighed down by genres, studio restrictions, or a time constraint that would not allow enough time to develop its angry individuals. This movie is a welcome addition to a great storyteller's filmography, and quite possibly my favorite film of the year."

","Hateful Eight....bloody marvellous.. It could only be QT; complicated plot, interacting strangers and blood splatter. There are laughs where there shouldn't be laughs and actors acting their socks off. Loved every minute from the opening titles to the gory climax. SLJ plays a gritty , grisly , stranded stranger who joins others on an ill fated stagecoach ride. Kurt Russell reminds us just how good he still is, and JJL is a revelation . Every character brings intrigue to the table, each with their own agenda. This is an adult film and shocking at times. More than once, I thought how did he get away with that but the violence, although jarring, is always integral to the story. One of Quentin's best films....high praise in deed."
"ninie2310-644-249348","8","6","16","15 January 2016"," A great addition to Tarantino's filmography
","Since I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino's work, I was really looking forward to this movie and though I can say at this point that it's not my favourite, it did not disappoint. Among the cast we find the regulars such as Samuel L. Jackson or Tim Roth It's quite impressive how Tarantino manages to direct this 2 hour and 50 minutes huis clos without boring the audience to death. In my opinion, he's one of the only contemporary directors that can pull off that kind of thing.I think this is partly due to the fact that the characters are so well-drawn and that even if they all are in some ways « hateful », you really create some kind of bond with them. <br/><br/>On the downside, the movie was a bit too violent at times and I think some scenes of beheading weren't really necessary. But then that's a Tarantino movie so that was to be expected and that wasn't a big bother. The only thing that really let me down was the score. To me music is a majour aspect of Tarantino's movies and The Hateful Eight's original soundtrack was kind of lacking compared to the director's other films. <br/><br/>I also have to admit I was kind of afraid it was going to be very similar to Django but it had nothing to do with it. I loved how the tension grows during the whole movie and you're kind of on the edge of your seat and not totally relaxed, but in a good way. <br/><br/>One of my favourite characters was Jennifer Jason Leigh's, or Domergue, pretty much the only female protagonist in this movie. I had never seen her in another film, and I found her performance both riveting and hilarious. <br/><br/>Overall, that's not the best Tarantino but I would definitely recommend going to see this movie while it's still playing in theatres."
"jrdnlwn","8","6","16","10 January 2016"," Another Great Quentin Tarantino film!
","First of all, I want to congratulate Quentin Tarantino for the release of his 8th film, The Hateful Eight. As a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino's films, I have seen Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2, Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, and Reservoir Dogs. Just like any of his other films, The Hateful Eight did not fail to impress me and it clearly utilizes the same distinctive film style that he uses in all of his films. Although, The Hateful Eight is extremely well made, I cannot say that it's my favorite Quentin movie. But, I am going to thoroughly explain what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent! I noticed that Quentin incorporated a lot of shots that were filmed with slider, dolly, and/or jib. I may be mistaken about the equipment that was used, but the motion of the shots definitely held my attention. The opening credits scene with the crucifix and the horse carriage was very creative; it was all filmed in one long shot, and the camera slowly moved back to reveal the horse carriage moving closer until it went out of frame. I loved the shot where Quentin reveals the people hiding beneath the cabin in the basement; Quentin also filmed this type of shot in the beginning of Inglourious Basterds, and it allows to viewer to be aware of something that the actors are not aware of. I was also fascinated by the fact that almost every moving shot had a purpose for the way it moved. For example, when Daisy was explaining her deal to Chris, the angle of the shot shifted from the right to the left so that John, who was sitting at the table, ended up in the background right before he was about to speak. There were also a lot of long shots in the movie that not only used subtle camera movements, but that also had the focus adjusted to the actor that was speaking. For an example, there was a memorable shot at the table in the cabin where everybody was eating and talking; the camera stayed still but the focus was constantly changing to keep the viewer's attention. I am currently in advanced video production in high school and I find the cinematography very inspiring. <br/><br/>The acting is also incredible; Quentin seemed to do a great job directing the movie and telling the actors exactly how to act. The style for this movie, just like any other movie directed by him, is long, and usually slow, with a lot of violence mixed with humor. I am very fond of his style, but there are many people that express distaste for his style. One of his most popular actors for his films is Samuel L. Jackson, and I found his acting superb and humorous for this movie. Walton Goggins, who apparently played a role in Django Unchained, did a great job acting as Chris in The Hateful Eight. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a fantastic job acting as Daisy Domergue, who is a very creepy and deceitful character... <br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD!***<br/><br/>...Chris and Samuel L. Jackson's character, Major Marquis Warren, don't seem to have a great relationship in the beginning of the film; but at the end of the film, the two characters unexpectedly seem to have planned their rough relationship the entire time, and they end teaming up to hang Daisy. <br/><br/>The only (small) weakness of the film is the story. First of all, I disliked the fact that the entire film took place all in one day at a cabin. I do wish that the story could have gone elsewhere, rather than just the cabin. I also observe that the storyline is very simple, instead of being complicated like Pulp Fiction; I am not saying it's a bad thing, it is just my observation. Even though the story seemed to drag on, it didn't reduce the quality of the movie that much. <br/><br/>I do however love Warren's background story of how he made the general's son suffer in the terribly cold climate; the scene itself is very well done: Warren has his own gun next to the general while he is telling the story, and at the last second, Warren has the general shot dead right before the general can shoot him. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film...Nevertheless, this was a great film filmed by a fantastic director! I recommend this film to anyone who is a Quentin Tarantino fan!"
"florp1","9","16","56","25 December 2015"," Very enjoyable unpredictability
","If, like me, you generally prefer movies in which you can't guess what's going to happen next, you'll probably enjoy this one. Obviously Quentin Tarantino has a unique style of making movies and it once more shows in this one. In this movie, you're never really sure who is the good and who is the bad guy, leading to some changes of the view on the different characters. For me that resulted in a somewhat emotional uncertainty of what I would want to happen next, just to be surprised by a new piece of information/development that changes everything I believed to happen next. So overall, the unpredictability, the twists & turns as well as the way the story is told make this movie a very enjoyable one. On top of that: outstanding performance by Samuel L. Jackson and Tim Roth while some other actors remain a little dull. The reason I don't give 10 stars is that in an almost three hour long movie, I partially expected more character depth."

Domergue is being taken to be hung for her crimes by John Ruth (Kurt Russell), The Hangman. his name is given because, as Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) explains, ""...when John Ruth the Hangman catches you...You hang"". Major Marquis, is another bounty hunter, with a violent past who mysteriously appears before Ruth and Domergue, but comes along as he and Ruth have a past together, making him semi trusted. later we meet Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a man that, like Marquis, suddenly just appears and rides along. he claims to be a the new Sheriff in town,but as you watch the movie, looks can be deceiving and not everyone is to be trusted. these four arrive at a bar due to a coming ice storm. there they meet Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the actual hangman. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) a confederate general. Joe gage (Micheal Madson) the quite introvert, Bob (Demian Bichir), the Mexican. together these 8 individuals will lead you threw a range of deceit and intrigue. this is a western who-done-it to rival any great modern mystery and drama.a must watch for any cinephile. a critics dream in cast and story alike. a must watch."

","Hmm so what did I think of this film. So my first reaction to this film was that I found it pretty boring. I fell asleep for a few minutes in the middle and I really wanted it to end. Now I love Tarantino and I love his dialogue and I was trying to figure out why I couldn't get into this film. For me it just lacked tension. I just never really was on edge about what was going to happen. I'm not sure if this is a story issue or a character issue. Like am I worried that the characters are going to survive, or is the information just not given to me in the correct way. Like this could be a SPOILER for some people.. Warning.. don't read on.. but in the bit where it flashed back, it was like I just didn't care. And I didn't care why they decided to keep Bruce Dern alive. I was just like get on with it already. Anyway, Tarantino films have a way of sometimes getting better with time... or maybe like some other people have said I was expecting a different film, so I'll definitely come back to this for a re-watch at a later date. I was actually writing that thinking Tarantino might be reading it, and I feel bad about giving something a negative review, but maybe it will grow on me."
"jasperbronkhorst","5","7","20","13 January 2016"," Tarantino has become a self indulgent academic
","Despite arguably one of the best opening scenes ever shot, I thought Inglourious Basterds was a 'cold' movie, in the sense that the soul or voice of the maker was painfully absent. It was Tarantino lecturing on cinematic history with the (excellent) cast as nothing more than bloodless puppets (Pitt, Fassbender, Roth) of his cerebral figments. It thought Tarantino had lost his way, that he was disconnected from his art. <br/><br/>And then I saw Django and I forgave him for everything I blamed him for (except for the Jonah Hill sequence), he was back in the Master Seat. Warm blooded, abundantly rich in cinematic joy: one could feel the directors pleasure for the genre and, the characters and above all: the story. <br/><br/>I am not sure what went wrong in Tarantino's head while making The Hateful Eight, but my guess is that he has never overcome the sad early leaking of his script. I can only imagine how this must feel. Since the story was already out there, Tarantino decided to focus on form only (becoming the 70mm posterboy while creating a hermetic stageplay) which in my opinion turned The Hateful Eight into the horrible Frankenstein Monster that is has become. Just a few random thoughts:<br/><br/><ul><li>It is way too long and unbearable self indulgent sometimes</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tim Roth does a spot on Christoph Waltz impression, really uncomfortable to watch</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I don't mind the lack of a classic protagonist, but the impossibility to connect with any of the characters makes the violence actually extremely disturbing and awful to watch. This is quite possible mostly true for Samuel L Jackson scene, where he tries to get Bruce Dern to reach for a gun by telling him he made his son give him head for a blanket since he let him walk bare ass through the snow at gunpoint for two hours. It is really off and Tarantino reveals a chilling fantasy with absolutely no cinematic purpose than to shock the audience. It is in such stark contrast with his trademark 'laugh when there is really nothing to laugh about'. Again, Tarantino on the lecturing seat quoting cinema history with countless references</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A completely redundant flashback scene that is supposed to add to the story feels just weird and cerebral - There are too many characters. And you really don't want to connect with any of them.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>70mm gives a stageplay feeling to the film which distorted my sense of space and characters on an uncomfortable level</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Kurt Russel (who is right up there with Chuck Norris) is just not the man to embody Tarantino's fantasy, not in Death Proof, not in The Hateful Eight </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is so much more but I want to conclude my thoughts with the fact that Tarantino is back at the Inglorious Basterds level: a self indulgent academic who has become fat on facts and form. He 'Tarantinoizes' existing popular film genres, which makes him one of those rare directors who can hide his lack of original inner source in plain sight. He is always dependent on existing vehicles to carry his cinematic vision in. His intelligence in doing so is rather intimidating. </li></ul><br/><br/>Let's wrap up by giving a great compliment to Robert Bridge Richardson for his excellent cinematography, Ennio Morricone for his score (but I am afraid that the Master has lend his name to this movie as opposed to doing actual composing.), Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins for their strong performance and let's move on. <br/><br/>I praise Tarantino for all the work he does on preserving film along with Anderson and Nolan, but he completely lost his way here, being the geek that he is. Just too much form. <br/><br/>Tarantino is unmistakably a mean motherf*cker, but with a big warm heart for story and character. In the absence of this heart he is just a mean motherf*cker, which is hard to watch. <br/><br/>Two more to go to make good, I am full of confidence and look forward to the new 'Tarantino'. In modest 35mm."
"shadowyx12","9","13","45","1 January 2016"," Quentin Tarantino returns to form with his latest film.
","I'll admit - Tarantino was one of the very first filmmakers to inspire me to start taking movies a little more seriously. I've enjoyed almost everything that he has worked on. I have seen every film that he has directed - and 'The Hateful Eight' is the latest one.<br/><br/>However, putting my fandom aside, I will try to review Tarantino's latest film with as little bias as possible. Before I dive in, I have to say that this film is not as action-oriented as 'Inglorious Basterds' or 'Django Unchained', nor as game-changing as 'Pulp Fiction'; if anything, 'The Hateful Eight' falls more in line with Tarantino's first film, 'Reservoir Dogs'.<br/><br/>Although this is by far my favourite film of the year, I do not consider it to be the best. <br/><br/>All the main actors are delightfully despicable. They are the main reason why I stuck around for the entire 2 hrs. and 48 mins. of this film's runtime. Not only do they bring a great deal of enthusiasm and energy to their characters (trust me, every actor seemed like they had fun with his/her role), but they also managed to create this undeniable chemistry for them. There are no interactions that feel awkward or forced - everyone just kind of works naturally off of each other. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the standout here; without giving away too much, her performance as Daisy Domergue will more than likely make your skin crawl - she is scary good in the role. Samuel L. Jackson also gives his best performance in recent years. There are scenes where his delivery can either get a crowd cheering or laughing their guts out (all because of how unexpected he can be).<br/><br/>The score by Ennio Morricone might possibly be the most memorable of this year's. It's a dark and creepy vibe mixed with Morricone's signature western vibe - and it sets the mood perfectly for what's to come.<br/><br/>The story is unlike anything I've seen on the big screen before. This isn't a traditional story of good guys vs. bad guys - it's a story about morally ambiguous characters who couldn't trust each other less. It is both suspenseful and unpredictable - something that a lot of films these days aren't. I personally had a lot of fun trying to figure out what would happen next based on the clues left by Tarantino. Yes, the film does feel incredibly slow at times (especially during the middle), but Tarantino makes up for it by making each payoff more shocking and rewarding than the previous one. The final climax is a fantastic surprise - perhaps one of Tarantino's finest.<br/><br/>The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful. Every time there's a wide shot of the stagecoach galloping across the snowy terrain, my eyes can't help but go wide. Unfortunately, most of the film takes place inside, so there aren't that many shots of the surrounding natural environment. However, that's not to say that the indoor shots aren't also great to feast your eyes upon. Even though the film is shot with 65mm film (and projected to 70mm), Tarantino and Richardson (D.P.) still managed to make the most of showing off the film's wonderfully designed haberdashery. <br/><br/>Tarantino's daring direction and bold decisions not only make 'The Hateful Eight' one of this year's most unique cinematic experiences but also one of this year's more problematic films. As mentioned, the film is LONG - and one can really feel it drag on at certain points. The pacing will throw off those expecting a lot more violence (don't worry, there's some good bloody violence in this film as well). Finally, a lot of what happens in this film doesn't contribute to the main plot, but to character development instead (and to great effect).<br/><br/>In reality, if I weren't a fan of Tarantino, I would give 'The Hateful Eight' a 7/10. For an average viewer, the film will seem like a long and boring journey. For a true film fan, it won't be something you'll want to miss."

","Quentin Tarantino's highly anticipated ""The Hateful Eight"" further augments the director's portfolio of transgressive, innovative, and influential filmmaking. He successfully enhances the quality of his film with the use of the 70mm extended edition featuring an overture and intermission. Tarantino pays homage to the epics of the 50's and 60's with this long forgotten film technique. It pays off very well because it provides the viewer with more of an experience rather than just an ordinary watch.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is a film that is highly influenced by other films. It features the same atmosphere and tension of ""The Thing"", the talky ultraviolent stage play of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" the whodunit mystery of ""Clue,"" and finally the setting, genre, and vengeful mood of ""Django Unchained."" QT masterfully creates well rounded nefarious characters in an enclosed environment. The characters are brought to life by phenomenal performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, and Jennifer Jason Leigh -- who was the only person to get an Oscar nod. These performances were guided by QT's extraordinary writing. Also the score was excellent from legendary composer Ennio Morricone, and really made rather slow moments more suspenseful. Finally the cinematography was great and almost matched ""The Revenant"" in artistic beauty. <br/><br/>The main complaints about the film from critics are that the film is overlong with excessive dialogue, excessive violence, and finally an absence of character morals. The dialogue did drag on especially in the first half but it was all made worth while in the second half with the violent interplay between characters, the gut twisting climax, and finally the jaw dropping monologues QT is known for. The film is incredibly violent but it helps set the hateful and brutal tone of the film. Finally the characters are mostly despicable, and lack morals. But how many movies actually have a 'bad guys vs. less bad guys' storyline? Like seriously this is the core of the movie -- the characters are hateful! It's called ""The Hateful Eight"" for a reason and the characters certainly are not sugarcoated or lionized in any way. <br/><br/>Overall this film is another brutal and highly entertaining masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino."

Set as a western this time out, the first hour keeps you comfortably in your seat until all the players have assembled. Towards the end there's just too much gun play and even though our protagonists survive to the end of the film - it's likely they'll bleed out and die with the rest of the players now littering this rather Shakespearian stage.

"lucasnochez","10","5","13","3 February 2016"," Film Review: The Hateful Eight/
","Watching a Tarantino film is a cinematic experience, better yet, a right of movie-passage; an experience that may not be as recognizable or appreciated now by the vast majority, but can surely be pointed out and appreciated by a fine few who can find similarities and influences with some of the last great auteurs and great directors of the past. And yet, like his films, Tarantino intended to present his sly and ultra-violent eighth film in the most roadshow way possible; with an overture, intermission and in 70mm no less. Maybe your wondering, after eight films, has Tarantino out done himself, especially after the exceptional critical and commercial praise of Django Unchained, for which he won an Academy Award in the Original Screenplay category? The answer my friends is, as Samuel L. Jackson so coyly says within the first lines of the film, ""Got room for one more?"", cause Tarantino ain't going anywhere yet!<br/><br/>Tarantino's newest film, The Hateful Eight is every bit as brilliant, violent, unapologetic and masterful than his last, plus some. Writing in a way that can only Tarantino can write, The Hateful Eight proves that the master scribbler has no intention of letting up, or letting lose of his racial, sexist and down-right offensive subject matter in his older age.<br/><br/>But before we get into all that, lets take a little history lesson<br/><br/>Back in 2014, the original script for the film leaked online, which gave Tarantino a very easy choice to make, he scrapped the project in pre-production altogether. Opting to make the film a novella instead, a cast was chosen to give a brief reading of the script in LA. The cast, who is almost identical to the final cast seen in the film, with the stark exception of Jennifer Jason Leigh, who replaced Amber Tamblyn in the read as Daisy Domergue, as well as the addition of Demián Bichir and a super secret role of Channing Tatum, The Hateful Eight saw the light after all. Thankfully, after a very successful and publicized read, and with the help of the convincing of good friend Samuel L. Jackson, a frequent collaborator of Tarantino, the writer extraordinaire re-wrote the first draft of the script, created two new alternative endings, and announced his plans to continue with The Hateful Eight as his next film. Alas, here I am today.<br/><br/>The film, which circles mostly among eight main characters, tells the story of a hangman, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is notorious for claiming his earning with subject who are alive, and his seamlessly impossible quest of getting the wanted Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a woman convicted of murder, to the proper authorities for a hefty bounty. Unknown to him at the time on his way to Red Rocks, Colorado, Ruth's coach, steered by the steady O.B Jackson (James Parks), encounters one helluva winter storm. Untrusting of anyone and everyone, except O.B, the storm swallows the travelling companions of two men; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter, with some precious cargo of his own, and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), an ex Lost-Causer militiaman who is on his way to Red Rocks to claim his new badge as Sheriff and inevitably, issue both Ruth and Warren, their bounty prizes. Too many coincidences yet? Trust me, we are just getting started.<br/><br/>As the two horseless men make their way on Ruth's coach, Ruth makes an alliance with Major Warren, to both protect their bounties from anyone threatening to take it away from them. While the three men bond in the most bizarre ways, Mannix, an ex Confederate, laughs in the face of Major Warren and his conquests during the Civil War, showing just how stormy the next chapters of this epic story will actually be. As the storm takes a turn for the worst, the coach and all its occupants are forced to seek refuge in Minnie's (Dana Gourrier) Haberdashery, a cozy and warm little stagecoach lodge the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>Once settled, paranoia levels are high while we are introduced to the rest of Tarantino's Hateful Eight. Among the new eight are; Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a quiet man who so happens to be at Minnie's on the quest to see his mother; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) an old Confederate General who is just being cozy playing chess; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the hangman responsible of the actual hanging of Daisy once at Red Rocks, and my personal favourite Bob The Mexican (Damián Bichir), the only person in charge of running Minnie's place while she is 'conveniently' away with her husband Sweet Dave (Gene Jones). Once the already inhabitant guests greet the new coach full of killers, bounty hunters and coachmen, the stage is set for one of the best whodunnits films in recent memory.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is Tarantino's first attempt at a mystery film and without question, what a success it is. As expected, Tarantino, arguably, one of the best actor directors working today (and even possibly, of all-time), assembles a stellar cast full of vivid characters who, may not be are favourite group of individuals, ones we aren't suppose to like much, but end up loving, regardless of their intentions."

","Although I am not blind to his weaknesses, I do confess that I enjoy Tarantino's work and in particular love his writing of pulpy dialogue and the way he can draw tension from even the most innocent conversation. His films are littered with examples, and it is this element of his work that drew me to The Hateful Eight. The combination of a single location with a load of actors capable of delivering the material, made me assume we were in for a film where tension built across the whole film in the way he has done with individual scenes before.<br/><br/>The reality is that the film partly manages this, and for sure there is pleasure to be had in his combination of dialogue driven scenes with sudden violent interludes. However at almost three hours, there is simply too much film and not enough content. Considering that the film is more or less set in a single room for most of the film one wonders why it also tries to be such an epic in presentation. Okay the opening hour is mostly on the trail and has some great sweeping landscapes and vistas, but even then the real action is inside a wagon. This duality did work against the film for me because it feels so sprawling, but yet the actual narrative seems to be driven by scenes that require a tightness and tension, and it doesn't wholly come together. The setting and the spread of characters occasionally has some interesting things to say about race and politics, however it is too saggy in the delivery and takes way too long to deliver everything, that it does tend to lose impact in many ways.<br/><br/>Those that like his work (as I do) will still find a lot to enjoy (as I did), but Hateful Eight is a flawed film. The cast really enjoy their performances even if they don't quite have the presence of equivalent characters or scenes, whether it be moments that invoke Reservoir Dogs, or Tim Roth for some reason playing a version of Waltz's character in Django. The film looks gorgeous and has a great score, but it is the writing that brings in the issues. The lack of discipline in the delivery robs the film of a lot of the power it should have had, and in the end while it should be a satisfying resolution to the mystery, instead it because loud, bloody, unpleasantly mean-spirited and surprisingly unengaging and lacking the tension all the parts suggest it should have had."
"Ken-Tajalli","8","5","13","19 January 2016"," Viva Tarantino, Viva Leone, Viva Morricone
","Love it or hate it, it arguably is Tarantino's best work yet. Enio Morricone wrote the music, and Sergio Leone's influence in style and camera work is everywhere to be seen, but make no mistake, this 'is' a Tarantino movie. It is long (about three hours) with even an intermission! it can seem long-winded and slow, depending on your pre-conceived expectations, but to me there was not a dull moment. Acting is superb (mostly) - specially from Walton Goggins, Miss Leigh and of-course Samuel Jackson. Kurt Russel also did a wonderful job portraying John Ruth. Watch it and make your own determination, don't go to the theatre expecting it to be yet another western, indeed don't go with any expectations, just with an open mind and curiosity. I bet you won't consider your time wasted."
"callofdutysucks","8","5","13","15 January 2016"," Fun Tarantino ride - not the greatest.
","Like I said, it's not the greatest ride from Tarantino, but still, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. The movie is basically about two bounty hunters who find shelter in a small haberdashery until morning, when snow stops falling. There, they find four guys who are hiding a secret. One of the bounty hunters has a criminal who is to be hanged. Through talking and talking and talking (with some action here and there) we find out a lot during the story. Like all other Tarantino movies, this one has signature witty dialogue Tarantino's known for. It's got a great story, has a great set of characters and dialogue, so what's wrong? What's wrong is that the film gets boring in the middle because it takes time to get the story right. The ending of the film is violent and gory, but not really satisfying. Asks a lot of questions, but answers none. That's what's wrong. This is one of the darkest Tarantino films yet, but still manages to get some really dark humor here and there. Samuel L. Jackson like always nails the role as a bounty hunter Marquis Warren. Kurt Russell is also great, but what surprised me most was Jennifer Jason Leigh. Her performance is energetic and fantastic. Final verdict - 8/10"

","Overall, not a bad movie.<br/><br/>Had great characters, intense sequences (at times) and had your usual Tarantino quirkiness that you can't find in any other violent, Western movie. But my only complaint:<br/><br/>HOLY SH*T, it was WAYYYY to long. There were many scenes that could have been cut down in length (scenes where the stage coach is just driving to the house, characters nailing the door in, dialogue scenes, etc)<br/><br/>I give this movie a 8/10 for that reason alone. If this was 2 hours or at least Django length, it would have been a 9/10 or possibly a 10/10. Otherwise, Great work Tarantino. Don't get to old on us!"
"ligonlaw","6","11","37","22 December 2015"," Lengthy Disappointment
","Quentin Tarantino has created another category of film, like Woody Allen. You know what to expect, and the film will deliver more or less what you were expecting. A Tarantino film is expected to be especially violent and harsh. The Hateful Eight runs 2 hours and 47 minutes, and it unfolds slowly, as you brace yourself for the inevitable bloodbath. In this film, the violence comes but not immediately.<br/><br/>The film resembles a stage play in that most of the dialogue and action take place in a single room called Minnie's Haberdashery. There are outside shots purporting to be a snowy Wyoming. The cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>My problem is with the script, the language and the thinly drawn characters. The reasons for the shedding of much blood are varied. Some are blown away for racial reasons. Others are blown away for economic reasons. Some are blown away for revenge. Some of are poisoned so that they puke blood on the floor and on the faces of each other. <br/><br/>We don't get to know these characters well enough to feel hatred for them. So when they are dispatched from this earth we don't feel any real emotions. They are in a Tarantino film and you know there will be bloodshed. When it happens, you aren't shocked and you don't feel the loss of them. They are, for the most part, unlikeable characters or stone cold killers.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino's eighth film, and he has made better ones, and some much worse. You roll the dice with Tarantino. Sometimes you get something brilliant like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Django"" and sometimes you get beheadings and a fountain of blood showering the scene and an irritating revision of history like ""Inglorious Basterds.""<br/><br/>Not his best work."
"corozin99","6","10","33","27 December 2015"," Same old, same old
","Another bloated, pointlessly complicated film from Tarantino. All the performances are excellent, in particular from Russell and Leigh, but I have to admit to getting a little tired of seeing Samuel L Jackson reprise Jules the gangster *yet again*.<br/><br/>And for all the plaudits being heaped on Tarantino's script I found the story bloated, over-wordy and some of the plot devices utterly pointless. The scene where Jackson taunts and then shoots the old General develops from absolutely nothing and seemed inserted just to set up the resulting killing.<br/><br/>In addition I am no PC hound but Tarantino seems determined to insert the word ""nigger"" into every dialogue just to make a point of using it. I'm sure it was a commonly used word back in the 1900s but Tarantino seems to use it like a badge of honour, and (as in Django Unchained) it's overuse is noticeable, unpleasant and in my view ultimately detracts from the film.<br/><br/>In summary this is nothing new. It's Reservoir Dogs all over again in stetsons, but at 3 hours long it lacks Reservoir Dogs' wonderful pacing."

One modern song which takes away from the movie like Django Unchained's ending shooting scene. Also, a lot of blood and dialogue. Overall, it was really good. Way, way, way better than the #1 movie of 2015 (Mad Max Fury Road).<br/><br/>Hope to see more westerns like this and Bone Tomahawk (which I thought was even better, BTW)."

"Anurag-Shetty","10","6","17","22 January 2016"," Another unforgettable Quentin Tarantino masterpiece!
","The Hateful Eight tells a story set in the post Civil War era. On a cold & stormy winter day in Wyoming, a lone stagecoach is racing through the snow. The stagecoach's passengers are, a bounty hunter named Major Marquis Warren(Samuel L. Jackson), a hangman named John Ruth(Kurt Russell), Ruth's prisoner Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh) & a man named Sheriff Chris Mannix(Walton Goggins). As the blizzard gets worse, the stagecoach stops at Minnie's Haberdashery. Major Warren, Ruth, Domergue & Mannix decide to stay at Minnie's Haberdashery till the blizzard subsides & it's safe for them to continue their journey. While at the Haberdashery, they meet four more people who are also staying there, till the snow storm ends. As the hours go by, the atmosphere becomes tense & not everyone is who they say they are. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a mind blowing film! Director Quentin Tarantino proves yet again, that he makes some of the boldest, most original & best films in Hollywood. This film has elements of comedy, action & drama. It is also extremely thrilling & there is a little bit of suspense thrown in, too. What's really interesting is that, since all the characters in the film are questionable, you really can't guess the true motives of anybody. Basically, The Hateful Eight has all the ingredients that make Tarantino movies, unforgettable classics. I would recommend you to give this one a miss if, you hate violence with tons of gore. The music by Ennio Morricone is perfect & sets the tone for the film. The performances are the highlight of the film. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as Major Marquis Warren. Jackson's performance as the treacherous major, is flawless & one of his best performances on celluloid. Kurt Russell is brilliant as John Ruth. Jennifer Jason Leigh is another standout performer as Daisy Domergue. Leigh portrays everything her imprisoned character goes through, effortlessly. Walton Goggins is outstanding as Sheriff Chris Mannix. Demian Bichir is good as Bob. Tim Roth is spectacular as Oswaldo Mobray. Michael Madsen is great as Joe Gage. Bruce Dern is fantastic as General Sandy Smithers. James Parks is impressive as O.B Jackson. Last but definitely not the least, Channing Tatum is superb in his short yet significant role, as Jody. The supporting characters are effective as well. The Hateful Eight is a must watch for all Tarantino fans & everyone who wants to watch one of the best films of the year."

","And we wonder why there are so many mass shootings in America!<br/><br/>Tarantino takes the unlimited pursuit of freedom of expression beyond sanity in this brutal gorefest. No matter how many times Mr Obama gets up and says that the killing must stop, it will never end as long as this sort of stuff is produced as entertainment. In a normal, sane world, Tarantino would be identified as a psychopath for having written and produced such murderous mayhem, but America is not such a place. They lionize him and march him triumphantly down Hollywood Boulevard, with as good a chance as anyone of picking up a golden statue at the end of the route. The theatre should have provided vomit bags because there are so many anti-peristaltic scenes that it's inevitable that someone's gonna upchuck before the show is over. The strange thing is that there were NO gasps of revulsion from the audience through the whole length of the screening. <br/><br/>Are we inured to such violence as a society? <br/><br/>So why do I rate it a ten? <br/><br/>Well, it is a perfect and excellent example of what is wrong with a society where guns and violence are glorified. Once you accept the film for what it is and get over the fact that you're actually watching it instead of volunteering at the food bank, you realize that it is tour de force of acting and production. All of the main characters are powerhouses of evil,with the secondary roles the personification of wholesomeness. Tarantino engineers a very clever juxtaposition of these human qualities with the way he structures the story, and the scriptwriting is just superb underneath the bloody and horrific mess. It is amazing that Mr T manages to weave some of the most politically incorrect language and culturally unacceptable behaviour into characters and make them almost endearing to the audience. Kurt Russell, Samuel L Jackson, Tim Roth and Jennifer Jason Leigh give fantastic performances but everyone in the cast is excellent. If I ruled the world, stuff like this would never make the screen but I don't and so I have to understand that the aforementioned freedom of expression trumps everything else. Nutcases believe that guns and violence solve problems and as long as we keep feeding them fodder like this there will be repeat episodes."

","Western Touch in the classic sense,full Suspenseful, Funny, and Violent this movie has got everything.The closest comparison of Tarantino's filmography to The Hateful Eight would be mixture of Reservoir Dogs & Django Unchained.Don't matter If You Are a pure class fan or straight simple movie liker,you will admire this movie. Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film, a Jacobean western, intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing his own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale. Moreover, Tarantino now makes a serious star of Walton Goggins, giving a hilarious performance as the deeply unreliable Chris Mannix, soi-disant Sheriff Elect of Red Rock, Wyoming. And Ennio Morricone has composed a score which is as sinuous and catchy as anything he has written: a theme with a tense and gloomy tread, coolly cranking up the tension. Note:- Some mindless,over- smart people will say this movie is overrated, because for those guys all time greatest movie like The Shawshank redemption & The Godfather and every other great movie is also overrated,so ignore them & enjoy this movie."
"michaelhirakida","9","8","25","8 January 2016"," A Review and a Message to the haters.
","Dear Haters of Quentin Tarintino's Hateful Eight:<br/><br/>If you are thinking about leaving a dislike on this review, don't bother. You've already done it on Several other positive reviews so why even bother rating a review like this? I will not be discouraged to talk about my opinion and I will not take people shoving hate down this movie without any good reason at all. So If you are a hater of this movie and are going to rate, read and listen. If you're a person who feels discouraged by these reviews, don't worry, I'll tell you everything you need to know.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, The Hateful Eight is a modern masterpiece of cinematic art, Tarintino's movies have been getting much better since Django Unchained was released and that is where the hate seems to start. People are offended by the overuse of the N Word in his movies, but may I remind you that this takes place in the 19th Century when that slang was used most frequently and is an important part of the movie due to it's relationship with the world today with all the police brutality on black people. <br/><br/>It's Misogynist you say? Well, I can't really say anything without spoiling it, so I'll give you some spoilers. Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is a criminal in the movie who has done filthy things. Yes she gets beaten by John Ruth and Major Warren (Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson) but it's because she is evil. She is the main antagonist for the movie for crying out loud! Do you really think it's not OK to punish a criminal for what the person has done no matter what sex they are? Although it's not seen, it's talked about. She is really rotten in this movie, really. In the end, hanging her was justice. This is not acts of misogyny, it is an act of law and order even if it's done in a sadistic way.<br/><br/>Do I even have to talk about how violent this movie is? We all know it's a Tarintino movie. But the movie has a different way of gruesomeness, it builds up, and up, and up until the climax where everything shatters. People say Oh it's tedious and boring. Not one moment in this film is boring. NOT. A. SINGLE. MOMENT. The whole movie has amazing writing and dialog and twists that will keep you entertained until the end credits. Did you haters just sleep through the second and third act thinking nothing was going to happen? Well guess what. Stuff does happen. We find out the Lincoln Letter (Which is important) is a phony, we find out Warren killed Sanford's son, we find out Daisy works with her brother in a gang, we find out who poisoned the coffee, we find out that the three people working for Jody are not who they say they are, many people are killed. That's Boring!? I have no clue what is wrong with you but you need to get your head checked. None of this was boring, to me at least.<br/><br/>His Epic Fail of a WWII film doesn't work because the dialog is not interesting and nothing happens. Plus it's offensively inaccurate to what happened. Here, The Hateful Eight is a movie that is so well written it may as well be one of the best screenplays of all time.<br/><br/>Let me tell you what I loved about the movie and maybe you can understand why people like it also. I saw the roadshow version (where the projector broke after intermission so we had to watch a digital print) and to tell you the truth, it's resurrecting film. Hearing the projector, looking at the grain of the picture, the sharp picture quality of Ultra Panavision 70 is unbelievable. This is a film to be cherished. The Use of 70 mm film is making a comeback with things like Interstellar and The Dark Knight Rises, Tarintino cares about film so he made a film that was actually filmed with reel to show how much he cares. This was my first time actually seeing a modern movie not only in Ultra Panavision 70, but the first modern movie I saw to have an Overture and an Intermission which I highly defend the use of. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast is excellent here, Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Walter Goggins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Dern, Zoe Bell and Channing Tatum are all excellent and are dedicated to their performances. Every single line you believe is actually real and coherent.<br/><br/>The writing is superb as I said before, those 3 Hours went by fast and I didn't even know that three hours went by! Tarintino knows how to make an excellent screenplay when the writing is so good that time flies by fast. <br/><br/>The build up is amazing, I was in suspense the whole time and I really wanted to know who would survive this bloodbath. ""Boring"" this isn't. Not a single moment is boring as I stated.<br/><br/>Look I can't say what all the other positive reviews have said but this experience is one I will remember for a very, very long time. If you are easily offended by gore and language, then you would be better off seeing freaking Norm of the North which comes out next week. But for fans of using actual film reel, film students who want to make movies, people who love Tarintino, and people who like a movie that is gripping throughout, The Hateful Eight is one to see. I don't only think this is one of 2015's best films, I think it's one of the all time best in my opinion. So try watching it again if you had a hard time with it and maybe you can understand what he was trying to accomplish. <br/><br/>Signed, The Reviewer.<br/><br/>97/100 A"

If you like Horrors, Westerns, Agatha Christie mysteries, violence and lot of blood you will enjoy this film, otherwise you will be bored. It seems it was shot through with cruelty for cruelty's sake.

"Zubacz","7","11","38","20 December 2015"," A more serious addition to the Tarantino Collection
","At start, I'll say that my favourite films by Quentin Tarantino are Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. I also liked his part in Four Rooms as well as the iconic scenes in Jackie Brown or Reservoir Dogs. I consider the dialogue in True Romance to be a masterpiece. Therefore, it can be safely said, I am a fan of Tarantino's more humorous, more pop-culture-oriented films. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight did not fall into that favourite category of mine. It was a serious and brutal film, where the more humorous moments were provided mainly by the gruesome death scenes. The characters were incredibly vivid and real, but not particularly memorable. Over two hours of the 160 minute film takes place in one room. The focus is on the character interaction, with a lot of attention devoted to highlighting racial differences. The plot driving the film forward however, is quite limited. <br/><br/>The film is very well made. The beautifully shot harsh environment, the music by Ennio Morricone, the costumes perfectly fitting with the portrayed characters, all make for a very captivating watch. It does not quite feel like a Tarantino film though, at least not in the sense I was used to. It is definitely worth watching, for the grit and character interaction, but I missed the incredibly quotable dialogue and the pop-culture icons of Tarantino's other works. <br/><br/>7.5/10 from me."

"jack_the_BOSS","9","4","10","22 April 2016"," Tarantino's Best Since Pulp Fiction
","On December 28 that I was fortunate enough to see the film in its glorious 70 millimeter, anamorphic Ultrapanavision film experience. While visiting my sister in Tulsa, my girlfriend, my sister, a good friend, and I packed into the car and made the trip to Oklahoma City to see The Hateful Eight Roadshow during it's brief week-long early release. We were given limited-edition pamphlets to reinforce the 1950s grand film exhibition style showing, something very exciting to experience in 2015.<br/><br/>This wasn't the last time that I got to see the extended film version of The Hateful Eight, however, as on March 21, the older theater in my area, the one that still has film projectors, was playing that version. Ryan, a big Tarantino fan also, asked me to tag along with him to this showing, and for reasons I will soon expound, I was eager to do so.<br/><br/>The film opens with an overture (and clearly labeled as such) which emphasizes the, perhaps, best aspect of the movie: the incredible score by Ennio Morricone. The great Italian composer of western staples (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly for one) delivers some of his most haunting and powerful sounds in The Hateful Eight. The main theme lingered in my head for hours and I still enjoy listening to the music by itself or with a good game of Bang! the Dice Game (one of my favorite board games and one that plays out a wild west shoot out where everyone has a hidden role; I kept thinking I was watching Bang!: The Dice Game: The Movie). The suspense and intrigue Taratino captured in his anamorphic lenses are even better capture by Morricone's menacing motifs.<br/><br/>As the overture fades back into background music, the viewer is greeted with awe-inspiring wide images of snowy Colorado as O.B., the driver, and notably not one of the titular eight, leads his wagon down a winding path. The stubborn desire for Tarantino to shoot the film in a 2.76:1 aspect ratio is immediately understood; not only the for the breath-taking images, but also the magnificent flicker. It's not easy to see a movie actually played on film these days (and a big reason I tend to prefer the term movie to film). The score's theme builds as an aesthetically pleasing title sequence plays (the climax of the theme occurs as Morricone's name appears, a nice touch.)<br/><br/>Inside the wagon are two of our eight, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Daisy ""The Prisoner"" Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They are soon (well, this first section of the is almost an hour long) joined by Major Marquis ""The Bounty Hunter"" Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris ""The Sheriff"" Mannix (Walton Goggins). The interplay of these characters was one of my favorite aspects of the film. Tarantino's dialog is quick and witty, anachronistic yet still believable. As he frequently does in his movies, Tarantino deals with race, gender, and, in this case, nationality you might say, disputes head-on in an at once hilarious and profound way. As the group arrives at the haberdashery, where the remaining two hours of the film take place, a whodunit mystery is flamed as John Ruth tries to figure out which of the many shady characters are after his $10,000 bounty on Miss Domergue. The slow action, strong suspense and intrigue, and engaging dialog brought me immediately back to Reservoir Dogs, one of my all-time favorite films.<br/><br/>After the intermission, and yes, there was a 15 minute intermission, lights on and all, I wasn't quite as satisfied with the film. Suspenseful sections seemed to be answered too quickly without permitting the view a chance to solve anything. The film went to more high action, reminding me more of Django: Unchained rather than Reservoir Dogs. Don't get me wrong, Django was fantastic, but my favorite aspects of Tarantino's films are the dialog and the slick aesthetic paired with the intrigue of a great story. I don't think those decisions made it a bad movie, but I was personally a little disappointed. Still, the ending of the movie was exceptionally well done and tied up the story as well as the themes of the story beautifully. I have already seen the film twice in four months and I would watch it yet again tomorrow. Rewatching the film, I had new appreciation for the character's and was also able to pick up on a lot of the subtle foreshadowing. When you go back and watch a movie saying, ""How could I be so blind?"" you know you're watching a great director. I place The Hateful Eight among my top four Tarantino films at least, and, thereby, as one of my favorite movies period. I need to listen to the main theme again right now!"

You just keep thinking that there must be a good bit about to come, and then you'll get five minutes of something interesting before it goes back to nothing happening. The worst part of the movie was when I looked at the time and realised that there was still another hour and a half left to go.<br/><br/>The premise of having 8 people who are all somewhat evil stuck together sounds interesting. However it leaves you with nobody to like, but nor do you really hate any of them, so you don't really get connected to any of them or care what might happen to them.<br/><br/>It would have got a 1 or 0 for being that dull, but there are two wonderful Samuel L Jackson monologues that are superb and deserve praise both for the writing and delivery of it."

","Got to see Tarantino's The Hateful Eight today in 70mm! For the uninitiated, most movies are, or rather were, shot with 35mm. However, the trend today is overwhelmingly becoming digital photography, which can be effective but is also inundating modern cinema with depressingly blurry camera pans and other adverse effects. Anyway, Tarantino's film was shot with 65mm film (the extra 5mm comes from the accompanying audio track), and the difference between 35mm and 65mm is like 720p vs. 4k; significantly higher image quality and resolution.<br/><br/>To get the full experience, you'd want to see it projected through an actual 70mm film projector. This is easier said than done since the cost of getting the proper equipment reportedly runs $80,000 per auditorium. To that end, the Weinstein Company has helped outfit a handful of theaters around the country with said equipment, and if you want a truly premium experience I encourage you to seek one out. There's at least one theater in most major cities.<br/><br/>However, as admirable as this audacious Roadshow is, I question Tarantino's choice of movie to do it with. On paper a Western sounds great to shoot with 70mm film; vast landscapes, grizzled faces, close-ups of holstered pistols with clenched hands around their grips Unfortunately, most of The Hateful Eight takes place in a relatively small and dim interior. The movie looks nice, but not nearly as good as it would've with outside daylight bringing out every crisp detail. The contrast seemed a touch high, as well. I'm thinking of one shot in particular of a stagecoach moving alongside a stream outside. The snow is very white, and the stagecoach is very dark. Not much middle ground. I hate to say it but I'm looking forward to The Revenant's cinematography more now.<br/><br/>Tarantino's well known for his dialogue, and it doesn't let down here. I'm not sure it was intentional, but at one point several characters are accused of wrongdoing. I noticed two of the three were actors that came under suspicion from Tarantino for leaking his script of The Hateful Eight early. Very quickly I started noting parallels between the characters' defenses and the actors' real life defenses when accused of the script leak. Maybe it's coincidence, but that added some fascinating depth to the scene for me.<br/><br/>Direction is top notch too, and even at 3 hours the movie doesn't get boring. Maybe slow in some spots, but never boring. That being said, the story itself isn't particularly compelling or amazing. There's a very ""whodunit"" feel to the whole affair, with a sense of mystery evoking And Then There Were None or maybe The Thing. The buildup is better than the underwhelming payoff, sadly, but it's by no means unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Performances make up for story shortcomings. Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins (glad to see him getting some bigger roles after Justified), Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, and even Channing Tatum are all in top form. I was happy to see Zoë Bell get a small part too. Michael Madsen just recycles his old performances, however, but he was the only low point among the otherwise terrific ensemble cast. Similarly, Morricone lends his talents to great effect. It's not The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it's still a solid mix between The Untouchables and Two Mules for Sister Sara.<br/><br/>This isn't Tarantino's best movie, but it's probably one of my favorite 2015 releases alongside Mad Max, Ex Machina, Rogue Nation, and Sicario. I'd put it ahead of Death Proof and Jackie Brown, and about on par with Reservoir Dogs. Do yourself a favor and seek out one of the 70mm Roadshow locations if possible. It wouldn't be the end of the world to see it on a digital projector, but the image quality will degrade somewhat and you'll lose a big part of what makes the experience special.<br/><br/>8/10"

","*Pretty much no spoilers. Go see it. It's worth it!<br/><br/>Firstly, I've got to give credit to Samuel L here. I wasn't sure how he would mesh into a Western set 18 something Wyoming but he is the best character in the movie. The girl does a terrific job as the psycho chained to the Hangman. I liked that they didn't reveal much about her or anyone until later in the story. It was story telling at it's best and each character was very unique. <br/><br/>There was a lot of dialogue in the movie, but the dialogue was tremendous. In typical Tarantino fashion, the story begins to unwind and we are given glimpses into the past. Anyone asking why is it called the Hateful 8 there were more characters? Please get a clue. 4 people in the first stage coach, 4 in the second, and boy each character would kill at the drop of a hat. Were any of the kills justified? Is any killing justified? That's for you to decide. <br/><br/>There are a lot of racial slurs in the movie, but it's meant to show what it was actually like during the post Civil War Era. A black Yankee sitting with a Confederate General. Imagine what that would have actually been like? I loved how Samuel L spoke, and that scene was pretty funny. He was very intelligent and violent. Kurt Russell was great as the Hangman, Goggins was excellent as the Cracker Sheriff, and Tim Roth was also great as ""The Hangman."" I thought they could have used Michael Madsen better, which was surprising because he is usually the most violent character in QT's films. <br/><br/>As always with Tarantino, it was a very gory movie, but that was to be expected. It was over the top and I found myself laughing about how the characters weren't bothered a bit when viciously murdering someone. <br/><br/>I thought it was a great movie. I don't understand how there are so many 1's. You think this movie is on par with Open Water and Jack and Jill?! I don't think so."

I think the story is very cool, but is there all those extended dialogs necessary?<br/><br/>The movie is very long (2 hours and 45 minutes) I couldn't keep my head straight, I had to pay attention, but it was hard.<br/><br/>Next time Tarantino premieres a new movie, I'll keep in mind that there always be a lot of dialogs.

","The plot is simple and easy to follow in five chapters, we first meet Major Marquis Warren stranded with three dead bounties being transported to Red Rock and hitches a ride with the well-known bounty hunter John Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue who he plans to see hanged for her crimes in Red Rock. John is suspicious for anyone trying to steal Daisy for her substantial bounty from him, and along the trip they also meet Former Lost-Causer militiaman and the supposed new 'Sheriff' of Red Rock Chris Mannix who convinces John to hitch a ride to town in his coach. Having a wild blizzard fast approaching behind them, they stop for the night to get shelter from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, where other unknown lodgers reside from the blizzard; Bob (the caretaker of the Haberdashery while the owners are on leave), Oswaldo Mobray (the hangman of Red Rock), Joe Gage (a quiet cowboy on his way to his mother's) and Sanford Smithers (a former Confederate general of the Civil War). A suspicious Ruth disarms all but Warren, but it becomes a long night of suspicion, deception and whom to trust for all these eight strangers as who is really telling the truth.<br/><br/>The first act of the film is more of a character build up, where the audience is introduced to the eight strangers where they state where they come from and what is their purpose to the plot. The casting here is well chosen, with Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madson, Demián Bichir and Bruce Dern each playing the leading 8 characters while there is a small supporting cast that handle themselves easily and don't overthrow the leads. The best performances are a tough to pick as all the leading cast gave solid performances, but I give high approvals to Jackson, Russell Leigh, Goggins and Roth for making their characters believable and kept it going throughout the five chapters. The second act of THE picks up more on the brutal, over the top and bloody violence that occurs in Tarantino's films while resolving the plot and getting closer to the climax that gets bold and suspenseful, the results are great but there are moments where it could you make you feel uneasy and quench in your seats. The plot overall is great and carries the spirit of a Western film and as well a stage play but on the screen, but it can be long and dull ride for those who hate dialogue driven films as the violence plays out more in Act 2 but I thought each of the characters were given solid moments of seriousness, establishment and at times humour when needed.<br/><br/>The cinematography is as beautiful and detailed throughout like the recent acclaimed film 'The Revenant', having watched the 70mm print we can see that Tarantino's camera work captures not only the characters on-screen but the snowy and yet detailed environment of the mountain scenery and cabin location (as most of the film is set inside of the cabin after we are introduced to each of the eight characters). The music score here is composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone (known his musical scores for other westerns such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and other excerpts used in Tarantino's previous films) has composed an entire original score that mark not only new work in recent years but the very first film for Tarantino that uses an original score than having to used licensed music and scores from various films. The music plays out as mysterious, engaging and yet at times feels like a horror film but it suits to the film so well that it won not only a Golden Globe for Best Original Score but an Academy Award nomination in the upcoming 2016 Oscars (due for air on February 28th) alongside with nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).<br/><br/>Overall, The Hateful Eight can be seen by some as the weakest work from Tarantino as Django, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and even Reservoir still have a huge following and acclaim from fans and citric alike or seen as a great form of film but not as strong as the previous films. I however think that this is a solid presentation that keeps me hooked with character development, plot and the Tarantino quality that I have known of and earns a spot on my list of top films for 2016, alongside The Revenant.<br/><br/>4 ½ / 5 - Nick"

","For a man who's awfully fond of four letter words, 'hate' may be Quentin Tarantino's most appropriate in encapsulating his eighth (ha) feature film. Saddled with a production narrative of script leakage and bitterness that eerily mirrored its parable of backstabbing and deceit, Tarantino's second western (or third, if you count Kill Bill Vol. 2) stubbornly slogged through all foreseeable obstacles like its antiheroes trudging through the deepening snow, just in time to wink at its Christmas Day release by opening on a crucified Jesus buried by a blizzard. And, after all that, critic-baiting as its title may seem, the final experience of The Hateful Eight is begrudgingly hard to hate. Dear God does he make you wait for it, but that sonofagun Tarantino has done it again, doggonnit.<br/><br/>This is not immediately apparent. As if extracting his own revenge for the burn of initial script theft, Tarantino stretches his fondness for listening to his characters eloquently prattle on about repetitive, subtext-riddled inanities to the breaking point, introducing his band of miscreants in so playfully lackadaisical a fashion it's excruciating. But then, right when the viewer would be thrown into a rage by one more pregnant pause as Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell wax poetic about Lincoln, in comes another basterd (Hater?), and the field of carefully played out character dynamics and social politics has the rug yanked out from under it again. It's a dangerous waiting game Tarantino plays, and those watching in the privacy of their own home will be sorely tempted to scornfully give up. Trust me: stick it out. It's worth it.<br/><br/>But don't be hasty. One we hole up in Minnie's haberdashery to wait out the punishing blizzard (and Tarantino has great fun building this rich, almost theatrical set, including a recurring gag necessitating nailing the front door shut every time it's kicked down), there's more waiting to be done, albeit with almost palpably thick storm clouds of tension preparing to burst. Here, we're reminded of what the 'hateful' in the title is really about, as Tarantino digs deep into the political fallout of the Civil War and the storied racism it fostered (which, as Tarantino himself would cheerily remind you, remains poignantly topical today), with far less problematically bungled racial politics than Django Unchained, though nearly as uncomfortably racially slurry (historically accurate? Sure. Necessary? Hmm). This infuses the Agatha Christie/The Thing-in- the-old-west's potboiler tension with prescient motive: any number of the fiends stewing in the haberdashery could by lying or have it out for one another for any number of reasons. So we wait. For the entire. Length. Of. An. Average. Feature. Film. And then, the bear trap narrative snaps viciously into play, and we're reminded why we keep giving this preening basterd our money in the first place.<br/><br/>Insanely over-the-top bloodbaths, fourth-wall poking flashbacks narrated by none other than a smirking QT himself (including a dastardly cheeky wink about the benefits of patience, that rotter), and a razor-sharp context finally, cathartically, making itself known, The Hateful Eight's second half payoff IS why you came. It's vintage Tarantino, savagely funny and operatically violent, and all the sillier by being bottled by the pristinely precise cinematography (between this and The Revenant, most of 2015's most beautiful images involve blizzards) and sound work, and punched up by the visceral power of Ennio Morricone's sparse, soulful dirge of an original(!) score. Naturally, it's hard to decide who to root for - everyone is pretty irredeemable for their own reasons - but Tarantino's whip-pan power plays gleefully force you to decide, then hate yourself for it, in a sadistically playful puppeteering act that plays out in really the only way it ever could. Remember that whole first act chat about legal justice vs. frontier justice you discounted as more killing time? Yeah. You will.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson has been waiting twenty years for a meaty Tarantino lead role (again: delayed gratification), but his first one here does not disappoint. Eschewing his normal shoutiness, Jackson finds the power in calmness as he methodically pokes each character around him into going to pieces and showing their hand, his magnetic, force-of-nature charisma put to magnanimous use. Kurt Russell is equally riveting, his sour resolve as mighty as his moustache as he attempts to beat meaning out of the standoff and his prisoner alike. As said bounty, Jennifer Jason Leigh is a firebrand, gargling pathos, blood, and gallows humour with venomous ambivalence, as she is subjected to almost every possible indignity imaginable in this surly boys club. Walton Goggins is similarly disgustingly likable as the purported sheriff of the upcoming town, as impossible to get a beat on as it is impossible to assess whether his sheriff story is utter bunk or not. The rest of the miscreants, all Tarantino vets, patiently (see?) await their moments to shine -though Tim Roth's effetely weaselly gentleman- hangman and Bruce Dern's indignantly racist Confederate general are highlights - while even newbie Channing Tatum spits Tarantino verbiage like the best of them in a cameo that suggests Tarantino must be a Gambit fan.<br/><br/>But, as the rogues simmer on about something being rotten in the state of Wyoming, is it worth the wait (in more ways than one)? Ultimately yes, though even Tarantino deserves a knuckle-rap for indulging himself almost to the breaking point here, when the same effect could have been fostered with up to an hour lopped off. Unapologetically bloated as it is, The Hateful Eight gives you all of the Tarantino mayhem you want to those patient enough to ride out the calm before the storm. Hell, it's probably the only virtue he's ever advocated for, so maybe it should be commended. Still: pairing Quentin with an editor who forces him to keep his running time under 90 minutes? Ultimate frontier justice.<br/><br/>{And, of course, how could this be rated anything but:}<br/><br/>-8/10"

Due to a blizzard they are forced to hole up in a store some way out of town with the occupants of another stagecoach. Suspicions commence and Civil War enmities are reawakened...<br/><br/>Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, but not among Tarantino's best. This doesn't quite have the quirky dialogue and swagger that you expect from Tarantino. The plot takes a while to kick into top gear and at three hours long it can do with some editing.<br/><br/>This said, it feels much shorter than three hours. The dialogue, especially the characters' back-stories, keeps the momentum going. Tarantino doesn't reveal the direction of the movie until late in the piece and the twist is quite unforeseen. <br/><br/>Some good action scenes too, with the usual Tarantino trademark of large helpings of blood.<br/><br/>Solid performances all round. <br/><br/>Might take some patience but well worth watching."
"cliffordjames","8","5","14","20 January 2016"," Tarantino's 8th Is Brutal Fun
","I saw The Hateful Eight twice in theaters - once in the 70mm Roadshow and once in its wide release - and I thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Tarantino takes somewhat of a revisionist approach to his second try at the Western, exposing through his trademark dialogue and over-the- top violence how brutal, dark - and, well, hateful - the West was, especially post-Civil War. Eight vile characters are locked up together in a cabin during a blizzard, with somebody being not who they claim. The concept certainly takes inspiration from other claustrophobic mysteries and thrillers (John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" immediately comes to mind), and Tarantino uses this to create characters that are likable in their horribleness, as well as build up a tense mystery over about two hours before exploding into a wild final act. The ensemble cast is top-notch (Jennifer Jason Leigh probably takes the cake with her performance), the pacing is excellent, and the script is both sharply humorous and sometimes quite shocking. Though some may certainly be turned off by the excessive gore, language, and one very shocking scene in particular, I found it to be a wild and fun experience."

","A movie from Tarantino always gives you certain expectations. There are many twists and turns in the story, it's mostly quite graphic, there's a lot of character development, good music and the dialogs are one of a kind. Each Tarantino movie has this, yet the manner in how he brings it differs. <br/><br/>This 8th installment (what a ""coincidence"" the title is The Hateful Eight) is no different. Tarantino, again, delivers a masterpiece. It's more slow going than his usual work and though it's (just a little bit) annoying at the start, it picks up speed (story wise) and by the end there are so many things happening you'll need to rewind a bit. Luckily the movie helps you with that a little.<br/><br/>The actors each add a lot of talent to the atmosphere even on this limited set (which is mainly inside Minnie's haberdashery).<br/><br/>The music, brought to you by Ennio Morricone does deliver the atmosphere, though I found it less ""accessible"" outside the movie as was the case with Tarantino's previous work.<br/><br/>For any Tarantino fan, you will not be disappointed."

The premise of this film sees a bounty hunter and his captive arrive at a lodge in a blizzard, surrounded by nefarious characters it becomes a mystery to find out a deadly secret. Samuel l jackson Is amazing in this film, he even channels his performance from pulp fiction at times. He is the funniest character in this film and the coolest character in this film. Kurt Russell is also really good in this film, he has good chemistry with jackson and was a great character. Jennifer jason leigh also does a surprisingly good job considering her character doesn't give her that much to work with. Walton goggins is awesome in this film and probably my joint favourite character with jackson. Tim roth and channing tatum ate also great in their roles. The story has a mystery detective feel about it and I enjoyed it because it left you on the edge of your seat as you learned things with the characters and it managed to sustain it to me. The script is obviously fantastic with the brilliant dialogue flowing and making even the most mundane scenes seem interesting. The style was good with the western setting working for the film and the soundtrack being absolutely amazing. However, we then cone down to the one Achilles heel for this film and that is it's pacing. I do not believe this film needed to be 3 hours long and I feel like some situations were drawn out too long. Overall though this is a fantastic film and if your a fan of Tarantino is a must see."

","Tarantino movies are known for their gorgeous cinematography, rich dialogs, great soundtrack and... violence ! And I'm happy to say that his 8th movie delivers on all of these aspects ! I saw the digital version, which is slightly shorter than the 70mm version. Still, at almost 3 hours, this movie takes its time. But it allows the director to set the stage right and to introduce each character properly. And it also let us appreciate the superb Oscar-nominated cinematography and witty dialogs.<br/><br/>Tarantino movies are a bit of an acquired taste and this one is no different. You have to let yourself immerse into its world. Sure, some establishing shots could have been cut shorter (I have a feeling this is due to the Ultra Panavision format) but I loved every single minute of it ! There are clear similarities between this movie and Reservoir Dogs : it takes place almost entirely inside a building (be it a haberdashery or an abandoned warehouse) and the story revolves around guessing who's not what he says he is. It's also a bit reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little N-words"" (also known under the more politically correct title ""And Then There Were None""). I found the pacing and timing to be perfect : the slow build up to the first death, the reveal of who's who and the final act are all perfectly executed and very satisfying ! One thing I didn't expect was how funny this movie would be ! I found myself laughing for a good part of it thanks to deliciously witty lines and well written dialogs. I had almost forgotten that, on top of being the coolest tough guy actor, Jackson is also a great comedian ! It truly is a delight to hear Tarantino's dialogs being expertly delivered by Jackson, it's like music to the ear. The rest of the cast doesn't disappoint either, with amazing performances all around. Goggins and Leigh are especially funny and seem to really inhabit their role. It's no wonder that Leigh has been nominated for best supporting actress at this year's Academy Award.<br/><br/>As far as the level of violence is concerned, I'm pretty sure that some people will complain about it, just like any of Tarantino's previous works. Sure, it's a bit gratuitous, but at the same time, just like Kill Bill, it is so unrealistic and over-the-top that it becomes slapstick. I didn't feel that it glorified violence, it made it look silly.<br/><br/>After seeing ""The Hateful Eight"", I wondered when was the last time that I got disappointed by a Tarantino flick ? And I came to the conclusion that it simply never happened ! I'm amazed to see that after 8 movies he still got that magic touch ! Tarantino definitively is one of the five best directors out there and probably my favorite.<br/><br/>If I had to nitpick, I would say that the score was slightly underwhelming compared to Tarantino's usual masterful selection of relatively unknown tracks. I also found Madsen to look a bit tired, mumbling through his lines, and Bell's hyperactive nature seemed out of place in this movie.<br/><br/>Regardless, compared to the dread that hits the silver screen every year (I'm looking at you, superheroes movies and cheap remakes !), this film is a masterpiece and deserves an exceptional rating. I've rated more than 1100 movies on IMDb, and this is the 7th time I give a perfect score : 10 out of 10 !"

","Quinton is a living legend in the film industry. As a prolific screenwriter he's contributed some of the best scripts Hollywood has seen over the last couple of decades.<br/><br/>With a love for kung fu, classic westerns, and a healthy amount of gore He's been known to embellish in intense confrontations like the ones found in this film. He likes to be classy, but always at some point, reverts to his boyish love for chaos.<br/><br/>Sometimes he does it to remind us of the brutality of the human condition<br/><br/>Sometimes he just does it because the boy in him likes to watch heads explode in a ""gory watermelon like fashion.""<br/><br/>We tend to love it either way he delivers it though.<br/><br/>Usually It is all accompanied by a thought provoking dialog that does well to showcase the human condition in its many forms.<br/><br/>This film is no exception.<br/><br/>The latest fictional tale from Quinton takes place in the ""old mountainous west"" on the eve of a great blizzard around Christmas. The premise, is Kurt Russell is escorting a prisoner to her hanging for a ten thousand dollar reward, and in the last few miles of the stretch to Red Rock, begins to run into several strangers whom seek refuge from the cold of the storm.<br/><br/>Kurt's healthy level of suspicion sets the stage for a wonderful mystery moving forward Especially when several strangers end up stranded at a cabin with him and his death row prisoner.<br/><br/>It has an all star cast, but there really is no star of the film itself, mostly because many of the characters are given ample room to breathe and interact with one another.<br/><br/>The dialogs between the characters really reflected the divided nature of a country after a civil war. It also does well to showcase America's long history of racism (much like ""DJango Unchained"" did.)<br/><br/>But beyond all of that It was just a damn good thriller that weaved a wonderful web of mystery and suspicion. Dare I say... Very ""Reservoir Dogs"" like in nature.<br/><br/>A lot of people like to see some gore when it comes to their Terantino films, but for me it was always about the interactions between the characters & how the story unfolded.<br/><br/>This film doesn't fail in that regard one bit. I can say without a doubt that I was satisfied and even laughing a bit as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Regarding the gore It's no Kill Bill, but there are some extremely satisfying moments that deliver buckets of non-CGI props for us to twist in. There was a decapitation at one point and ""my eyes nearly bulged through my glasses as I started to giggle like a schoolgirl with glee.""<br/><br/>Those moments weren't in short supply, they just weren't back-to-back ""like some viewers may prefer,"" and that's OK Just know that this isn't going to be one of those films. It's more refined than that Even in its brutality, it is obvious that Quinton is, even now, still evolving as a film maker and screen writer.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is old school. Don't expect cutting edge synthesis or raging metal at any point of the story. Much like the movies Quinton grew up on, he wanted this one to fit right in with the classics, just Modernized for today's audience.<br/><br/>I think he accomplishes this.<br/><br/>The camera work is beautiful. The images and angles he manages to capture in this latest addition are outstanding. I especially loved how the storm looked behind any given character doing whatever ""whenever."" That feeling of ""old Wyoming in winter"" was beautifully captured. The sound design was great. When the blood came I felt the splats in my subs and the swishing of chunks properly distributed in the stereo stage.<br/><br/>I think there was only one point in the film that I didn't feel good about it and even that particular moment/ scene served a purpose for the audience, so as uncomfortable as watching a particular scene was It truly depicted the cruelty of man back in those days, and made the conclusion of everything all the sweeter too.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece. Hands down beautiful.<br/><br/>Not for your kids<br/><br/>But a great way to spend an afternoon off of work.<br/><br/>Professional Review Score: 8/10<br/><br/>Didn't make me cry, and its not for all audiences, but it was still awesome enough to beat out the average Awesome I see on a monthly basis. Drawbacks for some will be the length, glorified racist perspectives from characters, and gore. I personally like the length and gore just fine though, and the racism, well... It exists. It REALLY existed after the Civil war too. I applaud Quinton for getting it right.<br/><br/>Personal Review Score: 10/10<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece. The script is beautiful. Samuel L Jackson tops his performance in Pulp Fiction here easily, and I absolutely love this film's ability to weave a great stage. The scenes are captured in style, the blood isn't modest yet very effective /realistic, and the mind games are perfect! Just perfect:)<br/><br/>And there it is.<br/><br/>No spoilers Now go watch it. You're gonna love this experience."
"billcr12","9","9","31","27 December 2015"," Long but Entertaining
","The three hour running time is a bit much, but every shot is interesting in this marathon of a western. Quentin Tarantino uses his usual sarcastic language throughout, giving a great cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson great lines to spew out with sneering venom at each other. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh are particular standouts, and Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern make for the ensemble who shine brightly, and viciously reading Tarantino's badass vernacular which we have heard before. The story is the basic western one, with influences from Bonanza on the small screen to Sergio Leone's from the big screen; particularly ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly; Tarantino's favorite movie. Major Warren hitches a ride with John Ruth(Russell) who is handcuffed to his $10,000 bounty, Daisy(Leigh), on their way to Red Rock and payment for delivery to the hangman. A blizzard forces them to stop at Minnie's Haberdashery, where the eight come together for intrigue and a bloody finale very similar to ""Reservoir Dog's"", Tarantino's directorial debut from 1993. The Hateful Eight is one of the best movies of 2015."
"choorydanny","9","13","50","20 December 2015"," Flawless masterpiece: One of Tarantino's finest
","Starting off the review I must confess that despite my being a huge Tarantino fan, I do not agree with him in certain decisions on his films therefore I will not praise them as much as usual fans would do - not realizing the movies' mistakes or flaws.<br/><br/>However what he did with The Hateful Eight was a flawless work of art. Tarantino did not only stood up after the failure of his script's leaking out by going back to the project and making it anyways, but he also managed to find a more interesting and narratively more of a Tarantinoesque format by rewriting his former screenplay. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight boasts with masterful acting from Kurt Russell to Samuel L. Jackson to Walton Goggins to Jennifer Jason Leigh. The cast did an excellent job as promised. The magnificent Ultra Panavision 70 mm looks mesmerizing as promised. Our beloved Author did a masterful job as promised. The sets and costumes are capture and most memorable. The humor is flawless as promised. Tarantino is cheekier and more vicious than ever.<br/><br/>Tarantino deepened the bond between the characters of Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson as well as we can have a more elaborate look into the head of Walton Gogings' character and his decisions. The Lincoln Letter has a much bigger role in the way of things. The poisoned coffee part now has narration and flashback, but so does the final act. Daisy Domergue's real, humanly side is revealed as well as a touching, but eventually comic moment with his younger brother. Finally, the Channing Tatum storyline was unpleasing for the Gang, but satisfying for the viewer as we can see in the midst of Act III a more elaborate hostage conflict than in the previous story - just as much pleasing to the mind as bloodbath is pleasing to the eyes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the reason why I am giving this gorgeous film 9 stars is because I have doubts on the rewatchability of this piece and on its quotability - which are considerable aspects in rating Tarantino movies. As time is passing and I decide to watch and re- watch it again, I may reconsider my rating.<br/><br/>I must however recommend The Hateful Eight to you as a memorable piece of cinema with intense action, cheeky humor and elaborate characters."

","This movie displays everything I love about Tarantino and his films. It has an original story, colorful characters, unique settings, fiery dialogue, character development, flawless direction and screenplay, unique style and violence and an epic soundtrack. <br/><br/>Tarantino is able to get amazing performances from his actors, and this movie shows that. This movie focuses heavily on character development and interaction, and due to the phenomenal performances and dialogue, I did not get bored for even a second, since the dialogue hooked me in. Tarantino has created unique characters, and the casting is on-point, all the actors which were chosen for their respective roles gave an exceptional performance. The chemistry of the cast works really well. All the characters are really complex and they live up to the title, each character is just as ""hateful"" as the next one.<br/><br/>The setting and basic plot line might be a bit similar to Reservoir Dogs, but the movie plays out way differently than it, and is much more fun than it. The movie has a mystery element to it, while Reservoir Dogs didn't. The movie uses paranoia and fear as a plot device, and it will leave the audience on the edge of their seats as they try to figure out who is the real culprit.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has proved once again as to why he is one of the most respected directors in the industry. He has this unique way of story- telling, and has this over-the-top style which just makes his movies very interesting. The dialogue is on point, and crafted with sophistication and beauty.<br/><br/>Tarantino's choice to film in 70mm was great, since the use of 70mm gives you a literal wider look at the setting. It really brings out everything in detail and makes each frame a work of art. You feel as if you are inside Minnie's Haberdashery with all these people. The 70mm also captures the snowy landscapes in its natural grand beauty.<br/><br/>Even with all the mystery elements, there is still a lot of humour (most of it dark humour, of course), and it feels that each character is having a lot of fun with their characters, and that is one of the many reasons the movie is great.<br/><br/>The movie might be long for some people, but if you come to think about it, there is really nothing you can cut from the movie since each scene is equally important. If you don't like the movie because you thought it was dragging on, it is just that you don't like long movies, there was nothing wrong with the film itself. <br/><br/>If the violence, and other sinister and sadistic elements in the film are too much for you and you can't handle the movie, that is perfectly understandable. Often Tarantino movies are too much for people because of their talkativeness, violence, sinister and sadistic elements, and they could be too much to take in. But if you like well-written, directed, complex films with character interaction and development, or you are just a movie or Tarantino fan, you will love this movie. <br/><br/>The soundtrack of the movie dances along beautifully with the movie. Morricone's score and the other songs used by Tarantino really set the mood for the movie, and give you a rush. The overture (and most of the tracks) fit the movies paranoid feel so well, that if you play the track during dinner with your family, you will not be able to help yourself but eye everyone on the table suspiciously. <br/><br/>Every performance stood out very much in the movies and all of them were amazing, but the ones I liked the most were Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins. Don't get me wrong, everyone did really good.<br/><br/>If you like a good murder mystery, or a well-directed, complex film (or if you are a Tarantino fan), you would love this movie. I loved it very much. If you get the chance, watch it in 70mm!!!"

"harrylosborne","5","3","7","28 May 2019"," A rare Tarantino misfire
","On the surface and premise alone, this film gives the impression of another strong outing from the mind of Quentin Tarantino: a group of nefarious characters take shelter from a Wyoming winter storm together, unaware of one another's intentions. Unfortunately, the end product is anything but enjoyable, a tedious story lumbering between each subplot, split up by occasional shots of gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight suffers in part from trying to be ""more Tarantino than Tarantino"", playing on his movie trademarks to the point of annoying the audience. A prime example is shown in the opening scenes, where a single drawn out shot of the US wilderness is shown for around 5 minutes. Whilst bearable to begin with, these clichés soon drag, and by the end of the considerable run time you'll be looking for the door.<br/><br/>The story lacks any real cohesion as well, opening on the pretence of an intricate backstory-driven tale, but in practice offering little development. Samuel L Jackson (and for the most part, the rest of the cast) give noble performances, but they aren't enough to truly elevate this film. The cinematography is exquisite where given the opportunity to shine, but the limited focus of the film prevents this from really salvaging the story.<br/><br/>Having tried this film several times, on each occasion I was met with the same senses of both creeping boredom and annoyance at the promise not capitalised on. As with actors and directors of Tarantino's calibre, there is a delusion to immediately hail any work as an immediate classic - The Hateful Eight does not deserve to be included in this category."
"adamoctranspo","8","3","7","2 November 2018"," A real treat and amazing script
","It's weird to see haters reviewing this with 1 star. I guess they wanted Transformers or something very American to hold their attention.<br/><br/>First off, the characters are awesome and well written. The dialogue is punchy and fun. The story doesn't need to be overly complex but if you pay attention there are a ton of details to pick up on. Especially on a second viewing. There is violence but it's far from disgusting. It brings some exciting scenes to a one set film.<br/><br/>I think this is one of Tarantino's best, similar to Reservoir Dogs. It's a longer film, so as long as you dedicate the 3 hours and aren't expecting a traditional film then give it a watch. Especially on a cold winter's day."

","You could say this is a Western version of a children song, ""10 little ..."" (and whatever probably racist or at least discriminatory thing came after that in your country - it's Indians in America, which kind of seems fitting replacing them with Cowboys, mostly). And let me make clear that I did watch the 70mm longer version of the movie, that also had an Interlude. Kind of as they did in the old days ... though the movie due to it's depictions of violence would not have had a chance in the old days (playing in cinemas that is).<br/><br/>Tarantino also seemingly making fun of people criticizing his scripts or rather the use of the ""n-word"" by his characters. It seems like he listens and does care. With Madsen and Roth you have a couple of Reservoir Dogs thrown into the mix. Both terrific actors, but almost everyone is being put to shame by Russel and Jackson. While Will Smith had a great role in Concussion, the real Academy Awards miss was not nominating Samuel L. Jackson! Strangely enough Jennifer Jason Leigh did get a nomination. She's good, don't get me wrong, you just wonder, why she's the only one to get the nod from this movie.<br/><br/>And that's because it's an overall amazing group effort. Some may feel this moves too slowly, not enough is happening. That would either mean you're not familiar with QTs work (he loves his dialog and we do too) or didn't read up on where this is taking place. Don't get it wrong though: Because when it gets violent, it really goes all the way. Not for the squeamish at all.<br/><br/>Quentin made this feel very operatic and the larger than life setting suits the movie and the characters in it. It's a mind game and it's a words game too. But it's also about who is faster than the other person ..."
"jamiefagan","8","3","7","16 October 2016"," Engaging, Enthralling, Simple
","The film Tarantino gives us here is drenched in the usual nuances of one of his films, blood is shed in copious quantities to provide an explosive exclamation to his story, the dialogue is rich and engaging flowing forth in a manner that is inescapable holding you on the characters every word, the film is beautifully and extravagantly costumed, the scenery is gorgeous and the shooting is excellent if at times less of a filmic marvel and more of an exercise in restraint. However there are issues as with all films, the film is incredibly long, loaded with build up and filled with mystery but the conclusion falls slightly apart simply due to the fact that it cannot live up to what has been built towards. Certain characters feel under used or misplaced with some acting as paper cutouts, lacking anything to really sell them to us. But its still a functional film with plenty of engaging enjoyable elements."
"shinsrevenge","7","3","7","13 August 2016"," Almost 3 hours of suspense

Surprisingly enough you don't get bored. The dialogues are interesting. There are clues and hints as you try to figure what role everyone plays in this story.<br/><br/>Then the first one dies. An unspectacular death - for a Quentin Tarantino movie. Just wait for it. The next deaths are way more brutal, even to the point of splatter. I don't appreciate that amount of senseless death and violence. The story could have been a lot better if Tarantino wouldn't have gone over the edge so much.<br/><br/>But then it wouldn't be a Tarantino movie, would it? Anyway, it's 7/10 from me. Story is intriguing, the acting is good. Despite my complains it was worth the time. And I give him credit for making a movie that immerses you for such a long playtime without getting boring even for a second.<br/><br/>So even if you're not a fan of his movies, you may want to give this a try."
"evanston_dad","6","3","7","13 July 2016"," One of the Most Uneven Movies I've Ever Seen
","Quentin Tarantino is finally becoming the very thing he tries most to resist: a cliché.<br/><br/>I've continued to defend Tarantino against critics of his films who claim he does nothing but peddle in senseless violence and that he's made a career out of borrowing other filmmakers' styles rather than develop one of his own. But after ""Django Unchained"" and now ""The Hateful Eight,"" I'm finding my interest in defending him starting to wane. <br/><br/>After reading the divisive reactions to ""The Hateful Eight,"" many of which confirmed my sinking suspicions that I would be in for yet another pointless bloodbath like ""Django,"" I found myself pleasantly surprised by the film's first half. Tarantino's penchant for creating colorful characters and giving them juicy dialogue is in full force, and he's assembled again a cast of actors who, even if in some cases aren't really good actors, are able to convince you for the length of this film that they are because they sound so good saying the things they're given to say. And some of them ARE good actors, like Jennifer Jason Leigh who steals the show as a degenerate gang leader, and who knows exactly how to land every joke Tarantino throws out, which are numerous and which make the first half a riot. But the movie, after all the rambling dialogue and plot exposition, has to eventually come to a conclusion, and unfortunately, Tarantino has seemingly lost all ability to end a movie in any way other than killing off all of his characters as gruesomely and graphically as possible. The very violence that used to give his movies punch and get people talking has now become boring and routine and, worst of all, predicable. I watched the end of this film play out and thought, ""he gives us this great set up and these great actors and this is the only thing he can think of to do with it all?"" <br/><br/>Tarantino has taken a lot of heat for being misogynistic and racist. I don't think he's a misogynist -- nothing happens to Leigh's character that wouldn't just as easily happen to any of the men, and in his own way Tarantino gives us a rather feminist character in his refusal to concede anything to Leigh's gender; she's as nasty, if not even more so, a piece of work as any of the male characters. As far as racism goes, I don't think Tarantino's a racist either, but I'm not sure what he's trying to say about race relations. If ""The Hateful Eight"" is any indication, he's saying that blacks have been so mistreated by whites that they are now free to do whatever they want to the white man with the added bonus of it being hilarious because it's so deserving. In this complicated and sensitive time of revived racial conflict, this is a poorly-timed moment to address the topic in so juvenile and facile a manner.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is above anything else one of the most uneven movies I've seen in a long time. It can't settle on a tone or a point of view. It's too long, too excessive, and Tarantino clings too rigidly to tricks (like topsy-turvy chronology) that have made his previous movies interesting but now just seem so tired. One thing I can unequivocally say the film has going for it is its magnificent score, courtesy of Ennio Morricone, who won a well-deserved Oscar for it. The rest of the film's not a wash, but it did leave me feeling like it's time for Tarantino to crawl out of the sandbox and start playing with the big boys.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"deloudelouvain","8","3","7","27 March 2016"," Brilliant vocabulary throughout the whole movie.
","How some people can give a bad review for The Hateful Eight is beyond my comprehension. First of all, everybody knows what kind of movies Quentin Tarantino makes, so if you don't like those I don't get why you even watch this one. Or you're a complete moron or you're a masochist. I love Tarantino's movies and that's what I also did also with The Hateful Eight. The vocabulary is just outstanding, wouldn't expect any lesser from Tarantino. It's just brilliant, like always. The cast is also excellent. Every single actor in this movie brings his own touch to the ambiance. It is maybe not his best movie but it is for sure way better then 95% of all other movies ever. Everything Tarantino does is just genius. If you don't think the same just stop watching his movies. It's that simple."
"jamescwilson-925-178830","9","3","7","25 March 2016"," Tarantino Delivers Another Classic
","Do not believe this movie to be a typical western. This movie is something much more. The Hateful Eight, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, is unique and beautiful with its intense drama and overly clever dialogue, as well as its incredible original score by Ennio Morricone. The plot, somewhat reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs (another Tarantino classic), brings back the classic 'who done it?' scenario and ultimately Tarantino makes it his bitch. Walton Goggins, who plays Sheriff Chris Mannix and my favourite character in this movie, pulls out his best performance yet and one must still hate the character he portrays - out-performing an actor such as Samuel L. Jackson in the process. Nobody in this deserves to live but the ensemble of murderers come together and showcase so much true deceit, and raw emotion. And even though it is not considered an action movie The Hateful Eight still produces some of the most entertaining action sequences whether they're verbal or physical. Once again Quentin Tarantino creates yet another masterpiece and personally I believe this to be his best work yet, even better than Pulp Fiction."
"ferguson-6","7","9","32","27 December 2015"," Dead or Alive
","Greetings again from the darkness. If one is to believe Quentin Tarantino, the leaked script scandal nearly turned this into a novel, rather than what it clearly needed to be  a Quentin Tarantino movie (his 8th). It could even be considered a companion piece to Django Unchained (though this takes place in snowy Wyoming, as opposed to the balmy Deep South). It's set soon after the Civil War and there still exists a palpable uneasiness between Confederate and Union types, creating a constantly teetering milieu between violence and progress.<br/><br/>Tarantino's obsession with classic film led him to utilize the same Ultra Panavision 70 lenses used for Ben-Hur (1959), which required the retrofitting of 50 theaters across the country for the ""road show"". This presentation includes an opening musical Overture, a midpoint Intermission, and approximately 6 minutes of footage that highlight this rarely used format  stunning snow-filled vistas and wide shots of the frontier. When the film opens nationwide, the digital version will be straight-forward (though still nearly 3 hours in run time). The ""road show"" features are bonuses for us film geeks, and will have no impact on whether one enjoys the film or not.<br/><br/>Rather than follow in John Ford's majestic Western footsteps, QT has the vast majority of the story take place within a one-room set called Minnie's Haberdashery. Thanks to a record blizzard, the general store/saloon turns into a human snake pit filled with nefarious types who are quick with a quip and a trigger. The diabolical assemblage is made up of John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell, featuring world class whiskers), a bounty hunter who is handcuffed to his latest prize Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh); another bounty hunter (Union) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson); British fancy boy Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who says he's the hangman for Red Rock; the self-professed new Sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins); General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a former Confederate officer; quiet cowpoke Joe Gage (Michael Madsen); and Senor Bob (Demian Bichir), whom Minnie left tending the store in her absence.<br/><br/>Now as you might expect, some of the above descriptions may be true, while others could be considered ""conveniences"". What you also might expect is a steady rain of Tarantino dialogue delivered by the perfectly chosen cast. Each of these players grasps the cadence required to make this work  they have the rhythm of a stage play – a new direction that Tarantino has hinted at. And have no fear, over-the-top violence fills the second half of the story as the confined space and contradictory missions begin to clash.<br/><br/>No more need be said about the characters or the story. Russell, Jackson, Goggins and Ms. Leigh are especially effective at enlivening their scenes, and they are joined by supporting actors such as Dave Parks (son of the great Michael Parks), Gene Jones (who didn't wish to call the coin flip in No Country for Old Men), Dana Gourrier (as Minnie), QT favorite Zoe Bell (as Six-horse Judy), and even Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>Legendary composer Ennio Morricone delivers his first western score in about 40 years, which is important since he's the man behind the iconic music of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. On the topic of music, Morricone's score is complimented by only a smattering of other songs (including a Roy Orbison gem and a solo from Jennifer Jason Leigh), which is unusual in the Tarantino canon. Three-time Oscar winner Robert Richardson re-teams with Tarantino and seems to have a blast with the challenges presented by the one-room set  he plays with focus and depth to create some fantastic shots. It should also be noted that the Sound is spectacular – everything from gunshots, to swirling wind, to boots and spurs, to galloping stage coach horses, and even the pouring out of coffee.<br/><br/>All of the above results in a stunning movie experience with the anticipated QT humor, violence, and anti-racism sentiment (though the N-word usage is once again tough to take)  yet somehow the final product doesn't equal the individual moments of genius. It comes across as a blend of Agatha Christie, (Tarantino's own) Reservoir Dogs, and John Carpenter's The Thing minus the cohesiveness required for a great movie. So enjoy the characters, the technical achievements, and the terrific dialogue, but know that it's unlikely to be one of those that cause you to stop down while surfing cable channels in a couple years."
"asher-luberto","10","10","37","21 December 2015"," Spoiler free review, Hateful Eight
","The Hateful Eight takes place about a decade or so after the civil war, and follows the story of John Ruth the hangman( played excellently by Kurt Russell). Where he captures a bounty worth 10,000 dollars( Daisy Domergue, played by Jenneifer Leigh) which was a large sum back in that day. On there journey to there destination they pick up mysterious passengers along the way, eventually a blizzard arrives causing there stage coach to go off course. Where they eventually end up in a cabin with more unfamiliar faces. <br/><br/>We have been able to see Tarantino's fixating dialogue in movies such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and basically anything he has made; but this movie does it best. What you want is what you get with this movie, another Tarantino masterpiece. I absolutely loved the Hateful Eight. Aside from Star Wars, this is going to be the most fun you have in a movie in 2015. This movie is filled with substance and feeling that was basically oozing from the screen. This movie is extremely tension filled from beginning to end. This is all made possible by Tarantino's incredible screenplay, and its no wonder its nominated for best screenplay(Golden Globes). The entire movie you question who is good and who is bad, who is on who's side,which made it a mystery for the characters and the audience. It created so much tension, that I found my self clinching my fists throughout the entire second half of the film. Another thing that adds tension to this thriller is the original score done by the the famous Ennio Morricone. <br/><br/>Lastly this film relies heavily on acting, since there is a lot of dialoug in this movie. And everyone does an incredible job in this movie. I would not be surprised if Jennifer Leigh is nominated for best actress, since she stole the show in this one. The Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece,this movie keeps you captivated for the entire 2 hour and 47 minute run time. If your looking for your usual Tarantino violence right off the bat, then your not going to find it here, not to say there is not plenty of violence in the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end I loved the Hateful Eight, Tarantino fans will love it, and even people that don't like his work will love it. The screenplay, the acting, the directing, the original score all make this one of the best movies of the year(easily top 5), and one of Tarantino's best."
"souplipton","8","8","28","25 December 2015"," The Longest, but Perhaps Best-Told (not best) of Tarantino's Films
","The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's latest play on genre, his first ""true"" western. Borrowing from classic Hollywood story-telling, and from Westerns in particular, The Hateful Eight has what might be called Tarantino's most mature and developed plot (though mature is not how I would describe the movie). This development comes at the cost of brevity, and this maturity comes at the cost of some of the fun that one expects from Tarantino, so how one views this film really will dependant on one's values as it concerns his films. It almost feels less like a Tarantino film, and more like a traditional film made with Tarantino's style. As well, the pacing in the film's first half is slower than his usual pace, but this is not wasted time, as the first half's scenes are still great, and the build-up really pays off in the second half. I for one (a big fan of his work), thought it was excellent, though it's lesser amount of fun does place it behind his very best work. The technical aspects are executed perfectly, and if you have the opportunity see it in 70mm. Glorious is exactly what it is, and the technology is excellently utilized. Not just beautiful in its stunning landscapes, the film uses the very wide aspect ratio in many two-shots and uses the space well in multiple planes in other shots to keep several objects on screen simultaneously. The acting was great by all in the relatively small cast, with no weak links. The musical score was great, as was the production design, which brought the film's primary locale to life. Slightly less entertaining, but more developed, than what I expect from a Tarantino film, The Hateful Eight may not be exactly what I was expecting when I walked in, but I left the theatre having seen a visual experience, had a lot of fun, and having seen a great film."

The scene can be shown in beautiful ways and also appealing. There are many close-up lens, but all actors perform so well that their micro expressions make a huge contribution in this film as well. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight contains mixing features of other movies of QT, each one of them may not be outstanding but not a single on can be omitted.

As a Tarantino fan and movie fan I felt like I completely got my moneys worth and I enjoyed every second of it.

But I personally don't care what anybody says, I loved this movie a lot and I couldn't get enough of it. Even though this is Tarantinos second western movie it is no way the same as Django unchained as the playful silliness is less present to create a more tense environment. But the movie still has the traits of all Of Quentins previous films such as the tension, Drama, humour, the Graphic violence and colourful language. <br/><br/>The thing I love about Quentin Tarantino is not only his appreciation and passion for all types of films (especially exploitation film) but the fact he has the confidence to make a 3 hour movie at the pace that it goes and feel that his characters, story, direction and everything that the cast and crew bring to the project will be enough. And so he should be confident, as he and everyone involved pull it off brilliantly. And what they deliver is way more than enough. <br/><br/>The cinematography is done perfectly and it sucks you into the movie creating that Tarantino style feel. The Soundtrack worked really well at creating the films menacing mood. I especially loved the song at the beginning credits as I think it sums up the movie perfectly. The characters were all interesting and mysterious that I wanted to learn more and more about them. The acting was superb by everyone in the movie and everyone looked great at the parts they were playing. The costumes fitted what the characters looked and acted like which was great. <br/><br/>The locations were atmospheric and truly represented the beauty of the old west. The main cabin location was amazingly designed, with lots of little details fitted in. The direction of every scene in my opinion was greatly executed. And the story is easy enough to follow as it is a western style who done it. The less you know about the story before watching, the better it is. Although I do think you can still enjoy this movie a lot even if you do know some important story points. The Tarantino style is very present in the movie which will please any fans of his. <br/><br/>The Violence like any other Quentin Tarantino movie is very in your face, graphic and mature but is a lot of fun to watch. There are also a few twisted scenes which are funny but also uncomfortable. The language, also like any other Tarantino films is also quite offensive throughout. Many racial slurs are thrown about but are usually for comic effect and I don't think should be taken too seriously. <br/><br/>There aren't really any big problems I had with the movie. But a few little ones are some slow motion shots which I didn't think were necessary. Also a couple of the songs felt forced into the movie but it didn't bother me too much. The biggest problem I think a fair amount of people will have is the pacing of the movie, as this movie is 3 hours of character interaction. But its got enough going on to keep your interest and the length of the movie allows for a lot of tension to build for when certain things later on happen. If you are a Tarantino fan then I don't think this will bother you, but if it does then fair enough. <br/><br/>I had a blast watching this movie. The more I think about it, the more I love it and want to see it again. the only reason this movies isn't a 10 is because I feel ill have to watch it a couple more times in my opinion. I hope when it comes out on DVD, it'll be an extended 4 hour version as I just want to see more of it. Like I said at the beginning if you don't like it then that's fine. I don't think the movie is for everyone but It definitely was for me. What more can I say other than see for yourself if you haven't already and see if you love it too. Also if you can see it in 70mm then id suggest doing it as that's the intended viewing Tarantino intended."

"Tristanovich","9","4","11","4 April 2016"," Can't get it out of my mind
","I had seen the trailer about a month ago and couldn't wait to see the film. The Ultra Panavision 70mm format looked absolutely stunning and there was no way I would miss this for the world. Not a die-hard theater-goer by any means, I thought I would wait for the Blu-Ray version to come out or see it pop up on my Bell Fibe account, whichever came first. So Bell it was (incredible 4K quality, by the way, if you have a 4K TV). So I started watching it. I have every Tarantino film in my collection and like so many others, felt disappointed with this one, finding some scenes ridiculous (the bloody gore scenes involving the tainted coffee, for example), over- indulgent, redundant, boring and a bit long. And yet, I couldn't get the movie out of my mind. After my first viewing, I came here and started to read reviews for over an hour, which I've never done before. And look at me now, I've opened an account at IMDb and writing my first one. And it's not so much a review on the film itself but my experience with it. After reading the reviews by other members, I decided to watch it again the next night (available for 48 hours on Bell when renting) and not be so stuffy about its flaws. Let's face it, it has quite a few. I did have more fun with the second viewing, especially with Walton Goggins who in my opinion, should have won for Best Supporting Actor (Mark Rylance was deserving too in Bridge of Spies, but Goggins just blew me away). On Saturday, I went out and bought the Blu-Ray edition and watched it again. And this time, I took it all in, enjoying every stitch, even keeping an eye out for more goofs in continuity (posted 2 under that section yesterday). I connected with Ennio Morricone's score only on the 3rd viewing (didn't care much for it on the 1st). I enjoyed every bit of screen time Bruce Dern got, forgave Tim Roth's emulation of Christoph Waltz and took his offering for what it was, and enjoyed the 70mm extravaganza indoors which at times gave me the impression of watching Opera on stage. (The lighting was masterfully done, by the way). Bottom line, it's a great movie with flaws, one I can't get out of my mind and will want to see over and over again."
"rblenheim","8","4","11","6 March 2016"," Tarantino's best film in years
","I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, although I appreciate his best work. The last film of his I felt achieved greatness was ""Jackie Brown"" (still his finest film), and the last ones I liked were the two ""Kill Bill"" films. I'm pleased to admit I found ""The Hateful Eight"" his best in years. It's not perfect (too long, and hampered by some unnecessary campiness where it should have stayed serious), but it's a powerful character-driven, small 'chamber film' (ironic, as it was filmed in 70mm Ultra Panavision, i.e., Cinerama) relating a western tale with eight certifiably hateful characters interacting with each other in verbal power plays like wicked game pieces.<br/><br/>Most of its drama takes place in a stagecoach lodge called 'Minnie's Haberdashery' where they have taken refuge from a powerful blizzard (these indoor scenes having been filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles). The sequences not shot in the cabin were actually filmed on location in the beautiful Wilson Mesa area of the Colorado Rockies in extreme conditions of freezing wind and snow, and the stunning visuals, especially in 70mm, are gorgeous to behold. The film has a great cast: some Tarantino regulars, some new, with Kurt Russell as a bounty hunter carrying a handcuffed fugitive (Jennifer Jason Leigh at her filthiest) on the way to her hanging, but each of the eight has his or her own secrets and hidden agenda. Though violent at times beyond the pale (not a surprise for Tarantino!), it is a compelling drama throughout.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it might have more style than substance (it seems rather shallow upon analysis), but its style and dramatic structure -- at times almost Shakespearean -- makes this a worthy cinematic experience, even when not seen in 70mm."

","The Hateful Eight had two big wins for me. First was that some of my favorite feature films have only a few locations across the entire picture and mainly focus on telling a great story. The usage of locations was likes a Reservoir Dogs to me. Another great comparison would be some of the best music in the world is simply. Simplicity in art is the absolute hardest. It is easier to keep adding and adding and adding, but to take away and focus on the core is incredibly hard. Quentin Tarantino is a master. Tarantino leveraged each location in the The Hateful Eight to the max, intertwined the story with the style I have become accustom to expect and gave us an absolute classic. The second win for me was of course, Samuel L Jackson's long dialogues. As expected, they were incredible!"
"thebenhoward","6","9","33","23 December 2015"," The Next Jackie Brown
","Quentin Tarantino's eighth feature film includes a terrific cast of experienced QT veterans (with the addition of Jennifer Jason Leigh and Channing Tatum) who all come come together to put on a theatrical performance filled with classic Tarantino gags (blood, guns, exploding heads). The story is told in six chapters, divided by an intermission halfway through the film. Tarantino's insistence with making the movie an ""event"" (i.e. the inclusion of an overture and the intermission itself), are pretty much the only things this movie had going for it. It was neat to sit through the film as theater-goers back in the day would have, but once the movie began, it never really picked up.<br/><br/>The story itself is not particularly engaging; it's essentially an ultra-violent ""who- done-it"" flick. The vulgarity lacked purpose and purely existed for the sake of maintaining and keeping with the director's violent reputation. It's not a special or even interesting film, but it does contain, during some parts, his unique cinematic style.<br/><br/>Visually, it's nice to watch. The ultra-wide format allowed for some awesome exterior shots, but once we get inside the cabin, where 70% of the film takes place, the ultra-wide serves no purpose. This lead to a surplus of unmotivated lighting, especially once nightfall hit.<br/><br/>Production value was off the charts, the set decoration and wardrobe are perfect and the acting is decent, but the characters portrayed are neither likable nor hatable. It was difficult to root for any of them, which took out any inkling of suspense. Since I didn't care who died, I was just waiting for the next person to get shot. None of the characters possessed charm, making each of them just as dreadful as the next. As a die-hard QT fan, I don't regret seeing it, but if this was any other director, I'd suggest waiting for the DVD. 6 out of 10."

I love this kind of movie where performers are given a chance to shine, and deliver.<br/><br/>Cinematography - 10/10 - Beautiful. Harsh. Cold desolation masterfully conveyed.<br/><br/>Directing - My favorite movie, from one of my favorite directors. It really felt like Hateful Eight is the work of craftsmen, as opposed to something quickly and cheaply produced. Hopefully Tarantino looks back on this movie and smiles, because that's what I do. :)<br/><br/>Audio and soundtrack - 10/10 - Tarantino has a long history of superb soundtrack selection, and I felt he hit it out of the park here. The music was enjoyable, quirky, and set the mood as only Tarantino can. Loved it. The non music audio successfully conveyed the sense of harsh Wyoming weather, and the time period for me.<br/><br/>Overall: Among my top 5 favorite movies, and I plan to watch it at least a few more times. Everything good about Tarantino, westerns, and the spectacular cast is present in Hateful Eight. Highly recommended."

The complicated plot and surprise ending was very Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The over the top spatter of bloody projectile vomiting and the covering of characters with blood and brains was typical.<br/><br/>All told, a splendid example of Saint Quenten performing one of his film miracles.

I know many people have issues and think this is the worst Tarantino movie but I actually really liked it, maybe more than some other movies considered some of his best. A post-Civil War western film which takes place in a snowy Wyoming had a great potential as of cinematography and this movie really did a great job capturing the feeling of this particular place perfectly. The biggest win of this movie is clearly the acting and the characters' establishment too. You can really feel these characters are unique, you learn about them by listening what others know and experiencing how the react to circumstances so you keep gaining information in each and every scene and dialogue, making this movie really interesting to me. The violence is over the top as expected in a Tarantino film and that's something I always enjoy the most. Also, the plot might seem somewhat simple but I think had some pretty nice turns and decisions I couldn't say they were predictable. I think the only issue that you can really see in this movies is that it's really long and anyone could get bored, it surely pays off in the end but some minor scenes could be eliminated in the final cut to make it less tiring for the viewer. I definetely enjoyed the story, loved the violence, appreciated the characters and had a great time with the acting.

"rachelgallit","4","0","0","30 June 2020"," Oh so long
","Having watched two Tarantino films back to back, I may have burnt myself out on this genre. Perhaps my lack of excitement at the events was due to the blurring together of the two movies, which reduced the sensationalism of the plot, but there is no way to know. For a movie with such graphic bloodshed and exciting backstories, not much seemed to happen. There was no protagonist, per se, and all of the characters were unsavory, making their inevitable deaths feel justified and moral. What saved the film from feeling interminable was the flashback. Going back in time to show how the situation came to be broke up the monotony of men standing around shouting. However, the stakes did not feel real to me. The threat level was so high and critically dangerous that it capped out and became mundane. If everything is violent and aggressively sinister, it doesn't feel special anymore and loses its sensationalism. One scene, in particular, felt forced and unnecessary: Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) informs General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) that he had tortured, taken advantage of s*xually, and then killed the Generals son. It was graphic, and shocking, which was the intention, but lacked any sort of reason why the audience should care. There was no established reason why this event would spark a deep emotional reaction, beyond basic human decency."

But I don't think the gratuitous violence and gory details give any additional value to the plot. I could just have well been at a B-rate flea market and for a dollar, purchased a used DVD of some obscure horror film director, showing blood splatter and body parts dangling.<br/><br/>And if you are using the privilege of shooting in 65mm lenses, then you should exploit it for grandiose outdoor scenery. No. Not here. 95% of the plot is indoors. Wasted.<br/><br/>About the Ennio Morricone full score: not impressed. The overture of music only was nice. But that's about it. The rest of the plot had very little need for musical support. The rest of the plot was just a string of sequential quotes from verbal dialogue that had very little need for musical background. Sergio Leone employed Morricone's music very differently, where the sound, tunes, and lyrics ARE the dialogue. A Sergio Leone close-up is a rugged Klaus Kinski face, twitching nervously, and a jarring sound track supporting its expression. But Tarantino never NEVER uses the music to his plot advantage. So, what's the music for ? left the theater unsatisfied."
"DareDevilKid","10","8","29","27 December 2015"," Devilishly Good From Quintessentially Diabolical Tarantino
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.9/5 stars<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is a cinema buff's dream - outrageous, extraordinary, extreme filmmaking at its most confident, and unlike anything else in theaters this season. But that's only to be expected from Quentin Tarantino, one of the few directors with the clout to pursue his vision wherever it takes him. It's a big, shambling, audacious inversion of the western genre, held together by Tarantino's sincere conviction that beyond his unbridled imagination, American audiences might recognize their own fractious nation.<br/><br/>Set about a decade after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive Daisy Domergue, race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as ""The Hangman,"" will bring Domergue to justice. Along the road, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren, a black former union soldier turned infamous bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix, a southern renegade who claims to be the town's new Sheriff. Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie's, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob, who's taking care of Minnie's while she's visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside stopover, our eight travelers come to learn they may not make it to Red Rock after all.<br/><br/>You can feel Tarantino crushing on Howard Hawks and John Ford in every frame of this weirdly engaging epic. The characters are big. The horses are real. And the quiet promise of the American Dream is always palpable. Even at almost three hours, the story never feels labored. A lot of that is because Tarantino's dialogue is rapturous to the ear. But mostly it's because the performances are all so strong. Hell, matter of fact it feels far shorter than many of the 100-or-so- minute duds we've had to endure this year.<br/><br/>Now that isn't saying that ""The Hateful Eight"" is a western as wacky as ""Django Unchained"", but it's everything you want from a Tarantino movie: unbearable tension, deft and intuitive dialogue interspersed with acerbic wit, fleshed-out characters, and sudden, grisly violence. This 8th outing from Tarantino offers another well-aimed round of his signature blend of action, humor, thrills, and over- the-top violence - all while demonstrating an even stronger grip on his filmmaking craft."

","I was one of the few people who saw the original run of Reservoir Dogs when it opened in the UK. After reading a review with a picture Tim Roth, swimming in blood with a freshly emptied 9mm, I was hooked. <br/><br/>QT's ground breaking debut was not a success on release, it only gained notoriety when it was pulled last minute from the TV schedule of Channel 4, who had helped fund the movie, primarily due to the cop torture sequence. <br/><br/>The media uproar drew enough attention for a second run in theatre and the rest is history, a legend had rewritten all of the rules and shot them in the face for good measure.<br/><br/>From that point on we were spoilt with the wild ride of Pulp Fiction, True Romance and Natural Born Killers as Quentin Tarantino was, quite rightly, hailed as a genius, but he seems to know this and that's where he falls down. <br/><br/>The steady pace of the more mature Jackie Brown polarised audiences, as did the 2 part Kill Bill, which I felt could have been told in one film. <br/><br/>Death Proof was pretty much unanimously kicked, Inglorious and Django were seen as a return to form even though their flaws (disjointed storytelling, last act issues, that stupid Australian accent) are widely debated or acknowledged. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is no different, with the added bitter disappointment that Quentin has not learnt any lessons from his last few outings.<br/><br/>The first half of his 8th movie is a master-class in cinema. <br/><br/>The opening theme is a statement, the cinematography stark and beautiful as the film unfolds in its own sweet time on Quentin's trademark colourful dialogue. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell's bounty hunter is dogged as his recent and sublime turn in Bone Tomahawk, Jackson is Jackson... 'nuff said, and Jennifer Jason Leigh looks like she's having the time of her life in her role as a gang member in chains who's every bit as brutal as her male counterparts.<br/><br/>Enter Walton Goggins in a role that seemed written for him, and on rolls the story to Minnie's Habbidashery where the mystery unfolds in true 'whodunnit' style reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs where we meet the rest of a perfect ensemble cast and things start to really get fun.<br/><br/>Until the sudden introduction of a condescending directors voice over... <br/><br/>Previously that day I listened to interviews with Aaron Sorkin and Harrison Ford, both of whom bemoaned the use of exposition for expositions sake, Ford quite scathingly inferring that it was a lazy device in a visual media, particularly when the point has already been made verbally. <br/><br/>For 90 minutes Quentin trusted us to patiently invest our time, drip feeding the mystery piece by piece as the greater puzzle started to fall into place through clues in the dialogue, vicious glances and suspicious body language, all shot in this epic photography when suddenly 'out of the f****n' blue' he starts describing what's going on, on screen. <br/><br/>At this point, the film lost me. I was completely taken out of it, like Django and Inglorious before, by a random, jarring, amateur swerve- ball. A turd in the punchbowl. It just didn't fit, it wasn't needed and felt vain. A lot like that Australian cameo in Django. <br/><br/>From here on the movie took a sour turn. <br/><br/>While not without merit, there was plenty of excitement to be had when the bullets started flying but when the violence escalated to epic proportions it lacked the visceral edge of Dogs or the sudden twists in Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>After his heavy handed exposition, the language started to feel clumsy and misjudged as the ""bitch"" and ""n****r"" count started to rise with gleeful abandon and the explosive gore-fest seemed less pulp fiction and more torture porn. It felt more nasty and mean spirited than edgy. A movie that had started out with ambitions of Pekinpah was now looking more Platinum Dunes.<br/><br/>Maybe if the film had been voiced by Sam Elliott and started with narration, maybe that would have sat better with me, who knows? But what is certain, is that I'm increasingly frustrated with Tarantino's growing propensity to almost give us the perfect movie, yet always seems to be one final, ruthless edit away from the true genius he is."
"stra-7","9","9","34","28 December 2015"," Tarantinos best since Pulp Fiction, but probably not for everyone
","I personally don't understand the people calling this ""slow"" or ""boring"", did we see the same film? It's a suspense thriller kind of film with a who-done-it plot, it starts off slow but builds to a grand finale. It's an artistically very pure film, all shot in 70mm, and more akin to watching a play in a small theater than going to the movies. It's also about as far from The Avengers as you can get, and for me that's a good thing. Don't expect non-stop mindless action, but if you have a brain between your shoulders chances are you'll find yourself glued to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>It's not perfect. Some plot elements were added for that typical Tarantino off-kilter comical effect, but about half of them end up feeling a bit forced and staged rather than organic. I also feel that while the cast is excellent not all of them fit the setting or the tone of the story. The diversity between the on-screen characters is so great that you wonder if all of them really could exist in the same universe and at the same time, it feels like some of them are trying to do classical western while others are trying to do spaghetti western with hints of western satire. But maybe this was the effect Tarantino wanted? He does like to polarize and create tension between extremes whenever he can. I'm personally not convinced it actually adds to the film though.<br/><br/>As for individual performances people have been praising Jackson, and he does indeed perform his usual Jackson repertoire to great effect. But for me the real star of the show is Kurt Russell, this may be the best performance of his entire career. He is absolutely fantastic as the practically minded frontier bounty hunter John Ruth. A real star performance that binds the movie together, and the frontier look suits him.<br/><br/>All in all I highly recommend this film. It's a fine work by Tarantino, definitely one of his best. But it's also one of his more artistic films and set in a very morally grey world, don't expect non-stop mindless action and don't expect a clear sense of right and wrong. Do expect a thriller with a focus on narrative tension. If it sounds like your kind of film it probably is."

","What is film if not a portal to another world, where rules are imagined by one master creator, with a point to escape from the only reality to another fantasy.<br/><br/>Many critics deemed this film ""too long"". They would much rather stick to the 90 minutes prestige movies about wall street thieves, bankers, single-parent mothers, one-dimensional silly action packed scraps and PC 'for-the-sake-of-reputation' stories that the world is bandwagoning like Gastarbeiters on minimum wage.<br/><br/>I like to see ""The Hateful Eight"" as a two act movie, where, in the first one Quentin Tarantino gets comfortable with his scribbling, and by scribbling, I mean amazing writing, in which characters talk and talk and talk and don't mistake it for boredom, one iota. It's captivating. But in the second... it explodes into hateful violence, where some of it were done just for the sake of it. That's how these characters are ruthless, selfish and in many ways unpredictable.<br/><br/>The Ennio Morricone score jump starts the movie and one of the things that I love in a Tarantino movie are the opening credits. ""Little Green Bag"" reveals the Reservoir Dogs title, ""Misirlou"" reveals the Pulp Fiction title, ""Across 110th Street"" reveals Jackie Brown a-la ""The Graduate"", ""Bang Bang"" reveals Kill Bill, ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" reveals Inglorious Basterds (personally my favorite opening credits of a Tarantino film, and perhaps of all time), ""Django"" reveals Django and finally, Morricone doesn't blast with horns or loud string quartets, but slowly dissects the puzzle and invites you to see the violence that is to come. With big, bold, western yellow font and orange shadows: THE HATEFUL EIGHT.<br/><br/>The film hasn't started and it's already Tarantino. It goes in the top 4 Tarantino films, most definitely."
"KineticSeoul","8","9","34","23 December 2015"," Very different western
","When I first saw the trailer to this, I had no idea what this film was about, except that it's a western. Let's just say Quentin takes elements from old westerns, television westerns and spaghetti westerns and mashes it into this in a very coherent manner. However for mainstream audiences, this isn't a western that you will be used to. With the hero fighting against bandits and stuff like that. Instead this reminded me of those who done it films, like ""The Thing"". It even has a unused track from ""The Thing"" in this. When it comes to the plot, it's one of those ""who done it?"" films. Except things get crazy and gruesome with the trademark Quentin style thrown in. With some amusing interactions amongst the characters, which is a staple for Quentin. This isn't really good as some of the previous Quentin Tarantino films, but it's still a bloody good time. It's a very unpredictable film with things happening that is relevant but very unexpected. It might take some time to get used to with it's slow start but when it hits it really hits. When it comes to the cast Kurt Russell did just fine, Walton Goggins really shocked me in this, Jennifer Jason Leigh put on a stand out performance. However this film seems to have be written just for Samuel L. Jackson, cause without Jackson I don't know who else could play his character. Overall, this is a good mystery, dark comedy, thriller that is worth a watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

"jakeanderson1206","10","10","39","21 December 2015"," Tarantino delivers something old and something new - In a great way
","Quentin Tarantino is a film fan's filmmaker. He does what he does for no other reason than that he can, or that he wants to. <br/><br/>Hateful Eight proves this and runs with it, and passes with flying colors.<br/><br/>The best way I can describe the film is that its a combination of John Carpenter's 'The Thing' (not JUST because of Morricone's score or Kurt Russel) and 'Clue'. What we get is a film entirely about one stagecoach, one room, and the people that occupy it.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are the Tarantino fair of being colorful and non- conventional, and of course, a ton of fun to watch. The acting and performances help as well, this is one of the best casts to grace a film this year. Kurt Russell is fantastic, Samuel Jackson delivers his best performance since Pulp Fiction, Tim Roth does a fine job, but the stand outs (other than Jackson who is near Oscar worthy) are Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins, who I wasn't expecting to hold a candle to the veterans of the cast. Goggins especially finally gets a film role where he can truly shine and will no doubt get him more well-deserved work. <br/><br/>The story and characters seem to intertwine in ways you do expect and don't expect simultaneously. The direction and cinematography is spot on, as several hints and many different details allude to various character actions and motivations - and thats just on first viewing. QT proves he can work his film devices to the fullest potential since Pulp Fiction. And Morricone's score, as always, is beautiful, with even a nod to the score of 'The Thing' in the film.<br/><br/>As far as problems or issues with structure, its all on how you enjoy these films. If you don't like Tarantino films, this film won't change your mind. It does fall into the conventional criticism that Tarantino doesn't really make films, he makes a collection of masterfully made scenes that may or may not hold together. Not to mention you can absolutely describe this film as various other film's by QT (even though thats evident in all his work, but this film feels like Reservoir Dogs meets Django Unchained with a twinge of Inglorious Basterds.) But here's the thing - Hateful Eight holds up together. It's fun, its dark, its dramatic, its hilarious, it's Hollywood filmmaking at its most charismatic and confident. <br/><br/>I look forward to your Ninth, Tarantino."
"adrongardner","5","6","20","9 January 2016"," 65mm can also amplify mediocrity
","Spoiler Alert: Size of the film negative does not adversely result in better movies!! Plenty of trash was made on 65mm over the years and Hateful Eight is now one of those.<br/><br/>I got the joke pretty quickly. We are watching one of Tarantino-world's western shows. But instead of twenty minutes of tight plotting, it goes on for three hours. Hey look it's bad TV! But we used HUGE cameras this time!!!! <br/><br/>And the ""twist"" ain't there. There isn't one folks. You sort of figuratively lean in for three hours waiting for the final denouement but there isn't one. <br/><br/>Forget ""racial"" context or social commentary. There isn't any. Don't give QT that much credit. Saying Hateful Eight is a commentary on the Civil War is like saying Transformers is a comment on the Civil War. This thing is a complete mess in many ways and if it was merely 90 minutes, there COULD be a movie to almost laugh off. But no, there's nothing here. All they do is beat the living sh** out of Jennifer Jason Leigh for three hours and then the credits roll. <br/><br/>The real twist is, QT got you to pay for it. Not falling for that one again..."
"griffcoldiron","9","11","45","1 January 2016"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","On this site, you'll inevitably read reviews calling this movie long and boring, those reviews couldn't be more wrong. While I don't think this is Tarantino's best work (I place it 5th behind Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Reservoir Dogs, and Django Unchained.)I do think this is a satisfying addition to the Tarantino catalog. There's not a ton of action, and you have to appreciate dialogue, but if you do, you're in for a treat, the dialogue is sharp, at times brilliant, and has a sharp comedic edge (this may be Tarantino's funniest work) The scenery is beautiful, and beautifully captured, the actors while intentionally being over the top at times are all stellar (Walton Goggins was especially good.) I definitely think it's worth a viewing in the theater (preferably in 70mm)"
"tifftoft","10","11","45","31 December 2015"," My first review on here...
","HI All. I have been using IMDb for many years, and I have been an actual registered member for a little over five. I usually do not write reviews because, truthfully, I'm not very good at it, and I'm so scared of accidentally spoiling something. However, I was so bummed to see so much hate for The Hateful Eight, I decided to leave a review.<br/><br/>I love this movie. I think The Hateful Eight is awesome. It's my new favorite from Quentin Tarantino. I am not a movie critic or anything, and yes, I have seen his other work, and yes, I love all his other movies, even those movies he didn't direct. And yes, I still stand by this rating anyway, and by my declaration if it being my new #1.<br/><br/>So what did I love without spoiling anything?<br/><br/>First, I loved the set intimacy. You are spending three hours with eight or so fascinating characters trapped together in one central location. There is no escape. These people must face each other, interact with each other, and survive each other. And we get to watch. This all taking place during a blizzard. I find the weather to be a reflection of the characters. What might have once been romanticized as a beautiful setting is now simply dangerous- the frozen landscape is stark and barren, the bitter cold is cruel and painful, and the howling wind is loud, violent and overpowering throughout the film.<br/><br/>Second, I love the acting. This is an impressive lineup of experienced actors and actresses. You have to give them credit because they are the ones carrying this movie. There is no major-over- the-top action scenes to hide behind, no sweeping landscapes to occupy the viewers attention. It's one room and a handful of diabolical characters and an unfolding story. Compliments to all of them.<br/><br/>Many reviewers complained about the unlikable quality of these main characters, but that is what I loved most about this film. It is called The Hateful Eight for a reason - there are at least eight hateful people trapped together in/on this movie ""stage"". For a better understanding, imagine that the eight a-holes you hate most in the world were stuck together in a room. Then imagine what awful hilarity might ensue if you gave them all weapons and a reason to kill each other. This is the basic setting for this vengeance-style movie.<br/><br/>Three. If you love Quentin Tarantino for the violence, then you will not be disappointed here. When it comes, it is explosive. I see many reviewers complaining that there is not enough action in this movie, but in this case, it works. I would say that, like sex, patience is key here. It is the buildup that makes the climax so exciting and gratifying. I think Samuel L. Jackson's character is warning viewers of this in the trailer: ""Let's Slow It Down, Let's Slow It Way Down."" However, I was not bored at all--not even for a moment. The climax is worth the wait.<br/><br/>Anyway, I recommend that you go see the movie. Do not go with expectations of a classic Western with Cowboys and horses and Native Americans and gunfights among cactus-strewn sunsets; rather, go with the expectations of eight complicated Southern/Western characters that must survive a blizzard together, Quentin Tarantino style.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 Stars."
"vissini95","8","8","30","1 January 2016"," Another piece of Tarantino genius
","One of the greatest directors of our era, Quentin Tarantino, returned with an almost 3-hour film, without any big stars (but with many of his regulars) and much trouble during production. But he made it again.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is perhaps the Tarantino film with the more mystery in it; for long enough during the film you don't know who is who and who does what, and there's even a scene when the great Samuel Jackson produces a Poirot-style speech trying to solve one of the plot's mysteries. <br/><br/>As in every film Quentin made, the greatest part is the screenplay. Quick and witty dialogue, especially by Jackson and Kurt Russell, colorful, ambiguous characters, black humor, great use of actual events (this time, the American Civil War) and of course, suspense, mystery and masterful plot twists. Chronological order is not observed, typically for Tarantino, but this time it's necessary in order to deceit the viewer, as he aims to.<br/><br/>The cast acts fine, with Jackson, Russell and Leigh performing at their best. Because of its similar scenery (19th century United States, with race relations an important factor), you can't help but compare the movie with Tarantino's latest Django Unchained (2012). The latter film had stars like Waltz and Di Caprio and much more action than this, but The Hateful Eight almost equals it with its mysterious plot and brilliantly claustrophobic directing by Tarantino, plus the wonderful score written by the great Ennio Morricone. I think Django was slightly better, but this one had significantly less potential to exploit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film proves for one more time that this guy is a master behind the camera, and provides 165 minutes of suspense, intrigue and fun. It's a great movie to watch, not a masterpiece, but another piece of Tarantino genius. And for the die-hard Tarantino fans, they may observe that the style resembles the earliest films he made, such as Reservoir Dogs, with slapstick violence and no sympathetic characters. Not his best, but a true Tarantino movie."

","While travelling to the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth, and his fugitive prisoner, encounter another bounty hunter, and a man who claims to be a sheriff. <br/><br/>Hoping to find shelter from an incoming blizzard, the group travels to a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass. <br/><br/>Greeted there by four strangers, the eight travellers soon learn that they may not make it to their destination........<br/><br/>Just of late, it's been a fashion that movies released between the months of November to March, with an eclectic cast, wonderful story, and a bravura marketing campaign (AKA Oscar bait), has to be nearing the three hour mark.<br/><br/>We've had The Wolf Of Wall Street, Django Unchained, The Revenant, and now, this.<br/><br/>But they never seem like they are that length, especially this one, because Tarantino must know that a film this length could potentially be a hard slog, so he puts his three acts into handy, bite-size chapters.<br/><br/>But unlike many a whodunit with which are of a certain length, The Hateful Eight unfortunately feels bloated for the first act only, and the usual Tarantino banter that is usually the heart, soul, and main selling point of his movies, just feels forced, but in the first act only.<br/><br/>The whole build up to the halfway house could have been trimmed by at least eighty percent, as the exposition between Jackson, Russell, Leigh, and Goggins, is like the energiser bunny, it just goes on and on, and on and on........<br/><br/>And it really doesn't tell you much about the characters, or their traits, it's just a case of them saying to each other 'hey, didn't you', 'your such and such' for a good hour.<br/><br/>But then when we reach the halfway house, and the halfway point of the movie, it goes absolutely bonkers, and what Taratino has given us, is a slow, a very slow build up to one of the most tense second and third acts that the man has ever created.<br/><br/>The film feels like a mix of Reservoir Dogs, and Carpenters 'The Thing', and this becomes all the more apparent when Morricone's own score from The Thing 'Bestiality' is used in the more tense scenes.<br/><br/>Again, The Thing similarities are all the more evident as the film progresses. The unbearable elements of the outside, the trust quickly dwindling from the group, the lining up against the wall, reminisces one of the blood test scene in The Thing, and the whole film has that claustrophobic element to it like Carpenters did.<br/><br/>Even Jackson hitching a ride on the carriage could reference the huskies travel to the station.<br/><br/>And then there's Kurt Russell.........<br/><br/>Tarantino does the narrative for the film, and although it comes across as a bit of a pretentious thing to do, it works because it kinds of smooths over plot points that couldn't really be explained on screen with actual narrative.<br/><br/>The cast, as you'd expect are all excellent. Jackson is a little bit pedestrian for a an hour or so, but again, I believe that this is Tarantino's intention to make the latter part of the film more tense, because the monologue Jackson gives to Dern about his son, rivals that of Jules' Ezekial 25:17 speech, and then he becomes the films focus point. The man is brilliant.<br/><br/>Russell too is excellent, and him and Jason Leigh bounce off each other and provide the humour. Roth does his best Waltz impression, You wonder why Dern is there at all, but again, thanks to the narrative, it all becomes clear as soon as the film becomes too bogged under by its own madness.<br/><br/>And then there's the violence. Unflinching, over the top and pretty psychedelic, it's s Ow motion harks at the Wild Bunch, but the blood veers toward total exploitation.<br/><br/>Top it off with cinematography to die for, and a sublime score from Morricone, this is the best thing Tarantino has done in twenty years. <br/><br/>So aside from the beginning being a little too long, which on hindsight, does benefit the later scenes, The Hateful Eight is one wonderful film, and proves Tarantino is a master storyteller who is still at the top of his game....."
"tavm","8","5","16","13 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight was another entertaining Quentin Tarantino movie
","I've yet to see Reservoir Dogs but I've seen just most every other Quentin Tarantino movie after that so I wasn't surprised by the kind of dialogue he wrote, nor the way he arranges some scenes out of sequence. I was surprised to hear mostly original music by Ennio Morricone (which just won him a Golden Globe which Tarantino accepted). Some familiar players-Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson-abound. One not normally in a Tarantino flick-Jennifer Jason Leigh-really tears into her part here. The only other movie she was in I watched all the way through was Fast Times at Ridgemont High when I was a teen so this latest of hers really impressed me and I now wished she had won the Globe as well! The expected violence was pretty entertainingly weird which was how my movie theatre-working friend described it when it was nearly over, at least that's what I was thinking when he said weird during that and then told a fellow employee he enjoyed it when asked! Anyway, that's a high recommendation for The Hateful Eight. Note: This review is of the general release version which is not in 70mm and has no intermission, therefore some cuts. Oh, and there's a mention of my current hometown of Baton Rouge in this but not in a good way..."

","""The Hateful Eight"": At this point if you go into a Tarantino movie and aren't sure what to expect then you've probably never seen a Tarantino movie. You should usually expect a good time with some fun characters, a lot of vulgar language with some racial slurs and even a few big buckets of blood. That is exactly what I received with this only in gorgeous 70mm Cinema Scope. Seriously, the cinematography was great in this film. And yes, I saw it in the Road Show with my amazing girlfriend who was more than willing to drive me about an hour away to see it on the BIG screen. This was a really good movie, out of the Quentin Tarantino film roster; I wouldn't say that this was my favorite of his because I do have a couple of issues with some of the editing choices and odd narration inserts planted a couple times in the movie. I still was more than thrilled that I got the chance to see the movie. I love Tarantino as a director and writer; he's made some of my favorite films of all time, such as ""Jackie Brown"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Reservoir Dogs"". He's a talented guy that has done another amazing job on a movie here.<br/><br/>The film is about a group of men and one woman locked up in a cabin together over a night, one of the men is bounty hunter holding a prisoner to be hung by the neck. He believes that one of the other men isn't who they say they are and there is a lot of mistrust between them, of course. Twists and turns and a hell of a lot of cool dialogue between the characters, we have our movie. I'm not going to get too much into the movie because I believe it is worth seeing in the theater, especially if you love Quentin Tarantino. Between his two westerns, I would put ""Django Unchained"" above this movie, but I still really dug this one. So if you have the chance, I strongly say go see this where it is playing the Road Show version of it because you get some extra footage not seen in the other version, the full scope of the environment with its fantastic cinematography, an opening overture, an intermission, and a cool little booklet that talks about the making of the film. That's my two cents on the subject anyhow, if you see this in a regular old theater I don't believe you'll feel disappointed by any means, I just believe that you'd be missing out on a really cool experience is all. Either way, go check it out!"
"da-port-figure","9","9","35","30 December 2015"," I understand why some hate it and why some love it
","I grew up watching westerners with my father, it was part of our bonding time, so whenever I see a western type of movie pop up, it immediately grabs my attention. Now keep in mind that i'm a young guy in my 20's so I will say that I do understand why most people disliked this movie. <br/><br/>We are so used to shorts and with the emergence of very powerful TV Series at our fingertips on Netflix, with twists, turns and swerves at the end of every episode, we crave for something that will deliver the same amount of impact, complexity and visual effects that TV series rely on. That will not be found in abundance in this film, it is a very long movie with the first half dealing SOLELY with character creation and that is done through very dense and heavy dialogue scenes, it to me is the most refined Tarantino movie to date and I'm sure i'll have my critics on this but this is the one because it may not be his BEST TITLE, but the most artistic one for sure. Where some see dullness I see a stage for the art of dialogue. <br/><br/>It is a movie you can watch many times over just to enjoy the way it was filmed, the dialogues between the characters, the one liners and overall feel through all the scenes. It was shot so well and the acting was so brilliant that you feel immersed by the universe, you can almost feel the shivering cold the characters are enduring and feel refreshed at the warmth of the freshly brewed hot coffee. <br/><br/>I feel like younger people (under 30) will find this a boring creation for they were expecting the typical gory hack and slash scenes from Tarantino, which are present but nowhere as abundant as a few of his other titles. <br/><br/>I was extremely excited when I found out Ennio Morricone performed the score for the movie but I have to admit that it felt a bit too modern for an old western movie, it somehow lacked the essence that he is known for. <br/><br/>Overall, I recommend that you watch it as the masterpiece that it is, allow the movie to guide you into this adventure, do not take breaks or pauses, it does feel dense and heavy at times or as the younger generation would label it ""boring"", but bear with it and absorb as much as you can for it all has a certain meaning, even if not apparent at first. <br/><br/>I am sure you will feel rewarded. I left the movie theater with a heavy heart for I did not wish it to end, by the end I was completely drawn in to their world, I have not watched a movie like this in decades and I truly hope more of this style will come to fruition, this was an incredible experience every film lover should experience at least once in their lifetimes."

"fcote-49483","9","9","35","24 December 2015"," My thoughts about THE HATEFUL EIGHT and other reviews
","There are two types of people who have watched this movie. 1- Those who were disappointed because the movie was too similar to previous Tarantino pictures or: 2- Those who enjoyed the movie for the same reasons.<br/><br/>I am part of the latter.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews of THE HATEFUL EIGHT, positive and negative, and I have not yet seen a review in which the viewer had felt the same feelings I had during the end credits.<br/><br/>It seems that everyone who watches a movie absolutely wants the movie to end with answers to all the questions they were asking themselves during the the movie. This is not that kind of flick.<br/><br/>Who is trustworthy? This is the question to ask. There are no heroes in this movie, unlike Django or The Bride. It is difficult to pick someone to root for. And I believe this is where the audience confuses itself. The audience seems to need to have a good and a bad character. Some viewers cannot enjoy the picture if they have mixed feelings at the end. I was a little confused in my emotions at the end of the movie and I was reminiscing on all the characters and their ambitions. I have come to my own conclusion and I'm sure others won't share the same thoughts as I did. THIS mix of opinions makes a movie worth watching, and reviewing for that matter. You cannot have all answers given to you, you must think a little.<br/><br/>Every character tries to bargain or lie to get his or her own way. It seems that viewers have a hard time understanding that it is not because a character says something that it is necessary true, especially if that character is SAYING that he must lie sometimes to get his or her way.<br/><br/>The narrative frame, the flashbacks and the narrator made that movie even more interesting to me. Yes, the movie starts slowly. Very slowly. There is a lot of dialogue that seem pointless. Yet, it is necessary in order to understand each of the goal and a little bit of the history of each character presented and you later understand that everything that has been said was indeed important to the story. I admit that towards the middle of the picture, I was eager for something to happen, as expected from Tarantino, and then a turn of events occur and the narration part embarks. I have read many reviews that criticized the narration but I thought it was brilliant. Tarantino being probably the greatest storyteller of our generation gets into the story is if you were listening to the DVD commentary. It wasn't any narrator, it was Tarantino himself telling you ""Okay, here we are in the movie, now watch what will happen next. You'll be surprised!""<br/><br/>Furthermore, the scenery was exceptional. The cast was great, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh. I have read from other reviews that some characters were just thrown in the movie just for the sake of the 8 in the title and claiming that they should have had more dialogue. I again disagree. Given the history of each character and the situation they were in, I felt that they were perfectly written for the story.<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to patient viewers with an eye for realistic human reactions. What would you do in these situations?<br/><br/>9/10"
"MattBirk","6","11","46","31 December 2015"," Tarantino Brings Us a Dialog Driven Mystery
","First we had the character-drama Slow West, then the horror-western Bone Tomahawk, and finally Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. This one being the most 'grand' in scale and certainly the most well put together. This is one of the year's better movies which is a nice mix of western justice and cabin fever. You can easily see the influence The Thing (my favorite movie) had on this movie (which Tarantino had the crew watch before making the film).<br/><br/>There is a lot to like here from strong characters to dark cynical humor, everything you expect from a Tarantino movie. The introductions are a tad slow, but once you hear everyone's story you then can start to piece together who is lying and who is telling the truth. And the action this time around is nice and swift verses other stories where violence is more of a storyteller (Kill Bill). This is what makes The Hateful Eight so foreboding, once you realize how swift the action is it really antes up the tension. Not to mention the dialog carries a lot of the weight, we get to see the characters analyze other characters based on their responses to certain situations. Which is bittersweet in my eyes, I personally would have liked more physical puzzles/clues, but with Tarantino, the puzzles are hidden within the dialog.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my main gripe with the movie, the mystery the story presents us with. It's engrossing and intriguing but, unfortunately, too brief. The Hateful Eight builds up this idea about someone not being who they claim to be and then in an instant we are given the solution to the mystery. Just when things start to get interesting as to who killed who, boom, resolution (to the mystery, not the movie itself). The movie should have played out a bit more like Clue or Gone Girl, keeping us guessing while presenting new clues as the mystery builds to its apex. But here it is all too brief. That's not to say it ruined the movie, what we are given is still juicy enough to keep you entertained most of the time, it just could have been a bit more of a guessing game when all is said and done.<br/><br/>Though I did like the movie quite a bit and would place it in the middle of Tarantino's filmography, I have to admit I was slightly let down. That, of course, being because I expected more of a one-by-one-they-all-die mystery. But that sure as hell didn't ruin the movie. It's fun, intriguing, and, of course, over-the-top violent when the script calls for it."
"athawolsux","10","4","12","1 February 2016"," A must-see for fans of the western genre
","The Hateful Eight is an amazing movie that no fan of the western genre (especially spaghetti westerns) should miss. The twist is that while everything is in the tone of a spaghetti western with intentionally clichéd characters like the silent cowboy, the bounty hunter, ""the Mexican"" and the grumpy old racist officer, they are all put in a claustrophobic setting reminiscent of The Thing. The pacing of the movie is also quite slow and deliberate, where nothing seems to happen for long stretches of time while still being wholly enjoyable to watch thanks to the cinematography and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Now there is a lot of criticism directed at this movie. The criticism of the movie's pace and gory content is a matter of taste and subjectively depends on one's take on standard Tarantino fare. While such criticism is justified, most complaints about the movie revolve around the fact that it is offensive and that it does not ""really have a message"" while dealing with complex social issues. Now the thing to keep in mind is that this movie deliberately features horrible and racist people, who act exactly like horrible and racist people would act in the 19th century in the Old West. There are three issues to consider here:<br/><br/><ul><li>is there something wrong with a movie featuring evil, horrible and intentionally shallow characters (meant to work as caricatures of standard western tropes)?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>if such characters are cast, is it wrong to expect that they should say offensive things and act in an offensive manner (and thus be in character)?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>should a movie dealing with social issues such as race and gender necessarily ""say"" something about it?</li></ul><br/><br/>The answer to all three of these questions is, of course, a big no. The best way to deal with a social issue in film is to show it, portray it for what it was. The idea with The Hateful Eight is that race relations in America were/are utterly messed up with no clear good and evil. We can see this in the ""oppressed"" female character also being racist, the black character who is the recipient of most insults in the movie also being a terrible person and in the sweet black lady running the shop also being racist (towards Mexicans). If one is necessarily looking for a concise ""message"" or a satisfying conclusion, it can be that the only two intelligent characters in the movie are the black character and the female character.<br/><br/>So I believe most of the criticism at its purported offensiveness and pointlessness is flat out wrong because it all fits in the movie's own logic. The Hateful Eight is simply a great western movie and also a great murder mystery."

","Loved it, the hateful 8 did its job! It delivered a great action/drama/thriller with all the satire and comedy you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. I have heard a lot of negativity about this movie a lot to do with the use of the 'N' word. While confronting at times this is a period piece. Set in post civil war America probably around the 1870's Slavery was still thing! African Americans were treated like second class citizens, that really happened. This movie is reflective of the era, it does no favours to sugar coat the past! yes there is a lot of racial commentary in this film but that was the way the world was back then. Anyway! the movie is great its Quentin Tarantino, so you know what you are going to get! a great cast with amazing dialogue! This movie is long but really enjoyable its a 'who done it' film 8 strangers in a cabin who is the bad guy? As a whole i don't think its Tarantino's best work but his 'not best work' is still a 9/10 in my opinion and a 8 on IMDb overall. So even when his isn't on his game he is amazing!"

","* Free * spoiler // This is my first review on this site. I start from here cause I love Tarantino movies and I would often debate about his movies with friends in the past .. - A great Italian critic that gives its name to the famous dictionary Mereghetti, said of Tarantino, Pulp Fiction about ""Perfect game of joints, paradoxical dialogs and good actors direction, but do not ask real emotions: the second film, there is already a risk that Tarantino is too in love with himself."" - This film looks like a return to his first three films before Jackie Brown where cynicism was not lacking and totally devoid of romantic tones. You can not ask for, in my opinion, to Tarantino to make a traditional comedy, but I am sure that he is able to do it if only he wanted .. The dialogs are perfect, paced rhythm, a story a little kneaded from his previous films, but still credible, compelling, funny and with a certain suspense that reminds me of PF. Clear reminder of the Spaghetti Western of Leone, the ruthlessness of the films of Kurosawa and perhaps a look at Hitchcock. Maybe the biggest flaw of QT is that he may not have a hero to protect, but his eighth film will probably be an eulogy a little pleased with his genre but that critics in the future will recognize as unique .. 9/10"

"ramblyanna","8","4","12","23 January 2016"," A Whole Lot of Fun!
","This movie showcases some of the best of Tarantino: the beautiful cinematography and epic feel of Inglourious Basterds combined with the sheer fun of Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>One prisoner (played to perfection by Jennifer Jason Leigh), one bounty hunter who has captured her (Kurt Russell in one of his best roles), one man with a plan (Sam Jackson, more on him in a minute) and one haberdashery they need to stop at due to inclement weather, filled with a host of characters who all have their secrets. A growing number of dead bodies and not a whole lot of time to figure out who is behind the murders. <br/><br/>This has the feel of a western, but really, it's all about Agatha Christie. We all know Tarantino loves his homages/rip-offs and this one is where he goes all And Then There Were None on us. And when he does, Sam Jackson chews all the damned scenery. Walter Goggins keeps up with him nicely, providing great foil, but Jackson is the star of this show. He positively shines. <br/><br/>There is, of course the violence, swearing and general offensiveness you'd expect from a Tarantino movie. If you dislike Tarantino for making a joke out of grotesque violence, lifting heavily from other films (in this case more a book) or his use of a certain word - you know the one I mean - then this film will do nothing to endear you to him. But if you enjoy that stuff, then it's all here in abundance. <br/><br/>Why 8 stars instead of 10? Well, as beautiful as this film looks and as much as I enjoyed the loving shots of snow covered woods and appreciated the cinematography in general, I'm not entirely convinced it was in keeping with the tone of the movie. In IG it worked because that was by far a more serious movie, filled with moments of genuine suspense. Whereas H8, although suspenseful in places, is much more light-hearted in tone, making the switch from sheer fun to loooooong shots of snow feel a little jarring. <br/><br/>But all in all, a great movie and highly entertaining."
"Troy_Campbell","9","4","12","22 January 2016"," Tarantino is at it yet again.
","As Kurt Russell's bounty hunter meets Samuel L. Jackson's ex-military man on the snowy road to Red Rock, he warns him to slowly move forward, ""molasses-like"". Which is the perfect description for Quentin Tarantino's eighth motion picture. This is arguably the filmmaker's most languid flick, and at 167 minutes (the 70mm extended version lasting 187 minutes and including an intermission) the theatrical cut of this leisurely-paced western, which largely takes place in one room and a stagecoach, is a slow burning treat to be sure. Those with a high tolerance threshold for Tarantino's trademark pretentiousness are likely to enjoy on a much deeper level, as he pushes his (once again eminently quotable) dialogue to controversy-sparking extremes in purposely protracted conversations. That these prolonged scenes never bore are testament not only to QT's innate ability for razor sharp and uniquely-delivered dialogue, but also to his unsurpassed skill for producing memorable characters both on paper and, through his keen eye for casting, on the screen. The pick of the bunch is a four-way tie: Russell's John ""the Hangman"" Ruth is both tender and tough, Jackson's Major Warren is endearing and vicious, Walton Goggin's Sheriff Mannix is excitable and wormy, and Jennifer Jason Leigh (nominated for an Oscar) is rough as guts and just a little deranged as captured crim Daisy Domergue. As a once-proposed sequel to Django Unchained there's a similarity in tone and atmosphere to QT's previous movie, which is a small shame considering the usually drastic changes in setting and genre we have come to expect movie-to-movie. It's hard to complain about that too much though, especially when we're treated to Robert Richardson's sumptuous cinematography of a blizzard-encountering post-Civil War Wyoming and Ennio Morricone's Golden Globe-winning score that harks back to his classic spaghetti western scores of the 1960s. Sitting in the bottom half of his ridiculously impressive and consistent body of work, The Hateful Eight isn't the film that will garner Tarantino new fans, yet for everyone else this just another reason why the ultra-talented filmmaker is one of the finest of his generation."

","The Hateful Eight is a Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. While it's not quite on par with some of his better movies, it's still a worthy entry into Tarantino's expanding filmography. It's filled with all the directorial trademarks one would expect from his movies.<br/><br/>During the cold winter of Wyoming, some time after the American Civil War, a bounty hunter and his prisoner take shelter in a cabin with a group of strangers to avoid an oncoming blizzard. Throughout the course of the night, an awkward tension starts to build as it becomes evident that not everyone is who they claim to be.<br/><br/>This film contains all of the typical Quentin Tarantino movie elements. It has brutal violence, dry one liners and some creative cinematography. Samuel L. Jackson once again gives a memorable and bad-ass performance, as do Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. My only real gripe with the film was that the pacing at the beginning was very slow. I guess it was to showcase the tense atmosphere building up, but I feel that this could have been accomplished through alternate means. Overall, if you're a fan of Tarantino's work, then I recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10."
"therebeccadorn","8","4","12","20 January 2016"," Reservoir Dogs in the snow
","Tarantino has delivered yet another fast paced action movie, this time in the style of a modern Western set in the snowy mountains. It really echoed the film that made Tarantino famous - Reservoir Dogs. The main story is set in a bar, the crossroads of many a different characters fate in the style of a whodunnit but this time framed as a ""Who is the enemy"". <br/><br/>What Tarantino does well it deliver a simple idea so effectively and Hateful Eight is no different. It keeps your attention, builds the suspense and has all the swear words and gore you can expect from a Tarantino film."
"PrashunChakraborty","8","4","12","20 January 2016"," Django Unchained meets Reservoir Dogs
","To start off, I will say I really liked this movie because I am a big Tarantino fan. It has every thing you might expect out of a Tarantino film, great dialogue, non linear chapters, copious amount of violence which is oddly funny at times, overthetop acting which goes with a movie of this type and of course has some epic scenes bearing Tarantino's stamp. The movie reminds me a lot of Reservoir Dogs (my favorite Tarantino film) i.e. there is just a single set and most of the events of the movie take place on it and the main theme of the film is a whodunit mystery. There some great outdoor scenes as well but I think they accounted for about twenty minutes or so in the three hour epic(yes it's that long). Speaking of long I must say the editing could have been better to make the film shorter and sharper. Also since there was just a single set, this won't be the premiere movie you think of when you think of Tarantino's visual mark, he had less to work with. Another criticism that may be made is that Tarantino took very less risk with the film, he is clearly in the safe Django Unchained mode of his last film and has arguably not innovated anything as far as this film is concerned, not that I mind it too much. Other stand out features include great music by legendary Ennio Morricone, all the Tarantino regulars and the newcomers are great as well but Samuel L Jackson is the standout and gives perhaps the best performance of his career since Pulp Fiction, and is the part of the best scene of the film and almost steals the entire show."
"darkknight3993-1","8","4","12","19 January 2016"," Going back to the 1960's to go back to the 1860's
","When Tarantino's The Hateful Eight script leaked onto the internet a couple years back, he swore in the heat of his rage that he would deny his viewers the right to see it played out on film. I'm glad that he eventually came around and decided to create this remarkable cinematic experience. <br/><br/>It was obvious from the very start of the film that Tarantino and co. were aiming to recreate the films of old, using the Ultra Panavision 70 camera to shoot ultra wide screen pictures, and using an overwhelmingly rich six track sound system to emulate the great western soundtracks of old. Ennio Marricone is back with the soundtrack for this film, and he delivers on a stronger note than his previous efforts with Tarantino. The sound and imagery immediately threw me back to an era of film that I was never alive to witness. If you have a theater anywhere near you that's playing this film in the original 70 mm print, I highly recommend seeing it that way over a scaled down digital version. The tools used to create this film truly enhance every other aspect.<br/><br/>The film itself treads familiar ground for Tarantino, after mastering the old western aesthetic in Django, he uses it again to craft the charming little Minnie's Haberdashery in which most of the plot unfolds. The attention to detail in the inn is noteworthy; since about half of the tiny cabin can be seen in any given shot because of the wide camera lens, each item around the set adds some kind of artistic value to the setting as a whole. There are times in the story in which certain elements of the setting come into play in the most unexpected way. Without having to think too hard, I was enraptured by the plot and the acting of each of these Tarantino acting alumni (bar a couple new members). Each of the eight brought something completely different to the table, and delivered wholeheartedly. The limited space combined with the excellent script really brought this play-like film to life.<br/><br/>Except for a couple of pacing issues, and some strange directorial decisions, I personally thought this was one of Tarantino's strongest efforts. He may claim that the script just writes itself, but the level of cinematic detail that his team produced for this movie is worth the price of admission. Block out a full day, time travel back to the 60's, find a theater that supports the 70mm film, and enjoy."

","In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive?<br/><br/>Most of us were raised to believed that cowboys were men of few words, but Quentin Tarantino is out to prove otherwise with this film. He delivers once again, a film with icy cold dialogue, amazing sequences of people talking back and forth; the movie is roughly three hours long and so old fashioned. It's difficult to lock this film down a genre, much like many Tarantino's movies and here it is what makes this film brilliant. <br/><br/>Snowed in together like Agatha Christie characters in a country house, here characters must face a plot unlike any Christie's story - but very much like, say, Reservoir Dogs - in which there is no notional authority figure to exert control over everyone. The only authority is violence and superior firepower. In this film as well as in Reservoir Dogs: the idea of being in unbearable pain from a gunshot wound, but still talking and still being a threat is present. Samuel L. Jackson is definitely Oscar worthy in this film, every scene in which he has a monologue is perfect. It might be his best work since Pulp Fiction and I genuinely mean that. He never get a monologue of such awesome calibre here, Quentin Tarantino did give him some of the best lines. Plus, it's great to see Tim Roth back on a Tarantino movie. Kurt Russell is fabulous: funny, likable, a total badass and Walton Goggins gives a hilarious experience.<br/><br/>There's no denying Tarantino's been down this road before, when he reheated the Spaghetti Western to such spectacular effect in Django Unchained. The use of location is perfect. It is such a claustrophobic movie, all actions are centred in one place. You are isolated and you feel like you are in this cabin, everything is cold (except the coffee), you feel the location. Tarantino's treatment makes this film epic. To be sure this film looks grand. The mountainous landscapes and snowfall of the opening reels have a dense splendour. Quentin Tarantino dusted off the Ultra Panavision 70 format used on epics cinema legends such as The Greatest Story Ever Told or How the West Was Won and he put those vintage lenses to curious use. The real test of Tarantino's decision to shoot in 70 mm comes inside, as it raises the question of what advantage a super-wide screen format serves when the drama is mostly limited to one room? Plus, to eyes young enough not to remember luxuriating movies like Ben-Hur, shot in the brilliance of Ultra Panavision 70. The Hateful Eight offers a genuinely different sort of experience? Anyone who loves great images on the big screen will appreciate the movie. Its hefty running time (the 70 mm version clocks a thrilling 187 minutes, including overture and intermission) should appeal mainly to cinephiles. Tarantino manages to stretch the suspense as far as it can possibly go, he withholds the first bullet until roughly the 100 minute mark. He even insinuates himself just after the intermission narrating what transpired during the break and introducing a twist, whereby someone poisoned the coffee while the audiences were restocking on popcorn. Finally, Tarantino's use of music, like his choice of shooting formats, marks a dramatic break from the rest of his oeuvre. This film does include an original score by Ennio Morricone, who you may know from everything basically. He's one of the most famous composer who ever lived - equal to my personal favourite John Williams. Tarantino has creatively recycled existing songs and score, while giving them such accuracy that they may as well have been written for him.<br/><br/>Overall, Quentin Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film. Everything about this movie screams 1960's style: the score, the wide screen and the look. Tarantino still got it. I utterly enjoyed seeing some of the actors on the screen delivering amazing performances with great dialogues."

","Quentin Tarantino's 8th film, The Hateful Eight, is an expose on hatred, in its various guises, cleverly crafted in the form of a cinematic allegory. Why we hate, both individually and collectively, is rendered on the big screen for our consideration. For the sake of brevity, I'll explain by assigning each of the film's protagonists to one of the infamous Seven Deadly Sins, with one notable exception, to follow. My justifications should be sufficiently simple enough to warrant no further discussion. Our first protagonist, The Hangman, brilliantly portrayed by Kurt Russell, represents Greed. We are soon introduced to Wrath, personified in brutal detail by Samuel L. Jackson, as The Bounty Hunter. Pride, The Sheriff is well represented by Walton Goggins. Sloth, The Confederate, played by Bruce Dern, is perhaps the easiest deadly sin to recognize. We also have Envy; The Little Man (Tim Roth), Gluttony; The Cowpuncher (Michael Madsen), and lastly, Lust; The Mexican (Demian Bichir). But wait a minute, one might say, what about the eighth protagonist, The Prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh)? The Prisoner represents how we allow ourselves to become prisoner to our own fears and prejudices, leading us down the path towards hatred. There are also supporting characters, which could be said to represent the collateral damage the practice of hating surely incurs. The Hateful Eight is not for everyone, but it is a must see for Quentin Tarantino fans. It is aptly cast and the performances are very solid. The Cinematography is breathtaking, and the soundtrack is epic. Perhaps most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously; those who do not enjoy this movie surely will."

","Hmm, I don't know what the people who have given this 1s and 2s were watching (or smoking), but 'The Hateful Eight' deserves at least half marks based on the dialogue, acting and cinematography alone, all of which were first class. To completely write a film off and give it 1 star because the story didn't meet your expectations is just stupid.<br/><br/>Tarantino's latest film is predictably violent and, perhaps even more predictably, long. Most of this three hour movie is set in one location, and yet the dialogue and relationship between the characters is plenty enough to keep it entertaining. I've sat through films half the running time that felt longer than this.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' does too many things too well to be disregarded, as it has been by many.

"brando647","8","3","8","4 December 2016"," Absurdly Violent with Fantastic Over-the-Top Performances
","During production on THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to retire after he's completed ten films. That is probably the saddest cinematic news I've heard, especially since this marks his eighth film (he counts KILL BILL as one, thankfully) and it means he may only have two more left. Tarantino movies are an event for me. I get more excited for the release of one of his films than any other director or franchise out there. For the first time ever, I was even able to partake in a film's special event coinciding with its release. Roadshows and limited releases generally don't happen too close to my town (unless I feel like driving two hours to Orlando) so when I found out the roadshow cut of THE HATEFUL EIGHT would be playing relatively close, meaning only one hour away, I was ecstatic. I drove out to that theater just late enough to miss the showing I'd aimed for and gladly sat in my car for three hours in the parking lot of that theater (I'd recently been by a bookstore so I had some reading material to keep me sane) until the next showing because it was a Tarantino film. It was worth it. I got the souvenir program issued with the showing, got to enjoy the full experience with the overture, intermission, and additional footage, and I was able to mingle with fellow Tarantino enthusiasts who were just as thrilled to be there. It was a fantastic time.<br/><br/>That being said, how was the movie? It was great but it wasn't one of his top tier films; it fails to reach the levels of PULP FICTION, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, or DJANGO UNCHAINED. It has a few pacing issues. Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson were so proud of the gorgeous western landscape footage, covered in snow and shot in beautiful 70mm, that we get long shots of just the landscape at times to let us soak it all in. The story is also a bit thin so there's a lot of padding in the form of long scenes included just to add more flavor to the proceedings, like the characters putting out a guideline between the haberdashery and the outhouse at the onset of the blizzard. We sit on that scene for what feels like an unnecessary amount of time but I don't hate it because it just reinforces the old west atmosphere with a reminder of how rough and inhospitable life could be. None of that matters to me though because it's part of the experience in his films. He's a cinema nut and he loves to have fun with his work; no one's going to tell him what to do or what not to do. He has a vision in mind and he intends on delivering that vision to the audience to share in it with him. It's exactly why people like me drive to a theater farther away, so we can get that full experience when opportune.<br/><br/>My quibbles with THE HATEFUL EIGHT are all minor and they're drowned out by pretty much everything else in the film. It's a Tarantino film and you get everything you'd hope and expect to find. Questionable characters. Sharp, often crude or unsettling, dialogue. Larger than life performances. And those strange bombastic genre touches he loves to toss in. The cast is phenomenal and loaded with familiar Tarantino collaborators, with some new ones tossed in. No one really steals the show because everyone is bringing their absolute best and having fun, but if I had to point out the highlights it'd probably be Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins. And Demián Bechir as Bob the Mexican. He almost borders on caricature but he steals scenes with his bizarre performance. Honestly, the only person who didn't outright blow me away was Michael Madsen and that's because he was sort of just doing his usual: narrowed eyes, few words, and an obvious threat despite the fact the movie is supposed to be a bit of a mystery as to who can be trusted and who can't. He stands out as a hidden enemy the moment you meet him on screen but it doesn't matter much because no one in this movie can be trusted. Every character trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery has darkness in their past and a real mean streak. The fun is in learning about each of them and watching them interact with each other as the time rolls on and we approach the inevitable breaking point for this tense standoff. This is why THE HATEFUL EIGHT, despite not being Tarantino's strongest film, is almost mesmerizing for me. You sit me down in front of it and I'm not moving until it's over. Tarantino fans will certainly find something to love in THE HATEFUL EIGHT but others might be put off by the pacing, the racial undertones (it's set soon after the end of the Civil War), and the mounds of Tarantino dialogue filling it out before the action explodes. Frankly, I don't care. I'm just excited we get at least two more and remain hopeful he'll rescind his decision to retire so we get Tarantino films for years to come."

","After the war, O.B. is driving a stagecoach to Red Rock, Wyoming carrying bounty hunter John 'Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his $10k quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They stop for Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is stuck in the middle of nowhere with his three dead bounties. Next, the group picks up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock. Warreb and Mannix clash over their separate war exploits. The group seeks shelter from a snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery. Minnie and Sweet Dave are gone and Bob (Demián Bichir) claims to be in charge. There are passengers from an earlier coach. Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is the hangman going to Red Rock. Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowboy. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a former confederate.<br/><br/>This is actually more like an Agatha Christie movie except Quentin Tarantino has his own special blood-splattering foul-mouthed ways to resolve the mystery. He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play. Tarantino fans should not be disappointed."

","I am a huge Tarantino and Samuel L Jackson fan which is why I decided i should watch this movie with my boyfriend. The movie in itself was OK. Great cast and flawless performance which made the movie watchable after the first 15 or so minutes, and the ending was awesome. However this could easily have been shrunk down into a 2 hour movie and saved us a lot of the nonsense, make no point nothingness that most of the scenes actually were about. I doubt I will ever watch it again. maybe would recommend it to a friend that didn't lead a busy life and actually had 3 hours to sit thru a 1.5 hour movie but overall it was far from Tarantino's best work.<br/><br/>my first review so I checked off spoiler cause I am not sure what the spoiler alert covers. so if this contains no spoilers then OK least I won't get banned lol"
"classicsoncall","9","3","8","29 April 2016"," ""Well, I guess I should be plumb scared right now, huh?""
","There was an interesting observation made by the character Mobray (Tim Roth) in the story when he began to speak about justice. He stated that justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice. Which was somewhat ironic considering Tarantino's ragging on policemen about the time this movie came out; not too much dispassion in his ranting when it comes to singling out a profession made impossibly difficult by politicizing their every move. With that, one would expect that my attitude about the film would be negative, but I actually get a kick out of Tarantino's pictures and this was no exception. I liked the set up, the story, the cinematography and the principal players, well cast for their roles and for the dynamic each one of them brings to the picture. I also go for the quirky unexpected stuff, like the nailing of Minnie's door shut to keep out the blizzard, the revelation that Minnie herself was a black woman (didn't see that coming at all), and the hell's bell's reaction of Walton Goggins' character in the story's resolution. I must be getting used to Tarantino's pictures by now because except for a handful of times, I didn't really even hear the 'n' word that so many reviewers here say surpassed it's use in ""Django Unchained"". But for all of that, I think Quentin needs to develop some new ideas because they're becoming decidedly repetitious in his pictures. There's the racist thing, the buckets of blood, the severed body parts, the repeated casting of various players (Jackson, Madsen, etc.) and the sexual depravity meant to intentionally shock. You know, maybe offer up a look at a topic while remaining dispassionate."

","Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! While I enjoy most Tarentino films this one is by far my favorite!!! A well written and directed western ""whodunit"" with mindful clues throughout. I loved the suspenseful opening and intermission! The overture added a sense of anxiousness, not knowing what's to come or what to expect and the intermission left me wanting more, more, and MORE! The acting was superb! Jackson and Russell are a given, but Goggins stole the show and Bichir entertained famously! I felt like I was there, like I was sent back in time.

","Sometimes it seems like this movie is a spoof on westerns. But it isn't. In fact, it's not even a western. True, the story is set in the It contains the cultural trappings of the old west - stagecoach, remote and desolate landscape, horses. But it's about people, namely the people depicted in this movie. They are complex and their actions intense. Thus, this is an intense movie. The story is actor-driven. This means that if the acting is not excellent, the story will fail as a work of drama. In this case, the acting is excellent and often superb. There are eight principal characters in the story. Each character has a story. Each is trying to survive and get over on the other. To find out more details, one must watch the movie. Samuel L. Jackson delivers another dominating performance. However, Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is a show stealer. She holds her own in what is otherwise a male-dominated story. The rest of cast is excellent too. If you like movies with intense stories, this movie is for you."

","Personally I had a great time watching Hateful 8. <br/><br/>Part western, part Agatha Christie whodunnit, the movie is best viewed as a graphic novel or as some have commented as a stage play. <br/><br/>I think what surprised me the most was just how funny it was. Sure QT is no stranger to putting humour into his movies but I found myself chortling along to the vast majority of film.<br/><br/>And the comedy fits and never detracts with what's going on on- screen or overshadow QT's dark views on race relations or lack thereof in the U.S's past and present.<br/><br/>The performances are fantastic, especially those of Jackson and Goggins. The fact that Goggins in particular was not honoured or at least nominated at the Golden Globes is a real shame. His is a multi-layered performance of a character that enjoys one of the most interesting arcs of the film and Goggins plays it to a tee.<br/><br/>My only quibble with it is that it lacked suspense, which is a fairly major thing when you're creating a mystery/thriller of this kind. <br/><br/>Morricone's brilliant score set the tone of a dark fantasy thriller western (think High Plains Drifter) but the film never lives up to the promise.<br/><br/>Other than that, it was a brilliant slow burn to a really fantastic blood soaked climax.<br/><br/>I would say that while Inglorious and Django were more balanced films in terms of dialogue and action, Hateful was in its way a better movie because of the depth of the script.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a thrill ride, this ain't it. If you want a brilliant crafted script with exceptional performances that actually makes you think then QT's latest is for you."
"kieranbattams","10","5","17","9 January 2016"," Tarantino is back folks.. that's all you need to know
","Quentin Tarantino is among the finest of filmmakers working today, i would go as far as to say Tarantino is the best director of all time. I will keep the description of this film vague because i went in vague and i was hugely surprised at the outcome. We follow two bounty hunters played by Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell who meet by chance during a blizzard. We also have Jennifer Jason Leigh who is a prisoner that is being taken to her death to be hung. They take refuge in a cabin whilst the blizzard dies out with 6 other strangers. So you now have these 8 characters and we are left to unravel the mystery within.<br/><br/>Do not go into this film expecting a fast paced western, in fact don't even go in expecting to see something similar to Django Unchained because this is very different. As a fan of Tarantino i knew that we would be given a lot of dialogue, the dialogue here is so captivating that it puts you right in this time period with these characters. But when something happens.. oh boy it becomes a tense thrillride. There is one scene in particular towards the end, where i literally rose to the end of my seat because i had no clue as to who was going to make it out alive. I like films where you don't know what is around the corner and where you have to keep guessing even when a scene is happening. The Hateful 8 is no exception.<br/><br/>What i also like is where you have a cast of characters that you at times want to root for, but who are also unlikable. Literally none of the characters we face are likable.. they have all done terrible things. Kurt Russell in this film is a mega douche but does his job so well and Jennifer Jason Leigh is a character who you really want to dislike but can't. It was nice to see Samuel L Jackson in this film as the main character, if there were a ""hero"" it would be him, but he has still done things that are terrible. Tim Roth for me was a real standout, he is the most likable, but is so shady at the same time.<br/><br/>In the end, what can i say, it's Tarantino. He takes these situations and throws us right into the mix. It was captivating, fun and gruesome. The last act is pure Tarantino blood and guts carnage, but for all the right reasons. The soundtrack was one of the best I've heard in recent years, especially the opening track which continues throughout the film and you can see where 70mm film is used because it also has a very unique look about it. It proved itself as the best film of 2015 next to the Force Awakens and i highly recommend anyone who loves film see it. I can't wait to see what Tarantino throws at us next."
"rmahler1","10","8","32","4 January 2016"," A Tarantino stage play
","Personally, I thought this movie was yet another Tarantino classic. The dialog is as crisp and clever and sprawling as it is in his other movies, and the characters are just a blast. Make no mistake -- this is a fun movie even at three hours. My entire family ventured out for the 70mm roadshow experience. While I enjoyed the movie, I have to admit that I didn't really see much of a difference in the 70mm presentation. I don't know if that's a product of having seen it on a less than optimal screen, or perhaps I just didn't see much of a difference. Certainly, it did not detract from the experience. If you like Tarantino's other films, you'll enjoy how this hearkens back to Reservoir Dogs in that the story is mostly contained in one location and therefore relies entirely on its excellent dialog and characters to unfold the story. Go see this. I highly recommend it."

But not this movie. Nope, Tarantino is pure genius when it comes to dialogue. This was a brilliant and entertaining film all the way through. Every member of the audience laughed during the jokes, and I felt was entertained as I was. A great movie with great dialogue, perfect casting of thoroughly professional actors come together for the perfect mix of gritty western suspense. <br/><br/>If you like movies like Reservoir Dogs, and you like a good gritty western, I think you will thoroughly enjoy the movie."

","Just saw the 70mm roadshow version last night and it was AMAZING! The experience that goes along with the movie (overture, intermission, little gift) was something that i personally think, everyone should experience and, this is the way to see this movie. <br/><br/>I was skeptical at first reading some reviews with people complaining that it was too long and dragged and was too violent but its not true. Its your typical Tarantino film. Yes, it is 3 hours long but it doesn't feel that long at all. Its all about patience and its entertaining dialogue with amazing acting that sets up the last three chapters perfectly. No one in the theater complained about the length and i think the intermission comes at a perfect time. As for the violence, typical Tarantino. Shots to the heads, overkills, etc. There is one scene at the end of chapter that gets you off guard with how messed up it is but it perfectly sets up the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>In general, the first three chapters are just a big guessing game. Dialogue heavy, introducing characters with stories that might or might not be true which causes suspenseful interactions. Then, the last three chapters, all hell breaks loose and no one can do it better than Tarantino himself. Walton Goggins is the star in this movie. Honestly, i don't see all the hate its getting. I guess people cant sit through a well written movie. Once the movie was over, it got a standing ovation.<br/><br/>Definitely going to go see it again!!"
"whytryharder","6","7","27","25 December 2015"," QT far from what we know Identity meets the usual suspects and almost ends up as a Mansion mystery
","Tarantino has a wild reputation for being the director known for non-linear stories, asymmetric character development through verbiages, radical to moderate to liberal characters all in one frame kind of cinema that has kept us, at least me, entertained since reservoir dogs.<br/><br/>He can be easily distinguished from his way of imagining things, artwork, the old school ways of instilling you with sense of unease, which work damn good every time. His last western, Django Unchained, was a roller coaster ride of revenge saga of a slave with help of his suave, smooth talking partner, which Tarantino seems to be desperately missed while filming the Hateful Eight. <br/><br/>A group of different people are stuck in a blizzard and have to take shelter at a Passover called Minnie's haberdashery. They can't leave until the storm subdues. One of them isn't what he or she claims to be. And then begins the tale of deception, thrill, flashbacks, excessively verbose but crucial dialogues, few intense moments, with mansion mystery style flavor added (like revealing something taking place now, in the flashback, with narrative explaining what's going on) which kind of makes it a good watch – unless you are a Tarantino fan. I have never assumed Tarantino to be this obvious storyteller. Always I have watched his movies with my own theories and I was so glad he blew them out each time with his own set. I expected his films to surprise me, they rather blew me. Not this time. In short, this film is nothing like what you expect QT to throw at you. More like Ridley Scott or one of those directors whose movie got critical acclaim for god knows what reason. There are hardly any surprises, storyline is predictable, violence is nowhere to be seen albeit in few places. Ruthless, unrelenting atmosphere that he usually creates, doesn't really gets at peak. Every QT flick has a sequence that is remembered for ages to come: Ear ripping off on chair, post robbery carnage in Reservoir Dogs, Climax with Mexican standoff, self-realization of Jules in Pulp fiction The long take in Kill Bill, final battle (this entire series is remarkable) Astounding opening to Inglorious Bastards (probably one of the greatest opening scenes of all time), Bar standoff, when French girl actually meets her family's annihilator, Redemption of Django and his deeds as a free 'slave' in Django Unchained, confrontation post 'D is silent' scene and finale <br/><br/>I may have missed plenty of scenes here, but point being each one of his movies have some scenes which have immense repeat watch value. Hateful Eight itself is a cumbersome movie, with even more tedious character development and draggy first half that leaves little to no scope in the room for unpredictability or remarkability. The premise isn't something which we haven't seen before, and add on to that, Tim Roth's impersonation both in terms of appearance and speech, starkly reminded me of Christopher Waltz's suave mannerisms in Django Unchained, which kinda made me wonder the purpose of it. There are no catchy dialogues, no worthy one liners which I could keep note of, maybe there were, I missed to take note of them. <br/><br/>Second half does some justice to compensate the first half's boring prologues, but it fails to get a grip over the entire play, by the time it climaxes and to explain several questions and give out answers to them. *********SPOILERS START: Skip this section if you haven't seen the movie********* Why kill entire haberdashery's staff than to ask them to either go along with the play, or get the hell out in the stagecoach? Which one of the spiked the coffee? Joe says he did, but that is unclear given his seating from the coffee jug and the POV we get to see the hands and wide angle take at Domergogue's face? Snow after unprecedented blizzard will melt out in two days? How sure they could be? If her fifteen men are awaiting her arrival at red neck, and waiting for snow to clear out in two days (but hello? They plan to stay in Passover for two days, right?) why interrupt them in the middle of nowhere? Why not catch them by throats when they arrive in full force? Why cross swords with those who have got nothing to do with you? *********SPOILERS END: Carry on reading here onwards************<br/><br/>Summing it up, this movie is great only if it weren't from Tarantino's stable. You certainly feel like missing many typical elements of a Tarantino flick, especially after last two glorious movies he churned out. Only the most ardent fans of QT will not be disappointed, for haters, it's the easiest pick after deathproof and for appreciators of QT, like me, are certainly in for a disappointment."
"vangelovkasey","10","10","43","31 December 2015"," One of his best
","Don't listen to the other reviews, this was a great movie and exactly what should be expected based on what Tarantino said. The first half of the movie was all buildup with great dialogue and beautiful cinematography; the 70mm shots gave a great feel to talking scenes, bringing to life the dialogue, as promised. There is not as much action in the film as Django, Kill Bill, and Inglorious Basterds, and while I love that, it's nice to see him brining back the witty buildup his earlier films had. It was more like a play, similar to Resivoir Dogs, and I'm anticipating the stage version Tarantino said he's working on. If you are expecting an action packed Western like Django, you totally misread the hype Tarantino was building up for this film. It may be long and not 'flashy', but there is plenty of action in the words and the faces of the actors. Nothing was acted poorly in this film. This is the type of movie you have to pay attention to and appreciate it for what it is, don't get frustrated that it's not paced like his last three movies. No character is particularly likable, but they are all equally as intriguing and fun to listen to. And when the violence breaks out, he filmed it in a way I've never seen before."
"jboothmillard","8","6","22","18 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight
","When I heard about this film, the eighth from director and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated writer Quentin Tarantino, and having watched his first proper western with his previous film, Django Unchained, I was most excited to see another offering of the same genre. Basically a few years after the Civil War, three dead bounties are being transported to Red Rock, Wyoming by bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), he hitches a ride on a stagecoach that is travelling to avoid a snow blizzard. The stagecoach is being driven by a man named O.B Jackson (James Parks), also travelling to Red Rock, inside is bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell), who always brings his criminals alive to watch them hang, handcuffed to him is fugitive Daisy Domergue (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jennifer Jason Leigh). Ruth is suspicious of anyone trying to steal his bounty, he and Warren bond over a personal letter from President Abraham Lincoln, on the journey they also pick up former Lost-Causer militiaman Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. The group is forced to stop during the snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge, they are greeted by Mexican stranger Bob (Demián Bichir), who claims owner Minnie has left him in charge so she can visit her mother. The other lodgers inside are British Red Rock hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), quiet cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) who claims to be heading to see his mother, and former Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a suspicious Ruth disarms all but Warren. The group settle to eat, hearing of a Warren's Lincoln letter Marrix speculates that it is a forgery, Warren admits it is and helps him get things, including rides, Ruth is outraged. Warren then approaches Smithers, placing a gun next to him and provoking him into reaching for it telling him that he sexually humiliated and killed Smithers' son, Warren shoots and kills him first, in lawful self-defence, as revenge for Smithers executing black soldiers at the Battle of Baton Rouge. Everyone is distracted by the confrontation, Domergue is the only person to witness someone poisoning the brewing coffee, Ruth and O.B. drink it, then moments later vomit blood and collapse, dying Ruth attacks Domergue, but she grabs his gun and kills him. Warren disarms Domergue and leaves her cuffed to Ruth's corpse, he and Mannix, who Warren trusts because he avoided drinking the poisoned coffee, hold all the men at gunpoint, they want to deduce who did the poisoning and who is not who they say they are. Bob, who had an alibi for the poisoning, is deduced as an impostor who killed the original lodge owners and he is executed. Warren threatens to kill Domergue to take her bounty, but Gage reveals himself as the poisoner, then all of the sudden a man hiding in the cellar shoots Warren in the groin, and Mobray draws a concealed gun and shoots Mannix, he returns fire and wounds Mannix, and Gage is forced against the wall. A flashback from earlier in the day reveals that Bob, Mobray, Gage and a fourth man, Jody (Channing Tatum), arrived at Minnie's Haberdashery, killed everyone apart from Smithers, Jody reveals himself to be Domergue's brother, he strikes a deal with Smithers to spare him, the bandits dispose of the bodies, hide the evidence, and hide guns around the lodge, Smithers agrees to keep quiet while Jody hides in the cellar. Seriously wounded Warren and Mannix hold Domergue, Gage and dying Mobray at gunpoint, Jody is flushed out of the cellar when they threaten to kill Domergue, Warren kills him. Domergue angered claims more of her brother's men are waiting in Red Rock, they will kill Mannix and ransack the town, she tries to make a deal with Mannix that if he kills Warren and lets her escape, the gang will spare him and let him claim the bounties of the deceased. Domergue and Mobray taunt Warren, he shoots Domergue in the foot and Mobray in the leg, Mobray dies from his wounds, Gage draws a hidden revolver, but is shot dead by Warren and Mannix, Warren is out of bullets when he tries to shoot Domergue. Mannix calls Domergue's bluff, rejecting her alliance, he faints from blood loss, Domergue hacks off Ruth's handcuffed arm to free herself, she reaches for Mannix's gun, but he regains consciousness and wounds her, Warren and Mannix work together to tie a noose round Domergue's neck and pull to hang her from the rafters, in Ruth's honour, as the two men lie dying Mannix reads aloud Warren's forged Lincoln letter. Also starring Dana Gourrier as Minnie Mink, Zoë Bell as Six-Horse Judy, Lee Horsley as Ed, Gene Jones as Sweet Dave, Keith Jefferson as Charly and Craig Stark as Chester Charles Smithers, with Quentin Tarantino narrating. The performances are all spot on, Jackson and Russell as the bounty hunters, Roth and Madsen among the bandits, Tatum as the nasty surprise guest, and Leigh is splendid as the mad wanted female criminal. I can see the comparison to Reservoir Dogs, with eight strangers brought together, bounty hunters, outlaws, lawmen and soldiers, it is not as action packed as Django was, it is very dialogue heavy, and a little slow-burning at times, but it has plenty of hard-hitting moments, especially the high level of brutality and blood spill, it has fantastic music from original Spaghetti Western composer Ennio Morricone, and it does keep you watching, a satisfying violent western mystery. It won the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Music, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Very good!"
"blaynebittner","10","6","22","7 January 2016"," Different from the usual Quentin Tarintino film: While very brutal, makes great use of subtle figures of speech.
","This is my favorite Quentin Tarintino film since Pulp Fiction. Its quite violent and sadistic, but not without a point.<br/><br/>People ask why people are still going on about racism in movies and showing all of this; it is because all of this racism still goes on to this day even if its not as apparent in our individual community.<br/><br/>For some Quentin Tarintino fans, the movie may feel too slow especially for the first half. One thing Quentin Tarintino did in writing and directing this that I've rarely seen him do so well is make use of more subtle figures of speeches.<br/><br/>Though there were very graphic parts as with all of his films. There were also parts where he implied things instead of just showing them which I felt added to the intensity of the plot.<br/><br/>A lot of people used to Quentin Tarintino's previous films may find the slower parts of the movie a lot more boring. However, if you pay attention, the subtlety leading up to the heavy parts shown actually makes the movie.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarintino just takes a different approach than he usually does. While some people probably felt bored or walked away or snored, they should have paid attention. I think a lot of people bored by their first watch of this movie should give it a second watch.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarintino has never been the most subtle of directors. However, I am impressed by his use of juxtaposition and dramatic irony that I've never seen him personally use as well.<br/><br/>You'll have to pardon me if I'm being vague as I write my reviews spoiler-less. I'm not pretending to be a professional, but I like to say something if I believe my side has not been told.<br/><br/>This is a movie with layers of symbolism. Watching it a second and a third time, like Fight Club, you'll notice more and more interesting and subtle things about it.<br/><br/>While I am not going to get into exact details, this movie is not only ballsy because of its content, but because Quentin Tarintino and some of the actors in the film stepped out of their comfort zone and performed amazingly.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarintino should receive an Academy award for directing this film. I also believe that some of the actors at least deserve a nomination.<br/><br/>The cinematography was more simple at first glance than his usual film, but simplicity that was put to great use.<br/><br/>This movie still isn't a movie for the faint of heart. It talks about very tough issues that will offend a lot of people. The Hateful Eight is not only controversial in content, but in its unique delivery.<br/><br/>I'm going to rate this a 9.5/10 and vote a 10 rounded up. There are VERY few movies including his that I would rate this high.<br/><br/>People who are complaining about this movie that its too brutal should have watched Reservoir Dogs. To be honest, there wasn't a scene in this that compared to some scenes in Reservoir Dogs or some of his other films.<br/><br/>The point is that Quentin Tarintino made something completely new. Its not his usual film, and it shows a maturing and developing director. The Hateful Eight makes me look forward to more experiments by Quentin Tarintino as its obvious that he is not creative in just one way.<br/><br/>While the cast and director are obvious stars of the show. To someone who knows the industry a little bit (not a pro), I can also see that the co-directing is spot on. Its obvious that the director didn't slack and allow everything to be done in one shot.<br/><br/>People love the TV show Gotham, yet the script in that show pales in comparison to The Hateful Eight. Despite the swearing, its not much more offensive than the content in Gotham or especially HBO shows like True Blood and alike.<br/><br/>People seem to be judging this movie based on Quentin Tarintino's previous work. IF you go into watching this movie expecting his usual, don't. While he does stick to his roots, he does something new and great.<br/><br/>People are often thinking that he tried to make another Django, but this is not at all the same.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Its a movie meant for adults, not kids. There's other movies made for kids like Star Wars. Adults are allowed to have their movies too.<br/><br/>Watching the whole movie to the end and thinking hard about it, it makes some great points about politics, society and war. It may be hard to chew, but its real.<br/><br/>This is one of Quentin Tarintino's best. I hope others enjoy it and give it a real chance like I did. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. As an amateur writer at best, this is mine.<br/><br/>9-10/10: Rare Gem."
"kennedyb143","3","4","13","11 December 2018"," Grow up Tarantino
","I am a big fan of the actors in this film. The middle of the movie becomes redundant with all the back and forth inside/outside confusion. I was offended by the violence towards the woman captive. The degradation and humiliation that Tarantino deemed appropriate to the movie content was unnecessary and borders on the approval of extreme violence towards women. I was disappointed in the actions of Mr. Russell and Mr.Jackson in agreeing to the degree of violence to be meted out to the female costar borders on sadistic behaviour. The constant battery was unnecessary to the story. Mr.Tarantino depends on twisting the parameters of shock value to help gather viewership. The content of this story is right up there with toilet humour."

","I just want to thank Q. Tarantino for bringing theatre on screen and make a play possible. It's the most beautiful western I've ever seen. <br/><br/>To all who didn't understand the movie, I suggest to start watching cinema finally not only crappy vampire stuff.<br/><br/>I loved every second of this film. And already waiting for a new project of his. Also there is no doubt that this director always brings quality in Hollywood pop cinematography industry. The way bounty hunter portrayed and the criminals / amazing work, and how the story unfolds... It's always a pleasure to watch how elegant and easily Tarantino puts together grotesque, theatre, drama, crime and mystery, how character are involved and connected. I'll definitely watch at least three times more because I always feel like his movies ending too soon..."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","9","4","13","6 February 2016"," This isn't Tarantino's best work, nor his most commercial, but is a great, twisty, suspenseful, hilarious film.
","Tarantino is one of my favorite directors and i love all his movies, and the hateful 8 is no exception. Though there are a few things to note:<br/><br/>Don't expect a Kill Bill, an Inglourious bastards or a Django, this is much more in line with Jackie Brown. Its 8 people in a room for 2 and a half hours. This doesn't mean that the film is less good, just that this is more about talk, mystery, suspense than adventure or action.<br/><br/>This is his longest film yet, with nearly 3 hours. If you really love Tarantino, time will fly, if you're not his biggest fan you may feel the length a bit, though the film is climatic, is designed to be a crescendo, where things get more intense each minute until the third act where things just explode, revelations are made and twists and turns are the stars. There are a scene or two that feel unnecessary, mainly because they feel a bit repetitive, not offering nothing interesting or fresh.<br/><br/>Many of his favorite actors are back, along with new additions like Channing Tatum and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The cast as you would expect, commits 300% to their roles, because its clear they love them, And with much reason, each character is more peculiar, inventive and interesting than the other. And make no mistake, they are the worst of the worst, there's no heroes, but you can find one that is less bad than the others. This is part of what i loved about the film, because as bad people they don't have limits, so they can do what they want, giving you one heck of a ride.<br/><br/>While Tarantino is the master of dialogue, this isn't his best work, as you feel that this isn't the best he can do, though of course this still means that the dialogue is outstanding. There's many lines throughout the film that are really hilarious, and the conversations between the characters are amazing.<br/><br/>This is not his most commercial film, not really, but i think it is his most straightforward one yet, either the story or dialogue. Anyone can enjoy this, and in fact i think this is also one o his most funny films, there's so much humour and moments that really make you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>There's plenty of explicit violence, as usual, and if you think that he just cant come up with more inventive and fresh violence, you're wrong, because many of the best parts of the film are thanks to the violence. <br/><br/>The cinematography is wonderful and the score is a killer, though the film doesn't use much of it.<br/><br/>This isn't Tarantino's best work, nor the best he can do, but is a really great, hilarious film, filled with twists and turns and unforgettable moments, characters and performances. Its classic Tarantino, with everything you would expect from him. It's surprising all the way until the end, is really a great film, and you have everything to enjoy it, just don't expect this to be an action film."

","I use IMDb a lot but for someone who sees around 200 movies a year I have written few reviews but when I do I always write the review before I look at what others have written. Then I look before I post. Now, having seen the slather of 'hateful' reviews I feel I must say more before posting. I think if any other director had made this movie the reviews would have been, in general, somewhat different. We should allow Quentin to make a non-Tarantino movie once in a while.<br/><br/>This is what I want to say: In this latest offering from Quentin Tarantino I give Quentin 10/10 for story telling. No standard formulas for our Quentin; he unlearned them a long way back. For the movie as a whole I was hanging back from a 10 because a section of exposition in the early going was somewhat drawn out, a little slow, verging on becoming static (here I agree with the 'slow' verdicts). However the overall atmospherics, the dialogue, the directing, the camera work settled into a satisfying pace and I, for one, failed to pick the twists and turns and didn't find myself becoming bored at any point even though most of the movie was set in one room; kind of like a stage play, but that didn't bother me (I had the same sense of being trapped by the storm as the characters did). I do agree it could have been shortened a little. But, overall, I enjoyed the movie and so did my wife. When it was over I figured QT deserved the extra point for doing his civic duty, economy wise, by keeping the fake blood manufacturers in business. I suspect this is one of those movies that gets panned initially but 'matures' with reflection. Probably not quite another ""Django Unchained"" - but 10 out of 10 from me."
"MattBrady099","8","4","13","4 February 2016"," The Hateful Eight - Movie Review
","Major Marquis Warren: ""Move a little strange, you're gonna get a bullet. Not a warning, not a question...A bullet!"".<br/><br/>The story is about a blizzards strands together a group of bounty hunters and ne'er-do-wells in a Wyoming cabin. But the small group is about to face a trail of betrayal and deception - and survival is certainly not guaranteed.<br/><br/>So I've finally got a chance to watch The Hateful Eight and I thought it was great. Mr. Tarantino has done it again everyone and while I don't think it's he's best one (In my opinion) but I would be lying to myself and to you if I didn't say I was entertained. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors working today and he hasn't lost his touch yet, because he's directing in this movie was both stylish and old school. What Tarantino dose so brilliantly well in his movies is not only the dialogue or the character's, but the influences from other movies that he loves, because he is one of the biggest movie buffs I've ever seen. In The Hateful Eight, Tarantino takes movies like: The Thing, Murder on the Orient Express and Clue, all in one movie but with a gory twist. Even with the trouble of making this movie (mostly the script being leaked online), Tarantino still manages to pull off one heck of a movie with top notch directing. <br/><br/>There's a lot of big name actors in this movie and every single one of them shine in their roles. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins and Tim Roth were all phenomenal, but Samuel L. Jackson was freaking outstanding and completely stole the show. Now after thinking about it, every single character in this movie is a horrible person and just imagine how hard it would have been for any writer to make us find enjoyment in theses character's, but that's what Quentin Tarantino is always best at doing. <br/><br/>Another thing that's worth bringing up is the score for this movie, as it's more than good, it's fantastic. Ennio Morricone is the master of music composers and he's score for this movie was freaking magnificent. After the movie was over I was humming the score, it was that good. I hope he wins Best Original Score at the Oscars, because he deserves it. <br/><br/>The cinematography was amazing (whenever they're not in a room), it was engaging and the movie did grow on me after awhile. <br/><br/>Now for the flaws: The character logic towards the end of the movie didn't really make that much sense to me, as it really detached from what the movie perfectly set up at the beginning, but that's just me.<br/><br/>When Zoe Bell character says that Auckland is New Zealand's biggest city. Auckland didn't become New Zealand's largest city until the 1900s, surpassing Dunedin. There's many other historical errors in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall The Hateful Eight is everything that you wanted in a Quentin Tarantino film. The dialogue was engaging, all of the performances were amazing and the score was just perfect."
"sntvcn","9","4","13","4 February 2016"," Tarantino's most sophisticated move to date
","The most sophisticated Tarantino movie is a western version of a psychological thriller. With a very slow building up of tension. Tarantino plays with the audience, outstandingly mixing suspense and awe. The constrained setting - the whole movie unfolds in one room - make you think of Hitchcock's Lifeboat. But, it is the whole toolkit of the great British Master on display here. Think of the use of characterization,dialogue, camera position. Even the cameos trademark. And, most relevantly, the use of an entertaining story to observe and discuss society. Tarantino is the most Hitchcockian of contemporary directors. The Hateful Eight is a true pleasure to watch,<br/><br/>It is easily the movie of 2015 which I enjoyed the most."

I loved the reveal that Tim Roth's character ""Oswaldo Mobray"" is actually 'English' Pete Hicox, A distant relative of my favorite character from Inglorious Basterds Lt. Archie Hicox. The music is another thing all together, Quentin choosing to abandon his style of using mostly non-original music to mostly original tracks by the great Ennio Morricone worked excellently. <br/><br/>And that's all I have to say about that."

"relysew-07152","9","4","13","30 January 2016"," Impatient, IQ-deficient idjits hate The Hateful Eight
","There are so many thinly rationalized negative reviews of this movie, it's no surprise Hollywood is going in the shitter to serve us clichéd turds and sequels upon sequels, dulling the senses, making as much money with as little risk as possible, and spitting in the face of originality and artistry. <br/><br/>Furthermore, after Tarantino's ""gratuitously"" violent-interspersed-with-witty-dialog films have invited so many accusations of predictability, he serves up one that depends predominantly on what the actors are saying and saves the buckets of blood for the end, and y'all are still complaining. (""Gratuitously"" is in quotation marks because I don't agree with that claim, but this review is about The Hateful Eight, not QT.)<br/><br/>I can see how this movie might be disappointing. Until you accept it for what it is, you wonder why you should find it interesting. It's different, and seems to move slowly, and the plot is shockingly simple. If you can lay all that as well as your expectations for a QT movie aside, these are the things to love about The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>The dialog, which again, is pretty much the entire movie, is brilliant. Hateful, but with just a touch of silliness that makes it all a comedy.<br/><br/>The actors' performances were all amazing. I always love to see Tim Roth, but the star in this film was, in my opinion, Walton Groggins. Honorable mentions go to Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>That brings me to the characters. It's not called The Hateful Eight for no reason. These are eight people trapped in a room in the middle of a blizzard in post-Civil War America, and not one of them has characteristics which redeem them. These are hateful, ignorant people, and though SLJ's character is probably meant to be for the message of the film, there isn't really a protagonist, at least not in the traditional sense of being the character you root for. <br/><br/>But if Jackson's Major Marquis Warren is the protagonist, it's only in order to focus the film onto a commentary of racial tension in the U.S., past and present. The n-word is naturally dropped over and over, and there are one bad and two worse things Maj. Warren does that he justifies with the race card. He serves as a late 1800's Malcolm X, someone whom white men should and do fear. I'm not saying it's right, merely that I'm not in a position to judge. Let's put it this way: I assume we've all heard that history is in the hands of the victors? So for example, freedom fighters who fail in their mission are labeled terrorists. This could have easily been true for the colonists had they lost the American Revolution, but they didn't and got to label the monarchy tyrannical. So, with that in mind, let's together realize that white people throughout history have always been the victors. After emancipation, even after Civil Rights, rich and therefore powerful white men have been able to put this spin on popular history that seems to apologize while also excusing their actions, precipitating further discrimination and simultaneously setting guidelines of behavior for future black Americans to follow. TH8 is definitely not MLK-political correctness-friendly. But that's the point, for MLK is a figure whom we pretend to learn about in public school as a pacifist activist (which is not at all oxymoronic, duh, don't ask questions) while largely if not completely ignoring Malcolm X. This movie is frank, and invites honest, painful discussion, something that is conspicuously absent surrounding the issues today. <br/><br/>The least significant but still relevantly applause-worthy aspect of this film is how gorgeous it is. It's quite an amazing accomplishment considering most of it takes place in one room, but the visuals are stunning. <br/><br/>Give this film a chance and just enjoy it for what it is. Or don't, cry about having your white privilege shoved in your face, and/or watch something with all action and no substance, which is just about every single other Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I'm a white woman."
"markgorman","9","4","13","24 January 2016"," Brilliant Tarantino as he parodies himself. Ignore the critics.
","In which Quentin Tarantino sticks two fingers up to the American film industry and thinks to himself; if there's nothing else left to parody it's time to parody myself.<br/><br/>Tarantino's films have increasingly taken themselves less and less seriously. Look back through his seven previous movies and you'll see that he started with a pretty full on, totally original, but relatively serious 'take' on Mean Street type hit men, mafia stooges and mobsters with his only real moment of pure humour being the Stealer's Wheel 'ear scene' in Reservoir Dogs..<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction was a full blown paean to, um, pulp fiction and rather than reaching for the humour button instead drew entirely on style.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown was a stunning tribute to blaxploitation and pulp fiction of a more cerebral kind, drawing as it did on Elmore Leonard's superior crime noir and was an instant classic.<br/><br/>But Kill Bill 1 & 2 started to see Tarantino play games with his audience. This time he sought out humour as he dialled up the violence to ridiculous, but glorious, proportions drawing from Manga, Kung Fu, Bruce Lee, and Monkey to delight all who sailed with him. Death Proof I'll have to comment on only from reviews I've read. It pastiched B movies and Grindhouse. His descent into levity was beginning in earnest.<br/><br/>Inglorious Basterds (war films) continued that journey and it reached new highs with the remarkable performance of Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained; this time Westerns being the genre of choice.<br/><br/>It's perhaps a surprise to see him tackle the same genre two movies running as Westerns are the source of The Hateful Eight's inspiration but, for me, it's actually Tarantino that is the inspiration, because he's made a conscious decision to rip the p*** out of himself in this wondrous three hour epic. Every excess that Tarantino has brought to our screens in the past is amplified in this shoot 'em up, completely joyous and utterly unpretentious homage to Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>He lampoons himself by appearing as a voice over, very briefly, on two occasions, thereby giving us his 'Hitchcock Moment"" - another nod of reverence to a master of the big screen. <br/><br/>But it's the killings (and there are many) that provide the greatest glee and give Tarantino the most fun. Buckets of blood mixed with suet and bits of bone spray liberally across the set, and regularly onto the magnificent countenance of Jennifer Jason Lee (an actress that's clearly up for the ride and vies with Samuel L. Jackson for star billing).<br/><br/>Cowboys vomit gallons of gore in brilliant fountains of rouge and heads are dramatically obliterated with barely a by your leave.<br/><br/>Even his cast is a parody of itself. <br/><br/>Michael Madsen is back for the first time since being Mr Blonde, as is Tim Roth who was Mr Orange; Kurt Russell follows up his Death Proof appearance, Samuel L. steps out for the sixth time, Bruce Dern does a quick reappearance after Django, as does Walter Goggins who is terrific as the Sheriff.<br/><br/>It's glorious (inglorious really). A pure romp. A very clever storyline, beautifully filmed, hilariously, and I mean laugh out loud hilariously, scripted and the ensemble cast is a pure delight.<br/><br/>From the very first bar of Ennio Morricone's masterful score (in itself another parody) to the last note of the closing credits this is filmmaking at its most uninhibited, most irreverent (the n word appears many more times than any other white man could get away with) and most crafted.<br/><br/>A triumph.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for his forthcoming horror movie."
"jack-fitzpatrick","10","4","13","23 January 2016"," Vicious, Intense and even a little Cartoony
","The Hateful 8 had a lot to live up to. Tarantino has been delivering what are considered to be some of the best Cult Classics for years. They're so pop culturally relevant that they have been and still frequently are quoted, parodied and loved by fans all over. Personally I find Django Unchained to easily be one of my all-time favourite movies ever. So it's safe to say there were high expectations, I'm happy to say that The Hateful Eight reached those expectations. <br/><br/>THE HATEFUL EIGHT REVIEW – JACK FITZPATRICK <br/><br/>To the core; this IS a Tarantino film. From the intense moments juxtaposed by the light conversations of unique dialogue to the wide shot cinematography. The Hateful Eight delivers on just about every note. You know those moments in Quentin Tarantino films where the tension is building constantly and it just keeps going until the scene erupts into a violent mayhem; Scenes like the 20 minute conversation in the beginning of Inglorious Basterds and the friendly dinner conversation in candy land which soon turns chaotic from Django Unchained. Well, the entirety of the Hateful Eight is one of these scenes. Trapped in a claustrophobic environment, the film follows a group of people caught in a blizzard. The characters begin to unfold throughout the movie and we see that they aren't always who they say they are, and are all capable of committing acts of brutality. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, the characters spend quality time with one another while the tension escalates and the suspicions rise. Nobody can be trusted, and everybody is in it for something. It's up to the viewer to decide who they trust and who they do not and the film doesn't take sides. Characters get their fair share of screen time and this is basically an extended take of fantastic actors bouncing off of one another as their characters, often chewing the scenery and making the film their own. This being said, I definitely was on Samuel L Jackson's character's side for a lot of it, he was just so undeniably cool throughout. But all of the characters had a moment to shine in, and as I said, it's really up to you as a viewer to decide who you like or who you trust – The two don't necessarily coincide. Tim Roth, Kurt Russel and best of all Samuel L Jackson are returning cast for Tarantino movies and do their other roles justice. However, all of the characters in the film are fantastically written and well thought out. They all have their own stories and motivations and even if we don't like them or wish them to lose, we still understand why they are there and are doing what they are doing. The characters make sense. The writing makes sense, and that's important. The majority of the film is set in an old, partly run down cabin in the middle of a blizzard. Visually though, the film manages to stray far off of boring. I won't pretend I know too much about the 70mm, I'm no expert on aspect ratio or really practical filming in general, however I do watch A LOT of movies and I can appreciate the wide angles exposing characters in the background and the clarity of the film, revealing the tiniest of details such as the dust and snow falling through the air within the cabin throughout the movie. Something I loved about the movie as I mentioned above is that you can see other characters throughout it even when they are not the key focus in that particular scene. The film feels much like a stage play in that way, and it ups the stakes as important things can be happening in the background at any moment and the actors have to stay in character for the majority of the film. The movie doesn't shy away from keeping the background characters and set from staying consistent and logically present. Another element that must be mentioned when talking about any Tarantino film, but especially this one in particular is the violence. And I just have to say 'wow,' because this is one violent movie. Easily Tarantino's most brutal film to date, even beating out such scenes as The crazy 88 fight of Kill Bill and the cinema massacre of Inglorious Basterds; The Hateful Eight certainly earned it's R18+ rating. The film makes even gun combat feel close and personal. I will not spoil anything but I will say that not everybody makes it out alive by the end of the film, and the moments of human deduction are glorious. (Dare I say GORE-ious? Nah, I probably shouldn't actually.) The movie is extremely long, but copes without feeling like it's dragging. The film starts off slow for sure, but this isn't a bad thing. It needs to – This makes where it's headed that much more impactive. That being said the dialogue keeps up and doesn't slow down, and we get a feel of who the characters are and what their relationships are like or might become right off the bat. It never feels boring and once it really 'gets into it' You can't look away. The pacing is absolutely perfect and there's never a dull moment. The momentum keeps everything going steadily – only thing is, the movie's a car headed for a brick wall, and we as an audience sit there sadistically waiting for it all to wildly explode.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is Vicious, funny, intense and even a little cartoon-y all while managing to stay serious in tone and suspenseful throughout. Competing closely to The Revenant, I suspect this movie will land as one of my top 10 movies of 2016.<br/><br/>10/10"
"kluseba","8","4","13","20 January 2016"," All of Quentin Tarantino's trademarks united in one movie
","''The Hateful Eight'' is a typical Quentin Tarantino movie. It has a slow build-up that carefully introduces the eight different characters. The dialogues are very elaborated and mix crude vocabulary with more intellectual expressions to create an emotional balance. The tension of the movie is based on the cold landscapes, the long dialogues, the restricted setting, the excellent gloomy soundtrack and an overall simple yet efficient story with a little twist. It takes nearly two hours before the first main character dies and the killing scenes are then very graphic, purposely exaggerated and chillingly refreshing in contrast to the lengthy conversations. Anyone who knows Quentin Tarantino gets exactly what one can expect from him.<br/><br/>This factor has its advantages and disadvantages. The dialogues are among the very best in modern Hollywood cinema. The camera techniques are epic, the settings add to the atmosphere of the film and the score composed by Ennio Morricone is great. The eight characters are unique and very different from each other. They are incarnated by eight actors who really shine in this movie. All of them do an outstanding job but I would like to point the acting of the only female lead character played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who perfectly portrays a sneaky, sadistic and opportunistic criminal that constantly tries to manipulate people around her. The relations between the different characters are what makes this movie even more outstanding. Unlikely rivalries and alliances come and go during the movie and none of the characters is predictable.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the movie is comparable to several previous movies by Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion, the film has too many similarities with his last western ''Django Unchained'', including the setting, discussions about slavery and the Civil War background. Another negative element is the length of the movie. While the film builds up a lot of atmosphere, some momentum gets lost in the middle of the film before the first character dies. The movie could have been shortened by at least twenty to thirty minutes to assure a more fluid experience. Another element that bothered me a little bit was the perspective change in the movie. Right before the climax, the film introduces an entire chapter set in the early hours of the same day that reveals all the twists in about twenty minutes which decreases the impact of the following climax and interrupts the flow of the movie in an odd way. This background story could have been told differently, quicker and especially at a different moment in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, ''The Hateful Eight'' might not be Quentin Tarantino's best movie so far but it's a good or slightly above average film by him. The dialogues of the script are worthy of an Academy Award, the camera, light and sound techniques have both a retro style and are up to modern standards and the actors and actresses deliver some of their very best career performances. If you like westerns, the stunning landscapes and the story are two more reasons for you to adore this movie. If you are looking for a more graphic, short-paced and violent movie, ''The Hateful Eight'' might bore you since the film is unusually long and at points hard to sit through, focuses almost only on dialogues and character developments and only gets physically intense in the last sixth of the movie. Personally, this was one of last year's greatest movies in my opinion but you will only admire this movie if you are familiar with other works of Quentin Tarantino, like western stories and settings and adore elaborated dialogues."

"alexrwatson-888-169026","9","7","28","1 January 2016"," Brutally Entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino's 8th film involves eight strangers stuck in one cabin during a harsh blizzard. What could possibly go wrong? After his script leaked for this film in 2014, Tarantino decided to shelf the project indefinitely. I'm glad he changed his mind. The Hateful Eight is a brutally entertaining film that gives a gruesome look at racial tensions and life on the 19th century western frontier.<br/><br/>Since The Hateful Eight is set in only a few locations, the characters and their interactions need to be interesting and entertaining. The eight strangers are all very different, featuring unique backstories and intriguing character qualities. The dialogue between the characters is appropriately hilarious and hard-hitting, whichever the particular moment is calling for. Playing detective and trying to decipher who is telling the truth makes for an active and engaging time at the movies. This quality of the movie felt very reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's first film.<br/><br/>There are some very gory and shocking moments in The Hateful Eight, which many have come to expect from a Tarantino film. One of these shocking moments in particular makes me think very differently about Samuel L. Jackson. This very easily might be Tarantino's most violent film (that's saying something). Tarantino haters might argue his films are style over substance, but that is simply not the case with The Hateful Eight. The portrayal of how different races treated one another during the post-Civil War era and the sheer brutality on the western frontier more than justifies the onslaught of on screen violence.<br/><br/>Another staple of a Tarantino film is a longer runtime, and that is still the case with The Hateful Eight. It's nearly 3 hours long, but due to the fast and dynamic dialogue and the mystery behind the eight strangers, the pacing works in the film's favor. Nothing about the film feels bloated or unnecessary to the core story being told. <br/><br/>My favorite performance outside of Samuel L. Jackson's was Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue. She's absolutely hilarious and completely loses herself in the role. She was nominated for this supporting role at the Golden Globes, for which she is very deserving. There's one performance that I am still not sure how I feel about, but due to the 'spoilerish' nature of the role, I won't name a specific actor/actress. It was just weird and kind of out of left field (if you've seen the film you know exactly who I am talking about).<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is one of my favorite films of the year, from one of my very favorite directors. It's an entertaining ride from start to finish, filled with intrigue and features one of the best scripts of the year. A violent movie with a violent message, what better way to celebrate the new year?<br/><br/>Check out this review and many more over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com"

","{First review so its going to be short} So some scenes were over the top. But this movie was very good in my opinion. Samuel Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh,and Walton Goggins were all great. One of the best movies by Quentin Tarantino I've seen. The movie kept me in my seat all the way from start to finish. Some reviewers didn't like the humor or violence but look at most QT movies. Most are violent and humorous. So what did they expect going into this movie? I liked the fact that you didn't know if Samuel was lying about the letter or not. Actually you really didn't know if any of the characters were lying or not till the very end. I would have liked for Lee Horsley to have had a bigger role but that's because I've always liked him."

"paulswampymarsh","9","5","18","9 January 2016"," Too many poor reviews! Acting alone is fantastic.
","This is my first review on IMDb, I've done so purely because of some of the poor reviews I've read so far. I've seen a few 1/10 reviews which is a joke. Even if you didn't like the film, the acting alone would make it 5/10.<br/><br/>So glad i went to see The Hateful Eight on the big screen, trust me, you want to see it at the cinema. For me it was breathtaking. When outside of the shack, the scenery is mesmerising. When inside, the big screen holds the tension and the dialogue perfectly. Of course its a Tarantino film, so when there's blood its even more shocking when its big. I really can't understand some people who are slating this film, obviously A) you don't understand what Tarantino has done with his last 3 films, and you still bleat on about Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction. B) You think all Westerns are about gunfights and tumbleweed. C) You haven't read anything about this film what so ever. Tarantino said his inspirations for this film were Reservoir Dogs and The Thing, Spot on. Right up there with Django and Inglorious. The only shame is Tarantino says he is only going to make 2 more films.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell is fantastic as The Hangman, Samuel L Jackson as the cool, calm & calculated Marquis Warren, But Jeniffer Jason Leigh steals the show as Daisy Domergue. However ALL of the supporting cast are amazing, even Michael Madsen who is one of my favourites, hasn't been in anything for awhile, reduced to Big Brother, is brilliant as Joe Gage and has elements of Mr Blonde about him.<br/><br/>If you haven't guessed, Quentin Tarantino likes a bit of dialogue in his films, and this is full of it, but for me the dialogue is exactly what the film needs, John Ruth questions everyone trying to find their back story and who could possibly be in cahoots with the handcuffed Domergue. Also the whole cinema was chuckling at Chris Maddix and his exasperated one liners! 9/10."
"the_bluesman","9","7","29","1 January 2016"," Classic Tarantino
","I liked THE HATEFUL EIGHT. It's another great Tarantino movie with weird characters, crazy conversations and excessive violence. Just what I expected. There's nothing really to complain about. The movie has an interesting plot with some twists and turns, great cinematography, and a masterful score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The whole cast— led by Samual L. Jackson and including a number of Tarantino regulars like Michael Madsen and Tim Roth—is very convincing and could hardly be better. Kurt Russell as bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth and Jennifer Jason Leigh as his captive Daisy Domergue are the real surprises in the cast, though, and they have some of the best scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>I personally think THE HATEFUL EIGHT is Tarantino's finest movie in the last ten years. That is not to say that his other movies from this period—Django Unchained, Inglourious Basterds, and Death Proof—were not good because they were for the most part, but THE HATEFUL EIGHT just feels very complete and more elaborate than the previous few movies. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is definitely one of the best westerns in years and one of my favorite movies of 2015."
"robsta23","10","7","29","26 December 2015"," Tarantino Does it Again
","To get the full effect of the movie I would recommend that you see the 70mm roadshow version before it's too late. The overture and intermission (with somewhat of an entr'acte leading into act 2) along with the fact that the movie was filmed with the same lenses used to film Ben-Hur bring back a method of exhibition I was never able to experience before in my lifetime.<br/><br/>I admit I have a bias towards Tarantino, but honestly there were only a few flaws in the film, unlike what all the haters are saying. So before I get into the positives I'm going to refute the negatives. I've read this film is too long and ""overwritten."" Incorrect. I can't speak for the digital version yet, but the intermission gives you a chance to breathe before watching the second half of the film. Also, it may have a long duration, but (to me at least) it didn't feel THAT long. The dialogue is compelling enough to keep you on the edge of your seat since it gets very tense from time to time.<br/><br/>Another claim is that the mystery is not clever. While I would say yes to this, I would respond by saying that as you're experiencing the movie you come to realize that it really isn't trying to be clever, especially with Chapter Five following the ""reveal"" at the end of Chapter Four. Tarantino may have described it is like an Agatha Christie story, but who said he was trying to make a mystery as fully fleshed out as her stories? This is one of the reasons that justifies why the mystery aspect of the movie didn't come across clearly in the trailers. Although, to be fair, the main plot of this movie is difficult to explain, but the trailer does its best with Kurt Russell's ""I'm taking this woman to hang"" segment. The main problem I have with this film is basically the same one I had with Reservoir Dogs: it is a movie specifically focused on an ensemble, yet some of the main ensemble do not receive as much screen time and character development as others.<br/><br/>These flaws are minor, and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. If you're experiencing this movie with a multitude of Tarantino fans as I did you're going to laugh at all the right moments. This is actually one of the funniest Tarantino movies I have ever seen, delivering great comic bits even in the most dramatic and tense sequences of the movie. Tarantino should honestly be the name of a genre in itself since he combines the comic with the dramatic time and time again within his films.<br/><br/>This film is bloody as can be expected. And while some will have to avert their eyes from what happens on the screen, it is once again violence that is more ridiculous than disturbing or upsetting. But don't get me wrong, if you're not used to Tarantino violence, this movie may scar you mentally.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence in the film is what occurs just before intermission because it made my jaw drop. You want to love Marquis Warren (Jackson), but this truly is The Hateful Eight, and you will hate him at the conclusion of the first half.<br/><br/>Overall this movie seems like 2 different movies, the first seeming longer since it needs to establish what is happening in the first 3 chapters. And the last three chapters seem to go by quickly with all the fun Tarantino traits packed into them - you know, like Tarantino making a ""cameo"" by narrating in a comic manner, a jump in chronology - revitalizing the good ol' days of Pulp Fiction - and all the blood, humor, and intensity you can ask for.<br/><br/>Finally, this film is simply satisfying at its conclusion which always sells a movie in my book. See this film!<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"
"xecutionrecords","9","7","29","24 December 2015"," Epic Character Driven Masterpiece! Sit Back & Enjoy!
","Tarantino's 8th movie proper is without doubt one of the finest westerns of the modern era, far out shining his previous effort 'Django' and running alongside 'The Unforgiven' as possibly one of the most beautifully shot, tense & darkest ever made. Stripping away layers of each character as he goes along without time restraints (thankfully) what we have here is more akin to a theatre experience than an outright movie. Don't expect guns a blazing & shallow one liners, this is almost 3 hours of excellent character actors doing what they do best, inhabiting their roles and wearing their scars until we feel every bit of tension & doubt that they do. The Hateful Eight mixes the directors previous quieter movies, Reservoir Dogs & Jackie Brown, throws in a plot that you think you've seen before (The Outer Limits anyone?) adds in a blizzard that keeps the atmosphere claustrophobic throughout (There is no escape for these people, this is something we are reminded of throughout thanks to the wonderful sound design) verbally assaults it's viewers with venomous dialogue and sharp humour then tosses everything together in the blender as only Tarantino can. The end result is a perfectly well executed, genuine bona-fide masterpiece, something that is in short supply of late. What makes The Hateful Eight superior to other recent genre efforts is the directors ability to let his actors have the breathing space they need to deliver their lines to such exciting levels. Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson provide the meat of the 1st half of the film, whilst the incredible Walton Goggins & the rest of this fine ensemble cast really shine in the 2nd half, so much so that you don't realise that a gun isn't even fired in this movie until over half way through the almost 3 hour length, Channing Tatum fans will probably be very disappointed with this film, and that's no bad thing! It's been said before who needs action when the dialogue is this good, it just is! The second half of the movie when the guns finally do come out of their holsters is an exciting blend of Hitchcock Mystery Theatre & Balls to the wall blood soaked mayhem more in tone to something seen in a horror film rather than a western but it works as it always does. The directors influences work overtime here from 70's Italian splatter westerns to the more artful touches of Sergio Leone & Eastwood, this is helped greatly by a wonderful score by the legendary Ennio Morricone & the directors always appreciative eye for a beautiful tracking shot or just leaving the camera Static for the right amount of time to soak up the scene. Tarantino may have his critics but there is no denying his amazing ability to make everything in his movies seem perfectly at place even when you think it shouldn't be. This may possibly be his finest looking film to date. Although maybe not to everybody tastes, The Hateful Eight is a skillfully designed exercise in craft. Incredible performances all round, Goggins especially delivers a no holds barred 'gloves off' performance (Think Boyd without the TV restraints, but with some great emotional depth not previously allowed in that particular role) The Directing, score, sound & cinematography are all as good as anything i've seen in the last 5 years and are certainly as good as anything the director has done previous. if you like your westerns with a slow build & a sly wink you can do no better. Watch it!!"
"utgard14","6","8","35","4 January 2016"," A let-down but still worth a look
","The good - it's Quentin so the dialogue is interesting, the characters are colorful, and the direction is stylish. If you're a fan of his work, you'll probably find something to like here even if, like me, you don't love the movie as a whole. The bad - it's overlong, surprisingly stagy, dripping with anger and ugliness with far too many of the usual Tarantino excesses. The coarse language, cheap attempts at gore, and constant racial epithets are nothing new but it just felt like he was trying too hard and I'm not really sure what he was trying to prove. Just a suggestion but perhaps it's time for Quentin to evolve as a filmmaker and learn to make his points with some eloquence instead of throwing feces at people to get attention. Probably the biggest sin is the length of the film. There's no reason for this to be nearly three hours (and certainly no reason for it to be over three, as with the roadshow version). The first hour needs severe cuts as nothing much happens and whole scenes feel like they're repeating what happened five minutes earlier. The cast does a fine job playing unlikable characters. Yeah, they're all over-the-top, but given the slow pacing and the fact that the movie feels like a foul-mouthed variation on the old ""drawing room mysteries,"" some loud performances are kind of necessary. Look, I know most of my review has been complaining but it's not that I hated the movie. I just think it could and should have been better. As it is, it's worth watching but not one of Tarantino's best."
"nikhil_kamra","8","3","9","14 July 2016"," The best of Quentin Tarantino, THAT I HAVE SEEN.
","""The Hateful Eight""<br/><br/>*NO Spoilers*<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is one of those movies that is longer than you wish it was. But that does not necessarily mean that it's bad. The movie is divided in six chapters and the best ones are in the beginning and in the middle, which is not a bad choice, as you may think. Rather, it is good because it keeps you hooked!<br/><br/>This movie took me by surprise. Reading the plot/premise and catching glimpses of this movie before watching it made me believe this is one of those movies that deal with a lot of action and violence. But, to my astonishment, it's not. A MAJOR part of this movie is drama. People talking, recounting stories, most of which has a purpose. Sometimes, it's to amuse us, while other times, it is stuff that makes sense in the end. MOSTLY, it's character development. And like the title suggests, none of the characters are lovable. And again, that's NOT a bad thing.<br/><br/>The dialogue here is REALLY witty. It's attention grabbing, sometimes humorous and NOT AT ALL boring. I never felt sleepy, even though it was way past my bedtime by the time it ended. Not once!<br/><br/>I say it's the best of Quentin Tarantino I have watched because I've see only a few of his movies.<br/><br/>I watched Reservoir Dogs a few years ago, and I found it to be good. But being more than 2 decades old, it felt the same. And I've seen Pulp Fiction, which was again, an okay, worth watching movie. And that's about it when it comes to Tarantino's movies that I've watched. (I guess)<br/><br/>THIS, on the other hand, is not only a good movie, it actually made me long for more, despite it's already long duration. I actually got so interested in the characters' lives, that I wanted more. It's one of those movies that if I come across on TV someday, I'm not going change the channel.<br/><br/>The next Tarantino's flick I'm going to watch will be Django Unchained, because a friend of mine says, ""If you liked this, you'll LOVE that"". Let's see how much of that is true. :)<br/><br/>This one here, gets: 8.5/10"
"Pramitheus","9","3","9","2 May 2016"," Another classic from Tarantino
","I have waited to watch this movie for a long time. As I hail from India and as the Indian Censor Board is so concerned about the ""Indian culture"" being ""tainted"" by Hollywood movies that they don't release R-rated movies in India, so I had to wait because the name of the game here is PATIENCE.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies set in an indoor set-up. The movie is claustrophobic. Each person has a past and Tarantino makes you feel you are there right inside Minnie's Habadashery. It's almost a amalgamation of Reservoir Dogs and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It's a FILM. A film which has been crafted with the care and respect with which movies should be made and I am always in awe that how confident Tarantino is that his concept of movies will always work, and it does. Nowadays movies have become short, to the point and in a way has shortened our tenacity to be patient but then comes Tarantino with a plot which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Well truth be said, the plot is very simple but it is the narration that keeps it interesting.<br/><br/>The plot is that Sam L.Jackson is a retired war veteran turned bounty hunter who happens to come into the path of Kurt Russell who is taking a woman to hang. Due to a blizzard they have to make a pit stop at a inn so that they can wait till the blizzard passes by. At the inn waits 4 unknowns already, each of whose past is unknown. Sam and Kurt form a circle of trust as they start suspecting the four boarders in the inn.<br/><br/>Everybody carries out their parts in the best manner but the whole movie mainly rests on the shoulders of Samuel L. Jackson. Watch the movie alone for a monologue by him. It is riveting. It made me crawl away from my laptop screen. I think Channing Tatum was a miscast in this perfectly made film. A better actor would have probably nailed the role within the given screen time.<br/><br/>It is a Tarantino classic. If you have watched Tarantino's movies and are used to his style of movie making you are sure to love this one."
"EnriqueSilva_Reviews","10","3","9","1 May 2016"," A perfect combination between Django unchained and Reservoir Dogs...
","The Hateful Eight is one of the best films that Tarantino has created and its strong and unique element is its script. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight boasts The best screenplay that Tarantino has written, persons who do not fully know Tarantino style probably the be something slow and heavy, but those who know completely this director is a pleasure to listen to each character, their conversations and his monologues. <br/><br/>In general, all the actors are brilliant and no doubt Jennifer Jason Leigh will take a nomination Oscar for his brilliant performance (especially in the scene of his speech) The Hateful Eight is made in the style of Tarantino, in the time in which he was directing ""pulp Fiction"" and writing ""Kill Bill"", that is to say, the old school of Tarantino. <br/><br/>It is also important to mention that it is the most bizarre Film Tarantino, here violence is more real and more raw and much more cruel than any other Tarantino film (Yes, surpasses even Kill Bill in the brutal), but violence is accompanied by incredibly humorous moments, a very black, but totally fun humor. The return of Ennio Morricone is masterful, epic, unique and amazing and surely takes Oscar for best original score. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I would say: The Hateful Eight is one of the best films of Tarantino and one of the best this year, I'm completely sure that Tarantino will have a nomination Oscar for his incredible script, like Jennifer Jason Leigh for her incredible performance and the maestro Ennio Morricone for his incredible music."

The director had his cast in mind that was gathered with perfect performances. Every character executed the roles and showed the hate of America.

"BrendanMichaels","10","3","9","14 March 2016"," Tarantino's Best of the 2010s
","Django Unchained showed us that Quentin Tarantino is a chameleon of genres. He can go from a crime thriller to a crime thriller with multiple characters told unchronologically to a Blacksploitation film to a Kung Fu Revenge film to a Grindhouse flick to an awesome World War 2 Action film to a Southerner. Now we have a Tarantino Western with some of the most despicable people in the Tarantino universe. The Hateful Eight is an amalgamation of all of Tarantino's best work that creates one of the most epic westerns of all time. Not only an entertaining film but a great study into racial tension that seems all too true nowadays. Tarantino brings us the masterpiece that no one was expecting to be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walter Goggins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Demian Bichir, and Bruce Dern who are bounty hunters and crooks that are stuck in Minnie's Haberdashery for 2 days as a blizzard is happening. I don't want to give away anything from the plot but that's all you need to know about the movie. A lot of people are comparing this to Clue when really it's basically Reservoir Dogs in the Old West. Seeing as Reservoir Dogs is one of Quentin's best it definitely made the movie more interesting as I sat there watching the 70mm film. It's story is by far way more suspenseful than Reservoir Dogs and is quite possibly his best film he's done. For me, it's a close second with Inglorious Basterds being #1 for me. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and amazing. I quote more lines from this than any other Tarantino film. I love how Tarantino goes back to a more simplistic film. The movie is set 90% of the time at the Haberdashery and it lets the characters actions become more intense. It's storytelling at its best.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a master director and has a style that thousands (such as myself) try to recreate. The Hateful Eight is filled with great dialogue that never made for a dull moment in the film. That's a huge compliment seeing as how this film was 3 hours and 7 minutes at my screening. The reason I say at my screening is that The Hateful Eight has something extremely special for the 70mm Roadshow. As an homage to movies of the 1960s it includes a 3 minute overture and a 15 minute intermission. I can only dream right now as to what a regular screening of the film compares to this roadshow version. But this is the version that's the way to go. A film such as this is so epic that it made me feel a fury of emotions. It made me laugh, it made me disgusted (in a good way), it made me think. Not many films have made me feel those emotions this year and luckily Tarantino is able to pull it off wonderfully.<br/><br/>As per usual the entire cast of The Hateful Eight is perfect. Samuel L. Jackson is the standout of this film. He plays a Union Major turned Bounty Hunter that is easily his best Tarantino role since Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction. Other Tarantino alumni return such as Walter Goggins, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Zoe Bell that are fantastic but the true standout besides Sam Jackson is Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's been really impressing me this year with this being as good as her role in Anomalisa. This cast makes the film and keeps impressing me every time. Goggins is really the standout of this film and has great chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson's character.<br/><br/>Now, I can't finish my review without talking about Ennio Morricone's amazing score for this film. It is one of his best scores and it feels amazing to see an Ennio Morricone scored western. He even uses an unused song for John Carpenter's The Thing that fits in fantastically with the rest of the movie. It's almost as good as The Ecstasy of Gold. Go check out the soundtrack for The Hateful Eight. Definitely worth the hear.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is One of the Greatest Westerns of All Time. Tarantino can transbound genres with his style. The Hateful Eight is the most fun I've had in a theater since Star Wars The Force Awakens. See this as soon as possible. This and Carol are seriously the Top 2 movies you need to see this year. It's amazing directing, tight cast and unbelievable script make it worth the price of admission."
"Genti22","10","3","9","6 March 2016"," Spectacular and haunting
","The Hateful Eight is the 8th movie by the amazing Qunetin Tarantino and certainly one of his best yet.Tarantino wrote it and also directed it,and the cast includes Samuel L.

The movie is set in post civil war time and it's about eight strangers who are travelling to Red Rock but a strong blizzard makes spend a few days at a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass.Soon they begin to be suspicious that one of them is not who he says he is and is going to kill them all as soon as he gets the chance to. This movie is terrific,and the cast is spectacular.This is one of the best performance from Samuel L. Jackson on a Tarantino film ever.Surprisingly Jennifer Jason Leigh is great too,since she is on a side role only,but nonetheless it's a stand out for her too.Walton Goggins is also very good on the role and memorable too. The cinematography is phenomenal by Robert Richardson and I'm so glad that Ennio Morricone won the long deserved Academy Award for the brilliant and mesmerizing/haunting score on this movie. I have heard a lot of negative buzz about this movie as well as controversy regarding some racial issues that some people seem to have with it and in my opinion is pointless and stupid.People must learn to appreciate art and amazing film making like this in order for the cinematic experience to be good. It is quite long but it certainly doesn't feel that way because it is not boring in any part what so ever.Quentin Tarantino is a genius filmmaker and I hope/pray that he will keep on making movies forever because he is a great director and one of the best that we've got working today."
"gavin6942","7","3","9","14 February 2016"," Tarantino Adapts ""The Thing"" Into a Western
","In the dead of a Wyoming winter, a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) find shelter in a cabin currently inhabited by a collection of nefarious characters. <br/><br/>Part of the fun of watching a Quentin Tarantino film is trying to determine all the references he makes to other films. Whether you consider them homages or theft, he is known for an endless amount of small tips of the hat. In ""Hateful Eight"", we get nods to ""Stagecoach"", ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu"", among many others.<br/><br/>The most obvious reference (and the film that Tarantino acknowledges was his ""primary"" inspiration) is John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". We have Kurt Russell, and we have an Ennio Morricone score (including some unused tracks taken directly from ""The Thing""). When you boil down the plot, you have even the same story: a group of people trapped in a blizzard, with at least one of them being not who they say they are, but something much more dangerous.<br/><br/>In that respect, this is a fun movie and it is nice to see Tarantino convert Carpenter's work into a western. This is especially appropriate given Carpenter's love for Howard Hawks, and such westerns as Hawks' ""Rio Bravo"" (which Carpenter remade as ""Assault on Precinct 13""). But it is not without its shortcomings.<br/><br/>Tarantino has given in to his excesses. With his bigger budgets and A-list name, he is allowed to do more or less whatever he pleases. This has a bit of a backfire effect. The script is not as tight as it should be, with the dialogue going into the cheesy or campy terrain a bit more than it should. And when a movie runs to almost three hours in length, this time ought to be justified. For ""Hateful Eight"", it is hard to justify it... there is no doubt a few minutes could have been trimmed here or there to keep the pace up.<br/><br/>Counting this as his eighth film (which really depends on how you count, but we will go with Tarantino's own method), it is one that fans will enjoy, but ends up being on the lesser end of his work. I daresay this is his second-worst film, with only ""Jackie Brown"" beneath it. In fairness, even a bad Tarantino movie is often better than the average film. But this is nowhere near the genius of ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Inglourious Basterds"".<br/><br/>As far as the Academy Awards go, the nominations for ""Hateful Eight"" ended up being spot on. Tarantino is typically praised for his writing, but as noted above, this is not a tight script, and it does not surprise me that it was passed over for a writing nomination. People may also be getting a bit fed up with how many times the n-word peppers the dialogue. While it does not offend me as much as it might others (I understand why it is used as it is), there does seem to be an over-saturation in this script, even more than ""Django"".<br/><br/>The Best Cinematography nomination for Robert Richardson is well-deserved. Very few films have ever been shot in 65 or 70mm, and the lengths the studio had to go through just for theaters to screen such a film deserve recognition. But the award may not be given to Richardson just the same. Why? Because of two things. One, not everyone is able to see the film in this way. Voters are probably watching the movie at home on inadequate screens. Also, the widescreen is best suited for the Colorado landscape, but the vast majority of the film is indoors. This makes the idea something of a waste, or maybe a gimmick. <br/><br/>The Best Original Score nomination for Ennio Morricone seems more likely. He was already given an honorary award, but could use a ""real"" Oscar to put on his shelf. Morricone is, without a doubt, one of the all-time greatest composers. And his work here is just as good as anything he has ever done. Is it as iconic as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""? No way. But how many scores are? He would have my vote.<br/><br/>Which leaves Best Supporting Actress, and the nomination of Jennifer Jason Leigh. Of all the categories for 2015, this may be the most challenging. Leigh is the presumptive front-runner, but I think Alicia Vikander was outstanding in ""Danish Girl"" and Rooney Mara has plenty of support for ""Carol"". Any of them could and should be honored. Although my instinct was to award Vikander, I am now leaning towards Leigh. Not only is she incredible in this role (remaining in the background of almost every scene), but it is high time she is awarded for past achievements. (Sure, that is not how the Oscars are supposed to work, but it is no secret that many awards are seen as ""career awards""... and Leigh has been an unsung heroine for decades in such great roles as in ""The Machinist"" and ""Existenz"".)"

","I've read just about every 1 star review of this film. Beside noting that most of them are from accounts less than a month old (as of January 2016), even more notable is their dearth of insight whatsoever. ""Absolute garbage"" they exclaim. ""Smelly garbage"" they bellow from behind thumbed noses in single-paragraph adolescence.<br/><br/>Even if you can't appreciate the subtler aspects of cinema, such as composition and use of color (no please, not the n****r word), surely these surly reviewers must've noted Tarantino's use of on-screen space, his blocking of actors, and the invisible in-character reactions they have to each small development. Easily more apparent; Quentin's film may be set at a single set, but it has more compositional variety than 19/20 movies made. Bar editing, composition is the most psychically evocative element of emotive visual storytelling. Quentin is a virtuoso in this department, never more palpably than with this film.<br/><br/>Most drone on about how the smart introspective dialogue drones on. They must prefer the ear-drilling tunes of clunk like ""Directly under enemy scrotum"" from Transformers X, or perhaps even ""I like the way you die, boy"" from Tarantino's precedent masterpiece, which they can quote the next day at work even without context. <br/><br/>Consider the verse ""Considering all the things I done for money, I ain't one to judge but...don't you feel just the least little bad about hangin' a woman?"" Chris Mannix. OR "" Ain't you got mixed emotions about bringin' a woman to a rope?"" Major Warren.<br/><br/>Those two lines betray the deep, multi-layered irony in the final shot of the film.<br/><br/>It's Tarantino inviting us to inspect the apparent misogyny the film is deceptively wrapped in. The responses to both characters, from two others (Ruth and Mobray) relay the head and tail of the same misogynistic beast; To Ruth, Domergue's lack of grace disqualifies her femininity as an emotive, self-restrictive tool. To Mobray, womanhood has no bearing on the gravity of an atrocity. She isn't a woman to Ruth, and Mobray couldn't care that she is. Mobray is the dispassionate of the two. But then again...there is no Mobray.<br/><br/>The ""dispassion is the very essence of justice"" monologue is another twist of the contemplative knife; it's the verbal setup for eventual situational irony, a reciprocal of Pulp Fiction's ""Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fu*ked by anybody, except Mrs. Wallace."" It's a continuation of the subtle thematic lifeline that runs through Quentin's filmography: He creates the characters, they write themselves a plot, he writes the Story--and the three elements never align, into a contrived Third-Act eclipse.<br/><br/>When a character gets his head bloodily brecciated, it's not only over-the-top Quentinry, it's a story-point. That's how elaborate the scheme is. The characters talk and talk and poeticize their pasts. Sure, it isn't as electric as Tarantino's former poesy (Come on, give the 1870s characters a break; they haven't heard 'Like a Virgin', been to Amsterdam or been in a pilot of Fox Force Five yet) but the film reaches a new laid back, naturalistic real-time feel to it. It's Quentin's coziest film yet.<br/><br/>The ""beggin' for his life"" monologue by Major Warren, too, is full of ingenious touches; ""I grabbed me a handful of that black hair at the back of his head"" is double-edged. General Smithers as objectively observed has a (genetic or geriatric) white head of hair, so it's a two-way bet on whether his son would be or wouldn't be black-haired. Then, phenotypically, most male, Black humans don't have a handful of hair at the back of their heads, so that dips the icy pin further in some thematic racial poison. Plus, it's full of the fanciful tautologies Tarantino is famous for: ""When I knew me I had the son.....I knew me I was gon' have some fun."" Smile.<br/><br/>To earn this monologue (and its aftermath), Smithers romanticizes his racism saying; ""I don't know that n*g*er, but I know he's a n*g*er; and that's all I need to know."" How many writers, from any epoch, in any medium, can pack so much character and so much of a character's world-view into such a neat, pithy epigram? A shortlist, with Tarantino close to its helm.<br/><br/>Basterds and Django were satisfying, even at first-watch, because of how exuberantly executed they were. Second-watch proved the films more ruminative. With The Hateful Eight....its most thought-provoking meta-aspect is witnessing all the under-observed wrawling of witling naysayers: ""Ooh, it gave me crucifix-nightmares! Ultra-talky! Made me THROW UP! It's a snuff film!"" They've accrued a blunting critical irony now. To quote Major Warren: ""Hahaahahahaha, Whooo!"" <br/><br/>It's a sad moment for filmmaking that this masterly mood piece gets vituperated not out of objective outrage, but because The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino doesn't have the epic chic nor end with a fiery explosion in the tradition of his 6th and 7th. When my grandkids ask I'll tell them.... I'll tell them the story of how Grande Cinema died. It wasn't due to dumb directors telling silly effects-stories, no. It was a murder committed by impatient audiences. <br/><br/>A warm kiss, and a loving 8/10 for The Hateful Eight."
"The-Sarkologist","8","3","9","26 January 2016"," Another Great Tarentino Movie
","The one thing that baffled me about this movie was the title – there were actually nine people in the hut, not eight, so I am sort of scratching my head as to why it is called the Hateful Eight? Well, once again IMDb comes to the rescue and points out that one of the characters is actually a neutral character (which one I won't mention since I don't actually want to spoil the movie). Anyway, this is Tarantino's eighth movie, and ironically I also give it an eight (namely because I am really stingy with my 9's and 10's). Anyway, while Tarrentino is a great director, and I do really enjoy his movies, I'm going to have to say that his true masterpieces are now behind him (which is probably why he has suggested that he is only going to make two more movies).<br/><br/>One thing that struck me about this film is how similar it is to Reservoir Dogs. The reason I say that is because it is about a group on people inside a single room, and most, if not all, of the action occurs within the room. Okay, Tarrentino doesn't stick strictly to the unity of time and place (but then again he's not really one for following rules) however like Reservoir Dogs we basically have eight characters (actually nine) whom we know little, if anything, about. Okay, we do know about Warren, Ruth, and Daisy, but the rest of the characters are literally an unknown, and this is what adds to the suspense of the film.<br/><br/>I have to be honest and say that I didn't know what to expect from this film, and that is what is so great about Tarrentino. All I knew was that it was about a group of people stuck in a hut in the Wyoming wilderness during a blizzard, and that was it. Sure, Tarrentino loves his ordinary conversations, but that is what makes him stand out from the crowd. It is his typical trade mark film where nothing seems to happen and all of a sudden you are caught in the middle of a bloodbath.<br/><br/>One thing that I have to say is that Jackson is certainly getting on in years, but he is still a great actor, and Tarrentino really knows how to use him. As for Russell, well, if you know Kurt Russell you will know what he is like, and he certainly doesn't disappoint. If you like a good old fashion Tarrentino movie, then this is definitely worth watching."
"anthonyfrederick-71832","8","3","9","25 January 2016"," Classic Tarentino, uncompromising yet brilliant
","Tarentino continued on the 19th century theme from Django, albeit a different setting and theme, it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>The film focuses around eight characters stuck up in a stagecoach lodge during a Blizzard. The characters are all different, yet given the racial tensions, and the dust of the civil war having just settled, Tarentino utilises key historical events as the backbone of the conflict.<br/><br/>It's the initial exchanges between ""The Bounty Hunter"" (SLJ), ""The Hangman"" Russell, and the quite exceptional Jennifer Jason Leigh as ""The Prisoner"" that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Jackson's character tells Russell's he's penpals with Abraham Lincoln, much like if one said they were facebook friends with Obama, you'd probably offer them a ride on your stagecoach. But this is a different era, and the setting is perfectly isolated enough for each character to be truly vulnerable. Everyone has a story, and given the moral ambiguity surrounding each one, the audience and characters alike can't quite tell who's telling the truth. <br/><br/>The film is predominantly focused around the dialogue, with the relationships between the characters constantly changing as they are confined in such tight spaces. There isn't a protagonist, only eight villains. And with eight villains, comes the infamous violence and murdering, which, of course you'd probably have come to expect by now.The suspense is maintained throughout and Tarentino's character development is unparalleled by any other director or writer. <br/><br/>It's probably a bit too long, yet it's still of incredible quality. There's a touch of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction also, which bodes well with the cult following Tarentino has created. And as Tarentino often does, he stayed true to his following, as well as himself."
"amesmonde","Null","9","41","20 December 2015"," Great character play.
","A blizzard forces a group of four to take shelter at Minnie's Haberdashery where they encounter four more strangers. With betrayal and deception, the eight strangers realise they may not make it to destination, Red Rock, after all.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight offers impeccable framing, mountain landscapes, opening with a snow covered statue of Jesus. This film is all about justice and executions. The film is broken up with synonymous Quentin Tarantino chapter title cards. With Outlaw Josey Wales and Spaghetti Western coolness mixed with Tarantino seemingly nonchalant, yet, diligent story telling The Hateful Eight partly plays out like a heavyweight Cluedo mystery. Escaping an impeding blizzard menacing Russell known as the Hangman and bounty hunter outlaw Samuel Jackson ooze charisma and the whole cast clearly enjoy the wordplay. With its few locations (Reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs), as the group are isolated at a stagecoach passover (incidentally including Dogs' actor Tim Roth) it's mostly reliant on the actors talents and script. There's notably interesting flashbacks and a midway 4th wall voice over which brakes the confinement of the film up. Thankfully, the planets are aligned and all the elements like a jigsaw puzzle fit together in Tarantino's favour.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone score is perfect, but Tarantino also slips in a track and later a song performance (by an almost unrecognisable excellent Jennifer Jason Leigh) which surprisingly work considering its a winter set Western. There's a fanboy moment in a snowstorm where they stake guide rods and Ennio's score pulses harking back to the remote beats and paranoia of The Thing. It has a small cast ensemble. As the opening credits run anyone with an appreciation of film will have a inclination it's a Tarantino film simply by its tight casting, from classic to cult actors. Many he has already worked with and some he's prompted a deserving career revival. Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding with his Sherlock-like prowess. Walton Goggins is particularly notable. The supporting cast are great and include the likes of Zoe Bell, (surprisingly seriously good) Channing Tatum, Michael Madsen (also of Reservoir Dogs) to name a few.<br/><br/>It's a fine production, packed with seemingly period authenticity, excellent costumes, props, right down to the mutton chops and facial hair. There's plenty of historical social commentary, modern mirroring subtext and choice language that intentional or not will no doubt cause ears to prick up as the array of characters interact. Cinematographer Robert Richardson, who has worked with Tarantino on various film along with the naturalist lighting and setting gives the proceedings visual weight.<br/><br/>Lincoln letters, horse carriages, shootouts, it's gritty, violent, hard hitting packed with punchy dialogue driven scenes. It's edgy, naturalistic with poisoning, double crosses, twists and turns synonymous with Tarantino's back catalogue. There's also a memorable gross out scene with sick and blood, also severed limbs courteous of make-up veteran Greg Nicotero. There's exploding heads and when the tension builds and shoot outs happen they have a brutal impact.<br/><br/>There are great character arcs and development but debatably Russell and Roth steal the show. It's undeniably talkie but with plot surprises, fine performances and sharp writing, if you like Tarantino's trademark style and Westerns in general it's doesn't get much better than this."
"mkhawa","8","5","19","8 January 2016"," Suspenseful, unpredictable, hilarious, and shocking all at the same time. Anyone expecting something similar to 'Django' or 'Basterds' will be disappointed.
","First of all, before you see this film, erase any expectations you may have in your head about what you're about to see. All you need to know is that this is a murder mystery disguised as a western and is a unique experience unlike any film you've seen in a very long time. This movie is obviously not for the squeamish or for those who like their films politically correct that ends with the hero riding off into the sunset. <br/><br/>Suspenseful, unpredictable, hilarious, and shocking all at the same time; this movie challenges the audience in many ways. The much- discussed use of the 'n' word is here but QT uses it to establish the world that these characters live in. This film in many ways is a huge metaphor on race relations in America today especially with recent headlines concerning police brutality against black people. Also, this movie was purposefully made so that there is no ""moral center"" or clear cut ""good guy"". Every main character in this movie has a murky past that makes it hard for the audience to trust any of them. This is what differentiates this film over QT's earlier mainstream hits like ""Django Unchained"" or ""Inglorious Basterds"". As such, this might rub some viewers the wrong way who prefer their films to have a clearly defined ""good guy"" to root for. <br/><br/>All of the actors here give incredible performances from A to Z. My only complaint is that it could have been shortened a bit. But overall, it's another solid creation by Tarantino that I believe will be more appreciated as time goes on."

","I was surprised by how entertaining this movie is, despite its long runtime. And what's best: no flamboyant displays of technique and large budget. A honest film, that relies on a compelling story and fine acting. The rather complex plot reveals itself as we watch the interactions between the quirky characters, accompanied by a sensible dose of humour. The overall look of the movie is of good taste, and the influence of old westerns is blatant right in the opening credits.<br/><br/>The portrayal of violence is crude, that's true. That will be noticeable right in the first scenes. But, frankly, no one should expect something different from a Tarantino movie. No complex, multi-layered, thoughtful social critique here; just archetypal (almost bizarre) western characters doing what they do best. By the way, the cast choices seemed very appropriate. Samuel L. Jackson absolutely nails all the badassness, dark humour and integrity his character requires.<br/><br/>I think that the director managed to showcase again distinctive elements of his work, making this a worthy watch. I must admit that some aspects of the gruesome plot left me a bit upset, but that does not diminish the quality of the film at all. Just remember: this is a Tarantino western."

","If you are a true fan of Tarantino. This movie is gold. The more I think about this movie the more I love it. <br/><br/>A post civil war setting of the cold Midwest brings 8 amazing characters (played by the best Tarantino actors) to a lonesome cabin where someone is not who they say they are. <br/><br/>Amazing dialogue written by Quentin once again gives extreme tension to each scene. Never knowing what could happen next. Twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>This movie is for Cinematic Film Lovers. It is for those who know tension and dialogue are what makes a Tarantino movie. If you are looking for 3 hours of gunfights, with blood and cursing. You are going to be disappointed. You still get Tarantino gore though I promise. <br/><br/>Now not all movies are perfect which is why I originally rated this a 9/10.

","Great casting some great performances. Jennifer Jason Leigh & Kurt Russell in particular. You either love Tarantino or you hate him, personally i love the touches that show life in Movieland should not always be perfect, sometimes the damn door is just wrecked and wont close, and sometimes old hard cases need to put their glasses on before reading a letter that moves them to tears just before they beat up on someone. Leigh is brilliant and her character has you on a journey from, who is she, to a total loss of any respect or sympathy for her character to the point where you think she had it coming to her, Leigh somehow carries it off perfectly. Some Oscar performances, however judging from some of the other reviews on here there are plenty of haters, to whom all i can say sometimes you need time to tell a good story. For example the scene where the Jackson character is revealed as the teller of tall tales, the facial expressions of Russell without saying a word could have books on psychology written about them, now that is what i call acting, personally for me the time flew past, and i have watched it again and again, enjoying it each time.<br/><br/>Omg just had to add after last night Golden Globes no wins virtually no nominations.

"michaelcwilson","10","7","30","26 December 2015"," A Film for Cinema Buffs and Tarantino Fans Alike
","For those confused about what all the major publications are saying about Quentin Tarantino's latest flick: don't pay attention to anything they say.<br/><br/>Tarantino is known to stir the pot with his films and this might be his most bold film to date. There is graphic violence, albeit not immediately so be patient and don't complain that someone's head doesn't get blown off in the first 30 minutes. The ""n"" word and ""b"" word are both used a lot, so if you can't handle that don't even bother watching it. As a black man and someone who hates misogyny, I found this film not offensive. All the language and bad treatment towards women was contextual and expand your mind if you don't see it the same way.<br/><br/>No matter what you think about the film's content, everyone will probably admit that the cinematography is flawless. Tarantino didn't make this using 70mm for nothing and even at points where the film moves slow, it's still a delight to look at. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into detail about the plot because you probably already know it and it's best to go into this film without much insight into what possibly might happen. It's basically 8 strangers staying in a cabin together, all criminals in some way who don't trust each other. Tarantino builds tension throughout and even though there's not violence every 10 minutes at any moment you feel like something serious could go down. The storyline is pretty crazy, there's enough twists and unpredictability to keep a cinema buff or Tarantino fan at the edge of their seat.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Jackson is great as usual, Tarantino vets Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen are solid. Walton Goggins was the breakout performer to me as a lot of the dark humor comes from his lines, I hope to see him get some award recognition for his role. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I don't think I knew from anything besides Fast Times prior to this film deserves her Golden Globe nod. You genuinely hate her character, but you still understand her motivations and it doesn't prevent you from enjoying her great acting skills. Channing Tatum was solid in his first film role as a villain and fellow newcomer Demian Bichir was a surprise (loved him on FX's The Bridge!).<br/><br/>Things do get really ugly, really fast but the film's 2 hour and 47 min run time (3 hours for the Roadshow version!) does require patience. There are a few moments where the dialogue gets a little dull, but Tarantino is a wise man who knows how to keep his audience wrapped in his film. Just go in expecting a Tarantino film and an excellent Tarantino film you'll receive. As of now it's my favorite film of the year."

I loved the long & slow relaxed storytelling & interesting & strange characters, i love Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson & Bruce Dern!!!
A fantastic superb cast of talent involved.
The Hateful 8 is a long wild ride through the thick snowy countryside & further, the cold atmosphere is exciting & fun & full of mystery!!!
The dialogue is excellent & smart as usual for the genius Tarantino & his mix of strange characters are given full room to breathe & play out.
The performances are great especially from Kurt Russell & Samuel L Jackson!!! Both are on top form & are fantastic on screen.
Yes Kurt Russell is excellent & Samuel L Jackson is excellent, these two performances are the best in the film in my opinion, but hell the cast is superb all around!!!<br/><br/>At times this movie definitely feels like it's Going into the Horror genre & feels very ""Evil Dead"" at times when the stage is set up at the stagecoach stopover where different travellers are taking refuge from a major blizzard.
There's an exciting who's gonna turn on who feel to it & a sense of doom, each character is given room to shine & when it gets bloody it gets bloody, old school brutal violence explodes accross the screen.
I loved the beautiful cinematography & the old school music score, this is top notch film making by a master at his most relaxed & confident.<br/><br/>This is basically in a way Tarantino's ""The Thing"" but set around Civil War times & without an Alien but the mood, look, Atmosphere, music & the presence of the legendary Kurt Russell is just like ""The Thing""

The characters cannot help but interact with each other, and the personalities are forced out of people.<br/><br/>I must also say that Kurt Russell's character is one of my favorites, as the bounty hunter determined to hand over personally his current bounty, for whom most of the story takes place.<br/><br/>Really good movie.<br/><br/>8 stars"

Yet, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked Django Unchained I decided to cue up Netflix and give The Hateful Eight a shot.<br/><br/>It didn't take long for me to realize I had a Tarantino flick on my hands. The first 30 minutes is the typical dialogue heavy stuff, the Tarantino blueprint. At one point about 45 minutes in I was so close to turning the movie off, but I stayed with it. It was just too much characters talking and nothing happening. I knew that at some point they would all be confined together in a cabin or house so I told myself to wait it out, perhaps it will get better. If these are my feelings to this point does it sound like a 10/10 movie?<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh's character was a bright spot. She didn't say much but I thought her mannerisms and facial expressions were perfect. I think in a way she kept me in the movie to see what would happen to her. Kudos to the makeup team that successfully had her looking beat to hell.<br/><br/>I was interested to see what would happen in Red Rock, but because it's a Tarantino movie they were never going to get there. All hell had to break loose first. The inevitable slaughter scene took place. Heads exploding, etc. I would have liked a little mystery twist at the end, but instead it was the girl just simply suspected of lying and so everyone dies.<br/><br/>I think ending with reading Abraham Lincoln's letter was supposed to......what was it supposed to do again?<br/><br/>If you're a Tarantino fan you'll probably(?) like this movie.

It has a chapter layout where segments of the film are started with a black screen with a chapter number and title. I like this. I like the way the whole thing is laid out. You don't see movies like this that often. The characters all work well together because the director uses a lot of the same actors in his films and they all know and are comfortable with each other and it shows. The quality and polish of a Tarantino film is remarkable. For a man that's only made a handful of movies, he knows what he is doing. This movie is a whodunit. Executed superbly. As the run-time rolls on and more things are revealed, the tension builds within the characters. No one is safe. Don't fall too hard for a certain character cause they could be the next one to die.

Neither is the film's quality, which is just fine - acting, directing, script, all is fine. It carries through 'till the end, and you really want to see what will happen.

There are some fun stuff, like the personal letter from Linkoln that Sam L. Jackson carries around, but, there's not very much of it. Apart the Tim Roth's monologue on the purpose of an executioner in a ""civilized"" society, there are very few thought-provoking moments.<br/><br/>Given that it is as unrealistic as Tarantino is, it can't serve as a study of human behavior or some such thing.<br/><br/>So, what you're left is a master movie-maker doing his thing. Like a very well done painting that doesn't insight any feeling other than ""this artist can paint"". Which is fine, of course, but it would be nice if there were more."

","Am I the only one to think this movie is a comedy and a good one at that. Nothing in this movie is serious in plot, action, dialogs, acting (way over the top with everybody)or anything else. Please forget about the messages, the hidden meanings... Tarantino had fun and made it fun for us to watch. I wish one day he matures and gives us a good profound movie. Tarantino is a good director, no doubt he is very talented. But to be a great director, you need to be able to do it all: comedy, drama, Sci-Fi, ...

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In Wyoming, at the end of the Civil War, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is making his way across the snow drenched mountains with his charge Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is to be hanged. He runs into Major Marcus Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), with whom he strikes up an uneasy alliance, and they make their way to a secluded cabin. There, they encounter a whole host of colourful characters, including British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), surly cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), who just wants to get home for Christmas, and grouchy old confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern.) But their circumstances for being there may not be as innocent as it seems.<br/><br/>I recently brought a box set of what are all presumably regarded as Tarantino's finest films, which, owning a lot of DVDs as I do, helps to condense space and make room for other titles to be added. Despite his highly acclaimed status in the film world, the man is highly selective, and in comparison with other contemporaries, has only really made a handful of films in a twenty five year career. This box set not only seemed to comprise presumably his finest films, but also seemed to serve as a summary of his defining years, when he established his style as a film-maker, before he took a break for a few years, and tried to make films on a grander, more ambitious scale.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is the latest film made in a style that those familiar with Tarantino's films of more recent times will be familiar, and older devotees perhaps more weary of. The first hour/half hour or so gives off the impression of him paying homage to the films he was fond of in his youth, leaving a pretentious, self indulgent air that seems the staple-mark of his work of late. His trademark use of dialogue and exposition to establish a scene is in evidence, but does nothing to convey any sense of suspense or excitement. It really tests your patience like this for quite a while, but somehow if you bear with it, once the fingers start pointing and the guns start shooting, it does pay off, and becomes a lot more intelligent and intricate, building to an unexpected and highly satisfying climax.<br/><br/>Cast wise, Tarantino favourite Jackson reliably takes centre stage again, eventually joined by other familiar QT faces Madsen and Roth, doing an obviously phony but enjoyably campy accentuated Brit voice. The 'comeback' stars, being another of the man's 'trademark' touches, would probably be Russell and Leigh. While these two fail to develop what could be deemed a 'double act', individually they each carry off the personas of two grumpy, hate filled individuals quite well. Towards the end, new face Channing Tatum even shows up to maybe give some appeal to a younger crowd.<br/><br/>It really could have done with a more involving opening, which would usually spell the death knell for most films. QT really needs to try and connect once again with his original style of film making, where his short and sweet approach worked wonders whilst applying his trade mark use of dialogue and atmosphere. All you can do is test your endurance and stick around for the impressive and satisfying final round. ****"

","12 January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Hateful Eight. The latest eagerly awaited offering from Quentin Tarantino. That man is a genius. He gives us this film - which took more than thirty minutes to get going - it had a very small cast, little in the way of location with it all mainly being set inside the one log cabin, and a good helping of blood and gore, and you leave the cinema wondering exactly what it was all about. However, his genius lies in his casting, the script, which contained some excellent one liners and his sheer bloody mindedness with which he gets his story across. By the end of the film I was absolutely riveted and had no idea just exactly how things would turn out. A superb performance from Kurt Russell, great to see him on screen, I enjoyed watching the skills of Walton Goggins once again, and the unmistakable talent that is Samuel L. Jackson who only enhances every film that he is in. Not for everyone but if you're a Tarantino fan, make this a must watch."

I won't repeat what the other users said, but I insist, this movie is not destined to wide audiences, or for the Sunday evening program, with the whole family around the table for dinner, with grand ma and grand pa... No, Tarantino perfectly knew what he did when he wrote and shot this masterpiece, where there is no real lead, no hero, nor super hero, where all the characters are more or less disgusting, where you have no love story for sissies... And what a pleasure to find the too rare Jennifer Jason Leigh, who, thirty years later, after the terrific HITCHER, FLESH AND BLOOD or LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN, still have the same characters, the female who is tortured, burned, raped, beaten to death, quartered between trucks, shot at: Yes, Jennifer is still the perfect female victim by excellence, as she was thirty years ago. I also realize that, she was the perfect Tarantino's atmosphere female character, I should have thought of her in all his previous films, such as the GRINDHOUSE segment he made, starring Kurt Russell. Yes Jennifer Jason Leigh should have been in Tarantino's films since a long time, she hes the good profile for it. Too late is better than never. I hope her career will be boosted this way.

","From the amusingly warped mind of Quentin Tarantino comes this combination western/whodunit/character study set in post-Civil War era Wyoming. In the midst of a brutal blizzard, the titular strangers seek shelter at a local tavern but it soon becomes clear that not everyone is what they seem as startling revelations come to the fore. By now you know that whenever you hear this director's name and get pulled into his world that nothing will go quite the way you expect it to, but despite a flavorful cast of characters, vivid setting, and the expected scintillating dialogue, this is a surprisingly unmemorable effort; begins with an effectively tense and teasing build-up, but goes on way too long, with a final act that's relentlessly (and needlessly) violent, ugly, and mean, instead of twistedly fun like so many of the director's previous efforts. Playing out like some weird amalgam of Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained, and Clue, this is self-indulgent to a fault, and doesn't provide a very resounding resolution given the excruciating length of time it takes to tell this story. **½"
"chicagopoetry","8","8","36","20 December 2015"," Tarantino's Tribute to his own early days
","Watched The Hateful Eight. It's quite literally a combination of Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs, and his most recent, Django, as it's set in a claustrophobic environment like Dogs and is a Western dealing with racism like Django and is a brutal bloodbath like both those films. It's truly an ugly film without any morals and this is a huge swing for Tarantino who tried to get all moral with his last few films. The acting is impressive throughout (Samuel L. Jackson is actually the lead character in this one) and the thin plot is forgivable because anyone who has followed Tarantino up until now knows the point is the great big monologue leading up to the sudden eruption of violence, and in this sense it certainly does not disappoint. I doubt this is going to score any Oscars because this time around it is truly a b-movie rather than a parody of one, but if you love Tarantino for his earliest work this one will seem like it should have been his third film, not his eighth."
"StevePulaski","9","6","25","4 January 2016"," A glorious bloodbath that celebrates the strengths of Tarantino and the incorruptible aesthetics of his films
","Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" has gone through hell and back again to get made, originally axed after Tarantino's distribution of the script to Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen led to one of the men leaking it onto the internet. After more-or-less throwing a tantrum over the entire event and shelving the project as a result, Tarantino, with massive fan support, per usual, decided to pursue turning the story into a film once again, and all seemed well until the film itself was leaked onto the internet just a few days before the release.<br/><br/>The checkered history of the film's release before it was even able to be seen in a theater - where the film should ultimately be seen - is one of the strangest for a mainstream film in many years. In my opinion, however, it only adds to the craziness that is ""The Hateful Eight"" as a whole. At just under three hours (or just over, if you catch the 70mm/Ultra Panavision 70 version in over one-hundred theaters in America), Tarantino's sprawling epic is a smartly written mystery, largely acting as a stageplay about eccentric souls stuck inside a haberdashery in the midst of a relentless and frigid Wyoming blizzard.<br/><br/>The film opens with Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a local bounty hunter, hitching a ride from a notorious bounty hunter named John Ruth (Kurt Russell), also known as ""The Hangman."" Ruth has a woman named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) shackled to his arm, as he plans to turn her in for the $10,000 bounty as soon as they get to a place called ""Red Rock."" Warren tags along in order to get to a place called Minnie's Haberdashery to wait out the blizzard before finally traveling to Red Rock. Along the way, the three pick up a man named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who claims to be the new sheriff in town, and upon arriving at the haberdashery, the four are acquainted with another shady bunch of men, including a quirky Englishman (Tim Roth), a Mexican man (Demián Bichir), a ""cow puncher"" (Michael Madsen), and a largely quiet World War I veteran (Bruce Dern).<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is undoubtedly my favorite Tarantino film since ""Death Proof"" (noticed I said ""favorite,"" not ""best""), even if we're only going to speak of the film's immaculate cinematography, done by frequent collaborator Robert Richardson. Speaking as someone who doesn't know a great deal of anamorphic aspect ratios or the core issues with film and digital media, I'll explain the effects of Ultra Panavision 70 in layman's terms. 70mm basically allows for extremely wide-widescreen shots, allowing for a grand scope to be seen. Where full-screen typically letterboxes the sides of a film and, in turn, cuts off the sides of the image and widescreen allows those formerly subtracted sides to be seen, Panavision allows for a much wider shot to include even more than a widescreen image ever could.<br/><br/>As a result, the film looks like what a widescreen film used to look like on your old Television set, where the imagine is a long rectangle with black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The decision for Tarantino and Richardson to shoot ""The Hateful Eight"" in this manner allows the luscious imagery of the snow-covered mountains in Wyoming to be shown with pristine detail and beauty. Even though more than half of the film takes place inside a haberdashery, Tarantino still manages to use 70mm to capture the details of characters' costumes, facial expressions, and backgrounds in a way that's simultaneously subtle and decorated.<br/><br/>With that, ""The Hateful Eight"" is also a brilliant collection of seriously compelling performances, especially from Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell, both men giving very different performances. Jackson plays menacing but eloquent in a way that he hasn't quite done since ""Pulp Fiction,"" while Russell shows that working with Tarantino consistently brings out the best in him as an actor. Russell needs to fire on all cylinders here, occasionally having his character be more laidback and reasonable, despite largely acting as a blunt-force ready to bash Daisy's face in whenever she steps out of line. His performance here is a truly magnificent work of diverse acting abilities, and with Tarantino's liberal runtime, he's about to include and emphasize that kind of layered acting.<br/><br/>Being a Tarantino film, you will inevitably get your accusations of homophobia, with one particular monologue by Samuel L. Jackson that does go a bit too far in terms of not being too funny or very relevant as much as it is for shock, racism, with Tarantino's excessive use of the n-word, and misogyny thanks to the only real female role in this film being a punching bag for the men (though Leigh does indeed get time for her and her character to shine). My biggest gripe with Tarantino's unchanging style is that the violence in the last act of the film takes away from the engaging setup and grace the first act really emphasized. The slowburn opening of the film really capitalized off of a premise that was going to take its time to move from character-to-character, but Tarantino seems to be unable to remedy or push his appetite for violence and bloodshed by the wayside by the conclusion of the film.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is still a devilishly interesting film; at nearly three hours, it's never boring and through terrific performances and seriously beautiful cinematography, reminds audiences why we love Tarantino for all that he can do and do so well. For as merciless and as violent as this film can be, it's also an undeniably great time and an aesthetic achievement for the director himself, which, in a day and age where Tarantino can pretty much say three words and make front page news, is about the most we can ask from him."
"negativeions101","7","6","25","25 December 2015"," Maybe the time has come for QT to get a little taste of humble pie.
","Tarantino once said something to the effect of how he wished certain directors would watch their older stuff to be reminded of the great movies they once made and that if he ever got to that point he'd consider quitting making movies. I can't recall the exact quote or source but something like that. Anyways, it looks like that time may have come for Tarantino. And it's a sad day in hell.<br/><br/>Depending on your tastes for westerns this could be considered Tarantino's weakest effort I guess. Having said that it's still OK. I enjoyed it to an extent. Vicious humor, intense story, etc. I want to talk about what I didn't like and what could have been done better. There's potentially a really good flick here but:<br/><br/>For what it is, it's too long. A) People need to say their lines faster. Don't get me wrong, I think Wall-E promotes ADD, but come on. I didn't see any real good reason to drag out dialogue so much like that. In fact it kind of makes you look like a jerk as a director. B) Cut out unnecessary stuff. If this was a tighter flick, closer to 2 hours, I'd bet my life people would have less issues with it.<br/><br/>Secondly, sometimes the film treats the audience a bit too stupid. Like the narration or the second shot of the gun under the table when Madson's character asks to sit down. Just unnecessary.<br/><br/>Thirdly, in an increasingly PC time, the psychosis and violence might not go over too well with people.<br/><br/>Overall, not sure if it's Tarantino's weakest. But maybe second weakest after Death Proof. Death proof had so much unnecessary dialogue but it was such a cool idea. I think, instead of threatening to quit and whining over projection, Tarantino should take his own advice. Then keep going. We love you buddy, just take a bite of humble pie sometimes and respect the audience."

","In post civil war American frontier, the bounty hunter John Ruth rides a coach steered by OB Jackson to Red Rock in a blizzard, bringing in the fugitive Daisy Domergue to collect. On the way they meet another bounty hunter former Union Major Marquis Warren. Ruth lets him in though with some doubts for they've met once before. Warren lets him see his correspondence letter with Lincoln. Soon the coach finds another man hitching a ride in the blizzard, Chris Mannix, who claims to be the new Sheriff for Red Rock. Again Ruth gives a ride with caution. They reach Minnie's Haberdashery in the mountains to rest for the blizzard. Minnie wasn't there and a Mexican named Bob welcomes them. Inside Ruth finds earlier guests Joe Gage, Oswaldo Mobray who claims to be the area's hangman, and an old man. Warren, Mannix, OB, and Bob tend to the horses before going in. Warren questions Bob's employment at Minnie's. Inside, Mannix recognize the old man as a former Confederate General Smithers, and Warren does too as he was at opposite sides at the Battle of Chattanooga with the general. As their dialog heats up, Mobray suggests they stay on opposite corners of the room as northerners and southerners.<br/><br/>Ruth suspects something's fishy, so he makes a clear warning to everybody, and collects the earlier guests' pistols. At dinner Mannix claims that Warren's Lincoln letter is fake, which disappoints Ruth. Bob starts playing Silent night on the piano, and Warren chats with Smithers. Warren reveals that he killed Smithers' son, and he puts a gun beside Smithers. This gets to Smithers and as he grabs the gun Warren shoots him dead. The others don't question the killing as it was self defense. But nobody else knew while Warren was revealing about Smithers' son, someone poisoned the coffee and Daisy saw it. Mannix is about to when OB and Ruth, after drinking the coffee, suddenly vomit blood and die. Ruth had time to warn Mannix about it. Daisy kills the dying Ruth, and Warren quickly control the situation. He rounds up the men as suspects, but dismisses Mannix as he almost drink the coffee himself. Warren reveals that he knows Minnie and her stew, that Minnie disliked Mexicans. Warren kills Bob then hell breaks lose as somebody in the basement opens fire, causing Mannix, Warren and Mobray getting shot.<br/><br/>The movie flips back to the morning before at Minnie's. Four passengers in a coach reach Minnie's. They are Joe Gage, Oswaldo Mobray, Bob and their gang leader Jody Domingray, Daisy's brother. They dispatched everybody else except an old man in order to keep the place's pretended mood. Back to the story so far, Mannix and Warren survives with grave wounds, pointing guns at the gang. Daisy and Gage is uninjured, so is Jody in the basement, while Mobray is also gravely injured. Warren and Mannix threaten to kill Daisy to lure Jody out, and kill him as he does. Daisy negotiates a deal with Mannix, offering Mobray's and Bob's bounty. Mobray backs Daisy's talk up, but Warren shoots him dead. In the commotion Gage reaches for a hidden gun but Warren and Mannix get to him first. Warren shoots at Daisy but he's out of bullets. Mannix keeps Daisy talking but eventually doesn't buy it. But he faints and Daisy goes for Gage's loaded gun. Mannix wakes up and shoots Daisy, disarming her. Warren says that they shouldn't just kill her. Instead they must hang her in honor of John Ruth who saved Mannix.<br/><br/>I got to say this December is surely a great month for it has some great movies worth the score 8 out of 10. The Hateful Eight (2015) surely deserves such a score. Story-wise it's an intriguing piece, very well done in the classic Tarantino style of storytelling. The story gets to be deeply character driven, offering seeds of mystery and suspicion all along the way. The twists and turns were laid out and positioned very well. The mood and pace did greatly in helping story to achieve critical mass.<br/><br/>Since the beginning, Tarantino movies have always had their strong part in the dialog. They effectively steer the scene, deepening the character introduction, and ultimately helping the audience let down their guard and anticipation for the surprises and twists to have maximum effect. I like how Tarantino have always make his movies have certain levels of humor, even amid bloody scenes. But it's exceptionally funny in this movie as there are more laugh spots spread across the movie.<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the movie displays great cinematography work. You can spot great timing direction that resulted in the long single shot at the very beginning. There are also classic camera angles and moving camera examples here and there, which are rarely found on westerns. The blood effects are really a signature of Quentin Tarantino movies. What's great to see here is that those blood work has been improved very well that they appear very grandiose. Maybe they look less realistic, but they sure look more artistic.<br/><br/>The acting work in overall is a great work. Samuel L. Jackson is just an essential part in a Tarantino movie. It's like not having him in one makes the movie feels awkward. Kurt Russell did great in adding into the fray, contributing very well to the movie's starting first half. Jennifer Jason Leigh did well enough in her character's concealment of the plot twist. What's bad about the cast is that we tend to see many old faces that frequent Tarantino movies. We have additions like Channing Tatum here, but the main cast only has Russell and Jason-Leigh as the new faces.<br/><br/>Nevertheless an 8 out of 10 score is rightfully deserving for this latest Quentin Tarantino movie. A recommendation goes out from me as I enjoyed this movie very much as I did Django, the Basterds, Kill Bill, and Pulp Fiction."

"dave-mcclain","9","8","37","1 January 2016"," ""The Hateful Eight"" is vintage Tarantino, but more grounded and accessible than most of his films.
","Sometimes the experience of seeing a movie is best described as an ""event"". I'm not talking about the massive crowds or fans wearing costumes to the theater, ala ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". I'm talking about a filmmaker designing everything concerning his movie to be special. Love him or hate him, this is exactly what Quentin Tarantino did with ""The Hateful Eight"" (R, 2:47). This project was so special to him that when a draft of the script leaked out, he announced that he'd write the story as a novel, but not make it into a film, changing his mind only after an L.A. reading of the draft script went extremely well and Tarantino was convinced by Samuel L. Jackson himself. When the writer-director-producer got production back on track, he seemed to embrace the credo ""Go big or go home."" Tarantino shot the movie with old-style 70mm film stock and made sure that 100 theaters in 46 cities across the U.S. had or reinstalled old-school movie projectors that could show the film as intended. The December 25, 2015 release in those cities was a ""roadshow presentation"", a release template rarely used since the 1960s. This roadshow involved the distribution of souvenir programs about the movie, showing a somewhat longer version of the film (187 minutes, including an overture and an intermission) and shown, of course, ""in Ultra Panavision 70""! If you weren't able to get to a roadshow presentation of the film, you can still appreciate its stunning western vistas on screen in a somewhat abbreviated 167 minute version, complete with new (and some older, previously unused) music by the legendary Ennio Morricone, scoring his first western in 40 years! Of course, all this begs the question of whether this film is worthy of all these special production and release arrangements The film is divided into six ""chapters"", each beginning with a black title card with white letters, as it tells the story of eight mysterious characters trapped by a blizzard in 1870s Wyoming. As the movie opens, bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is riding in a stagecoach, chained to Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), on whose head is a $10,000 price tag. Ruth likes to bring in his human prizes alive so he can give the local hangman some business – and watch them hang. Fellow bounty hunter, Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), does things quite differently.<br/><br/>When Ruth's stage comes upon Warren standing in the road beside three corpses, Warren asks the driver, O.B. Jackson (James Parks), if he has ""room for one more"", O.B. defers to Ruth who recognizes Warren and welcomes him, along with his ""luggage"". A short time later, they come across another man on foot, with a blizzard approaching. Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) says that his horse broke a leg as he was riding to Red Rock to be sworn in as the new sheriff. Ruth doubts that story and Warren isn't happy that Mannix turns out to be an unrepentant Confederate, but Mannix convinces the men to allow him to ride with them.<br/><br/>With the winter weather worsening, the stage stops at Minnie's Haberdashery where the passengers and their driver can rest and get something to eat and drink while they wait out the storm. There are four other men inside Minnie's – Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), British gentleman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who introduces himself as a traveling hangman, quiet cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and ""Bob the Mexican"" (Demián Bichir) who explains that Minnie left him in charge of the haberdashery while she went to visit her mother. Ruth is uncomfortable with these strangers and is concerned about someone trying to prevent him from getting to Red Rock and collecting his bounty on Domergue. He expresses his instinct that at least one of Minnie's guests ""is not who he says he is"".<br/><br/>Ruth's not wrong. The questions for us, as audience members, are figuring out who – and how many of these characters are misrepresenting themselves – and why. We try to figure out the answers as we watch the people on screen doing the same thing – and trying to get along well enough to survive the storm, in spite of their conflicting agendas and prejudices. Then, just when things inside that cold cabin really start to heat up, Tarantino pulls the bear skin rug out from underneath everyone. After Chapters One through Four tell us a chronological story, Chapter Five show us what happened early that day, then the Last Chapter picks up the action where we left it – for the intense and predictably violent conclusion.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is vintage Tarantino, but more accessible than most of his films. For example, like his previous film, 2012's ""Django Unchained"", this one takes place in the 19th century, deals with the ugly results of slavery, gives the black man a chance for some payback and even incorporates the character of a well-spoken European gentleman. Unlike most of Tarantino's films, however, almost all of the violence is saved for the last half of the film (but when it starts, it's as bloody as you'd expect), and this movie tells a story that's more linear than ""Pulp Fiction"" and based on a scenario that's more realistic than ""Inglourious Basterds"". The screenplay is smart and has some funny moments. The dialog is a pleasure to hear (if you're not bothered by Tarantino's well-known liberal use of profanity, including the n-word). The film's excellent performances sell the story – and entertain wonderfully. All this, topped off with Morricone's magnificent score, the spectacular scenery and cinematography which captures it, make this film an experience – nay, an event not to be missed. ""A"""

The actors give every sign of enjoying themselves immensely, and I spent a lot of time laughing, recoiling, wondering and gawping.<br/><br/>I apologise Mr Tarantino, It took me a while... but you are indeed a fine film maker."
"nicholas_i","8","6","26","28 December 2015"," The Art of Taratino Storytelling
","When I was 15 years old, I got my hands on a movie called ""Pulp Fiction"". Needless to say, it had quite an impact on me. I had never witnessed such a unique art of storytelling; what genre do you even classify such a movie like that as? To me, they simply came to be known as ""Quentin Tarantino movies"".<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight can only be described as ""Classic Tarantino"". I felt like that was lacking in the Kill Bill movies and Inglorious Bastards (though they were great movies in their own right).<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight, in my opinion, was like revisiting classic Tarantino story telling. The movie is like reading a mystery novel with a Western theme. The movie had great character development and the script, pace, violence and music were all on point with Tarantino's work. The plot definitely kept me engrossed through the film and having some familiar face (Sam Jackson, Tim Roth) was a pleasure as well.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10, because among Quentin Tarantino movies, it was still not at the level of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed any of Tarantino's film, you should definitely give this a shot."
"mblanco-csi","8","4","15","19 January 2016"," Wonderful characters, great humor, intriguing dialogue. Another great Tarantino Flick!
","I was skeptical going into this film due to the many mixed reviews it has produced. As many have said before, don't listen to the negative reviews if your a Tarantino fan or a respectable cinema lover and know what makes a good film.<br/><br/>The characters are great, as expected from any Tarantino film. Each one is very unique in their own way, and the dialogue between all of them is wonderful, witty and hilarious at times. The film has a very similar feel to Reservoir Dogs and The Thing, which is expected as these two films were the main inspiration for this movie. It is a very Dialogue heavy film so I can see how some were turned off by this. It almost feels like watching a Play rather than a film which is wonderful in it's own right. The music is great, Morricone did a wonderful job and it is really refreshing to hear an original score play out in one of Tarantino's films. You really get involved in the story and environment of the film as it plays out. It is a long film for sure and it really starts to pick up in the second half of the film. Overall it is a wonderful addition to Tarantino's films and shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves good cinema. I definitely want to and will see it again!"
"danchees","8","4","15","18 January 2016"," Well done, sir!
","In many ways, this is a movie of polar opposites. For a start, it was really hard for me to watch – overly long and in many places redundant or simply pointless. After first viewing I wanted to give it a four or five, but then the day after, scene after scene started coming back to me. And chuckle after chuckle, here we are, discussing if it should have been nominated for an Oscar. It certainly has all the makings of a great movie – a renowned director who can have his own way, a stellar cast and plot that is of theatre play variety. But Interstellar, another big movie with all the same ingredients failed miserably. So these things cannot be all it takes.<br/><br/>I believe that one thing to bind them all is simply - spirit. And there is so much spirit in this movie it almost needs an exorcist. You cannot but admire utter insistence to explore every pointless dialogue, action or reaction produced by eight unlikely roommates in snowed-in, of all things – haberdashery! Movie is a testament of because I can"" attitude which, after Nolan's great failure (yes, I cannot forgive that one), is probably possible only with Tarantino.<br/><br/>Great theatre plays manage to execute two actions simultaneously simply because you can naturally encompass the full stage in your view. It is almost impossible on screen with focus playing the judge of attention. But there is an entire act in this movie where you have an action defined and demonstrated (Bob trying to perform Silent night"") and then only implied through audio cues. And while watching an entirely unrelated scene, I could still hold an image of Bob in my mind and portray to myself exactly what and how he is doing. Only a master director can pull such a thing off, and here we have one, folks!<br/><br/>Cinematography is wonderful, Ennio Moricone's score is brilliant, cast is, well a mixed bag. I did not particularly like how Kurt Russel and Jennifer Jason Leigh worked together. They just appear a bit forced, doubly a failure as movie is all about grotesque and overemphasis. On the other side, Samuel Jackson (as expected) and Bruce Dern (surprisingly) had best performances and steal the show in their respective acts. Oh, and Bob (Demian Bichir). Bob can be my uncle anytime!"

","In an era where I feel there is a serious lack of interesting films , too many aimed at the Attention deficient generation who lap up the sea of cookie cutter big budget franchises or the mind numbing amount of superhero / comic book films, we can be grateful we have a director like Tarantino doing what he does best. <br/><br/>This is as good as any film Tarantino has made, Hateful Eight had similar beats to reservoir dogs, so if you dig that and QT's dialogue and quirky characters, then it's worth your time.<br/><br/>For those of you who have the attention span of a goldfish and like your action served up in spades with dialogue that was written by the scriptwriter on the back of his cigarette packets, then this isn't the film for you."
"khang_tran","9","4","15","15 January 2016"," Quentin Tarantino reinvents himself in his 8th installment
","And then to think that Tarantino didn't want to make this film after its script leaked in January 2014. However, after Samuel L. Jackson read the script, he insisted that Tarantino tell this story on the big screen and I'm glad he did! <br/><br/>Tarantino's eighth film is coincidentally called ""the Hateful Eight"" and tells the story about two bounty hunters in post-Civil War Wyoming traveling to Red Rock to collect their bounty and have to stay at a nearby resting spot to escape from a blizzard. Here, they meet up with other suspicious characters staying in Minnie's Haberdashery, who are possibly interested in the bounty they brought along. <br/><br/>These bounty hunters are John Ruth and major Marquis Warren, played excellently by Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson respectively. Both deliver Tarantino's patented dialogue with great gravitas and perform very well off each other. Plenty of Tarantino regulars return as members of the Hateful Eight and give great acting performances, such as Bruce Dern, Tim Roth (in an eloquent Christoph Waltz-like role), Michael Madsen, Zoe Bell, James Parks and Walton Goggins. Goggins especially gave my favorite performance as sheriff Chris Mannix. With only a minor role in Django Unchained, Walton Goggins gives a great comedic performance with excellent line delivery. A real revelation in this movie is Jennifer Jason Leigh's depiction of Daisy Domergue, the live bounty everyone seems to be interested in. Her performance was incredibly charming and also showed the best character development throughout the movie when she is put in different situations of power.<br/><br/>All of these actors look good because of the superb script written by Quentin Tarantino. The dialogue is excellent and interesting as always, with all the characters being fully fleshed out as you discover more of their background stories as the movie progresses. It also contains a great plot twist, resulting in a bloody and violent conclusion. <br/><br/>Interestingly, the overall feel of The Hateful Eight is different compared to Tarantino's earlier work. It takes some time to get into the pace of the movie and the thriller/who-did-it-like vibe, but once you're in it, it makes for a truly amusing ride. Tarantino wanted to put on a show for people to be intrigued again when going to the cinema. That is clearly noticeable in his latest 70mm project. Fans of Tarantino need not to be worried, as his signature use of non-chronological chapters and abundant presence of gore and profanity are still in place. <br/><br/>However, the aspects I enjoyed the most of the Hateful Eight were the magnificent score by Western legend Ennio Morricone and the stunning cinematography by Robert Richardson. The score itself gives this movie its character with great suspense-building music, while maintaining the Tarantino trumpet-like theme. Robert Richardson was given the opportunity to work with Panavision 70mm and used it excellently. Not only did he film gorgeous wide landscape images 70mm can provide, but also put it to great use during intimate conversation scenes. Using the extra width, Richardson puts extra characters in the background of the frame during 1-on-1 dialogue scenes, giving it a more claustrophobic feel and raising suspicion. All in all an amazing accomplishment in cinematography. <br/><br/>My only minor flaws with the film is some inconsistency with the pace early on where Tarantino chooses to linger on during scenes without apparent reason. Also, I found a part of Samuel L. Jackson's monologue midway through the movie about his earlier interaction with a relative of one of the other characters a bit too vulgar, even for a Tarantino movie. It felt childish and out of place compared the tone of the rest of the screenplay. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the Hateful Eight is another expertly crafted movie by Quentin Tarantino with a great classical Western feel. An interesting story combined with excellent sound and visuals results in an amazing movie going experience. With possibly only 2 movies left in Tarantino's arsenal, these kinds of projects really increase your appreciation of the man and his stamp on original film making."

This ain't Vin Diesel movie, and THE BEAUTY of it lays in how much simple it is.

"s-serby","9","4","15","9 January 2016"," What I expected and a little more
","Being a fan of Tarantino movies I always said one has to appreciate his style to go see his work in the theater. I was disappointed by Django, but I loved Inglourious Basterds because I found more of his ideas and more of his way of telling a story in the last one. In my opinion, the beauty of his movies isn't the story, the action or even the violence. The story line is usually simple, the violence is almost always exaggerated. The one element that puts him aside and gives him the ""one and only"" thing is the way he directs the conversations, the speeches and more important how he chooses the actors for that. Not a mystery for me why he chooses to always have in his movies one or more ""buddies"" of his. The same thing with the Hateful 8: a simple story line with some action and R-rated images but the way the characters interact with each other, their stories, their accent and even the mimic of their faces is absolutely beautiful!"
"j-lennerth","5","4","15","31 December 2015"," Tarantino a has been-too similar to Reservoir Dogs-hate his linear screenplays ( save True Romsnce)
","Hateful 8 was pretty much like reservoir dogs without the awesome nonlinear story, witty dialogue, great characters, etc. ever since Kill Bill Tarantino has gone to traditional story lines and he hasn't been good enough to do that since writing True Romance. I give a 5.5/10 for Hateful 8. The ending was overly similar to reservoir dogs too. STICK TO NON LINEAR- it makes your average movies above average because the viewer has to actively engage in thinking to put the story together while watching your 3 hour epics. Tarantino has become a has been. He is Orsen Welles, with Dogs and Pulp Fiction-(10) his Citizen Kane or a quasi Coppola pre & post Godfather ( look at Tucker) and other bombs-The Rain People & other early work w/out a good screenplay nor direction. True Romance (9.4), Kill Bill( 8.0), and to a lesser extent Jackie Brown (7.7) his lesser but better movies. He's got 100 million net worth. Retire while your name has some credibility or become the next Lucas or Coppola. This guy was a hero for a long time but the past decade of films have been bombs. He can't write linear & be as well received. He needs the plot device. I wasn't a fan of Bastards either! He has become a, "" wait for it on DVD director."""
"samfischer88","8","3","10","9 February 2016"," Not Tarantino's Best, But Still Good
","I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, but this was not his best work. There is an high quality cast, nice cinematography, and Tarantino's directing. All of that definitely makes a good movie, but The Hateful Eight was missing Taratino's usual greatness. <br/><br/>The story was good, but not great. I was expecting a big twist at some point that would leave me speechless. The twists were not as huge as I wanted and some of the exciting parts had too much predictability. <br/><br/>The acting was actually pretty hit or miss. I thought Kurt Russell was miscast and didn't fit the feel. Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh were great and fit perfectly with the Tarantino style.<br/><br/>What also played a factor in the entertainment was the length. Usually, the length of a Tarantino movie doesn't bother me because I am constantly on the edge of my seat. The Hateful Eight had a lot of dull runs and needless storytelling. I think shortening the movie would have been for the better in this case.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight isn't great, but still a very solid movie, 7/10."

Then anything can go wild much more than you think. Well, well, well gentlemen, after all this is Tarantino's vision of America: a nation with dangerous people, each one with his own sense of justice and revenge and armed with deadly guns. And when they met all together, blocked by a snow storm in a remote emporium among Wyoming mountains, Christmas can become their bloody ultimate experience.

"schroeder-gustavo","10","3","10","7 February 2016"," Another Home Run from Tarantino
","The Hateful Eight is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others. It really is a star filled cast.<br/><br/>First of all props to Tarantino for releasing this film even after the script was leaked back in the day. Thank you for releasing this movie. I have to say, I applaud his efforts. I really do. He is really trying to pay homage to the westerns of the 1960's and just from the opening you get that feel. Everything from the locations to the shots makes this feel like a legitimate western. As much as I love Tarantino's previous film, Django Unchained, it didn't really feel like a western to me, but a really good Tarantino film. The Hateful Eight feels like a western. Something that really helps add to that feel is the score by Ennio Morricone, who composed the scores for many westerns back in the day, including The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.<br/><br/>Now, did the movie HAVE to be released in 70mm? No, I don't think so, but the Roadshow showings this movie had and the effort Tarantino put into it makes me respect him even more because that's just the love he has for cinema. He makes every movie of his so cool, but it seems effortless and that's one of the many things I love about him as a filmmaker.<br/><br/>Every performance in the film is spectacular, but I really particularly enjoyed the performances by Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. They were great in the film. Some people I heard saying this movie was boring, which at least for me it really wasn't. The movie is 3 hours long, it did not feel that long, at all. I can see why people would find the lack of locations maybe boring for them, but really I find that lack of locations the reason why this movie succeeds for me. Most of the movie takes place in a cabin, which works great because you feel the isolation, you feel the tension building up to the climax of the film. The use of location was great, it actually felt cold as I sat in the theater and watched this. I love that they filmed in real snow, as well. Every single chapter in the film is great and the story does advance rather slowly, but this is a movie that relies on that tension that is a result from that slow pace and from the amazing dialogue.<br/><br/>I found the cinematography great, the direction was great, the performances as well. There is to me but one, I don't want to call it a flaw, because it really isn't, but it's more of an observation, but I want to mention it. Without spoiling anything from Django Unchained, I want to relate something from that film to this one. You can say that the ""meat"" of the film in Django is everything that happens until the last few minutes of the film. And what happens at the end of Django (which is actually great, by the way) feels just like a cherry on top of the film. It doesn't really advance the plot anymore, but it gives the viewer a certain kind of satisfaction. The same goes for The Hateful Eight. You are constantly trying to figure out throughout the first chapters of the story, who the bad guy or guys is/are, and it's pretty cool, it's much like playing Clue with Tarantino characters and dialogue. So as the plot advances, you realize this person isn't the bad guy and then this person and so on, so you start discarding characters, but there is a point in the movie where just abruptly find out who the bad guys are and their real motivation. After that, in Tarantino fashion, you know what's coming. What happens next feels like the movie is almost over, but the movie gives the viewer a certain satisfaction. Now, like I said, this isn't really a complaint or a flaw but it's an observation in the last Tarantino films.<br/><br/>There is a part of the movie where Daisy starts playing the guitar and singing a song, I loved every single thing about that. It was directed perfectly and the tension just starts building up. It's one of my favorite scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I loved the Hateful Eight. I am sure I even liked it more than Django. You can nitpick all you want and you may or may not like Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker, but you can't deny the fact that the man puts so much love and effort into his films. That has to add something to it. Like many Tarantino films, the Hateful Eight doesn't feel like a movie, it's an experience, kind of trip back in time to the great films and times of the past. The Hateful Eight is a great film."
"muellerander","9","3","10","31 January 2016"," Good movie
","I saw the film two days ago. My opinion is very positive. For me, it's better than Django or Inglorious Bastards.<br/><br/>I think, the most people who don't like it are under 20 years old. They want action, fast sequences and a lot of shooting and stuff ...<br/><br/>If you expect this, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>But if you expect a calm movie, with a lot of cool Tarantino-gangster-yap, and beautiful pictures ... you will like it.<br/><br/>It's a little bit like reservoir dogs ... and I like this movie, too.<br/><br/>If I have to make a list (And in reality I don't want to do that, because every movie of him is watchable) with the 8 best Tarantino movies, it would look like this:<br/><br/>1. (best) Pulp Fiction 2. Reservoir Dogs 3. Kill Bill 1 + 2 4. The Hateful Eight 5. Django 6. Inglorious Bastards 7. Jackie Brown 8. Death Proof"

","OMG I loved this film. I have always been a Tarantino fan for years and years. I have loved everything he has done. And what he manages with Samuel L Jackson is amazing!! I mean seriously this is just amazed me to no end. This is a film that lives and breathes off the dialogue and speaking. It has a lot of commentary about the world we live in and I love this movie for doing that. It is also just a really interesting film on racism in the same way Django was, but this film is no Django. This movie falters because of its premise. It just isn't strong enough. It is also too long. Not like Kill Bill either where it was long, but didn't feel long. This film just has a really slow burn to get into the story before it does get interesting. <br/><br/>The acting is superb tho. Not just Samuel L Jackson is great, but Kurt Russell wins. Jennifer Jason Leigh is just funny with all of her lines. \ Walton Goggins also is a new actor who won me over with this movie as well, and deserves a lot of the love in the film as well. <br/><br/>Overall this is a film that I would recommend people go out and give a shot too."
"TrevorJD","8","3","10","25 January 2016"," Western and the conventions of Cinema
","Tarantino's the 'Hateful Eight' maybe a western but it constantly draws our attention to the conventions or mechanics of cinema. Why else would Tarantino film a movie in Ultra Panavision 70mm and comprise most of the shots indoors, a question that a lot of reviewers seem to be asking. The stunning music score by Ennio Morricone, apparently the first music score for a 'western' he has done in 35 years, makes us aware of the use of music in cinema from its dramatic opening score. Title cards that separate the film into chapters, make us aware of the conventions of the screenplay; and at one point a voice-over appears describing a characters motives. There is also the staginess of the film set within one area that makes us aware of the use of mise en scene (Tarantino may turn the Hateful 8 into a stage play); along with a couple of surprises in the latter part of the film that also draw our attention to the stage and the use of mise en scene. Most evidently though, Tarantino seems to have separated the 'plot' from the 'story', by making the first two thirds of the movie the 'story', and the last third the 'plot', creating a whodunit western! The Hateful Eight is an intriguing piece of cinema."

I mean most, because I was a bit afraid after Django Unchained, but now I know he's back. I saw too many bad reviews about this movie, I saw too many people offended that this is a bad western, and so on. Guys, this is a western as much as Kill Bill was a Chinese karate movie. Everything Tarantino does is actually a metaphor(e.g. the letter, the door). I loved the dialogs, which are very carefully chosen as usual, I loved the filming and the panoramic, btw well done sir, very well done! I loved the blizzard that explains you pretty clear, nobody is allowed to leave that chamber. Please do not compare the acting of characters with those from other classical western movies. It's not the case, and no, Samuel L. Jackson is not a wannabe Clint Eastwood, it's just Samuel L. Jackson from all Tarantino's movies.

"d_stack04","8","3","10","24 January 2016"," Another Great Film by Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino is the kind of filmmaker who doesn't make the same movie twice but all of his movies have a feel to it, a signature theme. And this movie is right in his wheelhouse. Dialogue heavy, unique characters, revenge, redemption, and of course, F-bombs. Now while there are many fans of this style we get from every Tarantino film, myself included, there are also people who don't dig Tarantino and boy is this movie NOT for them.<br/><br/>This movie is basically a cinematic play. 80% of the movie takes place in one room and through the dialogue we learn about the characters more than their actions. The characters themselves are perfectly drawn for the scenarios that this story puts them in. And the actors in these roles nail it all across the board. Samuel L. Jackson stood out to me the most. Obviously he and Tarantino have built up a strong rapport over the years but it hasn't been since Jackie Brown that Jackson led a film of QT's. He knocks it out the park and it's a shame he wasn't awarded with a nomination from the academy.<br/><br/>Now when it comes to the story I was left a little underwhelmed. As you sit there trying to figure out who's really who and where their allegiances lie, the tension and mystery build very well. But the execution of the reveal is what disappointed me. It seemed like it would have been better to have the reveals come through the climax as opposed to cut back to the reveal then jump back to the climax. Overall I enjoyed the mystery of the movie but I kind of feel like Tarantino unnecessarily dumbed down the reveal.<br/><br/>As for the technical aspects of this film, they are all top notch. Ennio Morricone's score captured the tone of this film perfectly, Robert Richardson's cinematography made you feel the cold of the blizzard. The editing was smooth. Costumes and sets looked awesome. While yes this is a 2 hour and 48 minute movie (over 3 hours in 70mm), the dialogue and editing make swift work of the movie. I was actually surprised when the last chapter title card came up.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of Tarantino, I can't call this his best work. Actually, I can't even go top 5 out of his 8 films. But that isn't to say this isn't a great movie, it is. I just feel that most of his other movies are better. But even an OK Tarantino movie is still a good movie overall, the guy is just that talented. I would recommend this to any Tarantino fan or film buff but this isn't for everyone. Not a great date movie but definitely enjoyable to the person who knows what they're getting from this movie. Good story, great characters, and lots of amazing dialogue.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars"
"phd_travel","8","3","10","24 January 2016"," A gripping, nearly 3 hour long experience
","At nearly 3 hours long, it's surprising that I didn't feel bored during the movie at all. The gripping story of bounty hunters in Wyoming is quite an experience.<br/><br/>The orgy of violence at the end is pure Quentin but what comes before is an interesting mix of funny darkly comic dialog and a clever whodunnit construction that plays out nicely. The dialog is long at times but always entertaining.<br/><br/>There are some top notch performances here. Jennifer Jason Leigh has a meaty role. Samuel L Jackson is good as usual. Bruce Dern is good too. Another good Kurt Russell movie this year, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a very different movie less comedy more horror. Liked them both.<br/><br/>The music by the composer of ""the Untouchables"" is effective and memorable and deserves awards.<br/><br/>Worth watching - quite unforgettable."
"ante13000","10","3","10","24 January 2016"," Quentin Tarantino = Genius!
","I watched this movie for two nights in a row in a local theatre, and dare I say so, this movie is amazing. It has amazing cinematography, sparely but greatly utilized soundtrack, and features some of Tarantino's stellar actors, which all did a great job.<br/><br/>The plot is very well made, some consider it slow, but I think Tarantino did a great job and one of his greatest strengths, the dialogue, is awesome in this movie. I liked how you could hear the blizzard the whole time, which affected the tension, which for me was unbearable at times and got me on the edge of my seat.It also gave you a bigger feel of isolation and danger characters were facing in that cabin, along with coldness of their own. I didn't have a problem with racial slurs, because this was a movie in which the plot was a while after the Civil war, and they were standard for that times.<br/><br/>Actors did a great job. Kinda forgotten Kurt Russell gave a great performance as John Ruth, and Samuel L. Jackson gave one the best performances of his career as a Major Marquis Warren. People complain that he is the same in every movie, but I disagree. You could feel his badassery in this movie, as his character was not to be messed with. Jennifer Jason Leigh got an Oscar nod, I hated her character, but it was because she gave a great performance and she was evil to the bone.The other stellar actor of his(Michael Madsen and Tim Roth) also gave great and fresh performances. In Tim Roth's Oswald I felt vibe of Christoph Waltz from Inglorious Basterds, which is only a good thing. One of Tarantino's great strengths is how he utilizes his stellar actors and they all fit so well in his films.<br/><br/>Overall, I personally think that this is one of Tarantino's best works, it is a true film and it shows how Tarantino is the master of filmmaking and the greatest director alive. He pulls out great performances, has a great dialogue, and the tension is built up so well that when it hits the fan, you are left guessing and shocked. This movie also had a great vibe of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in it, which is also very good.Overall, for me this work is underrated and one of his greatest works. I am looking forward to a new movie from Tarantino, amazing job QT! 10/10"

","You can imagine, what will happen when this once in a lifetime writer/director leaves us. It'll be a sad day, and with Tarantino, saying he might retire, after his tenth, that will hurt a bit. His latest pic, although you have to be patient, where some moments, might almost have you pulling your hair (believe me, it'll pay off later) is just another fine example of movie making and story telling which he does so well. The photography is fantastic, but it's Morricone's haunting opening score that will get you, for you know what's to follow are moments and characters of real unpleasantries. We're in the midst of a killer blizzard where hot shot bounty hunter, Russell, is escorting a soon to be dead hung woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh, superb) making a hell of a comeback, one of those actresses that never lacks. They have picked up a suspicious stray, Samuel L Jackson, a Major, where later, another guy, joins them (Walter Goggins) the new soon to be sheriff of Red Rock, which is very hard to digest, where for one thing, he never really shuts up, a sign of nervousness. Taking refuge at a lodge known as Minnie's haberdashery, also great you have a candy tooth, they meet a pack of other intriguing dudes (Roth, an English hangman) (Madsen, a mummy's boy, en route to visit his Mummy, giving off a much different character to a lot of other stuff he's done) and (a much old frail Dern, as an ex-confederate) who we kind of suspect are hiding a lot about their activities. This is what really makes it fun, but again, still, you'll need some waiting out, where you just get involved with the characters, amidst coffee drinking and stew eating. Then comes the violence, and it's very impactful, Django, taking a backseat to this, and shootouts, where Jackson in a flashback scenes, really shows the meaning of black power, where there's killer, revengeful moments between him and Dern. Jennifer and Samuel aren't the only ones to be commended on acting, where them just having accolades here is truly, unjust. Jennifer's great, though I have seen better performances from Jackson. Goggins is better, just darn great as the yacking, supposed, new Red Rock sheriff, with one of those standout performances (where did this actor come from), and like I said, Madsen's very different here, rolling with his character, the most intriguing out of them all. Roth, though delivering acting wise, is truly annoying in his over the top character, very much frighteningly similar to that particular annoying one, in Four Rooms, where here though, is purpose, as you'll see. Channing Tatum's performance is the weakest of the lot of course, coming in later, as you could say in a surprise visit. I'm glad I had a short amount of time, with this guy. When we go back earlier in the day to the sky blue outside Minnie's, Zoe Bell's Kiwi accent, again ruins the film, momentarily, period wise too. Yes there are surprise moments, but you can pretty much run down the plot, in simplistic terms as the story and motivations of our hanging out and waiting four, before Russell and co arrive. Russell's really good too. Again QT had done us solid. This is a film, like I said, you have to be patient and see it for what is, where second time, round, you enjoy it more, trust me."
"LeoQTCN","10","3","10","23 January 2016"," Listen all you people, try and understand. There won't be many filmmakers like QT.
","Cinematography is so good that I was inside Minnie's Haberdashery with nefarious characters. While watching outdoor scenes I felt cold. And unique original score from Maestro Ennio Morricone made the movie more mysterious. Brilliant performances. Especially Walton Goggins (Chris Mannix ""The Sheriff""). Sam Jackson didn't play another Sam Jackson role, he was different and so good. He at least deserved Oscar nomination. And of course well deserved nomination for Jennifer Jason Leigh. And maybe The H8tful Eight is QT's funniest movie. The movie is almost completely ignored from major awards shows, but I think, after 10-15 years it will be a classic. And people will like it more. Just like The Thing(1982). The Thing was box office flop as well.<br/><br/>Note: I don't understand people who hate the movie because of the filmmaker's belief's. I don't know if QT is a good person, but I'm sure he is a good filmmaker. So I enjoy his movies. If you don't enjoy his movies then don't watch them. If you like his movies, then why you even care about what he thinks about anything other than movies? I really tried to understand this, but I couldn't. Thanks for reading."

","This is a better film than I expected. It was as good as I hoped. While I won't call it a masterpiece, it is definitely a B+.<br/><br/>Some think it drags. It does not.

The interior scenes were shot in the cold to maintain verisimilitude and I for one appreciated that.<br/><br/>The character of John Ruth is melodramatic almost to the point of being cartoon-like. That is the one serious flaw I find with the writing.

"PyroSikTh","8","3","10","13 January 2016"," Tarantino was always best at Dialogue
","Hateful Eight is like a cross between Django Unchained and Tarantino's breakout Reservoir Dogs. It takes that Western setting and heavy undercurrents of racial tension, and sticks it, with all it's characters, in one confined space and drives it with dialogue and character. It's slow going to begin with, so I can't stress this focus on dialogue enough. The first gunshot isn't until the halfway point of the movie. Before that we follow the stagecoach as it races a blizzard and picks up lone strangers. Even once we reach the cabin that it all takes place in, the dialogue maintains it's centre stage to build up the characters and display the in-built tensions between them.<br/><br/>But when it comes to Tarantino, this focus on dialogue and character is absolutely not a criticism. Ever since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's strength as a filmmaker has been with writing dialogue and directing actors to get the best delivery of it. Hateful Eight is, once again, no exception. While there's no action per se, the conversations between characters are interesting enough, and heaped with enough suspense straight out the box, that you don't need gun fights and blood every ten minutes. What a lot of it boils down to is the aftermath of the civil war, as characters from each side find themselves sharing a room with the opposition, and all are not happy about it.<br/><br/>There's an eclectic array of characters on display here, which is another of Tarantino's strengths, but this is also where the film begins to falter. The leading man is arguably Samuel L. Jackson's Major Warren, who plays the black guy trying to make it in a white man's world. Such are his methods of survival in this outnumbered situation that he's not entirely the most trustworthy character, which can make him hard to root for at times. Fortunately, everyone else is just as despicable, or worse. Kurt Russell is John Ruth, a bounty hunter who parades the title ""The Hangman"" as he always make sure his bounties are returned alive ready for hanging. He doesn't have all too much respect for women, although he has the most respect for Major Warren than anyone else in the movie, and he's paranoid to the smallest detail. Jennifer Jason Leigh hams it up completely as Ruth's bounty; Daisy Domergue. She's rude and uncaring, and Leigh obviously had a lot of fun playing the part.Tim Roth brings in a fantastic performance as Oswaldo Mobray, the English Hangman of the town, but beyond his fairly neutral stance in the confrontations, there isn't really much character there. The same of which can be said of Michael Madsen's Joe Gage who is completely void of any character or presence. We're given no insight into him at all and Madsen just lazes and mumbles through the role, as if he doesn't really want to be there. Bruce Dern, however, brings spirits back up (or down) as General Smithers who fought against Major Warren in the civil war. This conflict is the root of the biggest racial tension in the group, but there's definitely more at play bubbling beneath the surface. <br/><br/>Once the action does kick in in the third act, Hateful Eight becomes possibly Tarantino's bloodiest movie yet, which is saying a lot. I haven't seen Django in a while, with it's pools of blood at the end, but Hateful Eight just felt bloodier. I'm not even sure that's a claim I can attribute to visuals, as it even sounds bloody as various characters squelch in their own plasma. A couple of characters violently vomit blood, a couple get their heads completely obliterated, almost everyone gets drenched in it, be it their own or someone else's. By the time the credits role, there's just blood everywhere.<br/><br/>Finally, the 70mm. I didn't watch it in a special 70mm cinema (at least, I don't think I did), but the picture was noticeably wider than usual. 70mm is usually used for vast and beautiful landscapes and settings, which makes it feel like an odd choice for a movie that spends 75% of it's time in one confined space. And yet, the extra widescreen is used to it's maximum capability. On more than a couple of occasions, characters are seen facing off against one another from opposite ends of the room, and with the 70mm adding that extra bit of width, you can see them both at either end. Make the screen any narrower and you would have absolutely cut one of them out. The extra width here is used less for the landscapes (although there are plenty in the opening moments), but more for capturing the whole breadth of the Habdashery and all it's dwellers.<br/><br/>To close, Hateful Eight is far from Tarantino's best movie, no denying that. It's slow going for a lot of the movie, a lot of the dialogue could have been trimmed further, and a number of characters could have done with a little more work. It's also Tarantino's most straight forward in terms of plot (although there are a couple of twists here and there, and even until it's final moments, you're not entirely sure who'll make it out alive), and it's themes are often retreads of what he's done before (in fact, Hateful Eight often feels like a pseudo-sequel to Django Unchained). However it maintains it's entertainment value, and it's shortcomings are more than balanced by his trademark brilliance elsewhere. It looks great and it sounds great, and I guarantee you'll be on the edge of your seat by the third act. I give Hateful Eight a somewhat fitting 8/10."

And in the middle of all this, a letter from Abraham Lincoln. Tarantino's cinema, hi. A movie but it could have been so different, each scene has a different smell and constantly reeks of authenticity to the event and mystery-filled minutes dragged to the construction. Think of a movie, a film that was formed from two places these two three- hour period in the place and in the meantime and dialogue are continually dialogues immerse you in. Other friends said, plus I can tell you that Tarantino is the best name in the field on how to write dialogue in the world and in my opinion the best. Dialogues written so skillfully that you two are around ten conversation a conversation within the venue and you witness the mysterious events that happened. That's why Tarantino film genre on and raised a tremendous amount of film. Close to all the players that play in his movies that he give up and in the movie a very convenient. Kurt Russell and Samuel l. Jackson, as the saying goes devleşmişlerdi. Even in this film could not play their characters in someone else's life. This is a gorgeous place to acting when you can get limited space but its added value is priceless. Tarantino's cinema is going to be easy-to-follow your friends that adopt the this movie for those who don't like the restricted space and plenty of dialogue should not be preferred. Because this style is not for everyone. Art handled, fiction is the change find strange that's why Tarantino likes the cinema close to the style of cut out for friends. The film was a tremendous degree of philosophy absurdism the operands. In the film, I'm not satisfied with nothing, only the final scene might be slightly different, was just thinking. Other than that, everything was huge. A secluded place outgoing guys on the snow, and the resulting story was watchable. World, infinite wealth and generosity, all your needs are very much against and killing or bloodshed without the need for you to eat. Meat, only wild animals fixes his hunger. In fact, it's not all animals: Horses, sheep and farm animals are fed with grass. But wild and aggressive ones; Lion, Tiger, Wolf and bear are soaked in blood as food lovers."

","Briefly:<br/><br/>Actors = excellent (it's always easier to deliver when you are directed by a master) Photography = fantastic Editing = very good Direction = possibly Tarantino's top (shot wise) Narration = not his best ever. Why?<br/><br/>To be honest for a few minutes (during the second half of the Third Chapter) I was afraid Tarantino failed this film (in spite of a great beginning); he's an extraordinary screenwriter capable of giving his characters remarkable complexity, but it occurred to me he was going a bit too far on this occasion (a bit redundant dialogs to make the protagonists' nature fully emerge), and I even yawned a couple of times when the first hour was about to strike (my heavy dinner helped in that)!<br/><br/>Luckily the second part has a completely different pace which helps the whole picture get a different perspective.<br/><br/>There are a couple of narrative Voice Overs which I found pleonastic, however, this is a Great Movie. <br/><br/>I still have to watch it 2/3 more times to be 100% sure about that.<br/><br/>His only film comparable with this one is ''Inglorious Basterds'' but ''The Hateful Eight'' picks a different genre (Horror, besides Western).<br/><br/>There are explicit references to ''Once Upon a Time in the West'' (i.e. Cheyenne), but the western picture which inspired him the most is Sergio Corbucci's ''The Great Silence'' (1968).<br/><br/>Western can be magic (whether it's Hawks, Ford, Leone, Peckinpah, Tarantino or Eastwood), no doubt about that."
"bakchu","8","3","10","10 January 2016"," Solid, visually interesting
","A solid Tarantino movie, in many ways typical for his style, but also remarkable for being mainly a chamber play: Tarantino puts eight characters of questionable background and honesty into a cabin where they're stuck as a blizzard rages on. Most of the movie takes place in that cabin, Minnie's Haberdashery. And there it's a bit like a mix of a Shakespearean play and... well, that may be a strange comparison, but yes, I'd say: an Agatha Christie mystery. Dame Agatha Christie would have been shocked by the violence and bloodiness, I suppose, but at the core, there are similar plot devices: Who's telling the truth? Who is who, actually? What really happened at the place earlier? The solution comes as an outburst of utter violence, as one expects from Tarantino. And it is quite surprising. Yes, there may be a plot hole presenting itself after the movie's conclusion (spoiler alert again!) - it doesn't seem to make much sense for the gang members not to kill the bounty hunters right away and to instead play their game of deception, which is dangerous (for themselves) and seems, ultimately, rather silly. On the other hand, the gangsters holed up in Minnie's Haberdashery might have been unsure what kind of ""visitors"" to expect, how many, and whether some amongst them might be aligned to their cause, so decided to proceed with caution.<br/><br/>Well, all this is filmed beautifully and nostalgically in Ultra Panavision 70, a process previously last used in 1966, and in the roadshow release, given an extra 1960s touch by including an overture and intermission music. I have seen the roadshow release and would recommend it. One shot especially impressed me on the very big screen: It's a view from inside a barn, the open barn's door forming a frame that looks a bit like a smaller cinema picture, and the dark inside surroundings barely visible - but still visible enough to create the impression that the viewer is actually inside that barn. Without any 3D technology, it creates a sudden and surprising feeling of immersion and of being there. As this shot's effectiveness heavily relies on the big screen, I'm not sure whether it's included in that form in the standard (digital) release which has, it's said, some different cuts as an adaptation to smaller screens. Also, I certainly wouldn't say that the ultra widescreen format is pointless just because most of the movie is set in a cabin - in fact, it shows that widescreen allows for interesting interior shots and isn't just for sweeping landscapes."

Sets are detailed and just awesome to look at. Yes it is nearly 3 hours long, but the story and unstable characteristics of each character keep you entertained through the duration of the film. although it has been done several times before, the racial tension in this movie add an entirely new layer for us to delve in to other than the original plot.

"Mikeslovesfilm","6","5","21","6 January 2016"," Not sensational by any means but certainly worth the watch.
","I will start bluntly and honestly; this is Tarantino's weakest film to date. However that does not mean that it isn't good. When considering the repertoire of Tarantino films at hand, it was always going to be near impossible to replicate the feats of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. I must say though that, to me anyway, films such as Inglorious Bastards and Django Unchained were not far off that high level. They had intensity, sharp dialogue and they captivated audiences. The Hateful Eight does not quite have these comparable qualities. <br/><br/>I'll begin with the positives; the acting in this film is stellar. Samuel L Jackson does a fine job as the main role here and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also every bit as good as Daisy Domergue. It is hard to fault anyone's performance in all honesty. Everyone in this cast grinds out a fantastic performance which is an obvious redeemable quality for this film. The cinematography and score are outstanding likewise, particularly for the atmosphere that both create. And of course, there are some very memorable scenes as expected in any Tarantino films and these scenes are in abundance in this film.<br/><br/>With all that said, this film just has one too many flaws for it to be considered a superb film, let alone a superb Tarantino film. The dialogue does not have the same punch as I would have hoped - it does not hold my attention as it did in Django Unchained or Inglorious Bastards. The story line is a bit thin and at times and given the length of the film (3 hours), this proves to be a problem. I have never had an issue with the length of Tarantino films up until now and I believe that says a lot about The Hateful Eight. The pacing of the film just is not up to scratch i'm afraid. It seems to plod on rather than move with any intensity. The film just did not grip me like other Tarantino films have in the past.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is a good film. But with all the hype and the wonderful director and actors at hand, it does not quite live up to expectation. As I said earlier though, I think it is hard for Tarantino to live up to any expectation now. For someone who's first two films were Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two films that redefined cinema, it was always going to be a challenge to direct on the same level. Django and Bastards were rightfully acclaimed in their attempts but the Hateful Eight falls short. A good film that is certainly worth watching but not of the level we would expect from Mr. Tarantino."
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","21","2 January 2016"," This movie was too entertaining to be hated on. It was awesome!
","Largely set inside in a Wyoming outpost dubbed Minnie's Haberdashery, this American Western movie directed and written by Quentin Tarantino finds eight strangers snowed in together during a blizzard, some of whom harbor dark secrets and violent intent. Can bounty hunter, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) survive a few nights with these people or will his bounty & prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), find a way to escape? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much; I do like how the movie moves like a stage play, by having one main location, where most of the characters are able to develop relationship, spit out exposition and very interesting dialogue. By doing that, it does helps create an interesting film astrosphere that fit the film. However, on a technical level, Robert Richardson's cinematography and the use of 70mm was somewhat disappointing, due to the fact, that it's only one location. Still, you can really tell, by the way, the location looks, that there are tons of stories waiting to be told. Stories like, how the door got broken & who made the tea are just as important, as the characters that make up the film. You really get the layout of the place, by the end of the film, after hearing tons of dialogue, about the fireplace represented the bitten, yet heated South, and how the bar represented the drunk power of the North. Combining that with all the gifted actors that played the characters made for a healthy dose of entertainment. By far, the best actors in the film for me, were Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a former Confederate raider who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock & Samuel L Jackson as the exile black union major turn bounty hunter -- Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). They have the most depth of all the characters, while, most of the others can be considered one-note and cartoony like Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, who introduces himself as the Red Rock hangman & Kurt Russell as John 'Hangman' Ruth. Still, supporting actors like Jennifer Jason Leigh did pretty well with her limited role. I like how the filmmakers really did, ugly her up, by showcasing her rude personality, but also giving her, enough make up scars to tell the audience, that this is one b*tch, not to mess with. She's most likely to get nominations, come awards season. However, the movie wouldn't get an award for pacing. This film is not well paced. The film clocks in, for a 187 minutes for the Roadshow version which includes an overture and intermission, and 167 minutes for the General version. In my opinion, both versions don't work, for a mystery plot that could had quickly dissolved, within 30 minutes of the film time. After all, there are tons of moments throughout the film where characters illogically wait, when they clearly could had act, faster and more aggressive. Like, I said before, the film could had ended in 30 minutes, if only some of the mysterious figures had the balls to kill Ruth when he was entering in the Haberdashery, by himself. Anyways, the first couple of chapters are somewhat dry, with not much of anything really going on. It would easily, have cut a few more scenes from that. Second off, the narration that comes in the middle was a bit jarring and come across as poorly utilized. It really comes out of nowhere, and never truly explained. Did we really need that important spoon feed!? It would had been better, not to know, the twist with the coffee. It would make a greater punch, than it was delivered here. Another thing, that wasn't needed, was the flashbacks to earlier events toward the end of the film. Yes, I know, of 'show, not tell' but, Quentin already loves to fill his movies with dialogue, so it couldn't hurt the film, too bad, just to do that. After all, it was a bit anticlimax to see a deadly gun fight where nearly everybody dies; only to cut back, to see how the enemies got there in the first place. I really don't care, how they got there; I want to know, if the characters survive, Quentin! The messy ending also kinda ruin the whole mystery of the film. However, I was glad, this movie was even made. After all, after the script leaked online in January 2014, Tarantino considered publishing the story as a novel instead. Sometime in early 2015, after some rewrites, he changed his mind, when he got the actors, he wanted for the film. I'm pretty glad, he did, because legendary spaghetti western composer Ennio Morricone also join the project. His music in this film is tense and very haunting score. A very good job from him. Overall: The tone of the film is armed with vicious yet offensive racist humor, sexual assault and an intense violent, and gory action piece that some people might not like; but for me, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is as brutal in its insights into race relations and human nature as it cans. After all, it's depicting an era of the mindless violence in the aftermath of the American Civil War where racism/sexism/ and justice was indeed a very complex issue. That's why Hateful Eight is outstanding. It's must-watch for any Western fan."

","Oh man, I've been waiting on this for a while and it's good to know that it's finally here. I'm a huge Quentin Tarantino fan and I absolutely adored his last western Django Unchained. This is another excellent film from Tarantino but I have a feeling it won't appeal to some people as much as it did me. I love Tarantino movies more for the dialogue than anything and this film is definitely heavy on the dialogue. There are some awfully violent scenes in the last half of the movie but if that's all you're looking for then this isn't the film for you. For those of you that like a good mystery with excellent dialogue and interesting characters, you'll want to check this one out.<br/><br/>The story centers around a woman named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a group of men in a frontier shop called Minnie's Haberdashery. John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter known for taking his prisoners to hang no matter what and he is hell bound and determined that Daisy will hang for her crimes. He is joined by Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who just kills his bounties since it makes his life much easier, and the new (maybe) Sheriff of Red Rock, a man named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). They are all on there way to Red Rock when a blizzard forces them to find shelter at Minnie's Haberdashery. When they arrive at the Haberdashery they meet the last four of the eight main characters: General Sandy Smither (Bruce Dern), a Confederate general known for massacring colored troops, Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the new hangman of Red Rock, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a cowboy out to visit mother, and finally Bob (Demian Bichir) a shady character watching the Haberdashery while Minnie is gone. It turns out all isn't as it seems in the Haberdashery and Daisy has an ally or allies among these men that are trying to help her escape. Pure chaos soon ensues.<br/><br/>With a cast this good, is there really any doubt about the acting talent in this film? Leigh is in top form as the foul mouthed and vindictive Domergue and it's easy to tell that something is wrong with the woman even before we find out what she's wanted for. Kurt Russell and his magnificent whiskers also give a great performance as the cautious and angry John Ruth. Samuel L. Jackson once again shows up in another Tarantino film and once again gives us one of the best monologues of his career. I'm not too familiar with Goggins but I've always liked what I've seen him in and he give a great performance here. He's really an underrated actor. I could keep going on and on but everyone in this film is absolutely superb. I love seeing these characters interact with each other, which is good, since that's the bulk of the movie.<br/><br/>The cinematography and soundtrack to this film is absolutely phenomenal. I'm not sure exactly where they filmed this movie but it looks like there was an actual blizzard outside. The countryside is beautiful but also barren in a way. It's very lonely but helps to set up the who done it nature of the film very well. The soundtrack is also intense as all hell and helps to set the mood for the story. I was literally on the edge of my seat during a good portion of the film and the music played a big part of that.<br/><br/>As I said before, this film definitely isn't for everyone. The story is excellent and the characters are interesting and unique but I know a few people that are having trouble with the pacing of the movie. Tarantino films are always a bit of a slow burn so you really shouldn't come into this one expecting nonstop action. I got exactly what I was expecting from it but I knew what to expect. Also, the language (especially directed towards Jackson and Leigh) will put off a few people. It's brutal language but Tarantino has never shied away from the more brutal aspects of his characters. There's also some really ultra violent scenes that will probably make some people sick (there were two people that actually walked out of my theater). If you can look past all of this then you should be good to go.<br/><br/>This is really an excellent film and I easily consider it one of Tarantino's best. The pacing will throw off a few people but if you go into it expecting interesting characters and some of the best dialogue Tarantino has ever written then you'll be fine. I recommend it but make sure you know what you're getting into."

It had great suspense, like trying to figure out which of the men was trying to kill the other. It had beautiful scenery. It did feel a little isolated and claustrophobic because the film mostly takes place in the boarded up Haberdashery. The movie is perhaps even more racist than Django Unchained, but the director is just showing us what it was like back in the 1800's. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell plays John Ruth aka ""The Hangman"" John is a bounty hunter who's taking Daisy Domergue to Red Rock to collect $10,000 and let her hang.

","Only Quentin Tarantino can write, direct, and structure a film in such a extraordinary way. This film like Inglorious Basterds exemplifies his film making style. I sense Quentin was inspired a lot by Sergio Leone. Ennio Morricone score is mandatory western. I was excited to see so many favorite actors from other Tarantino films. Bruce Dern is such living legend Western film icon. Unforgettable roles in Hang 'Em High, The Cowboys, Gunsmoke. He brings authenticity to any western. Kurt Russell is a natural actor who brings humor to the characters he plays. This film has so much of Quentin's sense of humor in it. I was laughing a lot during the film. There's a lot of dark hilarity in the film. Daisy Domergue is getting her teeth knocked out and I'm laughing. The vomiting scene had me laughing so hard. It reminded of a scene in The Thing. Quentin has a very similar sense of humor as John Carpenter.They unknowingly bring humor into a film which like minded people get. I love the fact they make movies for themselves and just so happen it appeals to a lot of other people. I rate this film a ten because it' perfect enough that I'll watch it again!"

","This is a piece of cinema that probably no-one but Tarantino could have pulled off in a way that holds your attention unflinchingly for the entire duration. If like me, you're a fan of both a good western and rich, superbly written dialogue, you can't but like The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have pointed out, it could easily be a stage play from the point where they arrive at 'Minnie's Haberdashery'. This doesn't detract from it however, as Tarantino keeps the story moving at pace, breaking it up with his 'chapters' technique. And he inserts narration at specific points in the process to make sure you don't get lost in the various interconnected subplots and background stories.<br/><br/>With dialogue of this quality, you almost eat every word that comes out of each characters mouth. On top of your popcorn, soda and chocolate, it all makes for a very fulfilling movie experience."

","The Hateful Eight is a great movie--it's indisputable. The acting, writing, soundtrack, cinematography, and story are spectacular. I saw it in 70mm and had a blast. The entire audience was rolling in laughter and applauding in the middle of the movie. Tarantino definitely does a great job at making a taboo subject hilarious. The only reasons I can think as to why someone would think this movie is BAD is-<br/><br/>1: It's long. Yes The Hateful Eight is over three hours long. Kinda like Seven Samurai, the first half of the movie is pretty slow and contains a lot of build up (but is still very entertaining). Then the second half is just a sheer explosion of badassery. I believe the length is completely necessary, even after watching it a second time. <br/><br/>2: It's visually disturbing. This is probably Tarantino's most violent film, so I can respect why some people may shy away when they see one's (INSERT BODY PART) get blown off. There's also some other disturbing parts, one in particular, that I don't want to spoil.<br/><br/>That being said, I do believe this film was very unique and awesome. If you have a chance to watch it in 70mm do it!"

","After enjoying the Spaghetti Western Mandingo remixed offered in Django Unchained,I was pleased to discover that writer/director Quentin Tarantino was returning to the Western with his next project,which led to me getting ready to find out how hateful the eight could be.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Planning to collect the bounty for outlaw Daisy ""The Prisoner"" Domergue,John ""The Hangman"" Ruth decides to hire a carriage to the town of Red Rock,so that he can bring Daisy in without getting attention from her gang.On the way to Red Rock, Ruth runs into Major Marquis ""The Bounty Hunter"" Warren,a former army Major who is looking for a ride to Red Rock so that he can collect the bounty on 3 outlaws he has just killed. Inviting Warren along,the group soon find themselves stuck in a blizzard,which leads to Ruth deciding that they will stay at a nearby ""safe house"" until the weather calms down. Expecting to find no one else at their chosen ""safe house"" the gang are met by three strangers,who all appear to be rather keen on Daisy.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Opening with a carriage being driven through snow,Quentin Tarantino & cinematographer Robert Richardson cast the Western across a vast canvas,as perfectly held wide shots display the endless snowstorm hitting the characters as Ennio Morricone sweet jazzy score flames up in the background.Along with the ""classical"" wide shots,Tarantino also displays an expert eye for the use of stylish slo-mo to make the quick-fire shoot-outs fire up the screen,whilst also each sudden burst of stillness to punctuate the nervous tension.<br/><br/>Toning down the cool cat off-the-cuff one liners that became his trademark,the screenplay by Tarantino takes great care in keeping the dialogue pinned to the doubts that the characters have for each other,as each sharp exchange is wrapped in bleak dread. Separating the movie into chapters, Tarantino unleashes a gripping (and bloody) murder mystery against a Western backdrop,as the isolated location allows Tarantino to deconstruct the events which led to them all being stuck together,whilst also filling the place with shady creeps who do sly deadly tricks that would make ""the butler did it"" proud.<br/><br/>Marking his mark as Detective Shane Vendrell in the excellent,gritty TV series The Shield, Walton Goggins gives an excellent performance as Sheriff Chris Mannix,thanks to Goggins giving Mannix a rough,Old Testament view of justice which gets burnt at the edges by the offers that the other 7 strangers give him.Pulling along a great Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue,Kurt Russell gives a wonderfully gruff,big beast performance as John Ruth,whose every howl and determination to get the bounty fills the room.Showing that he can still hit every line Tarantino writes with delicious glee, Samuel (Yel) L. Jackson gives a marvellous performance as Major Marquis Warren,whose war-torn body Jackson shows hides a quick-witted mind which is matched by Warren's brutal delivery of violence,as the hateful eight each reveal how hateful they can be."

"zardoz-13","10","6","28","4 January 2016"," Tarantino's Top Western!!!!
","The world emerges as a hostile, inhospitable setting in writer & director Quentin Tarantino's second western ""The Hateful Eight,"" and everybody but the innocent bystanders winds up getting what they deserve. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, and Channing Tatum seem never at a loss for words in this consistently entertaining but abrasively self-indulgent horse opera. Like a typical Tarantino tale, ""The Hateful Eight"" wallows in blood-splattered carnage, punctuated by gunfire, and intensified by politically incorrect subject matter laden with scatological, R-rated profanity. Set in a sprawling mosaic of snow-swept Wyoming mountains, this suspenseful bounty hunters versus outlaws western methodically unfolds like a claustrophobic but chatty Agatha Christie drawing-room murder-mystery. Predictably, Tarantino shoots the works with both surprises and shocks that keep this static outing interesting as well as melodramatic. A suspicious bounty hunter escorts a homicidal dame with a $10-thousand dollar reward on her head for a date with the gallows. During his journey, the bounty hunter encounters various gunmen and takes refuge with them in a remote stagecoach relay station during a freezing blizzard. The predominantly all-male cast is nothing short of exceptional, but this doesn't eclipse Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as a slimy villain. Now, if you're not an ardent connoisseur of all things Tarantino, you may find yourself exiting the premises before the film reaches its midpoint. <br/><br/>Scruffy, loud-mouthed, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell of ""Tombstone"") has chartered a private stagecoach to transport his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh of ""Backdraft""), to the town of Red Rock. He is taking Daisy in alive to watch her hang for her crimes. Unlike most bounty hunters, Ruth prefers to show up with his prisoners alive rather than dead. Along the trail, Ruth runs into another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), who is smoking his pipe perched atop a stack of three frozen corpses. Major Warren gunned down these three guys for the collective $8-thousand dollar bounty on their heads. Unlike Ruth, Warren takes no chances and shows up with his desperadoes dead rather than alive. Major Warren explains that his horse fell dead during the trip across the mountains, and he inquires if Ruth will give him a lift. Reluctantly, Ruth allows Warren to climb aboard. Before Warren can enter the stagecoach, Ruth orders him to surrender his two six-shooters to the coachman, O.B Jackson (James Parks of ""Machete""), for safekeeping. Later, another man stranded on foot, Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), who claims to be the sheriff of Red Rock flags them down. When Ruth demands to see his badge, Mannix explains that he was riding to Red Rock when his horse stepped into a gopher hole and he had to shoot it. Initially, Ruth refuses to believe Mannix. Mannix explains that Red Rock recently lost their sheriff and that he is replacing him. Since he hasn't gotten to Red Rock yet, he doesn't have a badge. Furthermore, Mannix argues that Warren and the coach driver will serve as witnesses to testify against Ruth if Mannix is found frozen dead in the snow because Ruth wouldn't oblige him. Glumly, Ruth lets Mannix join them. Before he lets Mannix aboard, Ruth strikes up an uneasy alliance with Warren. Ruth lets Warren reclaim his revolvers and promises to protect him if Warren will watch over him, too. An infamous Confederate marauder, Mannix is wary of Major Warren who is an ex-Union cavalryman with his own notorious reputation. According to Mannix, Warren burned down a Confederate prison camp to escape from it. During the conflagration, more than forty young Confederate recruits died. CSA President Jefferson Davis put a bounty on Warren's head and Federal authorities drummed him out of the cavalry. <br/><br/>Basically, the three men aboard the stagecoach remain deeply suspicious about each other despite any deals they may have forged. Eventually, the stagecoach arrives at a lonely relay station called Minnie Haberdashery where six horse stagecoach teams are changed while the passengers rest and refresh themselves. Warren is surprised to learn that Minnie and her family not only have left the relay station in the hands of a Mexican, Bob (Demián Bichir of ""Savages""), but also have gone to visit friends. Meantime, Ruth ushers Daisy inside at gunpoint and interrogates the three guests about their identities and destinations. He learns that an Englishman, Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth of ""Reservoir Dogs""), is a hangman in route to Red Rock. The other man, a drover back from a cattle drive, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen of ""Die Another Day""), is heading to see his mother on the far side of Red Rock. Ruth disarms both men, dismantles their revolvers, and sends O.B. into the freezing storm to dump their firearms in the nearby outhouse. The other guest, elderly Confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern of ""The Cowboys""), doesn't own a gun. Nevertheless, Ruth doesn't trust any of them, and he keeps Daisy attached to a chain around his wrist. Meantime, Warren doesn't believe Mexican Bob's story about Minnie, but he doesn't have enough evidence to call him a liar.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" clocks in at 168 minutes. Essentially, Tarantino takes his own sweet time developing these characters. If you're looking for role models, you won't find them. These guys and especially the girl are all dastards. Nevertheless, die-hard Tarantino fans will find it in their hearts to forgive him for the elongated running time, applaud his spontaneous, slam-bang violence, and chuckle at his ghoulish gallery of gruesome characters. Indeed, Tarantino's eighth feature film lives up to its title, and some parts of it are more hateful than other parts. Compared with Tarantino's previous seven epics, this gritty, gimlet-eyed western resembles ""Reservoir Dogs"" with ""Pulp Fiction"" excerpts. In fact, the director has said that not only he was influenced by Sergio Corbucci's Spaghetti westerns, but also the cult science fiction horror movie ""The Thing"" that starred Kurt Russell."
"subxerogravity","8","6","28","26 December 2015"," Can't hate it! It was great!! A wonderful cinematic experience!
","I can't blame the world for being on a thin line with Quentin Tarantino. It can be a turn off when people act like he is God's gift to cinema. At the same time, I love everything that this man puts forward, which includes the Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>Tarantino dares to go old school cinema on us. Not just with the 70mm Ultravision, which made for a beautiful motion picture. Tarantino always crafts an impressive story, but I'm equally impressed by the images I saw. It was a gorgeous western.<br/><br/>Tarantino went bold by having this movie go over three hours, and even bolder adding in the golden age movie experience of having an overture before the film and during intermission (although, my bladder does thanks him for that). He took a risk alienating his audience like he did with Grindhouse, but the overture did help to allow the music to set the tone The Hateful Eight, <br/><br/>And the music was the best part of the movie. It was haunting and sinister and a gave a feel of the old 60s westerns like Once Upon a Time in the West. <br/><br/>You go to a Tarantino movie to see a good unique story with amazing dialog (and a lot of white folks using that word with ease). It's raunchy smart and witty and that's what we get here. Plus you get the dialog being spit out by some amazing actors like Tarantino regular, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Madsen who by now knows what the filmmaker wants so much they probability don't bother reading the scripts.<br/><br/>The regular crew is joined by Kurt Russell who may not need as much of a career boost this year as I'm sure Hateful Eight will give him, unlike Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays the only woman in the cast. <br/><br/>It's long and slow and basically eight people talking to one another for over three hours, Yet I'd be a hater if I denied that in the hands of any other filmmakers, this would have led to pure boredom. Instead, it's was a great film to watch and I deeply enjoyed myself."
"Matt_Layden","7","6","28","21 December 2015"," ""One of them fellas is not what he says he is...""
","After a leaked script of Tarantino's next project, The Hateful Eight, he swore that he would not film it. Instead he did a live read and it got a lot of applause. This apparently gave him enough reason to shoot the film anyway...and in 70mm no less. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino finally steps out of the revenge theme that has steered his career since Kill Bill. This is a welcomed change of pace, but he still succumbs to things that plague his recent output of films, mainly self indulgence and a lengthy running time. <br/><br/>A bounty hunter is travelling to Red Rock with his bounty, a woman by the name of Daisy. Along the way he encounters two men stuck in a blizzard and unenthusiastically gives them a lift. They reach shelter where there are other men shielding themselves from the freezing cold. Yet something seems odd, are these men really who they say they are? Is one of them lying? Will anyone make it out of this cabin alive? For the first time since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino dives back into a little bit of mystery. In Reservoir Dogs, someone was a cop, here, we have no idea what it going on or who is who. This perfectly amps of the tension and in typical Tarantino fashion, he lets us stew in it for a really long time. It's not a Tarantino movie if there is not a long winded, yet well written and cool monologue that will undoubtedly end in blood shed. This film delivers that in spades as the blood does indeed shed and everyone has their chance to give a few quips here and there. <br/><br/>One thing Tarantino always seems to hit the nail on the head with is his casting. This film is no exception. Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir all play their roles perfectly well in this slow burner that feels more like a stage play than a film shot in 70mm. Tim Roth's character reminds me so much of a role that Christoph Waltz would play that it was hard NOT seeing Waltz in this film. Roth stands out in the crowd with a more exuberant character in line with Waltz's Dr. Schultz. Leigh is also on the bit eccentric side and deservedly should be recognized come awards season. Always being a fan of Kurt Russell it's nice to see him back in the Tarantino fold after Death Proof, which Russell was the best thing. Goggins is also a stand out, but if you've followed him enough than you'll know that this is not a surprise. He's always one of the best things about whatever he is in. Dern and Madsen aren't really given too much to do and Madsen in particular seems to be on auto-pilot. Not that the man gives great performances, but Tarantino usually gets a bit more out of his actors. <br/><br/>The opening shots of the winter landscape look glorious, of course. Then we are subjected to interior shots of people talking for almost the rest of the film. Which makes one wonder why bother shooting or even seeing this in 70mm. Tarantino has said that after he's done making movies he'd want to direct a stage play. So far, this is the closest he's gotten to it. Most of this film is merely interactions between people within a log cabin. The interactions are wonderful and show us the talent of Tarantino and those on the screen. Even at 2 hours and 47 minutes, the film never really feels like it drags in any parts. That was the biggest surprise to me. I felt engaged the entire time. Maybe on repeat viewings this will die down a bit, since most of the tension and suspense will be gone, but imagine the basement bar scene with Fassbender from Inglorious Basterds, only extended to a feature length film. <br/><br/>There are two sequences that took me out of the film and it's one thing that happens twice. Tarantino did the same thing with Inglorious Basterds, where random narration pops in to tell us exactly what we are seeing on the screen. Adding insult to injury...it's Tarantino himself narrating the events on the screen. I was confused more than anything. Why include this bit of storytelling randomly? If you want narration, give it at the start, not two random scenes, it makes no sense. <br/><br/>Tarantino falls back on his chapter storytelling element here. Much like Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds, the film is split up into chapters with scene headings. Also, like his other films it also includes flashbacks, this has become a staple in his films and I feel like his uses the same font every damn time. Again, like Django Unchained, the film contains a lot of racist remarks from the characters casually throwing around the n-word. Something that has become too common in his films. Small quibbles aside, The Hateful Eight is exactly what one would expect from Tarantino. It's violent, it's talkative and packs one hell of a cast. Hateful Eight finds itself in the middle road in Tarantino's resume, it's nowhere near his best, nor his worst."

","It's these questions that create an omnipresent atmosphere of bluffs and tall tales—heightened by, but not limited to, the slow-simmering, closed environment—where the door is literally nailed shut, and we're stuck with these characters just as much as they're stuck with each other. Unfortunately, the majority of this Western ensemble aren't terribly interesting or memorable, with even less being particularly likable. Who says you can't be hateful and decent? That said, ""The Hangman"" was still the most compelling and important player in regards to his unemotional sense of justice, which comes back around in one of Tarantino's bloodiest climaxes yet whilst pronouncing the film's already caffeinated screwball elements. None of that final act, however, or the film for that matter, would have been as erratic without Leigh's surprisingly delectable performance. Initially mum and marred, the actress still manages to convey a distinct arrogance whether she's spitting on Warren's letter or silently miming her own hanging. Yet, it's that aforementioned three-fourths point, aptly titled ""Domergue's Got a Secret,"" where the film and Leigh's performance really begin to sizzle. Picking up an acoustic guitar, an unexpected, though cynically-motivated tenderness emits during a brief tune, before the actress finally unveils the latent insanity–erupting in full and foul form, and, in my books, takes the cake for best supporting actress of 2015.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/07/the-hateful-eight-review-indie-adam/"

","This is obviously hate it or love it movie. For me it's one of the best Tarantino's pieces. He managed to place an intriguing story in utterly unattractive surroundings and very limited stage. Some said here in reviews that the film is boring and for me it is totally opposite, I enjoyed every minute of the unfolding story. Again some says that characters are not interesting. Totally wrong, every single one of them has a story behind him. Highly amusing and unexpected dialogues are another mark of good Tarantino film and this one is high in list regarding that. I personally found Kill Bill dreadfully boring and couldn't even watch part two to the end but this one would gladly watch again. Thumbs up for the 3 hours of bloody, action packed scenes, outrageous dialogues, highly amusing and colorful characters and first class acting!"
"brianberta","6","3","11","7 February 2016"," I didn't mind the slow pacing at all
","Before I watched The Hateful Eight, I saw a lot of negative reviews. Many people were complaining that the first 2 hours were painfully slow and it remained very boring up until the final hour. I was pretty concerned after reading all of those reviews and I was afraid that Quentin Tarantino would repeat the same mistake he made in Death Proof again. Hastily, I decided to watch this movie and hope for the best. I can safely say that I am very thankful that I watched this movie.<br/><br/>In order to take shelter from a blizzard, a group of people take shelter in a small cabin and decide to wait the storm out there. Among them is a man taking a female criminal to town so she can be hung for her crimes, a bounty hunter transporting the bodies of 3 outlaws to Red Rock, an incoming sheriff also traveling to Red Rock, a quiet cowboy going to stay with his mother, a former Confederate general, and several others. As more info is revealed about the different people there, rivalries begin to appear and they start to grow bitter hatreds for each other. It becomes possible that none of them will make it out of the cabin alive by the time the snowstorm stops.<br/><br/>For some reason, many people were complaining about the pacing. Sure, it does take a pretty long time for the gunfights to occur, but I found all the buildup to be exciting. I loved the sense of claustrophobia the movie provided and I felt that it provided a lot of suspense to the film. Also, the movie moved the story along nicely by slowly building up rivalries among the characters. It had several suspenseful scenes and the movie never felt boring because of this. I can understand why someone would get bored by the first 2 hours of the movie, but I didn't feel that at all. The movie kept me entertained from beginning to end. I feel that some people were expecting this film to have action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>As Tarantino fans know, Tarantino often likes to put his plot lines out of order. This has worked great for many of his movies and it works even better for this movie. Often, at times, the audience knows something that the characters on-screen don't know and it results in some of the most suspenseful scenes in years. It is revealed at one point that someone poisoned the coffee and it leaves the audience to wonder who will drink it. It is also revealed at one point that a gun is hidden under the table and someone who knows about it sits by it. There are also a few other details in the film which make the flashback scene very tense. Because of the disjointed plot structure, it made me want to watch it again.<br/><br/>Speaking of suspense, this movie sure contains a lot of it. In the final act, there are so many times when the characters come very close to getting killed and I become on the edge of my seat during them. As the movie approaches its end, I was fearing that something bad would happen to the characters I was rooting for at the very last second. My favorite scene in the film was when Bob plays quiet, relaxing songs on the piano while Warren taunts Smithers. The peacefulness of the piano combined with the arguments between Warren and Smithers creates a truly suspenseful scene for the ages.<br/><br/>There isn't really that much character development in the film, but this didn't bother me at all because of the consistent feeling of claustrophobia and suspense. That distracted me from it so well that I didn't even notice it. Character development has been a problem in some of his other movies such as Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2, but this movie was actually able to engage me enough for me to not notice it.<br/><br/>Tarantino has had issues with sadism in his past movies, but there actually isn't a whole lot of it in this film. I'd say that the only scene which bothered me was the scene when Warren forces someone to walk through the snow naked, do something very gross, and kills him. That scene didn't have to be as sadistic as it was and it felt very crass as a result. Besides this scene, however, nothing else in the film really bothered me. Also, that is an incredibly minor complaint. Some might find the scene when one of the characters (I won't spoil who) get hung to be overly-sadistic, but I really hated the character who died in that way and I felt it was a very fitting and deserved end. I was rooting for that person to be killed and I'm sure everyone else was.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also pretty excellent in this film. Snowy landscapes are gorgeous to look at and the cabin provides an inviting and cozy feel to it. Also, the acting is very great. It gets better as the film goes on. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show and his acting role is very haunting due to how closer he gets to death as the movie goes on. Also, Tarantino's narration is actually pretty interesting and entertaining.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better film. The slow pacing didn't bother me that much and I found the movie to be very suspenseful. It had some of the most tense movie scenes I've seen in years and the disjointed plot structure works better than ever. I understand why some people didn't care for this movie, but none of their reasons affect my opinion of the movie. If you're a fan of Tarantino then this is a definite must see. Just don't expect this to have action from beginning to end like many of his other films."
"pastrunho","9","3","11","5 February 2016"," Tarantino at the nth degree
","I watched The Hateful Eight the first day it came out, about a month ago, and I totally loved it! So I went back to the cinema a few days ago to have the pleasure to watch it a second time, and it was even better. Tarantino is my favourite director and every piece of film he puts his hands on ends up to be incredible. He truly loves cinema. He looks up for the best directors and studies their work in order to improve his. His passion to film and attention to details are outstanding. As Brad Pitt himself said in an homage to Quentin's Inglorious Basterds: ""(Tarantino) is a man who believes in the power of film. (...) He's a serious filmmaker, he's a unique voice for our time, he's a purist. (..) He's a joy to work for, he's a joy to work with and if you've happened to forgotten what you loved about movies in the first place I tell you you'll only have to spend a night with Quentin."" When Tarantino writes a screenplay he literally thinks about everything. He doesn't just write the story, he asks himself why a certain character is like that and what could make him/her interesting and why. He studies deeply each and every detail of someone's personality, he knows everything about them. Even the stunts, he wants them to act, to feel what the character is going through. And then there's the casting, he always pays incredible attention to the this part of the pre- production. He puts so much effort in searching the right actors because he knows that if he wants the script to come to life he needs the best ones (for the role). And indeed he always succeeds. But now let's come to The Hateful Eight. This film is a masterpiece. Shot entirely in two locations, as Tarantino himself said, ""is a theatrical play"". In fact he stated that one day he would love to bring it on stage. The development of the story is marvellous. The narrative of the film slowly takes you to a point where you find yourself immersed in a sea of questions and then cleverly answers them, of course in a pure Tarantino style. As always the film is divided in chapters, all but one in a chronological order. This film is Tarantino at the nth degree. It's purely based on dialogues, and boy he's the king of dialogues. I was indeed very surprised, and also quite disappointed, when I found out he wasn't been nominated for Writing — Original Screenplay. The directing is outstanding, as usual, and the cinematography in particular is wonderful. The music score by Ennio Morricone is extraordinary but it's not at all surprising knowing il maestro. The soundtrack is one of the few Oscar nominations the film has got. In my opinion it should win hands down even though, with 6 nominations, Morricone never won an Oscar (yeah, that's unbelievable!) if we exclude the honorary one given to him in 2007. Although his music is always wonderful, in this particular movie I think he did a seriously incredible work. I've heard many saying this film is not as good as the previous ones but I strongly disagree. First of all I don't think there's even one bad movie he made. Secondly you can't really compare Tarantino's movies because they're all so different one each other. I read people commenting that this is not even nearly as good as Django but, even considering they're both in the same period, Django and The Hateful Eight have nothing in common, so it's not really fair to compare them. I love both of them but, as previously said, they're very different. Tarantino stated that he's going to make only 10 movies in his life (this was the 8th) and after that he'd love to move to the theatrical field. This movie is a sort of transition between the two similar but with many differences worlds. His reason for doing so is that he wants to make only great movies. I like this. He's not someone who makes a movie a year so he can get as much money as possible, he thinks through his work, he studies it and only when it's perfect he finally makes and releases it. As we've seen with his last work. The Hateful Eight is done in 70mm Ultra Panavision, a format used extremely rarely in the industry and not used in decades because of its difficulties. But its wonderful result and Tarantino's love for film made him pursues this adventure and release a film that is a masterpiece! Am I sad that we only have 2 movies left from this genius? Yes, of course. And the worst thing is that when he'll move to theatre I won't be able to see it because I don't live in the US. But, as I said earlier, I love that he's not sold his soul for money but only for the beauty of film making."

But the movie is to damn good in cinematography, acting and the whole setting to give this movie so much hate! <br/><br/>I am sure, if someone else, let's say a new director, someone we never heard of, delivered this movie, everybody would be really exited! It's because Tarantino made some kind of different movie, everybody is so disappointed.. <br/><br/>I really don't understand that people call them self a film 'fan' and dislike this movie so much. It's maybe not what they expected, but it's very good and still got the genius Tarantino's sense of humor in it! And also the 70mm anamorphic experience is sick! To bad Tarantino didn't shoot the Basterds in it for instance.. ;)"

","Reading a lot of reviews saying the movie was ""too long and boring"", ""too many dialogs"", ""almost no violence"" (excuse me?? The last third part of the movie compensates very well the gore part you ""missed for so long""). I have also listened people saying this bosh in the theater.. People is saying that they were ""fans"" of Tarantino's movies but that they hated this one. If you are saying that it is boring and that there are also too many dialogs, then maybe you have never seen a Tarantino movie, it takes is time, the style of the movie is iper-realistic, so why are you saying there are too many dialogs and the movie is boring? You are saying that because you are the classic middle-man who watches movies chatting with the phone on one hand, doing other things, and then pretending the movie is clear for you and that has moment of actions that will make you appreciate it as a kid that need films with explosion, shootings, stereotypical characters to compensate your uncultured mind. Really, tell me why you went to theater to see a Tarantino's movie if you never liked dialogs that takes their time, and if you never liked Tarantino's genre in general. I don't think that this is considered a review, hope it is published. Sorry for my English, really tried to write it in the best way."

","""Chapter One: Last Stage to Red Rock"" Years after the Civil War, bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren is transporting three dead bounties to the town of Red Rock, and hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by a man named O.B. Inside is bounty hunter John Ruth, known for bringing in outlaws alive to see them hang. Ruth is handcuffed to fugitive Daisy Domergue, whom he is escorting to Red Rock, and is suspicious of anyone who might steal her substantial bounty. The two hunters bond over Warren's personal letter from Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>""Chapter Two: Son of a Gun"" Former Lost-Causer militiaman Chris Mannix, who claims he is traveling to Red Rock to be the town's new sheriff, persuades Ruth and Warren to let him on the stagecoach. Warren and Ruth form an alliance to protect each other's bounties. Mannix and Warren almost come to blows over their controversial war records.<br/><br/>""Chapter Three: Minnie's Haberdashery"" The group is forced to seek refuge from a powerful blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach lodge. They are greeted by Bob, a Mexican who says owner Minnie is visiting her mother and left him in charge. The other lodgers are Oswaldo Mobray, the Red Rock hangman; Joe Gage, a quiet cowboy traveling to visit his mother; and Sanford Smithers, a former Confederate general. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren.<br/><br/>As the group eats, Mannix surmises that Warren's Lincoln letter is a forgery. Warren admits this, saying the letter buys him leeway with whites, outraging Ruth. Warren leaves a gun next to Smithers and provokes him into reaching for it by telling him he ostensibly tortured, humiliated and killed Smithers' son. Warren shoots him first in lawful self-defense, in revenge for Smithers executing black soldiers at the Battle of Baton Rouge.<br/><br/>""Chapter Four: Domergue's Got a Secret"" While everyone is distracted by the confrontation, someone seen only by Domergue poisons the brewing coffee. Ruth and O.B. drink it, vomit blood and collapse. The dying Ruth attacks Domergue, but she kills him with his own gun. Warren disarms Domergue, holds the men at gunpoint and leaves Domergue cuffed to Ruth's corpse. He is joined by Mannix, whom Warren trusts because he nearly drank the poisoned coffee.<br/><br/>Warren deduces Bob is an impostor who killed the original lodge owners and executes him. However, Bob had an alibi for the poisoning as he was playing the piano. When Warren threatens to execute Domergue too, Gage admits he is the poisoner. A man hiding in the cellar shoots Warren in the groin. Mobray draws a concealed gun and shoots Mannix, who returns fire, wounding Mobray and forcing Gage against the wall.<br/><br/>""Chapter Five: The Four Passengers"" Earlier that day, Bob, Mobray, Gage, and a fourth man, Jody, arrive at Minnie's Haberdashery and kill everyone but Smithers. Jody tells Smithers they plan to ambush Ruth to rescue Domergue, Jody's sister; his gang will spare Smithers if he keeps quiet, as an extra lodger will make the setup more believable. The bandits dispose of the bodies, hide the evidence, and conceal guns around the lodge. As Ruth's stagecoach arrives, Jody hides in the cellar.<br/><br/>""Last Chapter: Black Man, White Hell"" Mannix and Warren, both seriously wounded, hold Domergue, Gage, and the dying Mobray at gunpoint. They flush Jody out by threatening to kill Domergue, and then Warren kills him. Domergue claims 15 more of her brother's men are waiting in Red Rock to kill Mannix and ransack the town; if Mannix kills Warren and allows her to escape, the gang will spare him and let him claim the bounties of the deceased.<br/><br/>As Domergue and Mobray taunt Warren, he shoots Domergue in the foot, then Mobray in the leg; Mobray dies from his wounds. Gage draws a hidden revolver but is shot dead by Mannix and Warren. Warren tries to shoot Domergue but is out of bullets. Mannix calls Domergue's bluff and rejects her alliance, but faints from blood loss. Domergue hacks off Ruth's handcuffed arm and frees herself. As she reaches for Mannix's gun, he regains consciousness and wounds her. Warren persuades Mannix to hang her from the rafters in honor of Ruth. Afterward, as the two lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's Lincoln letter while they wait to die together.<br/><br/>Awesome movie 10/10. Go watch it"

","Despite failing to equate the virtual cult perfection of Pulp Fiction, and failing to eclipse the contextually emotional and vengeful Django Unchained, this film retains the fundamental core of outstanding storytelling intertwined with explicit violence that has earned Tarantino his legendary status.<br/><br/>If you are a genuine fan of Tarantino, you will enjoy this film regardless of its three hour run time. Formatted in a chapter fashion, The Hateful Eight reminisces of Kill Bill and the aforementioned Pulp Fiction. With the elongated scenes and in-depth, intricate dialogue, the film is engulfed with tension, intrigue and all the qualities required to lead my mind astray from the building ache in my buttocks due to excessive sitting.<br/><br/>Failure to appreciate the artistic beauty of Tarantino's shock value will ultimately leave you rather horrified due to the characteristic spewing of blood and an overtly disturbing scene regarding Samuel L Jackson's genitalia. But these reasons are why Tarantino is loved by so many.<br/><br/>With the acting predictably faultless, and a plot so expertly weaved, the attention of the audience is unhindered. The blizzard of suspense forces us to take refuge in the cosy yet hostile fascination with the 'who dunnit?'-esque narrative.<br/><br/>Not his best but still thoroughly enjoyable. Typically Tarantino. Quintessentially Quentin."
"cvk73","8","3","11","2 February 2016"," one of the better Tarantino movies
","A good movie. The characters are performing extremely well. The choice of the main female character is brilliant. The scenery is beautiful. The dialogs are compelling. The amount of blood is adequate for a Tarantino movie. I wished for a movie without the dreaded ""Laughing while killing/torturing"" but did not get it this time either. Tarantino seems to like that combination. I do not like it. Oh, and I can criticize the ending - just a little. Every experience - and a movie is a great experience - is judged mainly by its climax and its ending (that is a psychological fact). The recently discovered so called 'mirror neurons' are probably the reason why we seem to feel exactly like the main character in a movie at its very end. You feel like a winner after watching Rocky, you feel like James Bond after watching James Bond, you feel like the coolest guy on earth after watching the ending of Pulp Fiction, and so on... I sometimes think that the right ending or at least an ending that makes you feel great, is crucial for the making of a cult movie. Well, after ""The hateful eight"" you feel worn out, bled out and your balls hurt."
"dragline82","7","3","11","21 January 2016"," Tiresome Tarantino
","I finally understand why everyone talks about Tarantino. It's not that he's a great director, he's very good. It's that his experiments are more worth talking about than say, a great director's successes. You won't hear as zealous a talk over the Coen Brothers, who deserve it. You watch his movies, and as much as you think about the characters, you think about the direction. It's like a Kanye West song. Kanye West can't resist giving a shoutout to Kanye West. QT is the same. In doing this, it's hard to see his movies as actual stories, or get lost in them. That makes them shallow, and confuses what he's trying to say, if anything. There's also his need to make everything juvenile which is fine but it tends to throw off the tone, making it distracting. Also, it makes everything bloody to the point it's tiresome. Notice this is a review of the experience, not the movie. Notice you can't review a movie by him without saying Tarantino a lot. The movie has snow, a cabin, and guns. You get the picture."
"peefyn","8","3","11","17 January 2016"," Combining a slow pace with great action
","This movie is brutal. What happens in this cabin is absolute hell, and if you are not up for laughing at moral depravity, shy away from this movie. That said, the laughter is not from schadenfreude, but from the surprising ways the story takes you, the gruesomeness of some of the situations, and so on. While most definitely a slow, brooding movie - it's also a really funny one. Especially some of the reoccurring motifs, like the situation around the door, a letter, and the physical transformation of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character.<br/><br/>People have compared this movie to an Agatha Christie novel, and the set up is in many ways hearkens back to those kind of stories. But it is still distinctly a Tarantino take on it. There are several spots in the movie where a Poirot-esque scene (where a character reveals what he has learned by deduction) would not have been out of place - but Tarantino doesn't let much plot be revealed in this way. A lot of the dialogue in this movie consists of the character's talking about the other character's back stories (or their own, for that matter). And considering how trust and lies are important themes in this movie - it kind of makes sense. It does take a bit away from the realism, but Tarantino has a way of creating a cinematic reality that is believable despite the exaggerated situations and dialogue.<br/><br/>Tarantino succeeds in combining a slow pace with sudden bursts of action. Through most of the movie, the tension is high, and you know something will go down soon. Here is my main critique of this movie, because at some points the movie loses its momentum, leaving me impatient. It usually grabbed me back in shortly, but these dry spells were noticeable.<br/><br/>On a more personal note: I had really been looking forward to Morricone's return to making a western soundtrack. The result is good, really good, but I had expected the soundtrack to be more like the ones he made for Sergio Leone. Seeing as how such a soundtrack would not be that fitting for this movie, it's ultimately a good thing he didn't. So while I am satisfied with a great soundtrack used well, I'm also a bit disappointed for what I didn't get."

","Potentially the level of criticism comes from die hearted Tarantino fans who expected something different (Western inspired characters usually suggest bloodier scenes).<br/><br/>Still, in my view this a masterfully created script which delivers - you feel you are in the room with the characters most of time, and fully engaged in their conundrum.<br/><br/>The movie is very much driven by dialogue (less so by shooting which is perhaps a turnoff for some) and that is what make the script so good - despite not leaving the same scenario for most of the movie, you feel you are in a Cludo board game trying to tell apart the good from the bad guys, without even having a very obvious character to cheer on.<br/><br/>This could work amazingly as a play but as here it is very well transported to film and throughout the inn scenes you are always looking for the characters' next move.

","Now hear this.

Here is exactly what you get. A claustrophobic gabfest, essentially in one cabin, ultra gratuitous exploding blood squibs, ridiculous over use of the N. word and the F. word, a story that makes absolutely no sense, and perhaps worst of all, 168 minutes of your life gone, with nothing to show for it. The film is neither entertaining nor enlightening. It is however an endless parade of nonsense, that Tarantino mistakenly believed had meaning. Do yourself a favor and tell your friends to avoid this like you would a rabid dog.

"SpoilerAlertReviews","8","2","6","31 December 2016"," Tarantino at his finest again.
","Well I'll be double dog damned <br/><br/>Is it really the eighth film from Quentin Tarantino? I'm pretty sure he's done more than that or is saying the eighth film he's written and directed? Anyhow, I ain't gonna argue with the legendary QT. <br/><br/>What I love so much about Tarantino's films is his style, his respect to the cinema a lot of us grew up with. I can imagine, quite like myself, Tarantino watching movies as a child, lost in wonderment with aspirations of making these very same films, but not to do them better, he loves these classic, iconic films that lay foundation of his inspiration. No, he's just a guy that loves the movies and set out to make good films just like them. <br/><br/>So, his eighth film is the aptly named The Hateful Eight which is an amazing, encapsulating murder mystery reminding me very much of films like Clue and especially The Last Supper where the story's characters ultimately have a battle of wits until the bloody end. <br/><br/>Set a few years after the American civil war, an unforgiving blizzard forces the assembly of eight drifters each with their own agenda and notorious history. The halfway shack that shelters them isn't big enough for their egos and their suspicions just squeezing in deceptions until the eventual burst. <br/><br/>The cast is of the usual Tarantino family with a few new, but recognisable faces. Kurt Russell plays a bounty hunter known for keeping his bounties alive long enough to see them hang. He's hellbent on getting most-wanted but not so known outlaw, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the gallows in Red Rock, Wyoming. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson plays an ex-union Major-turned-bounty-hunter, Tim Roth a polite British hangman, Michael Madsen a quiet yet looming cowboy and Walton Goggins, who steals the show entirely, plays the unsuitable, supposedly newly elected sheriff of Red Rock. Goggins is the modern day Bill Paxton to me, never really get the lead roles but does an amazing job, this being his moment in my opinion. <br/><br/>Bruce Dern returns plays a confederate General who strikes up an instant rapport with Jackson's Warren. A couple of newbies to Tarantino's world, Demián Bichir as the Mexican and Jennifer Jason Leigh who fits perfectly among the rest of the rabble. <br/><br/>It's interesting and almost comical how everyone has mostly heard of one another, making the Wild West feel like an expansive small town with larger than character reputations. It's something Tarantino does so brilliantly, creating distinctive characters. <br/><br/>As expected, the script is sharpshootingly good, full of insulting, derogatory slurs and loaded with expletives. There's more showdowns of tongues than shootouts, but what comes should surely quench anyone's blood thirst. <br/><br/>I can't imagine how excited Tarantino must have been to have the maestro Ennio Morricone actually compose the score to this film as oppose to having his famous tracks used in many of Tarantino's precious films. He first western in 40yrs, It one-ups The Revenant in this respect though not taking anything away from Alvo Noto and the also legendary Ryuichi Sakamoto. <br/><br/>The bloody special effects are gruesome with thanks to Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead. The set location and especially the costumes are flamboyant yet suitable for the film. To be dressed as a Tarantino character must be both fun and amazing. <br/><br/>Tarantino's style is glorious as always, gladly still shooting with the ultra Panavision, anamorphic 70mm film which still, in my opinion, so stunning compared to digital. But the lighting, the close-ups and the entirely film is perfectly shot and seamlessly put together. <br/><br/>I can see this very much as a play on Broadway or at the West End. It's theatrical brilliance. But, is it Tarantino's best work? Still not as good as Pulp Fiction, but it doesn't try to be. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 9 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 0 <br/><br/>81% 8/10"

","This film is a remarkable piece of cinema. The character development is carried out in a painstakingly methodical way. QT's association with Samuel L Jackson goes back a long way, though some might say that this was the ""easy"" casting option. Anyone upset by the language or violence should not have gone to see a QT film.<br/><br/>However, for me, there is a problem and that problem is Inglorious Basterds which is an unbelievably taut, well crafted, gripping, believable (?) work of art.<br/><br/>Watching Hateful Eight for the most part all I could see were the I.B. references, which though it is often a directorial trait, missed the mark.<br/><br/>With regard to scoring the film I would have given a 9.5 if I had never seen the Basterds.

"BillSims28","9","2","6","30 October 2016"," Five-Word Review: Compelling, Tense, Exquisite, Wonderfully Acted
","The eight Tarantino film is another Western, this one set after Django Unchained in a snowy cabin in Wyoming. Eight people, including bounty hunters, a sheriff, a hangman, and an old general, find themselves locked up together with tensions rising and violence looming.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is premium Tarantino. It's got every trademark and subtle touch that you'd associate with the writer/director: bloody violence, extended scenes of hard-boiled, effortlessly compelling dialogue, fantastic tension, and Samuel L. Jackson, to name but a few. And talking of Jackson, this is probably his best role since Pulp Fiction, with some glorious monologues and an intriguing character background perfect for the actor's commanding screen presence. The widely-praised Jennifer Jason Leigh is superb, too, whilst Kurt Russell is fantastic as a John Wayne/Jeff Bridges hybrid. A delightful dandy performance from Tim Roth and Walton Goggins' comedic Southern persona round out a flawless cast. <br/><br/>Every single scene is just amazing to watch, even when all the characters are doing is sitting in a wagon idly talking, and this is clearly Tarantino's strength. The plot is finely crafted, with a genuinely intriguing mystery playing out as the enthralling story develops. The setting of a cramped space hearkens back to Reservoir Dogs, and the spellbinding suspense is on a level with that, especially as all the characters are so well-fleshed-out due to the brilliant script. <br/><br/>It's hard to praise The Hateful Eight enough as it's clearly a passion project for Tarantino, right down to the outstandingly scene-setting Ennio Morricone score. I really wish I'd been able to see the full Roadshow version complete with overture and intermission.<br/><br/>The fact that this is Tarantino's fifth-best film is more a testament to the quality of Django, Basterds, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs than a slight towards this. There's a feeling that it may not stay so long in the memory as the others, and it has an occasional tendency to prioritise violence and gore. Still, it's a must- watch for any Tarantino fan and one of the best films of 2015. 89/100"
"Tehmeh","7","2","6","6 August 2016"," Tarantino might need a little restraint.
","...not on the violence and ""offensive"" department necessarily, but structure-wise. It turns out that ""The Hateful Eight"" doesn't really know how it wants to present itself. I saw the shorter version, the one that's ""only"" 2hrs and 40min. I don't know how much tighter the longer version is, but I'll review what I saw.<br/><br/>I do like the idea. People who seemingly have unexpected connections are trapped somewhere, and everyone seems to have an agenda. It's more like a classic murder mystery than a western, even if the tonal (or even genre) changes do come to play eventually.<br/><br/>I know nothing about the cameras or film they used, but people seem to be making a big deal about it. Perhaps it is, and perhaps those wide interior shots were made possible with that stuff. But if you're looking for visual brilliance like ""The Revenant"", you won't get it. Even though some scenery (especially at the beginning) looks nice, most of this movie happens in a cottage. That's not a flaw in itself, and this movie surely isn't poorly shot (quite the opposite) but I guess I was hyped up to see something else. Granted, my experience is based on the DVD I watched, which is probably the worst way to watch this one. I had no chance to see this in a theater with the setup this was meant to be seen.<br/><br/>The structure is baffling. This movie is divided into chapters. Some chapters drag on and on. I like the dialogue, and the actors are fine, but it felt like I was binge-watching a short series. That alone isn't a big deal, but suddenly around chapter 3 or 4 (I forgot), you get a narrator. Suddenly the movie is narrated to you, and the storytelling methods change for a bit. At some point during the latter half, the movie skips in time and shows you the beginning before the end. While there is a charm to it, this type of stuff got me out of the experience. You're slowly lulled into thinking you're watching X, and then it changes into Y. Granted, it made things interesting in a different way, but I felt it happened at the expense of the atmosphere and tension.<br/><br/>With great editing, this could have been a tight, engaging 2-hour movie. Instead it's wrapped in a long and choppy, sometimes even seemingly directionless form. That mess isn't horrible in itself, and I think that each different tonal or story segment is at least decent on its own, but without the straightforward ending I would have felt cheated. <br/><br/>So what about the engaging end parts? Perhaps I'm just an idiot who can't appreciate fine details or narrative diversity, but the simple, brutal and engaging last segment heightened everything else that happened before it as well. Without the overblown bloody rampage the long, disjointed build-up would just be an experiment in story-telling and not much else. Yes, it gets violent and exaggerated. You know it's coming, and while I can see how Tarantino tried to make this movie into something else than just a violent, gruesome action piece, that same violent action was by far the most satisfying thing this movie had to offer.<br/><br/>Almost the entire cast is very damn good, and the rest are ""just"" good. Samuel L. Jackson is once again very captivating, even though I'm for some reason waiting for him to fail in these movies, as if all his good work was just an accident. Nope, he's very good. And while Walton Goggins seemed to be forcing his accent and mannerisms at first, he became one of my favorite actors/characters of this movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh was great from the start. Every time she was on screen she got me, and I think she gave the best performance of them all. Tim Roth is always a pleasure to watch, as is Bruce Dern. Kurt Russell was good enough, which is fitting. Everyone else was fine.<br/><br/>In a long Tarantino movie, you're going to get tons of dialogue. Most of the dialogue is captivating. It seems to be mundane, but there always seems to be something happening between the characters, they're not just words for words' sake. <br/><br/>There are many instances of the word ""nigger"" in this movie. If you can't handle words like that, you can stay away. Then again, if you enjoy white men getting the short end of the stick, you could probably enjoy the scene where Samuel L. Jackson's character tells a story (in flashbacks) about thoroughly humiliating a white man. I don't know if it was some kind of political commentary, which I'd rather not have in a Tarantino movie of all things, but those kind of scenes managed to give the title ""Hateful eight"" more weight. Everyone is a hateful, bad person in one way of another.<br/><br/>The soundtrack did nothing for me. This is weird in a Tarantino movie. At times it even irritated me a little. I know Morricone is a master of his craft, and if I ever watch this film again, I will pay more attention to the score.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie. It seemed to go nowhere at times, it couldn't (or didn't want to) hold its narrative on a tight rope, it's certainly very long, but the last 30-40 minutes made ""Hateful Eight"" a positive experience for me. I don't know if I'll be seeing it again. I hope that Tarantino can get people in his crew to challenge him more, or a master editor at least. <br/><br/>Recommended for tonal shift aficionados, narrative structure critics, ""people trapped in a house"" - enthusiasts, story detail hunters and of course those who just like to watch people getting murdered like no tomorrow (but skip to the end for that)."

You have said it all before dear Quentin.<br/><br/>In fact, same actors most parts, same style of dialog most part, they all have said same message before. This time sort of slowness is not building time for audience to realize upper meanings, it make it somewhat boring.<br/><br/>You also cannot have big twist for reasoning slower acts, when all can foresee what will come. And guess what, they guess just about right every time. You start to wonder, why I see this and that again.<br/><br/>That is not that movie have no meaning at all.

"LeonardHaid","8","2","6","3 July 2016"," A Movie That Theater Lovers Will Appreciate
","I can't imagine anyone who appreciates fine theater not liking The Hateful Eight. I even wonder if anyone who panned this movie has ever seen a top-level theater production of a drama. It has many elements of a great play, yet goes that extra mile in many ways because it's a movie. Essentially, it is one of those movies - like 12 Angry Men - that succeeds, and can be appreciated, as both a play and as a movie. But unlike 12 Angry Men, Tarantino takes more advantage of his movie being a movie, and really goes to town sometimes, as only Tarantino can do.<br/><br/>Plays are about communication. And communication among the characters is at the core of The Hateful Eight. If watching a movie unfold based on what people say to one another is not as thrilling to you as action, you may find that this movie falls short. But there is plenty of action, just not boom boom boom like in some other Tarantino movies. And nobody can ""climax"" like Tarantino...in a play the climactic scenes have to be minimalistic compared to what can be done in movies, and the cinematic climaxes in The Hateful Eight are Tarantino-esque...need I say more? <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight, like a fine play, is more thoughtful than the usual Tarantino flick. Tarantino has become a deeper thinker, more adept at imparting wisdom about humanity, about how minds work. He seems to have a deep understanding of his characters, considering that they're from another era and from a very different American subculture. That all of the main characters are pugnacious,abrasive,and deceptive, yet know how to conduct themselves in an eloquent way, demonstrates what kind of person Tarantino admires, at least as a movie character.<br/><br/>Finally, a great stage drama is all about character development, and how characters develop from social interaction, which makes it the most human of all the arts. Modern American film often subordinates character development, instead focusing more on holding the attention and interest of a target audience, which is not the kind that goes to the theater. (Kind of a snobby comment I guess, but I'll stick to it.)The Hateful Eight succeeds as a stage drama, and does not succumb as a movie, in this way.<br/><br/>I could go and on about how much I liked The Hateful Eight. I think it's Tarantino's best work."

","All the trite Tarantino elements are there - the disjointed timeline, the swish dialog, the gory edge, the relentless trails of vengeance. But the film never really satisfies. Not a single scene brings you to look forward to the next scene; The count of graphically busted human organs is exasperatingly boring in relation to how it helps propel the story and convey the ambiance; The suspense of disbelief is never properly established as you're launched into the fantastically impossible world the story takes place in (just to give an idea, Django and Inglorious Bastards are near historical documentaries in comparison to this film's world).<br/><br/>The outcome - A superficial, irresponsible exercise by a director who seem to be engorged by the notion of testing the extent to which his audiences are willing to embrace his work, regardless of it's content.<br/><br/>And to add to all this sham, nothing is new here: Lock up a few men with guns in a single room, give them all intermittent chances of play, and shuffle the odds as best fits, was already done, successfully, cleverly and masterfully, by Tarantino himself, in Reservoir Dogs. Do yourself a favor and watch that movie (again and again) for the best that Tarantino delivered, and avoid this disrespectful piece of populist cinema - most likely the worst that Tarantino have mustered so far."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","6","13 June 2016"," A melting pot of all things Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino's films continue to look more and more like the films that inspired him. His last film, ""Django Unchained,"" brought the spaghetti western to the deep south. ""The Hateful Eight"" is a straight up western, albeit set in Wyoming during a blizzard — with the legendary Ennio Morricone behind the score.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is a melting pot of all things Tarantino. The tactics that have long drawn praise are in full array, as are those that have long drawn some criticism. So in that respect, Tarantino's biggest fans will leave this very long film with smiles on their faces. Everyone else — it's not so simple.<br/><br/>As someone who has both loved and been turned off by Tarantino, I was skeptical yet open-minded about his eighth feature film. Turns out the Western genre really does suit his pulpy style better than the backdrops of some of his other perhaps more experimental films. Somehow the Western frontier is one of few settings where Tarantino's rules can be argued to make any sense.<br/><br/>The first couple acts of ""Hateful Eight"" take place in a stage coach as John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his prized bounty, alleged murderer Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), travel toward the town of Red Rock (where the bounty is to be paid, and Daisy hung) with a blizzard nipping at their heels. On the way they pick up a couple stranded strangers: fellow bounty hunter and former Union soldier Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), son of an infamous southern marauder who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. Despite having good reason not to trust either of them, Ruth lets them tag along to Minnie's Haberdashery, where they'll wait out the storm — and the distrust only escalates.<br/><br/>At the haberdashery are Bob (Demian Bichir), professional hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), old Confederate General Sandy Smithers and cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen). Soon enough it becomes clear that one or more of these men is in not who they say they are and are likely fixing to foil Ruth's plan.<br/><br/>There's a strong thriller/mystery element to ""Hateful Eight"" that we haven't gotten from Tarantino in a long time. There are a couple unexpected, non-linear plot devices that add a greater layer of satisfaction to the way everything plays out beyond Tarantino's typical promise and delivery of carnage. The truth of what really happened and what everyone is really after hangs over the film from start to finish in a quite masterful way. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, there are a lot of similarities between ""Hateful Eight"" and Tarantino's first feature, ""Reservoir Dogs."" There's a large but tight ensemble cast (including Roth and Madsen), false identities, a confined setting and sadistic violence. ""Eight"" is just flashier, though much of that can be attributed to budget and the fact that Tarantino can do whatever he wants given his success since 1992.<br/><br/>But in terms of being brutal and uncomfortable, that's where the comparisons end. Taking place post-Civil War, ""Hateful Eight"" features abundant racial vulgarities and assault against women (Ruth keeps Daisy in line by regularly smashing her face in). Between ""Django"" and ""Eight,"" Tarantino has easily surpassed any other filmmakers' use of the n- word in two films (or the use of that word in any two other films ever made, probably). He continues to become more and more provocative and debatably without any clear artistic justification except to rattle the viewer.<br/><br/>Let's steer clear of that argument for now, however, and focus on how ""Hateful Eight"" does seem to offer some other cogent thoughts. Whereas Tarantino mostly includes violence for the sake of violence in his films, his script offers some more deeper thoughts on justice than usual. Encapsulated quite well in a little speech given by Roth's Oswaldo about the difference between the law's justice and frontier justice, Tarantino points our attention to the different ways bad people get what they deserve, which puts a bit of a thematic framework around the film's proceedings and — dare I say it — provokes some thought.<br/><br/>That's more than you'd expect from a film that from the onset clearly endeavors to kill off almost its entire cast over the course of three hours. Maybe the Morricone score dupes us into thinking what's on screen is more powerful and meaningful than it really is, or maybe Tarantino has struck up a little more genius than we thought a pulp Western could deliver.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

Really don't understand it<br/><br/>i mean isn't a movie supposed to be interesting? and when its finished you wanna be wanting it not to be finished?<br/><br/>Yes it all looks and sounds good, but what about boring to death apart from 5 minutes? really i was bored and watching how much longer it as gonna take. the acting was overdone and sometimes poor. it was 2 and half our i rather spend doing something else to be honest. i watched a lot of movies so I'm not someone who just say a movie is crap cos i need attention. I loved From Dusk till Dawn and Kill Bill,but this is one of those movies that I'm like no, its just not good nor fun to watch. and its just not a movie Tarantino should bring, its not good enough for his standards.<br/><br/>if you just like to watch a movie that looks good, this one is for you. However if you want to watch a good movie with a good story, great acting, great dialogues, great action, that keeps you fascinated till the end and amazes you. I advice to watch another movie."

","First of all, I want to define something. When I say ""better than I expected"", I don't mean that it was a bad movie but you'd be able to see it at last. No! I knew from the beginning that we were talking about something good not only from the director or the screenplay, but from the cast, the pictures and the atmosphere. A very good mystery movie with a western background. Some deaths and everybody are suspects. Known formula, good plot, everyone played very well (especially Jennifer J. Leigh) and after the first hour you can't even take a breath. Personally, I think it's Tarantino's best movie. Even better than Reservoir Dogs. However, he payed to much attention in uninterested things such as how they all of them met together and although it started very good it ends with a LOT of blood. Just like every of his movies, but it was really a lot. It wasn't necessary. Never the less, it was a good movie, I have already watched it twice. It was a new chapter on westerns movies. I highly recommend it! <br/><br/>7/10"
"Skruffbagg","9","2","6","31 May 2016"," For Tarantino fans, this is one of his best. For others, maybe avoid
","Quentin Tarantino is a hard man to like. His films are the very definition of R-rated. There are many who find his brand of gory violence and profanity extremely distasteful, offensive even. This must be taken into account before you watch The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>Personally I am a great fan of his work, and although I don't find him infallible, he has a very clear vision of exactly what he wants to show you and has a habit of getting the very best out of his cast. This is to be respected.<br/><br/>With his eighth feature, Tarantino has created a masterful suspense whodunnit that harks back to Reservoir Dogs (1992) for inspiration, set almost entirely within one room over the course of nearly 3 hours. <br/><br/>In the glorious opening act - taking up a full hour of screen time - we are introduced to a cast of larger than life characters, none of whom have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, but are so well fleshed out that you almost begin to like them (and pity them when they start getting bumped off). As things begin to unravel, you will find yourself studying their faces trying to suss them out, and who is (if there even is one) the true protagonist of the bunch. As the pressure cranks up, you may find yourself literally perspiring in anticipation of what is to come. I certainly did.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight does not shy away from extreme violence or language, and when it comes it flows. This will put many off and is understandable, but for those that love this particular brand of vodka, it's a joy to behold. I'm still smiling about it now.<br/><br/>This is definitely Tarantino's most intimate film since Pulp Fiction (1994), and is epic in every sense of the word. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to see this. There are people who will say it is way too long and some of the plot elements have no real bearing on the story, but if you love this stuff already then you will find everything you need here.<br/><br/>Best film of 2015? Hell yes. Will it make you enjoy Tarantino if you don't already? Hell no."
"michaelRokeefe","8","2","6","30 May 2016"," Prolific violence. Truly rough and raw western.
","If you like rough, rowdy, tough and raw...this one you will probably like. Quentin Tarantino's eight movie is not exactly his best; but it is far from being bad. Some can be disappointed, but THE HATEFUL EIGHT has no problem pleasing those looking for the expected bloody violence.<br/><br/>The Civil War has ended and a stagecoach hurtles through snowy Wyoming (filmed in Colorado) as infamous bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to Red Rock in the name of justice. Savage blizzard conditions will end up having a gathering of conflicting characters holding up a way station. Vengeful Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a notorious bounty hunter to his own acclaim; Oswald Mobray (Tim Roth), the hang man in Red Rock; Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins), the new sheriff of Red Rock; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and journal writing cowpoke, Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir) are hunker-downed in the old drafty haberdashery known as Minnie's.<br/><br/>Paranoria, mistrust and grandiose tales turn the movie into an over talkative, violent free-for-all. Tarantino narrates this film that plays out in chapters as an over-the-top brutal and vulgar stage play. There is so much detail in filling out the characters and the look of the film itself is as beautiful as it is rustic. <br/><br/>Also in the cast: Channing Tatum, Zoe Bell, James Parks, Dana Gourrier, Lee Horsley and Craig Stark. <br/><br/>No surprise in the R rating for the strong violence, sexual content and some graphic nudity. Raw, rough language is a given. Hey, this is Tarantino."
"Quinoa1984","10","2","6","24 May 2016"," ""Oh, a Haberdashery, it's a joke.""
","I had the suspicion watching this again that this could become like another JACKIE BROWN for Tarantino - a film that is somewhat (not altogether but somewhat) under-appreciated and will gain in following and status over time. It's a difficult film to embrace, and yet watching it again I don't know if I can call it completely 'nihilistic'. That's the belief that everything is meaningless, in nothing. I think that these characters, or some of them, want to believe in *something* - hell, even Daisy has a family, right, that has some meaning to it - but it's really about the *FAILING* of meaning, how meaning is screwed up by the promises and hopes of the American dream.<br/><br/>The Lincoln letter, the leaders of the confederacy and the ""Renegade Army"" and of course what slavery did and continues to do, so that even those who are ""free"" like Marquis Warren are never really free, not in their own life time (and if you read in-between the lines this is much more of an ex-slave getting revenge than Django, who was ready to go on his merry way once he got his bride), these are all things that poison and distort the truth of things.<br/><br/>So in a way it's actually an extremely moral film - well, EXTREME and MORAL as a film put together when you think about it - and that it's all acted by the gathered performers without a missed note (seeing it again the depth to which Madsen gives Joe Gage sticks out a little more, the image of the ""Cowpoke"" who is a twisted nightmarish killer), and while I don't think Tarantino is an overtly political filmmaker he's certainly seen his rather large fair share of spaghetti westerns and many of those were very political, plus he is not untouched by the world around him so in a way this reflects the country we're in far more than anything else I can think of in the past couple of years. <br/><br/>Not to mention the direction, seeing as this is all shot on gigantic 70mm cameras and there's no space for things like hand-held shots or zooms like on other films, he has to shoot much of this straight on. We can't look away from these mother****ers, QT may be saying, and with the way he frames shots it makes a stark, delicious contrast: often exquisite cinematography (not only the shots of the bitterly cold wilderness, an ideal backdrop for this story where nothing green or natural grows, but those details in the confining Haberdashery), and the subjects themselves are mostly rotten (except for Warren who is my favorite character, bar none, and Jackson makes him vivid and awe-inspiring and yet very human and vulnerable by the last act ).<br/><br/>Also, it does have a lot of stuff Tarantino's done before - theatrical ""acting"" to win over other characters' trust, verbiage that almost goes on too long but hey, hell with it, he can do it better than anyone and every word feels like it should be there (cut out one and it might start to unravel), and some gruesome violence (though on repeat viewing it's not THAT gruesome - I'd say it's about on par with Pulp Fiction on the scale, so much less than the Kill Bills or Django or Basterds, so if there are a lot of bodies that hit the floor and blood that flows in the 2nd half, it stands out because of how we've come to this.... okay, the throwing up of blood is still sick, but hilarious) - but when it's Tarantino and I love his stuff, I can't complain.<br/><br/>good times, QT salad."

","Quentin Tarantino writes and directs and it stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Lee, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Micahel Madsen, Demian Bichir and Bruce Dern. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Robert Richardson.<br/><br/>Wyoming, wintertime, and an assortment of suspect characters are holed up at Minnie's Haberdashery while a blizzard rages outside. Soon enough suspicions and ugly human traits come to the fore...<br/><br/>Tarrantino is on a Western/Southern/Oater/Civil War kick these days, here following on from Django Unchained, this is set just post the Civil War. Proudly homaging genres he loves, he throws all his trademarks at The Hateful Eight for glorious results - that is on proviso you happen to be a fan of his in the first place.<br/><br/>Picture is split into two halves. First half sets up the characters who come to be at Minnie's, the conversations are pungent with Tarrantino's caustic and comedic writing, the characterisations equally so, whilst we have been treated to some absolutely gorgeous Colorado vistas. There's a constant sense of mistrust in the air, while racism, misogyny and political fall outs pulse away in set up scenarios. <br/><br/>Then it's the second half, where after a wee bit of narration that had me thinking my Blu-ray player had somehow started playing The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, hell then comes to Minnie's! It quickly becomes evident we have been part of a Tarrantino parlour game, a game of Clue - cum - Ten Little Indians, only in a Wild West setting, and with blood, bones and bile in full effect.<br/><br/>The whole thing is wonderfully stylish in the way that Tarrantino is known for. The cartoonish horror mingles with more biting observations on humanity, the violence shocks to get a reaction from the viewer, for better or worse, and always there is humour, where Hateful Eight proves itself to be one damn funny film.<br/><br/>Morricone scores it as cartoon horror with Western strains, and it's magnificent, it sounds like the evil twin to his score for The Untouchables. The cast are super (though a couple of them are not given much to do), with Leigh standing out, and Messrs Jackson and Russell hold glorious excessive court. Costuming is most appealing, as is the set-design for Minnie's. And director QT? Well he does his thing, chapters and verse and playful filmic cunning. 9/10"

You would think that it will feel claustrophobic having 90% of the scenes just inside this bar / house but for the whole 2+ hours of it, you will be glued to highly entertaining scrip writing and plot twists. It is engaging enough to have you forget that you were just in a bar / house for nearly 2 hours. The sound score completes the film. And even though we are seeing usual Tarantino actors in most of his films, each and every time he introduces us to characters who are somewhat familiar but then really we are not. This film i can watch again for the years on coming. Classic!"
"fabkingcliff","9","2","6","29 April 2016"," An addition to Tarantino's masterpieces
","Quentin Tarantino is once again responsible for another whodunit subgenre with as much gore, foul language and the n-word galore. These of course are the highlights of any Tarantino film. If you had been waiting for his latest cinematic tour-de-force, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a situation film laden with heavy dialogue and tossing around of the n-word by Caucasian characters. It should in no way be looked at through that scope alone though, for the screenplay in general is neither politically correct nor apologetic. Tarantino sets up a simple plot with a lot of emphasis on dialogue and subplot while taking enough time to develop his ever malicious characters. There is seldom any good guy or bad guy in a Tarantino flick; the last man standing after an explicit bloodbath is usually the hero of the story.<br/><br/>Fate forces eight strangers to share a cabin located on a mountain pass as a heavy blizzard licks the lands of post-civil war Wyoming. It all begins with a bounty hunter of the name John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is transporting Daisy Domergue; a fugitive to be hanged, crossing paths with another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) with no name aside from ""black fella"", ""the n-word"" etc. who is also on his way to the town of Red Rock to deliver his kill and collect bounty. The Hangman allows the stranded lad aboard his stagecoach and they make for Red Rock, prior to taking on another passenger who claims to be the town's newly appointed sheriff.<br/><br/>As the blizzard grows on them however, they seek shelter in a cabin known as Minnie's Haberdashery. Here, they meet four lodgers of which Joe Gage, a cowboy, Bob, a Mexican, Oswald Mobray, another hangman and lastly a veteran of the battle of Baton Rouge. The tension is omnipresent, for each of these individuals knows better than to trust the next man.After someone only seen by Domergue poisons the coffee, the real confrontation begins between the eight rascals.<br/><br/>If you've ever seen any Quentin Tarantino film, then you know that they heavily rely on dialogue, narration and retrospection. The Hateful Eight is no exception; we learn about the characters as they learn about each other, since they are usually brought together by fate. A great portion of the film takes place indoors and it is very talky as mentioned. <br/><br/>One of most attractive aspects of the film however is the cinematography. Having been shot in 70 mm ultra-Panavision, the wide lenses capture the snow covered western landscape with sharp detail and a crisp color scheme topped with a warm overtone. The image is as large as should be. The cinematographer here is Bob Richardson and he brings as many wide shots as close ups to enhance the story. <br/><br/>I don't understand people who still complain about Tarantino's art. Truly his films are protracted and the stories are extreme but that's only because he has reputation for greatness which allows studios to leave the final cut in his hands. I wouldn't say his latest project is a classic (in contrast with his other work) but it is definitely a masterpiece. The score is partially nonexistent and it works for the story while the acting is the real winner here. <br/><br/>Although subpar to Tarantino's own standards,The Hateful Eight is an amusing exercise in vulgarity and gore -two recurrent themes in the director's body of work which are not always met with universal approval, and one of the immortal high points of modern cinema. Do not believe in the few who are bashing it, this film is mostly for the Tarantino fans who know what to expect from him while the rest will feel cheated as the end credits roll. Definitely go see this one."

","The Hateful Eight was quite simply the best movie that i watched in 2016(as of April).<br/><br/>The movie had been given bad ratings by a few Tarantino fans and that almost made me not want to watch it but for the sheer love for the plots of his movies i decided to watch it anyway and was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie retains the type of storytelling from the legendary Pulp Fiction and Samuel Jackson just brings life into the whole film. Set in the post Civil War period, the film brings eight strangers to one lodge where ""one of them is not what he says he is."" What follows in the movie contains equal measures of fun and suspense as all the characters are killed in an almost Reservoir Dogs like style.<br/><br/>For me, this is a movie that combines all the characteristics that make a Tarantino film stand out from all others and it is right up there in the list of his all time best with Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>It was certainly a great decision to watch this film and there is no doubting the fact that i will be watching it many times in the future as well."

The views with the hills must be appreciated, thus the first half of the movie might seem a bit slow, as it is filled with indescribable nature views, and not so much of the action. But as this is a Tarantino movie, all the blood comes at one point. It is beautiful and disgusting at the same moment. It might be fun and uncomfortable for the actors - to be soaked in artificial blood for half of the movie.<br/><br/>I was totally surprised to see Channing Tatum in this movie as this name comes up only paired with a dance movie or a terrible comedy. He had a smart part, but this might lead him to some actual normal parts. Is this another try from Tarantino to save the guy just as Pulp fiction helped Bruce Willis? <br/><br/>Any how, it might seem as a bit slower and more peaceful movie, in comparison to other movies, he has recently done.

There are a lot of scenes to long for what you need (you see horses and cartwheels running for literally 10-15 min of the movie and the first 30-40 min could have been done in 15). Second, no characters to create bonds with, but that was made on purpose (I mean, the name of the movie is the HATEFUL eight). And third, you are not going to watch Toy Story, this is a movie with vulgarity (n**** word, swears, ...) and blood abuse. If you can't see that kind of movie that's okay but don't be the person that complain when they brought their kid to R rated movies.<br/><br/>Now the good stuff! This is a movie with Agatha Christie's style, where you are looking for the unknown murderer. If you like that kind of movie, you will like it. This movie is made mostly in a single room and that fact make that room interesting for the movie (every places of every object, every character is important and I loved it!).

"Ed-Shullivan","7","2","6","11 April 2016"," The Good...The Bad...and the Ugly
","1. THE GOOD: The cinematography which was completed in 60-70mm made for such a wonderful viewing experience for the audience that you have to watch the film simply for the luscious landscape and wide(er) screen vision that director Quentin Tarantino used with 60 year old camera lens to enhance the picture for his viewing audience. The abundance of so many quality actors in one film was especially a welcomed treat as well. Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir and Tim Roth all added to the films star quality.<br/><br/>Consensus: I have not seen such fantastic picture quality in widescreen 70mm format since the 1968 film classic Ice Station Zebra. Additionally, Ennio Morricone won an Oscar for the film's music score which Mrs. Shullivan and I greatly enjoyed.<br/><br/>2. THE BAD: A lot of Samuel L Jackson's dialogue went on far longer than required as did some of the dialogue of the other co-stars. Samuel L Jackson played bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren.<br/><br/>Consensus: The continued windy dialogue sequences caused the film to lose some of its intended suspense such that Ms. Shullivan turned to me half way through the film and asked how many chapters were in the film?<br/><br/>3. THE UGLY: Kurt Russell played bounty hunter John Ruth, ""The Hangman"", and he was travelling by stagecoach to a town called Red Rock to deliver his captor, murderess Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh who had a $10,000 bounty on her head wanted dead or alive. Although bounty hunter nicknamed The Hangman was known for bringing his captors in alive so that he could watch them hang he just about killed poor Daisy before he would reach Red Rock with his continued physical beatings with his fists, elbows, and the butt end of his gun leaning harshly into her bloodied face. <br/><br/>Consensus: The de-humanizing of the only female star in the film captor Daisy Domergue set back the woman's movement 50 years. Although Jennifer Jason Leigh received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for her captor's role Mrs. Shullivan and I both took offense to the unnecessary brutality and continued beatings she absorbed. Having beef stew thrown all over her face, receiving the butt end of a gun to bloody her face and forehead, punched repeatedly by both bounty hunters was another unnecessary blow (no pun intended) to all real battered women. I for one did not feel her continued bloodied face entitled her to an Oscar nomination as her speaking lines were limited, not warranted of an Oscar nomination, and not core to the films plot which was to determine who was the gunmen trying to free murderess Daisy Domergue? The film seemed more intended to appeal to some viewers sick desire of seeing men batter women resulting in blood all over an ugly women's face. <br/><br/>I must say that I enjoyed Quentin's prior western entry Django Unchained much more for its complete story line and entertainment value than The Hateful Eight which was a tad bit longer than necessary but still good enough that I want to purchase a Blu Ray copy for future viewing as we love Quentin Tarantino's complete body of work.<br/><br/>7/10"

I went for the movie only because I saw Tarantino's name on the poster, then I went in the cinema without any idea of what this movie was about. So, during the first chapter, I spends lots of time watching them chatting, having no clue what's happening while not knowing how long this movie will be. Simply put, I was bored. <br/><br/>Second, I got confused from time to time when the introduction of narrator came in from the background.

"battista880","9","2","6","1 April 2016"," A quick review on The Hateful Eight
","Thanks to the 70mm film the director takes advantage of a very large frame, a peculiarity used with some tricks on the focus, by making the viewer see what he (Tarantino) wants him to see. The camera is fixed most of the time, a kind of style similar to the great Sergio Leone. The power of the images of Tarantino is not the same of the ones by Leone, but it reminds me of those, for example in the first long and very slow sequence of the crucifix, and also in the use of music.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone, sublime as always, gives Tarantino his compositions, that don't stick perfectly with the images (like in other Morricone's films), but they do it with the plot and with the sense of anxiety and mystery.<br/><br/>The characters are perfectly built. In a way that only Tarantino knows, they are given the right depth, not too much for the shadow of mystery, and not too little in order to make the viewer remember of: the nice hangman, played by Tim Roth, that looks like a relative of the previous Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained); the captive, Jennifer Jason Leigh, that gets more unpleasant every time she opens her mouth; the mythical anti-hero played by Samuel L. Jackson, a kind of character that seems recurring in Tarantino filmography that may deserve a long separated consideration; and the others.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a clear demonstration of how the love of Tarantino for the writing is increasing. He has even said that he could write theater plays once he will end with movies (we truly hope he never will).<br/><br/>Someone said that, especially in the first part, the film was full of political, long and boring dialogs that made them hate the movie. I think Tarantino's dialogs are never boring and, even if political (maybe the only thing I didn't like of the movie), built on a language that you can easily remember, a language near to the real society and not to the heroes of Hollywood."

And oh boy, was it worth it! <br/><br/>It first started really slow and reminded me of 'The Revenant' quite a lot at times. But this movie does everything so damn well that you lose track of time and just want the story just keep going. I honestly didn't expect this caliber of first-class performances from _everybody_. It just kept me pondering who I should hate or root for. Samuel, Goggins and everyone else really brought the characters alive and the acting was incredibly strong.

","Not Tarantino's best title, but still a very enjoyable and intriguing movie.<br/><br/>What I loved most is the mixture of feeling: in the beginning the photography and speed recall to the classic 70's Giallos, then it surprises you with a complete change of direction. It's like an old Giallo made PROPERLY and with modern realism and violent contents. The acting was very convincing and great, the screenplay really well made and the lines smart and funny as usual. Morricone soundtrack was really weird in some point (like during the snow storm) and gave the movie that ""out of place"" touch I mentioned before, the main theme is really intriguing and honestly I've whistled for a good couple of hours. Talking about the gore, there are bloody shooting but without gory details (the only one is an head explosion) sincerely nothing extreme and disturbing like people are saying. All in all a very good movie<br/><br/>Who is voting this movie with 1 star, deserve 10 stars right between their eyes. You can't vote a movie 1 stars, just because you don't liked it.

"ThePlagueLegion","9","2","6","16 March 2016"," Achieves Greatness but falls short of Excellence.
","The 8th film from director Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"", is a murder-mystery-western film about eight strangers stuck together in a lodge during a fierce blizzard while one or more is hiding a deadly secret.<br/><br/>I must say, this film was up to my expectations and then some. Considering I was expecting one of Tarantino's weakest films, given some of the backlash it received,but I was pleasantly surprised. I could see it being in my Top 5 favorites of Tarantino's, ranked somewhere lower than ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""Inglorious Bastards"", but higher than ""Kill Bill"", ""Django Unchained"", and ""Death Proof"". It is told in a play-esque format - with chapters and an intermission crafting the narrative structure as well as narration and long sequences of backstories, lies, confrontations and exchanges of conversation. This may be unappealing for some, but I found it charming as well as admirable of Tarantino to rely upon the strength of his cast rather than overblown action. Plus, it pays off, as the performances and the eventual action build in quality with each chapter. <br/><br/>The acting was both versatile and memorable, with standout performances from Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. Russell brings an intimidating, aggressive but strangely enjoyable personality to his role as John ""The Hangman"" Ruth while Goggins is both the funniest and most likable character, Chris Mannix, in the film. Leigh earns her Oscar nod in her supporting role as Daisy Domergue, who I found myself both hating and sympathizing with at once. Jackson steals the show, however, as Major Warren, a cold-hearted but irresistibly interesting bounty hunter that showcases Jackson's best talent in years. <br/><br/>Tim Roth is another standout in a cartoonish, but despicable supporting role as Englishman Oswaldo Mobray, whose exaggerated accent and mannerisms make him both unsettling and hilarious. Michael Madsen as Joe Gage, Bruce Dern as Sanford Smithers and Demian Bichir as Senor Bob are all great in their roles, as well.<br/><br/>All these characters fit the ""Hateful"" aspect but have moments of shining, likable personality. It's this conflict of flaws and strengths that make the characters the best part of the film. My allegiances switched commonly through the film, which was both more real and more gritty in it's tonal appeal. Russell as Ruth is abusive and antagonistic but later shows feelings and compassion towards both his own emotions and his allies. Jackson's Warren is a twisted, almost sickeningly evil, at times, man but has motives that make him understandable and ""root- able"" for. Goggins' Mannix is dim-witted, crass and biased against African Americans but has a good heart and an admirable loyalty to allies, and Leigh's Domergue is a lying, manipulative, conniving woman that still has a sympathetic side and an almost seductive (through her determination and fast talk) appeal to her. Dern's Smithers is a committer of war crimes but still holds a place in his son, Bichir's ""Bob"" is obviously hiding a diabolical secret but is still good mannered (and a talented pianist) Madsen's Gage is confrontational but is admirably defense of Daisy's safety, and Roth's old-fashioned, gentleman like behavior almost overshadows his blood-thirsty ways. <br/><br/>However, there are flaws present. A few scenes of predictably yet unsettling Tarantino-esque graphic content come across as borderline unnecessary and the pacing could be considered a tad off, as the whole first two ""chapters"" of the film are rather dragged out. These flaws are forgivable, but due to them, it makes holds back the film from truly being a 10/10. <br/><br/>That said, I found great acting, great dialogue and even better cinematography in ""The Hateful Eight"". The 70mm Ultra-Panivision looks great, bringing out nuances and details in both the outdoor environments and the indoor set of the lodge our characters find themselves in. Ennio Morricone's score is also great, as it builds both suspicious suspense as well as a deeply troubling atmosphere that keeps you on your toes for each tension-fueled moment of paranoia and confrontations. <br/><br/>Visceral, tight and suspenseful, Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is an all round great movie that is undercut by both unnecessary controversy (This movie is not racist or misogynist - I can't stand those who have labeled it as such.) as well as legitimate flaws. While I personally didn't mind a few of them, I could understand other disliking it and even (ahem) hating it's flaws. <br/><br/>9/10 - Great, Superb, Nearly Excellent - ""See this movie!"""

"valadas","7","2","6","18 February 2016"," A brutal movie
","I don't remember having ever seen any such brutal movie like this, with so many killings in a close space. But it is anyway a good movie though not very good only because the story is not particularly moving or interesting. Fundamentally it deals with a bounty hunter who is taking to a town as his prisoner in a stage coach a woman who had committed a murder, to be presented to justice and probably hanged. For that he will receive 10 thousand dollars as a reward. All this in the middle of a terrible snow storm and an awful cold. What would be an easy task turns out a very complicated one for the appearing of several individuals and the gathering of all the people in some kind of bar cabin in the middle of that stormy wilderness. Later we learn that some were there to wait for the prisoner and free her although they disguise their aim and identities. What has begun to be an apparent cordial relationship among all the people turns soon out on a relation of violent hostility with successive killings and blood everywhere. However, technically it is a very well made movie and very well acted. All the characters are very well characterized and made up in terms of physical appearances, dialogues and action. There are also scenes of great dramatic intensity. It is a movie that has also something to do with human nature."

"isaiahwilson15","9","5","23","4 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight once again shows Tarantino's mastery of filmmaking.
","At this point, I am convinced that Tarantino can not make a bad movie. The Hateful Eight is filled with all ""Tarantino"" qualities that once again make an amazing movie. In Tarantino's latest film, he makes a nice callback to his debut film, Reservoir Dogs, utilizing the similar ""Who had done it"" storyline. The Hateful Eight focuses on an interesting set of characters who find themselves stuck in a haberdashery. Thanks to the use of some very engaging dialogue, each character develops a distinctive persona that helps strengthen the overall tension felt between the characters. The best quality, however, is its twist ending that really helps distinguish it from Reservoir Dogs. This twist combined with the humor, violence, and vulgarity that can be expected from Quentin Tarantino help make The Hateful Eight one of Tarantino's best movies. In conclusion, I would say that The Hateful Eight is an absolutely excellent movie, and isn't necessarily for those who aren't fans of Quentin Tarantino."
"TheLlamaManStan","9","5","23","3 January 2016"," an Excellent Movie for True Cinema Lovers (spoiler-free review)
","The following review is 100% spoiler-free for those of you who are considering whether the movie is appropriate or not for yourself.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's the Hateful Eight is truly a piece of art. I have seen all of the films that Tarantino has directed (except for Jackie Brown), and this is definitely his 2nd or 3rd best (after Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).<br/><br/>This movie was excellent from all aspects. The cast that Tarantino managed to gather for this one is superb. The cinematography is, as in all Tarantino movies, exceptional and some of the best I've seen in a long time. The plot in this film is, story-wise, quite simple, however, the way it plays out and the order in which the events unfold make for an excellent, unique western story.<br/><br/>In the Hateful Eight, Tarantino captures his audience from the first shot shown on screen. Using rich dialogue and beautiful cinematography, somebody that truly appreciates film will find their eyes glued to the screen for the entire three hour runtime. Tarantino nailed the 70mm cinematography in this film. Since the aspect ratio on 70mm is huge (2.76:1), the camera can see much more than a normal 35mm camera can. The cinematography in this film was more than satisfying, with some unbelievable landscape shots, and very interesting shots from inside the main room from which the story is told, and from a horse carriage.<br/><br/>So, why the bad reviews? If this is such a great film, then there should be much less people that disliked the movie. Well, first of all, this movie is extremely violent. In fact, it is probably Tarantino's first or second most violent film (after Kill Bill Vol. 1...and I'm pretty sure the Hateful Eight was actually more violent). In fact, the movie is so violent to the point where I felt that some of the violence was over-the-top, felt out of place, and decreased the quality of the movie (hence the 9/10). I will not go into detail on the violence, due to spoilers, however, if you can not stomach strong violence, then this movie is definitely not for you.<br/><br/>Additionally, I realized that a lot of people in the reviews complained about how ""boring"" the movie was, and mentioned how they walked out of the movie in the middle. Well, I'd like to point out how absurd that is. The Hateful Eight is not your normal western or action movie, it is a one of a kind film. If you are going to watch this movie purely for the violence, or purely for the ""beautiful 70mm landscape shots"", then don't bother. And if you're complaining about the amount of over-the-top violence, well...it's Tarantino. And while I do admit that this movie was supremely violent, what do you expect? After all, it IS a Tarantino film. Anyways, a large portion of the film is a build-up, and is, of course, filled with Tarantino's excellent dialogue between the characters. So for those of you that walked out in the middle and complained about how ""boring"" the movie is...oh, well. I guess you don't have the time and patience to appreciate the skill that Tarantino has of toying around with words in between characters.<br/><br/>To conclude, the Hateful Eight is an excellent movie, and, in my opinion, one of Tarantino's best. However, it is not a film for everyone. It is not an action movie or a classic western. While some beautiful 70mm landscape shots are included, most of the movie is not just beautiful shots of nature and mountains. Nevertheless, the cinematography is still excellent. It is also extremely violent, so if you can't stomach violence, then pass on this one. If you don't appreciate or don't mind for rich dialogue between characters and the unique way that Tarantino builds suspense, then it's probably not worth your time. However, if you are a Tarantino fan, or show a true appreciation for cinema, or even, if this movie just caught your attention and you think you'd like it (and you can handle violence, of course), then give it a try. Approach this movie with an open mind, and I assure you, you'll leave satisfied.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Since his groundbreaking debut Reservoir Dogs, Hateful Eight is Tarantino's first film that's readymade to be performed on stage. Less cinematic than anything the blockbuster-auteur has done in two decades, Hateful Eight spends its lengthy runtime focusing on its charactersand what characters they are. Lovingly written with a clear grasp on its densely layered story, Tarantino passionately unravels and unhinges the levels of his tale, while maintaining his signature eye for geeky detail and meticulous backstory. The end product is an immersive chamber western that worms its way into your brain long after the bloody and hilarious affair has ended. As with each of Tarantino's films, it's bursting with capital 'C' Character, making it a breeze to spend 3 hours in this world. The small-ish cast is packed full of giant performances, each one bringing a different level of craze to their character. Leigh, in particular, quietly steals every moment as a grown-up and deeply disturbed murderess version of Ally Sheedy from Breakfast Club. Not that she's the only standout; in fact, there really isn't a hate-able role in the bunch, as a palpable sense of danger underscores every character beat and interaction. Above all, we get Tarantino's calling cards: vibrant dialogue and devilish violence. It may as well have been called ""The Bloody Eight"", as it's among his most demented films. However, the Christ imagery and thematic focus on America's racial history reminds us that there is more on this movie's mind than simple blood-and-guts. Full of surprises, The Hateful Eight is a darkly delightful mystery that makes us ponder the things we're willing to die for."

","8 dangerous people have to spend nights in the same stagecoach stopover during a blizzard. But can they trust the ones they don't know? Heck, won't violence erupt over the political differences? Bounty hunters Maquis(Jackson, quick) and Ruth(Russell, not trusting) try to keep safe the people they've collected... in particular, the only one alive, the prisoner belonging to the latter, Daisy(Leigh, taunting, set free by her imminent demise – she can do what she wants, all he can do is smack her, and no one but him would dare to, anyway). Is Mannix(Goggins, worth the price of admission by himself... steals the show) actually going to be sheriff? Is the Confederate General(Dern, hilarious as an odd and very old man) volatile? Is Mobray(Roth, delightfully British) really the hang-man? Is Gage(Madsen, secretive) hiding something? And is... Bob(Bichir, short on words, long on laughs)...really the temp?<br/><br/>The cast is incredible, and all show up inspired. I did not expect Tatum to impress me... before I saw he'd be in one of Quentin's. You never know who to keep your eye on, when, about what or from whom the next series of lines will come forth, when someone's double-crossing, etc.<br/><br/>This is a Western murder mystery, using isolation, claustrophobia and paranoia to great effect. The first half is pure build-up, and, admittedly, the reveal doesn't deliver. After the climax, you do feel like more could have been done with what there was. This is not Pulp Fiction. It also isn't as good as the last two Tarantino did. But it certainly is fun, and full of his trademarks... except for chronological jumps, he's more or less retired that since Kill Bill. Witty dialog and speeches, vivid themes, Mexican standoffs, sudden gory violence, it's all here. This compellingly explores the considerable post-Civil War US tensions.<br/><br/>There is a ton of strong language and implied slurs in this. I recommend this to any fan of the genres mixed here. 8/10"
"diac228","5","4","17","6 January 2016"," Well-Directed but Poorly Written, Hateful Eight is a Tarantino pound cake--thick but not fully satisfying
","Kendrick Lamar was the best live performance I've ever seen. April 2014, he rocked UCF. However, we had to endure two hours of mediocre rappers before getting to the main event. By the time we got to the very good part of the night, we were emotionally, physically drained. Lamar did his best, but Orlando struggled to maintain the energy. This is Hateful Eight in a nutshell.<br/><br/>It is extremely hard to get mad at Tarantino and the Hateful Eight project as they went through extreme lengths to ensure that it felt, sounded, and looked like a Western straight out of the 1960s. From getting Ennio Morricone to compose the soundtrack to using the same cameras used to film Charlton Heston, Tarantino and friends reached far back into cinematic history and moved it to present day. This alone propels the movie to become a unique experience, as there is actually an overture and then an intermission about halfway into the film.<br/><br/>But leading up to that intermission is where the film really struggles. Throughout his career, the better Tarantino's script is, the better the movie will become—regardless of all the other intangibles. Death Proof's climax rivals as one of the best in the past decade, but the ho-hum dialogue and unlikable first round of characters prevented us from truly enjoying it. In the meantime, Reservoir Dogs is one of the rare movies in which literally every word said is important, making it one of the best indie films you'll ever see.<br/><br/>There is a lot of what I like to call abe dialogue (already been established) in Hateful Eight—leading to a lot of repetitive dialogue, repetitive conversations, and verbal revelations that we had already encountered. As a matter of fact, you could have cut the first third of the movie because the facts and characterizations created were re-created once the movie's setting becomes more claustrophobic and remains in the cabin. Part of Tarantino's magic was his ability to create awesome characters without revealing too much about them. Sadly we don't get much of this in Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>The Tarantinoisms (good music, sharp imagery, inventive directing) start taking off once intermission ends and the intriguing mystery begins, as the tension suddenly revs up. In the second half is when things become interesting and the actors (and lone main actress) can start chewing at the scenery. The words suddenly become important, the details become more prevalent, and the audience has become much more engaged. In spite of this, the length of the film and the over-indulgence of throwaway dialogue weighs down on you and never allows for Hateful Eight to really reach the quality lengths of Tarantino's other hybrid westerns like Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight is like a large fluffy pound cake, a lot of density but lacking in flavor and substance. Tarantino directed this with his usual precision and quirkiness, however it lacks an outstanding moment, it lacks an outstanding character, and with the climax being delayed in favor of displaying past events it's hard to find the pulse of this irregular heartbeat.<br/><br/>In order for lengthy movies to maintain interest you have to cover a lot of ground in terms of whether years or space. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly covers an insane amount of Western territory, leading to every minute being required. Shawshank Redemption covers over two decades of prison life, so it too needed every minute. Hateful Eight is a cinematic bottle episode that could have been much shorter, much tighter, and with that each detail and word being much more vital.<br/><br/>Somewhere in that cabin lies a good story, and overall a good movie. You just have to get past the thicket of words to find it."

","This one pays homage to a number of movie genres: the Western; the mystery/detective story; the twisted plot; and (as we have come to expect), Tarantino's signature extremely long dialogue. A bevy of interesting/twisted characters - some very grotesque past events; plenty of gun play; and lots of blood - that is what is in store for you with ""The Hateful 8.""<br/><br/>I suffered thru the longest dialogue in any movie, which, while providing extensive back story, was only tangentially connected to the main action of the story. It could have been shortened by at least 30 minutes without damaging the movie. Bathroom breaks were a welcome relief from the tedium.<br/><br/>But once the action started with the first murder, it did not let up. This is where the mystery and detective angle came in. While Samuel L. Jackson is unraveling the mystery of a specific event which caused Kurt Russell's death, the larger story is unveiled as characters are dispatched one-by-one. The movie's denouement is well done and satisfying.<br/><br/>But, the acting was uneven - with the best roles being played by Samuel L. Jackson; Walter Goggins; and Tim Roth. Roth's character seemed perfect for Christoph Waltz, who I guess was not available. Nevertheless, Roth was convincing as the (presumably) town's hangman. The other actors pretty much were sleep walking thru the movie - especially Michael Madsen. Madsen, in my opinion reached his one and only peak with ""Reservoir Dogs"" - he should just stop making movies. I was also not impressed with Kurt Russell - the bounty hunter who displayed incredible violence towards his captive - Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). We really did not need to see the gratuitous violence against women. <br/><br/>And finally we come to the production company - the Weinstein Company. I'm glad Harvey finally came thru with his promise of an anti-gun movie ""which will sink the NRA"". After seeing this film, I was so appalled by guns, that I tore up my CCL, gave my 9mm Shield to the first gang banger I saw; and made a large ($.50) contribution to Hillary's campaign. Sorry Mr. President, I ""came to the light"" too late to help you in your crusade to make us safe.<br/><br/>The only remaining question for me about this movie is: where was Meryl Streep? (could she have been Bob?)<br/><br/>Well if Tarantino is your cup of tea. this one is pretty typical of his movies.

I could see where these people might be coming from but it personally, didn't bother me one bit. I loved this film. Stellar cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson being the standout in my opinion. The setting and look of the film looked exquisite, balancing the grainy look of a classic western mixed with a modernised cult type of look. The plot for the most part is something seen in other films but what made it work on a new level was the cast. It's simple, a bunch of strangers who are stuck in a house together for a few days start to figure out everyone's true colours and involvements with each other. This film balances out a slight sense of saltire mixed with intense drama and violence. It's Tarantino, what do you expect. There's one problem I had with this film, I found it dumb and it comes near the end. It's to do with a specific person named Channing Tatum. The twist was poorly executed and just didn't land for me and I felt the choice of casting Tatum was a mistake. But apart from that, I loved this film and definitely recommend it!"

","I can start off by saying that the plot makes absolutely no sense if you think about it for more than a millisecond.

Are these characters and their inflated utterances from reality or are they clones of Tarantino in various moods? You decide: I resign.
I give three stars for performances. Some might weigh performances higher than I; but I prefer solid, disciplined, *actual* writing and plot. I don't care for fluff disguised as something higher."
"droog-56936","8","1","2","16 November 2019"," Tarantino Hits High Marks With Second Western
","Tarantino always delivers new ways to put forth tried and true cinematic themes. The Hateful Eight is his 2nd foray into the western genre and although this doesn't reach the high powered triumph of Django Unleashed it's still a cut above most. A kind of play on The Thing by John Carpenter Hateful Eight follows the theme of the enemy among us. Spectacular cast of which Samuel L. Jackson takes center stage in a complete reversal of his character in Django the movie almost entirely takes place in a cabin. From here is where the story of opposing political and moral themes come full throttle into a death grip with each other. High end filmmaking is such a pleasure to experience."

Humour is unevenly sprinkled in my opinion.... the captive woman being assaulted for the least infraction was funny...if brutal- or the 'haberdashery"" door having to be nailed shut against the wind every time it was opened. The rest is unrelenting slaughter...as someone remarked, talk talk talk murder talk talk talk murder! One would have to wonder about a mind that can think up this sort of brutality.

","I saw Quentin Tarantino's 8th film on opening night in 70 mm, intermission and all. It was pretty big and fantastic, if not a little bit exhausting. Thankfully, the intermission allowed for a bathroom break.<br/><br/>I just watched it again, now 4 years later, as the extended edition on Netflix, broken into four episodes, and in UHD 4K.<br/><br/>The snowy vistas in high def digital are as epic and beautiful as you'll see in any film. The majority of the story happens indoors, though, in Mimi's Haberdashery, which provides a more intimate feel, as if you are alone with these characters with the blizzard outside, and the noisy footsteps on the wooden floors inside (You need two boards!)<br/><br/>The featured racism of Tarantino's films, and liberal use of the ""N"" word, doesn't age well with time. It jars. It seems less funny, and even a little sad. But it is what it is, and will stand the test of time in its quality, and what it tried to say as an adjunct to entertainment. What cannot be denied are the performances that Tarantino brings out of his eclectic mix of characters. Walter Goggins still is a standout performance, and thankfully, a redemptive one.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, knowing that QT will once again bring together time, music, set pieces, gore, dark humor, pulpy dialogue, and more - and would also like to see how his take on the more regrettable aspects of our culture has (or hasn't) evolved over the last few years."

","Tarantino's best since, ""Inglorious Basterds"" and one of the best westerns in recent memory. Excellent direction, screenplay, setting, cinematography, costume, score and acting. All of the cast deliver top notch performances. Russell, Leigh, Jackson, Roth and Goggins in particular stand out creating some very memorable characters. The plot is set in post - Civil War Wyoming when a well known bounty hunter known as, ""The Hangman"" and his current prisoner Daisy are joined by another bounty hunter and a man claiming to be the new sheriff of the town their heading to. The four are forced to stop at the well known Minnie's Haberdashery due to an impending blizzard. There they encounter four strangers already inside the stop. Things don't seem right to some of the eight including the fact that Minnie isn't there. That's where the mystery and interragation of the eight strangers begins. The plot is clever, funny, gritty, dark, brutal, violent, unique, duplicit and has a phenomenal ending. The dialogue is unparalleled and you'll hear fans of the film quote such lines as the Hangman's, ""Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep"". That line could be relative to Tarantino and his contemporaries. The film is captivating throughout which is difficult to do when most of the plot takes place in one setting. That's the brilliance of and speaks volumes of a true artist like Tarantino. This is the best of his westerns and is one of the very best in the genre."

With the snow, wind, and gaps in the haberdashery siding, you could just imagine how cold people would have been in such a setting.
It's a great flick, and certainly worth a second look."
"degisa","9","1","2","6 April 2019"," A good film with a slow second half
","I think most people were expecting a action packed romp like kill bill or pulp fiction form Tarantino but I think that's both his and their faults as he's been directing mostly action flicks and as such has built an audience around them. The reason I respect Tarantino as much as I do is that even though he knew what his audience was expecting and demanding from him, he made the film he wanted which is something other directors could learn from him. Russel and Jackson are great and are followed by an equally great cast, I don't think I didn't enjoy anyone's performance. There is the racial undertones and sub-plot that I, as more right leaning white person, enjoyed and I do think that racism is something that we should take seriously and we shouldn't try to cut it out of our history as if we pretend that we never made any mistakes than we have nothing to look back and learn from. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries and dramas but maybe not action flicks or westerns."

"tswiftma","7","1","2","31 January 2019"," Good but needs editing big time
","Let me first say that I'm a huge Tarantino fan. I pretty much love the plots, intensity, actors and extreme violence in all of his movies. The Hateful Eight had some good plot twists but overall it was a bit disappointing. First of all it's way, way, too long, 3 hrs, 7 minutes. If they cut out an hour of the movie (maybe 90 minutes even), and turned into a fast thriller I would have bumped the rating up to an 8. There are definitely some scenes and conversations that could have been cut and it wouldn't have been a big deal. The second problem is that 95% of the movie takes place in the cabin. There is some brief but spectacular cinematography of Wyoming (nee Colorado). I definitely wanted to see more, I was going stir crazy in that cabin. How about throwing in a few flashback scenes of the Domergue gang in action or making it into a town somewhere? Overall if you're a Tarantino fan it's worth watching the movie just for the great actors, violence and plot twists, but the first 90 minutes are pretty slow."

Now, just because it's my favorite movie doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws. Yes, it's kinda long, that's to be expected with Tarantino. And the flashback to how the habedashery was set up can get a little annoying rewatching the movie. But thats about it.

","... Is that Tarantino over-rated the main protagonists' charm.

She blew me away, and is now one of my favorite actress. Excellent casting choice for Tarantino. The other actors are all doing fine.<br/><br/>This is, without any doubt, an excellent movie that will become a classic. Yes, there's too much ""Tarantian racism"", but even then, it isn't out of place with the context. This is a movie that slowly goes down like a glass of brandy near the fireplace."
"rahulranganath","6","1","2","25 July 2018"," Wildly entertaining thanks to the screenplay, but not the finest of Tarantino's work.
","The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's eighth film (considering Kill Bill Vo. 1 and Vol. 2 as a single film). As expected, this is a highly dialogue driven movie, especially the first half of the movie. You can feel the tension in the air, given the backdrop. It takes place sometime after the American Civil War, hence the insecurities. I've got to applaud the director for the first half of the movie. It's directed superbly and acted out superbly. It's probably one of those films in which nothing nerve wrecking happens, yet it keeps you on the edge of your seat (I'm simply speaking of the first half). As the second half unfolds, you see this movie turning into a classic crime drama, with thousands of questions in your mind. And mind you, classic in the more traditional sense. But that is not necessarily a good thing. As a short story, that would have been great. It seems to lose its focus, especially in the last two chapters. I wasn't a big fan of the 'explanation' to what the hell was happening. It just stuck onto the norms of similar films. Disregarding the actual plot, this is a wildly entertaining movie. The ensemble cast is great, the cinematography is top notch and the conversations between the characters are intense. Disliking each and every character is a special thing about The Hateful Eight. Some would find the movie wildly entertaining (myself included) but not the best. Others would see this as an instant classic and one of Tarantino's best. Just a matter of personal opinion. But we can all agree upon the classic screenplay in the first half and the gorgeous cinematography."

","The Hateful Eight - is the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino. After the stunning success of the Tarantino's Django Unchained, Quentin presented us the new story, where events unfold after the American Civil War.<br/><br/>The movie starts from beautiful views of Wyoming plains. The bounty hunter John Ruth is escorting the female criminal person Daisy Domergue to Red Rock. The carriage is driven by O.B., experienced coachman. In the trip, John picks up another bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Afro-American) and Chris Mannix, who called himself new sheriff of Red Rock. The weather is very bad. For covering from the blizzard, they arrive to the Minnie's Haberdashery. But they discover that Minnie is missing there. Instead of her they meet several other people: a Mexican Bob - the temporary owner, Oswaldo Mobray - a hangman, Joe Gage - a cowboy and Sanford Smithers - the retired Confederate general. All 9 people have to stay under the same roof. However the fact is that almost all of them have very bad actions in the past. Some of them were enemies in the Civil War, and they try to provoke each other. Bad the main problem is that someone has introduced himself as another person. Who wants to free Daisy and kill all of the rest? <br/><br/>Compared with Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight doesn't have a lot of action. However, the viewer can enjoy the slow narration, interesting dialogues, and gradually increasing tension between all characters - all things that we love in Tarantino movies. The actor play is perfect: Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh - everyone is in the right place. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend The Hateful Eight to all Western lovers."
"Floated2","6","1","2","17 June 2018"," Interesting though overly long
","The Hateful Eight is set in Wyoming in the years after the Civil War, as bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) into a remote haberdashery to wait out an impending blizzard. Along the way, he picks up Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a former Union Army officer who has also gone into the bounty hunting trade. The company they find at the store turns out to be a bunch of killers, all hiding their own agendas.<br/><br/>This film is quite interesting within its engaging dialogue and scenery but does drag on at certain points. With a running time of 2 hours 48 minutes, it does get quite overlong and boring at certain points and was slightly difficult in watching and staying away for the entire film. There are good characters which does make the film work, as Samuel L. Jackson is in typical form as he helps carries the film, along with Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walter Goggins who steals his scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hateful Eight isn't an easy film to digest as it is violent, offers a lot of imagery and contains a little amount of action, with much talking. Such as all Quentin Tarantino films, this isn't for everyone."
"Darth_Osmosis","10","1","2","1 June 2018"," A superb western with a twist!
","Tarantino's second western is slower paced than his first(Django Unchained), but it makes up for it by bringing a collection of great characters together in an isolated space and being a ""whodunnit"". Seeing the different characters interact and the tension rise is a treat indeed! The dialogue is king in a movie like this, and Tarantino is the master of that."
"znr-08","8","1","2","3 March 2018"," There Won't Be Many Coming Home
","It is surprising just how many negative reviews the movie gets. Some of them I can understand but qualifying it as ""garbage"" is shear nonsense. It is true that the movie demands a considerable effort for comprehension and seeing the length, those who miss the main thematic point are doomed to be disappointed. <br/><br/>Well, the final song sums it up pretty well in fact. When you make war, you are probably to get yourself killed. So did all the characters. Had they stood a chance in the first place ? Yes I guess, at least one of them : the old veteran. He did what he could but the provocation got just beyond what he could stand. In fact, on a second thought he may as well ignore it, the experienced though guy he is. Nevertheless, as Oswaldo says : Gentlemen, I know Americans aren't apt to let a little thing like unconditional surrender get in the way of a good war...<br/><br/>Now that we dealt with the very nature of war, let's look at another issue brought up by the movie : The nature of justice. At this point, I find it useful to resort once again to Oswaldo's lines : <br/><br/>"" Oswaldo Mobray: John Ruth wants to take you back to Red Rock to stand trial for murder. And, if... you're found guilty, the people of Red Rock will hang you in the town square. And as the hangman, I will perform the execution. And if all those things end up taking place, that's what civilized society calls ""justice"". However, if the relatives and the loved ones of the person you murdered were outside that door right now. And after busting down that door, they drug you out in the snow and hung you up by the neck, that, we would be frontier justice. Now the good part about frontier justice, is it's very thirst quenching. The bad part is it's apt to wrong as right!<br/><br/>John 'The Hangman' Ruth: Not in your case. In your case, you'd probably have it comin'. But other people, maybe not so much!<br/><br/>Oswaldo Mobray: But ultimately what's the real difference between the two? The real difference is me, the hangman. To me, it doesn't matter what you did. When I hang you, I will get no satisfaction from your death, it's my job! I hang you in Red Rock, I move on to the next town, I hang someone else there. The man who pulls the lever that breaks your neck will be a dispassionate man. And that dispassion is the very essence of justice. For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice.<br/><br/>John 'The Hangman' Ruth: Amen! ""<br/><br/>Hence, for justice to be made in an honest way, it should be delivered by a law man. For law man, we had Chris the new sheriff. As the story approached its culminating point, he and Marquis Warren got ""in kahoots"". Which was surprising. Who in that little haberdashery got more reasons to hate each other ? But I guess it was the shared dignity of being ""soldiers"" not just random busters that got them together. Well, as far-fetched an idea as it may seem to some, I believe one could see there an apology to the old good days when ennemies knew how to exchange cigarettes and get friendly-like; as opposed oblivously the today's world that conventions of old times have deserted long ago. Chris and Marquis sealed the veracity of their status as lawful men by hanging Domergue, just as a law man par excellence would do. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, from a dramatic point of view, it was a clever plot and eventhough I generally dislike long movies, this one I regard as an artistic preference. Now, from a cinematographic point of view, I very much liked the gloomy yet snow-white atmosphere. Tarantino does his job and he does it duly. <br/><br/>This movie is not garbage. It opens with the isolated and snow-covered cross. So be ready to make some effort to get something out of it."

","I will be quick and to the point.This wasn't the best of QT, but honestly, the time flew by for me.I had no idea what the run time was going in and was shocked that 3 hours had passed. This film IS dialogue heavy.But the time is well spent hashing out the characters, and building the tension to a boiling point.The last chapter or two is the powder keg finally exploding. I see reviewers complaining that there aren't any characters to root for and that they are all loathsome and despicable. To this I simply want to direct them to....the TITLE OF THE FUCKING FILM!!! And people point out that cringe worthy scene in the snow w/Sam Jackson and the General's son as pointless., Again missing the point.Up to that point,the character of Marquise Warren WAS the one to rally behind as the sympathetic former Union soldier fighting racism.But after that HATEFUL act in the snow,he loses that sympathy and becomes as,once again,HATEFUL and worthy of condemnation as the rest. The cinematography and musical score rightfully get their due, but the direction and mainly the acting truly shine.It is awesome to see what good actors can do in an ensemble like this.Jennifer Jason Leigh got the Oscar nomination,but IMO ,was no better than the rest.Even the usually one trick (IMO) Kurt Russell tears up the scene.But like most things he is in,Goggins steals the show
This is a fun flick, if you take it for what it is, and don't go in expecting a traditional shoot em' up, all for one Western.These characters truly are HATEFUL!"

Even the glorious 75mm shots seemed a little superfluous. It was a 2 hour and 45 minute exercise in dialogue and double cross. And listen: I like dialogue. I especially like Tarantino dialogue.

His movies are getting stuck in a pattern of juvenile fascination with violence sans any cleverness, which his earlier movies had in abundance. I regret spending the 3 hours plus watching this, hoping something might save it at the very end. In fact, I actually didn't spend 3 hours---the last 13 minutes I fast forwarded.

"Misirac","9","1","2","8 December 2017"," Not classic western
","Why western again? Does Tarantino have something new to offer us? Oh yeahÂ… Eight mean, mysterious, interesting characters stuck in the same room over similar circumstances. What could we except other then big dose of violence and impudence. Someone who hasn't watched previous Tarantino's movies this might look like some boring drama where couple of random guys meet in tavern and have clueless talks, but this is far more then that.<br/><br/>Tarantino plays a poker game here. During the three hours of movie you kinda get impression that this is all a strategy where every thing you do is a crucial move. Minnie's Haberdashery becomes America itself, where is in one moment literally divided on North and South. This is a clear situation after the war spiced with dose of continuous tension. American history is brutally criticized and there is no concept of ""good"" and ""bad"". From the moment when the first company arrives in tavern, we are nailed to the screen carefully following every figure in the game, asking ourselves what hidden messages Tarantino sends us. Acting is phenomenal. They did a great job. The most distinguished is certainly Jennifer Jason Leigh (Daisy Domergue), the most pleasant surprise. Proof of that is nomination for best supporting role. Daisy managed to be very interesting and mysterious, while dominating on every frame and filled it with craziness. The rest of the crew also did a very good job. Even Michael Madsen.<br/><br/>Dialogue, the author's best weapon, is of course the main thing in this movie also. Many Tarantino's legendary phrases are still not clarified. What connotative meaning they have and what message they send us is questionable. Tarantino does that on purpose and he absolutely enjoys it. That list just got bigger when John Ruth said ""You only need to hang mean bastards, but mean bastards you need to hang"". All that talks and phrases might not be that provocative and good, if it was not for maestro Ennio Morricone, whose music is maybe the biggest win of this film. Great appreciation to this man. He finally received the Oscar, and that is one more big failure for Academy awards. They waited so many years to give this man some respect. This is another Tarantino's masterpiece. Some may say that we have here already tested recipe. The setting reminds us on Reservoir Dogs, which is in Tarantino's style all the way. He just loves taking this from other movies, even his own.<br/><br/>I think most of the people should enjoy this bloody history lessons guided with Morricone's music."
"skullsmasher-16391","10","1","2","2 December 2017"," Tarantino's Best Yet!
","For Tarantino fans and movie fans alike, The Hateful Eight is a must-see masterpiece which everyone should watch in its entirety at least once. The Hateful Eight is an intriguing, beautiful, and violent take on the classic ""And Then There Were None"" formula. The film takes place in only two settings (The stagecoach to Red Rock & Minnie's Haberdashery), and makes outstanding use of both. The Wyoming landscape is bleak, open, and beautiful, but is established to be certain death for anyone who steps outside for long. Minnie's on the other hand feels warm and homey, but also has an ominous feel with its dark corners and constant tension. These two polar opposite landscapes make the film feel like a true dealers choice of death and discomfort for its characters. The film starts off with a few calm and funny ""getting to know everyone"" chapters, which although seem boring from an outsider looking in, are incredibly entertaining and fun thanks to the talent of the cast and Tarantino's outstanding cinematography and dialogue. Without spoiling anything, the story then shifts into the previously mentioned ""And Then There Were None"" feel with the entire cast trapped inside Minnie's for at least three days waiting for the storm to blow over. Tensions rise and Samuel L. Jackson delivers a truly Oscar worthy performance as Major Marquis Warren. This is Tarantino at his best and in my opinion the greatest film ever made. The film's charming dialogue, incredible cinematography, perfect casting, and genius story, take it to the top of my list and will hopefully entertain many more for hours to come."

","Has QT made so much money that he has lost his passion? This is self indulgent self referential tripe. There are so many references to his heroes of Hollywood and his own movies that it becomes cringe worthy. The trivia in IMDb misses a lot. And there are a LOT in this movie. There are so many anachronisms and poor attentions to detail that I began to think this was a clever parody.But I don't think it's clever. It's littered with actors from past QT movies, which usually isn't a bad thing, but Tim Roth deserves a Ham Award. Can someone tell me why its snows INSIDE the hut? Why can one see in the distance in a blizzard? Why are there pistes on the mountains? Why use the N word all the time but no one is surprised to see a black person or a Mexican? I get that QT likes The Thing (it's sublime...) but why try to imitate a movie full of suspense and claustrophobia when that it is not your genre? QT leave that to the masters of the 80s. And Joe Gage. Really? (Didn't mention that in your Trivia did you IMDb?) This movie is like a Starbuck's double shot, soya, grande, pumpkin, cinnamon, caramel, machiatto, latte espressacino with extra cream. It's just too much.

"drqshadow-reviews","5","1","2","10 October 2017"," Red Blood and Grey Gunsmoke Against a Snowy White Curtain
","In the mid-19th century, a blinding snowstorm blows several crooked paths to one central location: a haberdashery in the middle of nowhere. Here, a motley gathering of bounty hunters, fugitives, lawmen and soldiers takes place, but nothing is quite as it seems. Eight may walk in, but far fewer will see the sunlight when this storm clears. Structurally, The Hateful Eight is quite similar to Tarantino's first effort, Reservoir Dogs. A wide variety of brash, violent, colorful characters, bouncing off the walls (not to mention each other) in an enclosed space while an unseen threat keeps them right where they are. Secrets abound, betrayals too, with the audience kept as much in the dark as the participants. Both are reminiscent of a one-set stage show, really, with the added benefit of cinematography. The biggest stumbling block here is setup, specifically how much of it there is before the plot feels ready to proceed. I'm a proponent of establishing things, of not rushing in with guns blazing, but this may be an extreme example. The first act alone runs for longer than many feature films, and while there's some good character stuff in that space, it surely could've achieved the same purpose in half the time or less. The auteur's infamously witty, cutting dialog is absent for this portion of the film, too, which may have contributed to that lethargy. Those who tough it out are rewarded when the pace finally quickens, leading to a typically Tarantino climax - grisly, shocking and wild - but that's awfully familiar territory. For now, this director can still deliver the goods with his back up against the wall, but the time feels nigh for an evolution. He can't answer every riddle with two barrels of lead and a wet, crimson explosion... can he?"

","As someone who's never truly liked a Tarantino movie after 'Pulp FIction,' I was amazed to have actually enjoyed this. While it starts out really slow, and I found myself thinking for the first hour that it was some failed sequel to 'Django Unchained' (which I was not a big fan of), the movie really picks up in the second half as it slowly begins to reveal to us where all these characters came from and why they all ended up in the mess that they're in.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh, who I always thought was a very talented actress, steals the show here. Her character, Daisy Domergue, is truly the most hateful of the eight. Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson true to form, and the other actors don't slouch either. The dialogue is well- written, and while the pacing sucks in the first half where Tarantino takes too long to set up the story, he's entirely forgiven when he produces a very watchable second half.<br/><br/>If there's any serious criticism I can have is that by the time we reach the last twenty minutes, it does feel entirely like the ending of 'Reservoir Dogs'; but considering that this is a Tarantino movie, that's to be expected. I'm just glad he supplied the viewers with enough interesting characters, dialogue, and situations to make this, for me, one of his most watchable movies in over twenty years."
"icasilas","8","1","2","2 September 2017"," Quinton Tarantino strikes, once again!
","It hasn't been a long time since Tarantino's first try on the western genre: ""Django unchained "", which was by all means the most financially successful picture this director has ever created and it's once more a huge stamp in his neat directorial career, nobody can deny that Quinton Tarantino is one of Hollywood's most creative and immaculate directors, and ""the hateful eight"" does nothing but to approve. It is by far one of the best written, directed and screen played spaghetti westerns of all time and it's another flash of the old Tarantino 's story over action. As obscure and flagrantly dazzling as every one of his movies are , Tarantino confines this masterpiece in a ""reservoir dogs"" like setting , only that it is set in a post- civil war united states .In a time of hatred , racism and blood lust, black bounty hunter and ex- major Marquis Warren, played by the amazing actor Samuel. l. Jackson, finds himself trapped by a blizzard in a shack with a curious group of people among which stands Kurt Russel as John Ruth ""the hangman"", a brute for whom Mr. Russel was naturally fit, tasked to escort a convicted female to a nearby town to be executed, only to be interrupted by a unprecedented blizzard that leaves him to accompany the major and another unexpected guest to their safe haven. In this tensioned atmosphere stands out a man of a familiar personality someone whose character is charmingly witty ,extremely skillful yet apparently dangerous, seemingly unusual to such an excruciatingly calm set. As a matter of fact, anyone who'd watched ""the inglorious bastards"" would think he's kind of a western version of Christopher waltz's unforgettable ""Hans Landa"" ,many people would even say that the persona itself, actually played by the brilliant Tim Roth, is nothing but a lazy copy of the German icon, which is kind of true seeing that Oswaldo Mobrey is nothing more than a polished adapted version of a Nazy officer, is it really that bad to renovate such a memorable personage in a new fresh landscape and with a new actor whose talent is nothing less than his predecessor. In my opinion, it's certainly a hard task that only reveals the brilliancy of the writer that is Mr. Tarantino. As expected from this surprisingly infamous director, this picture has it sufficing share of twist reveals and top-notch action. I can promise you the same way I do for every Tarantino movie (maybe apart from death proof) that this picture is a must see, it's a visionary gem that despite the decor monotony will always keep you on the edge of your seat. It ' s a great picture with a lot of depth and artistic value for it is in itself a mystery that gradually unravels itself in Tarantino-esque manner."
"ritera1","7","1","2","31 July 2017"," Strong but self indulgent
","Tarantino has always seemed like a good B-movie director. He learned from them and emulates them. There are better ones, though, who color within the lines. Granted, he has some flair in his dialogue (and scenarios) as a writer, but in the world of linear storytelling, it gets to be cumbersome and self-indulgent. But my view has always been in the vast minority.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, he was elevated to deity and I don't understand it. And it has created an egomaniac. That is shown from the credits that announce that this is ""The 8th Film by Quentin Tarantino"". O-kay? <br/><br/>I fully enjoyed Django Unchained as it seemed more focused on the justified murderous aspirations of its lead. The self-serving acting pauses were in line with the story-line. Same with Jackie Brown, which came from material not written directly by Tarantino.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight was not serving the audience, though. The first hour was just two very bloated scenes of men who wanted to get on the stagecoach. And that dumb Lincoln letter. Very forgettable. <br/><br/>The next hour was supposedly a thriller on finding out who is the bad guy. Very hyper-extended but done well. <br/><br/>The third hour was how the bad guys were going to take over the cabin. We know what was going to happen. It was just a matter of when. Just more colorful characters saying nothing.<br/><br/>And the characters were not remarkable, except for Jennifer Jason Leigh. There was not enough in the writing to credit Tarantino for that, either. It was her. But the rest? Just recycled hard-nosed cowboys we've seen before, although done a bit better than the rest. Beating up on Leigh had no real coherence, just illogical Tarantino blood-letting.<br/><br/>It could have all been done in 100 minutes. He apparently drew from John Carpenter's The Thing, a vastly superior film. Tarantino should have paid more attention to that.<br/><br/>And I didn't see the great publicity about it being shot in Ultra Panavision 70. Who cares? There was not enough to warrant any of that. It was essentially in one room. The exterior stuff was okay, but nothing spectacular."

It is told in a slow pace so that there is time to think and make your theories about the next step. Nothing is revealed before it is meant to.

Action being based on a indoor talking and thoughts can be interpreted as boring, of course, the real action comes when the coffee gets poisoned while Major Marquis Warren is trying to make General Sandy Smithers pick the pistol that he carefully left beside him. Of course this scene didn't finished well. We can say that this scene is one of the few with more impact in the movie. The movie has a good vibe by the time the action takes place.

No one quite does it like him."
"ycho-29371","9","1","2","3 June 2017"," Ignore the Hate! This Film is one of Tarantino's Best...
","The Hateful Eight is the eighth entry of film through the ultimate writer and director, Quentin Tarantino. He has stated that he will only be making 2 more films, which in a total becomes 10 films throughout his wondrous career. It is so sad and relieving to believe only 2 more films will be inclined from the fantastic writer and director Quentin Tarantino. Because this film is a welcome addition to fans of himself and to the beloved audiences that makes it one of the finest western films of the decade. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight starts with John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) comfortably travelling inside a wagon led by horses heading their way to the path of Red Rock, a small village which John Ruth is a bounty hunter and he's requirement is to capture Daisy Domergue and hang her in the town to get paid. On their path stands Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson) who is another bounty hunter but is black. His request for the long ride with them is because of an awful, deleterious snow blizzard. On their way meets another character, Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff of the town 'Red Rock'. Arriving their way, from the heavy blizzard that stands to disturb their way they decide to seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. Already, there are in total of 4 people waiting inside the Haberdashery as they claim that Minnie has been gone for a week to visit her mother for Christmas. While committing to stay for a few nights, a disastrous murder happens between the night by a coffee and between the hateful eight's, they seek to discover the incident and who the criminal is amongst them. <br/><br/>This might be similar to an older film and a popularized board game both named 'Clue'. Aside from the minor detailed plots, it doubtlessly borrows similar elements of its original concept. One might say, it is a direct plagiarism, but for the defense, I'd like to put as inspirational. The impression might be familiar but it is the story and the characters that make it very different from the inspired source material and other mainstream thriller films. A clear example may be, the collision between Major Marquis and the residence who were already resting in the haberdashery, the hilarious chemistry between John Ruth and Daisy. Another might be, a sequence in which Major Marquis explains the death of General Sandy Smithers' (Bruce Dern) son which remained a mysterious clue but now revealed from the dirty, deceitful mouth of Major Marquis. This 10-minute sequence is an aspect that decorated the film over up, and still remains to be memorable and highly impressive that made my first knuckle tight, and the sense of dread that made it authentically disturbing to view. <br/><br/>The cast of The Hateful Eight is undeniably fabulous. These actors and actresses deduce like they are fully committed to their roles in the film. To begin, interesting characters have been shown off to the screen as the film slowly reveals each of the characters which are utterly different in most other western or typical mainstream movies. As undoubtedly these characters are enjoyable, the acting of performance that is given by each make it more stimulating and enchanting. A prime example I would use would be, Samuel L Jackson as Major Marquis Warren. He is strikingly amusing and courageous as a dangerous and clever bounty hunter. He has a sense, in which is dread whenever he beings making movements and when he starts opening his mouth to speak. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that it is his best performance since the 1994's Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>Like all Tarantino films, all of his films are unduly bloody violent. He is a director who doesn't care about the age conscious and continues fully with the bloody violence that everyone could possibly imagine. Mainstream films, tend to hide violent acts of scenes and blood for disturbance but it may make the viewing bored and clichéd. However, Tarantino just shows the violent scene of violence that may be disturbing but totally fun and interesting. The film doesn't go for Tarantino violence for the first and second act. When the third act hits, it changes the plate and switches into an R-rated Clue version which was a total blast. <br/><br/>The film's running time is 167 mins which are close to 3 hours maximum. This is undeniably a huge number for a film to the tide, but from the immensely interesting characters, the absurdity bloody violence and the marvelous dialogue which Tarantino's professional writing shines the most makes the 3 hours run time fill like 30 minutes. A flaw that could be mentioned is, because of the long run time, sometimes the main story drags into nothing and appears at the main points usually at the third or final act of the film which most Tarantino films tend to have an issue.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone's score feels like the perfect music composing for a stage play that shifts the tones correctly according to the sense of dread of the scenes. The cinematography and the Ultra Panavision 70 mm camera is stunningly gorgeous, as it takes wide shots, that makes it a perfect vision for a stage play as well.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, Tarantino has made yet another sequestered masterpiece from himself. Like all Tarantino films, The Hateful Eight is funny, scary, alluring, dreadful and every time a new case or an unexpected condition occurs that makes the audience thought to provoke and entertained of what it accomplished. <br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I saw this movie on Xfinity for free. I was debating on whether I should watch it or not, because many people said it was not that good, and rather long. I decided to give it a shot, and if it did not capture my attention then I'd turn it off (as I did not pay any money). Within the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. This has that classic Tarantino feel, but is milder than most of his recent films. As I was watching this, I thought it felt like a mix between a western, a game of Clue, Reservoir Dogs, and The Thing. Afterwards, I found these were the inspirations for this movie, which wasn't surprising. Grant it, this idea is not completely original, but puts a great spin on the classic ""The Butler Did It"" story. I really don't understand the disapproval this movie received. I put it ahead of Django, and would maybe go as far as saying this is my favorite Tarantino film (behind maybe Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs). I think people have come to expect Tarantino movies as gore fests, like with Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, and Django. This certainly has some great violence, but it is more of a character development story, and a guessing game. I could see why people would say its boring. But if you enjoy great dialogue and tension, this is possibly Tarantino's best. The acting was phenomenal from everyone. There's a reason Tarantino uses the same actors in many of his movies, and that reason is evident here. Tarantino clearly has a feel for his actors, and they have a feel for him. it works flawlessly every single time. The movie is three hours long, and quite frankly it did not seem that long. I was upset when it ended. Overall, you need to give this movie a chance. Go into it, knowing it's not a constant gore fest, and I think you will appreciate it much more."

Mr Tarantino wrote and directed this unique and troubled production (which was almost cancelled due to the script getting leaked on the internet) that was eventually made into one of 2015's most standout offerings of the cinema.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is meant to make the audience uncomfortable about all the deceit plaguing the characters in the story. They're eight people stuck with each other, and none of them particularly like or trust each other. Yet at the cabin they're all stuck in, there's a terrible secret everyone of them are totally unaware of.<br/><br/>Take this film for what it is. I enjoyed it. I know some people like it, and that a few others also didn't like the film. That's okay.

","Quentin Tarantino has not ever been one of my favorite directors, nor storytellers. Admittedly though he has directed some very brave and edgy films that I do like. Among them are Django Unchained, Inglorious Basters and Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>The story of Reservoir Dogs is set in mainly one place, a storehouse. The scenery is simple, dialogue is well-flowing, characters are well-developed and it could as well be a stage-drama. To tell the least, the plot line of The Hateful Eight is developed pretty much in the same way as in Reservoir Dogs. Men with names of colors are changed into one man of color: Samuel L. Jackson, and one with ethnicity: Demlan Bachir.<br/><br/>Tarantino has his reputation on his side. Actors like viewers know at least a bit what to expect from a Tarantino-film. Everything is technically well done, and Morricone's score is as good as in any of those older western movies and The Untouchables (1987). Everything is just in the right place, everything is done in the manner of Tarantino.<br/><br/>What escapes from the most reviewers is the fact that the film is labeled the film as crime mystery. What does it mean? After lengthy intro during which the characters are built, over 1,5 hours of running-time, there is a sudden kill and poisoning. And this is a starting point of a psychological crime drama set in the cabin in the wilderness. When you should start focusing on what was said during the film, who are these people who now accommodate the cabin. Whom you or the main characters should trust, and whom not.<br/><br/>Structure of the film could have done in many other ways. But I believe Tarantino knew exactly how he would be doing the film: with a really long intro and a lot of talking during which most of the viewers get bored and miss hopefully what most of the talking was about. I would have preferred shorter introduction like most of the viewers, but I must say at the same time, once again Tarantino has done a great deal with characters and making a western movie that is not actually at all is and mainly is not a western movie.<br/><br/>I understand the disappointment of many who do not like this kind of storytelling.

","After reading negative reviews on here it seems that most users main issue with the film was the length of the movie, which i did not feel was a problem. The lead up was tense, the dialog was very Tarantino as usual (great) and the acting was fantastic. Sure, over an hour may be a little long for a set up of a movie, but that seems pretty common these days. I liked how it would go around the cabin to various conversations happening at once giving it a very theater play style to it. (Actually this movie would make a great play.) <br/><br/>This movie was great as a drama piece and i would would definitely recommend it. However, I would never, ever, call it one of the best Tarantino films. The fellatio scene i thought was unnecessary despite the fact i firmly believe that this was completely made up as a desperate attempt to make old mate reach for the gun, especially as it was made clear earlier that the major does lie to get things (the Lincoln letter). The scene ends beautifully however with the major getting what he wanted (the general reaching for the pistol and the major quick firing a round straight through his chest).<br/><br/>However it is the last 40 minutes that i feel could of been tighter and cleaner for a more satisfying ending, and i don't mean ""cleaner"" literally (the more blood the better). **SPOILER** <br/><br/>The film turns into a shoot fest resulting in everyone slowly dying and crawling all over the floor, even the use of slow motion to capture shoots fired i feel would of been better as a cowboy style quick shooter scene. This all results in a bloody death fest, hence the unsatisfying ending (maybe i just wanted the major to live) which leaves me to believe in the statement being thrown around about this movie; that it is just a ""directors masturbation"" film but still, the ending was still good and the hanging was nice touch. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and will watch it again soon. Its a great mystery/ drama played out in a unique way."

","I saw ""The Hateful Eight"", starring Samuel L. Jackson-Nick Fury in the Avengers movies, Snakes on a Plane; Kurt Russell-Furious 7, Vanilla Sky; Jennifer Jason Leigh-Road to Perdition, Fast Times at Ridgemont High; Walter Goggins-Justified_tv, The Bourne Identity; Demian Bichir-Machete Kills, The Heat; Tim Roth-Selma, The Incredible Hulk; Michael Madsen-Sin City, Die Another Day and Bruce Dern-D'Jango Unchained, The Cowboys.<br/><br/>This is Quentin Tarantino's eighth movie-notice the number 8 in the title? It is a western and he has Ennio Morricone doing the music-he did the music for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It is shot in 70mm, which hasn't been done since the 1960's. In fact, this is the same camera that was used during the filming of Ben Hur; not one like it but the actual camera. For the first week or two of the film's release, Quentin is doing what he calls a 'Roadshow' engagement, which means you have an overture before the movie-just music-and an intermission in the middle, so you can stretch your legs or go to the restroom. The whole movie has a nice, old fashioned feel to it. Kurt plays a bounty hunter right after the Civil War that is bringing Jennifer in for a reward-plus a hanging- on a stage coach that is trying to beat a snow blizzard headed their way. He crosses paths with Samuel and Walter and gives them a ride. Why not, they are heading the same way and there is a blizzard coming their way. They stop at a rest stop because of the blizzard catching up to them and find four strangers already occupying the building; Demian, Tim, Michael and Bruce. All of them have different occupations-a sheriff, a hangman, retired military general, a cowboy and another bounty hunter and Kurt has to decide who is telling the truth and who is lying through their crooked teeth. He believes that one or more of the strangers have ulterior motives and are either in cahoots with Jennifer and want to set her free or want the reward money for themselves. If you like Quentin's movies, you should enjoy this one because I think it's his best one he has made yet. It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 48 minutes-not counting the overture and intermission. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","For his eighth feature (as the film's introduction reminds us), film-maker and cinephile Quentin Tarantino capitalises on the critical and commercial success of Django Unchained (2012) and delivers another western set in the South, where racial tensions are high. Set post-Civil War, as opposed to in Django where the slave trade was very much in full swing, The Hateful Eight lumps eight characters of dubious moral fibre in the same shack while a raging blizzard whistles outside. Evoking memories of his breakthrough feature Reservoir Dogs (1992), Tarantino's latest ultimately suffers from stretching a wafer-thin plot over a three hour plus running- time.<br/><br/>Peppering the movie with chapter titles a la Inglorious Basterds (2009), the film begins with a magnificent long take as the credits flicker on screen to the sound of Italian legend Ennio Morrecone's beautiful score. Grizzled bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is transporting notorious criminal Daisy Domegue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock to collect his reward and see her hang. Fellow bounty hunter and war veteran Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) hitches a ride, and they also pick up former Lost-Causer Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), who is on his way to Red Rock to be sworn in as sheriff. The three men discuss their past and future, but find each other hard to trust.<br/><br/>As a wailing blizzard approaches, Ruth's stagecoach pulls up at Minnie's Haberdashery, a cosy rest-stop which has been apparently left in the temporary care of Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir). This instantly arouses Warren's suspicions, who has frequented the place before and knows the owners well. Also resting at the haberdashery is eccentric British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the shady loner Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and former Confederate general Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). Locked up together with no hope of moving on until the storm passes, the eight naturally talk and size each other up, with the events of the Civil War still firmly in everyone's mind. This being a Tarantino movie, it isn't long until guns are fired and blood is shed.<br/><br/>The dialogue crackles in the way that only Tarantino can deliver during the opening half, but an absence of humour and some twists and revelations that hardly come as a surprise throughout the second act tests the patience. Similar to Django, conversations go on longer than required, and unnecessary narrative devices - such as the sudden introductions of a narrator that comes and goes without reason - distract from a central story that needs to be more complex and unpredictable to justify the lengthy running time. Still, there's much to savour. Tarantino has always made inspired casting choices, and the ensemble - Russell, Leigh and Goggins in particular - are sublime. Filmed in 70mm Panavision to Morrecone's score, the film captures the glorious wide-wide screen beauty of the great westerns of the 50's and 60's. Sporadically thrilling but ultimately frustrating, The Hateful Eight ultimately fails to reward the audience for their time."
"tim-vanlaere","5","4","18","6 January 2016"," Disappointing
","You know you go to a Tarantino movie for cinematographic delight and something with a very specific edge.<br/><br/>To my disappointment, this movie failed to deliver. While the whole ""it's filmed Ultra Panavision 70""-buzz thrown around - it hasn't been necessary for the few scenes that stand out more.<br/><br/>The movie is slow and dreadful. And is divided in chapters, which makes it come off as a book that is half-assed put into film.<br/><br/>Nothing worthwhile happens until the before-last chapter where the entire movie is compressed into this 1/6th segment of the film. While 4/6th you see Samuel Jackson as this ""withdrawn and righteous man"", 2/6th you get to hear him babble on and on so much and in such a cocky know-it-all way, you long lost interest in this character and really want him to get shot in the balls. The character and Samuel Jackson.<br/><br/>The acting performances are very good. I'm not that much of a Samuel Jackson fan, so the camera orbiting him most of the movie just is... Boring.<br/><br/>The movie is watchable, the scenes are pretty and the set looks authentic. Some details in the movie are well done and cross referencing. Although, sometimes they're too obvious and ""restated"" it loses subtlety.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting, but everything gravitates around one character. While the story is stretched out with ""impression shots"" and dialogue to come to a short, high paced conclusion. As if it could go on and on and on and then everything rushed to a hasty finale. Where most characters jump out of character, really. And all dimension in the buildup is completely lost. Leaving you with the feeling it's really a political view rammed down your throat - instead of ""a story around the civil war"". The fact the movie seems to be a lecture that ""white to black racism is BAD and only stupid people do this"" but ""black to white racism is justified. And black to Mexican racism is a-OK!"" just wtf?<br/><br/>tl;dr: The concept, ""locked in a hut with strangers, what will happen"" has also been done. And arguably a bit more exciting."

","Quentin Tarantino is a man who knows how to put together a good yarn. He can bring originality to what from the surface seems to have been done a million times. Unlike that other unbelievable tale set in the frozen forests, this one has a collection of despicable human beings who might or not be who they claim to be. For three hours he treats us to biting exchanges, full of sarcasm, insight, clever lines, and some situations that because of their ugliness shouldn't be funny, but we can't help laughing at human flaws.<br/><br/>Helped by a brilliant cast, including Jackson, Roth, Jason-Leigh, Madsen, and more, he keeps us glued to the screen, not wanting to miss any of the ""chapters"", the clues, the red herrings, the constant barrage of insults, and of course, the twist at the end, and a visual feast that will surprise even those who are accustomed to his usual display of violence.<br/><br/>One prisoner is being taken to Red Rock where she will be tried and hung. Along the way people join that party, and they eventually find their way to an outpost where things are to become more complicated. Set right after the Civil War, we find people are still affected by the political and civil wounds of the country. Jackson is a man who has never held back, and what is truly enjoyable in this tale is that there are no weak links, no matter how small the part is. There is no doubt: everyone is dangerous and not to be trusted. Unlike ""Force"" we don't stop to think whether it was the casting that ruined the part, or if the part was written that way. There is no ambiguity here. There are bad people, and there are really rotten ones. There are those who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and there are still plenty of surprises in a story that shines for its unity and consistency. Even moments of unspeakable beauty while horses pull their carriages speak of coming danger. It's pretty, but it's not safe. With the help of expert cinematographer Robert Richardson, and a killer score by the always sublime Morricone, everything in this film just works marvelously.<br/><br/>No moment in its three hours is wasted. We fear the cold, the dark corner in the room, and we later find out that no spot is safe here. No metaphysics here, no unbelievable shots of super strength, just damaged goods from the beginning. People come up with the more twisted reasons for doing what they need or want. However, there is also the need to survive, to learn, and hopefully to move forward. We don't get long takes for us to know how miserable the surroundings are in and outside any dwellings. We see fully developed human beings, who tell us their life stories with snappy dialog or a wink of an eye. Smiles, smirks, laughs all have meaning. People cry, shout, yell, slowly deliver a powerful message to their adversaries or to us. The film has acting, lines, and technical elements of first quality that impress us because they are good not because they might be hiding weak spots. The package is loaded with snakes, and you'd better watch your hands, your backs, or in some cases, your head.<br/><br/>This film ranks among Tarantino's best, and we are grateful that he continues to deliver some of the best cinema can offer. We can tell he loves movies, he loves writing movies, and we love him for that."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","12","5 February 2016"," A Vicious, Violent & Venomous Western That May Be Quentin Tarantino's Bleakest Film To Date
","A wickedly gripping, strangely alluring & downright hysterical blend of The Thing & Reservoir Dogs, the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino is another impressive showcase of his remarkable storytelling ability, is shot in glorious 70 mm format that gives it a grandiose look n feel, is all the more strengthened by an outstanding ensemble, and also happens to be the first Tarantino film to feature an original soundtrack, composed by none other than the legendary Ennio Morricone in what is his first composition for a western in over 34 years.<br/><br/>Set in post-Civil War America, The Hateful Eight follows John Ruth who's taking fugitive Daisy Domergue to Red Rock alive in order to see her hang & collect the substantial bounty on her. On their way, they encounter another bounty hunter who's seeking a ride to the town. They are soon joined by one more fellow who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. But when their journey is cut short by a severe blizzard, the group is forced to take refuge in a stagecoach cabin where they meet five more people who may or may not be what they claim to be.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, the story of The Hateful Eight is covered in 6 chapters, with all but one unfolding in chronological order. The whole picture is his homage to John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, sharing many similarities with that classic and despite that, it's wholly original in content, is overloaded with Tarantino's patented trademarks, and is presented as a western to its audience. The screenplay puts greater emphasis on the characters inhabiting this tale and is another winning material from the master storyteller, even if it's a tad too full of itself.<br/><br/>Where Tarantino succeeds is in establishing an effective claustrophobic ambiance that brims with palpable tension & persistently looming paranoia. The interplay between characters in a Tarantino feature is almost always interesting and The Hateful Eight is no exception for it has a firm grip on viewers' attention from the start but there are also a few moments when its narrative starts feeling like it is stretched too much to fit its daunting runtime. No one blends violence & humour as ideally as Tarantino does but thanks to the bleak tone of the story, the balance is slightly off in his latest feature.<br/><br/>The majority of the plot unfolds in Minnie's Haberdashery, the stagecoach lodge, and the production design team does a commendable job in filling that place up with props that are in tune with its timeline while the snow-covered surroundings steadily bring in the element of isolation. Cinematography is truly epic in both the staggering details of the images filmed in 70 mm format as well as the extreme widescreen aspect ratio it employs to narrate its tale while the cold colour tones, smart lighting, clever angles & slow but fluid movements of its camera help a lot in enhancing the story's unnerving atmosphere.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Hateful Eight features a terrific ensemble in Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walter Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern & Demián Bichir, all playing characters that are downright despicable, deceitful & driven by hate. Russell nonetheless turns out to be quite charismatic in his role of John ""The Hangman"" Ruth and is brilliantly supported by Jackson & Goggins who play the bounty hunter & sheriff, respectively. However, of all the hateful people, the most memorable performance comes from Jason Leigh for she's absolutely manic as Daisy the fugitive plus her chemistry with Russell is absolutely spot-on.<br/><br/>And yet, despite getting most things right, Quentin Tarantino's latest is marred by a few drawbacks. First, the story he's written doesn't live up to the grand canvas it makes use of. Second, its 167 minutes of runtime isn't justified for many moments feel unnecessarily stretched just to accommodate for its intimidating length. Third, Tarantino's own cameo as narrator doesn't fit. Fourth, the excess self-indulgence nearly destroys some sequences, that ""Red Apple tobacco"" wink being one example. Fifth, the first half feels like a chore due to the slow pace & character introductions but the film picks up amazing well in the remaining half to correct that particular issue. And there's one more!<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight marks the first time in Tarantino's filmmaking career that he has made use of an original score instead of incorporating different tracks into one eclectic soundtrack. Music has always played a key role in every Tarantino film and it's one aspect he's very careful with for it can make or break a picture. Now, Ennio Morricone does deliver on that expectation with a full-fledged soundtrack that's moody, ominous & totally fits the narrative's themes but the groovy element that Tarantino's own musical choices brought into those sequences, acting as an antidote to the gruesome violence being perpetrated on the screen while at the same time contributing to the roller-coaster experience, is somewhat missing.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight is a vicious, violent, vibrant, vindictive & venomous western spewing poisonous hatred all over its frames, is another biting critique of United States' blood-soaked history, and is possibly the bleakest film he's made to date. The narrative scores high marks in quality but it's also blemished with few shortcomings that could've been avoided. Starting on a slow note, the film does manage to redeem itself with a nail-bitingly tense second half and finishes on a satisfactory note yet the whole experience of sitting through this western epic isn't as rewarding as some of Tarantino's finest works. Ingeniously directed, skilfully scripted, gorgeously photographed, patiently edited, methodically scored & superbly performed by its stellar cast, The Hateful Eight is another compelling cinema from Tarantino that's destined to please his fans."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","12","28 January 2016"," Tarantino's career in one movie
","""The Hateful Eight"" is, as the title already suggests, the 8th film by Academy Award winner Quentin Tarantino as writer and director. As usual with him, the cast consists mostly of actors with whom he has worked a lot in the past already. One great example would be Michael Madsen. Same goes for the crew as well. And also in terms of the action, it is a lot we have seen in previous Tarantino films too. It is pretty violent, also very graphic, but that should come as no surprise. People will moan and whine about how graphic it is at times (for example Bichir's last scene or Leigh's), some may even call it misogynistic with all Leigh's character has to endure and how she is depicted, but if you take a closer look, not really anybody in this film has a positive character. They are all scumbags and they basically all get what they deserve. And finally, in terms of the quality, it is a perfect film to mirror Tarantino's works so far. Sometimes it's great, almost always it's good, rarely it's bad.<br/><br/>My favorite performance probably comes from Samuel L. Jackson. His scene with Dern is one of the best of the film, same goes for the ending and the early scenes in the carriage. His investigation scene into who poisoned the ""coffy"" was very memorable too. Walton Goggins finally shows on the big screen how great of an actor he is and Jennifer Jason Leigh shines as well, confirms her 1st Academy Award nomination as the only major female player in this movie. Madsen shines more through charisma than through great range, but that's the usual with him and not a surprise really. It's also all good, he created one of the more memorable characters from this movie. The biggest disappointment was maybe Tim Roth who is a lot better than what we see from him here, a poor man's version of Christopher Waltz' characters from his last 2 Tarantino films. And honestly Waltz in ""Django"" was already a pretty poor man's version of Waltz in ""Basterds"". Speaking about these films, I think overall ""The Hateful Eight"" is on par with ""Django"", but clearly weaker than ""Basterds"". Western may not be Tarantino's best genre.<br/><br/>This may also be the reason why he did not get an Oscar nomination for his script this time or for Best Direction/Picture. Still, it's very Tarantino. If you like him as a filmmaker, you will certainly have a good time watching this work here. It runs for 2 hours and 45 minutes, an impressive duration, but this is also no news for Tarantino and it's very impressive how his films almost never drag. Thumbs up for that. Quite an achievement. Another recurring aspect is the lack of chronology. I had some issues with it while watching, but as a final verdict I have to admit, it is working here again too. The way he brought in the early events from the cabin was spot-on and helps in understanding the entire story before the spectacular ending. As a whole, I enjoyed the watch. ""The Hateful Eight"" is not one of the filmmaker's very best efforts, but it's still worth the watch from start to finish. I am also curious if it gets Ennio Morricone his first competitive Academy Award. He seems on course. Check out if you like Tarantino's other works. If not, then skip it. I personally recommend it."

","The hateful eight starts of slow. Before the interval came, half of the movie was Kurt Russel and Samuel L Jackson talking about things that were not related to anyway. I expected these small things would mean something in the later part of the movie but no. I would say 80% of the movie was actually pretty boring except for that sweet/suspenseful music score. Lots of war talk. Lots of black hate. Lots of ""This is my bounty"" and threatening talk. And in the end, the movie ends in a not so ""oh wow"" moment. There were no twist. There were no turns. The scene plays out like a straight arrow which left me very unsatisfied. I thought Tarantinos movie would have more depth and meaning. But that was it.<br/><br/>Overall an OK film."
"burlesonjesse5","5","3","12","19 January 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of The Hateful Eight
","""Got room for one 'mo?"" quips Sam Jackson's character in The Hateful Eight. Director Quentin Tarantino has got room for more movies and along with Django Unchained, this is his second Western in three years. In ""Eight"", Tarantino bludgeons us with the n-word, overindulges the audience with splattered blood and guts, brings in a cast of regulars/relative newbies (Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Channing Tatum), and provides no aura or mystery to something that's at least forty-five minutes too long. Registering in just under three hours, The Hateful Eight slightly reminded me of Quentin's earlier work in Reservoir Dogs. This is especially inherit during the flick's last act. However, ""Dogs"" is one of my favorite endeavors of his whereas The Hateful Eight falls into a set of his movies that I could care less about (that would be Inglorious Basterds, ""Django"", and Kill Bill: Volume 2). Granted, this isn't a disdain for Tarantino's latest mind you, it's just pure disappointment.<br/><br/>Anyway, his direction here is adequate if not unflashy, his main lead (Kurt Russell) does a great John Wayne impersonation a la Big Trouble in Little China, and Quentin even narrates certain parts of ""Eight"" which feel completely out of place. This thing is kind of a forced whodunit whose time setting is right after the Civil War. The story begins in snowy Wyoming where a blizzard is heavily approaching the town of Red Rock (an actual place in the Cowboy state). John Ruth (Russell) dubbed ""The Hangman"", is transferring a fugitive to ""Rock"" named Daisy Domergue (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). He wants to see her hang but his carriage is diverted (because of overwhelmingly heavy snowfall) to a stagecoach lodge called Minnie's Haberdashery. On the way, he picks up a bounty hunter named Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and a local sheriff named Chris Mannix (played by up-and-comer Walton Goggins). When they get to Minnie's, other strangers await their presence (Bruce Dern as a former war general is one of them). Ruth is suspicious that some of these random gentlemen are trying to help Daisy escape. He thinks that quote unquote, ""one of those fellas is not what he says he is"". As the proceedings barrel along, gunfights, stabbings, and poisonings ensue. Murder is unforgiving and unsentimental. Tarantino style!<br/><br/>Now ""Eight"" moves briskly in certain spots and really drags its feet in others. Most of its scenes happen in one room so it felt as if I was watching a savage version of What Love Is (2007) combined with a life- and-death variant of 2001's Tape. I was expecting to experience an intermission but I guess that was only for the film's roadshow release (we're talking about screenings in cities like L.A. and New York with the whole 70mm treatment tacked on). I was also expecting to see the Band Apart logo which seems to pop up at the beginning of every Tarantino venture. Oh well. So much for bantered tradition.<br/><br/>All in all, just like in the Kill Bill exercises, Quentin inserts The Hateful Eight with title cards that say ""Chapter 1"", ""Chapter 2"", ""Chapter 3"", and so on and so on. This doesn't hold much burden because what's on screen is such a straightforward eventuality. There are long stretches of dialogue where the actors explain everything to the audience. And Tarantino himself explains things too with his clunky narration plus a flashback sequence that although similar, doesn't quite equal the import of his finest hour, Pulp Fiction. In truth, there's no enigma to ""Eight"". And as for its grisly violence, well it's over exaggerated because humans don't contain that much plasma (sorry). With most of the troupers equaling the adjective by which this 2015 release got its title (you end up detesting almost everybody expect for Bruce Dern), well you can just call Tarantino's 8th vehicle The Good, the Bad and the Fugly. A bloody, messy, and obvious affair. Rating: 2 Stars.<br/><br/>Of note: Samuel L. Jackson was brilliant in Pulp Fiction. It was new, fresh, and exciting the way he spewed soliloquies about Big Kahuna burgers, Ezekiel 25:17, and Caine in Kung Fu. Twenty-one years later and within the span of 50+ movies, he's still tiredly doing the same old shtick. In The Hateful Eight, it has reached an all-time peak of annoyance. Also of note: Ennio Morricone's film score is nifty. But what's up with Tarantino adding songs that came out in the year 2000 (The White Stripes) and the year 1972 (David Hess). Didn't this flick take place in the 1800's. Just a random thought."

"graymattermovies","8","3","12","10 January 2016"," GMM: The Hateful Eight Movie Review
","Not falling far from the Tarantino tree, his Hateful Eight film is one of the most raw, gruesome westerns era. This isn't a movie meant for the squeamish, even though there is rich attention to detail within character interactions, some scenes are topped off with some gut splattering visuals. Having a keen eye on how to induce suspense where most other directors fall blind, Quentin Tarantino tells the story of a stagecoach carrying two bounty hunters, a prisoner, and the supposed new sheriff, being stranded in a not so warm cabin occupied by a group of skeptical characters.<br/><br/>Following up from Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino introduces his 8th directorial film, in a similar fashion. Like Django, The Hateful Eight takes place in an era where it is common to carry one or two revolvers around your waist. The film, though the name refers two eight essential characters, focuses more on Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). From the beginning, the level of personal communication these characters engage in is very captivating to say the least. As they discuss their current business and past experiences, the film portrays a very intimate suspense as each person is suspicious of the true intentions of the others.<br/><br/>This type of theme carries on through the rest of the film. The sort of ""I don't think this man is who he says he is"", aura that surrounds each character as they are introduced keeps the viewers engaged, despite the films near three hour run time. The communication between the characters and witty banter does at times provide some comic relief as well. There could have been a few scenes, such as the extended time spent focusing on the scenery in the first portion of the film, which could have been shortened. It is clear that Tarantino wants to immerse the audience in the atmosphere of his on screen vision. However, despite the suspenseful drama of the film, sitting in a theater for three hours may be a turn off for many movie goers.<br/><br/>Other members of the eight include Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Smithers (Bruce Dern), and Bob The Mexican (Demian Bichir). The members of the eight, which have each won multiple awards for previous performances, play an intricate role in the development of the movie. Each actor not only portrayed their character well, they displayed the appropriate chemistry amongst each other.<br/><br/>A nice little addition is that The Hateful Eight plays out just like a novel. Dividing segments of the movie into chapters, which are displayed on the screen, actually adds to the flow of the film and makes it seem like you are essentially watching a book. Tarantino does an excellent job creating the tone of the movie as well as depicting its setting. You can see why he prefers it being shown on 70mm. Certain scenes encompass so much detail, such as those in the haberdashery, that the film expresses more emotion and element in the moment. He does seem to do this better here than he has in some of his more recent films, and it is clear even if you don't see it in 70mm.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the deal breakers for some is the films level of vulgarity and violence. As with the Tarantino ""genre"", very strong language, blood, and gore are essential. It would not be surprising if one or two people left the theater during the showing due to these aspects. However, the language appears true to the time period and nefarious nature of the characters. Some of the gore is a little over the top, but again, this is how Mr. Tarantino uses his artistic directorial nature. For those who can handle the violence, it ultimately makes the movie more entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hateful Eight was a long, but fun and wild ride. Not being able to predict the character's action and the uncertainty of their true agenda elevates the thrill factor for the movie. Though some parts of the film, such as the run time and intense graphic content may not suit some, The Hateful Eight is a true raw western. I very much enjoyed the film and felt it contained an enthralling story. The Hateful Eight receives a non- hateful 8 out of 10."
"h-talbot","8","3","12","9 January 2016"," Tarantino Classic
","I went to see this eagerly anticipated film in the cinema on release day. As someone who is in their late twenties, I started getting into Quentin Tarantino films after watching Inglorious Bastards. It is clear that Quentin has carved a niche area of filmography which not many other directors can match.<br/><br/>Prior to going to watch this film, I was acutely aware of the negative reviews of the film. However, after watching the film, I can only praise the cinematography and plot.<br/><br/>The cinematography, acting, plot and score are all beautifully thought out and it was a pleasure to watch. If you like Inglorious Bastards, Kill Bill and Django, you would love this film. In typical Quentin style, the film is segmented into chapters. There is no doubt that Tarantino has amazing skills at keeping the watcher captivated, and his attention to detail is unreal. This is a film that you have to watch a second time to get the nuances and hidden meanings that riddle this film. <br/><br/>In terms of the plot, if you watch the whole film from start to finish, you will be amazed at how the film ends. For the first time you would have no idea that the film would finish in that way. The plot also had a hint of Reservoir Dogs (a classic must see) to satisfy the older viewers. <br/><br/>I admit, this film is not for everyone. For example, I would never recommend this film to my parents who will not understand the dark humour that keeps this film going. I was laughing at points where in another film I probably wouldn't laugh. There is also lots of shooting (the second half of the film) which is typical of a Tarantino film. Lets put it this way - you will not be going to see this film for a romantic drama. Tarantino is not for the mainstream audience - hence the 18 certificate. The language is crude but needs to be in order to set the scene.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the above does not detract from the fact that this film is yet another masterpiece from Tarantino. The dialogue and acting was amazing and I love how Tarantino really puts an effort into developing the personality of the characters. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend watching this and giving the film a chance. If you want a film set in the 1800's but with a deep meaning, check out There Will be Blood."

","First of thank you for reading this review, now let me begin by asking you a question can you name another writer/director/actor that covers every single little detail and constantly delivers such well thought out films?????<br/><br/>Didn't think so.<br/><br/>Tarantino delivers again with the western based mystery thriller and granted yes its just under 3 hours but for how the story is told and shown on the screen its probably the best 3 hours you could ever spend. It starts of slow but interesting next thing you know you would of watched 2 hours of the film its that interesting, the story of the harsh wyoming winter a bounter hunter travelling to red rock with his catch meets and helps out a couple of people on his way. With the weather getting worse they stop of at a cabin that has some intriguing inhabitants. With a superb cast that are all amazing and believable the hateful eight is up their with the best thrillers around and quite possibly the best. If you thought Django was brilliant then this 8th film from Tarantino will blow you away."
"boyan-anakiev","9","5","25","29 December 2015"," Classic Tarantino, If you like him, You'll like this.
","This movie is classic Tarantino all over, it crosses multiple genres in one and is dialogue driven. If you like Tarantino's movies then you'll like this one, probably love it, I know I did.<br/><br/>Most of the complains coming from other people for this movie are generally complains that are addressed at Tarantino for every movie he makes so there's nothing new there. If you don't like Tarantino, don't like gore, don't like a movie which is dialogue driven for the most part and are easily offended by racism/sexism and so on, then you probably should not watch Tarantino movies. <br/><br/>The cinematography,score,script and actor performances alone make this movie top notch. The plot has a few plot holes but is solid and the movie never gets boring even though it's almost 3 hours long.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast did an amazing job with their roles. In particular, Walton Goggins, Samual L. Jackson and Kurt Russell impressed me the most but there were very good performances from the other actors as well. <br/><br/>The music was fantastic and the best thing about it was that it was used in a magnificent way, just in places when it fits and is needed, something a lot of other movies get very wrong. <br/><br/>The whole movie looks beautiful, there's a lot of detail and it's shot marvellously.<br/><br/>Now about the dialogue. It's fantastic. At one point there was a character introduced to the story, he was referred to as simply the 'Hangman'. His introduction got me nervous and I didn't believe the film but then he had a monologue explaining himself and he immediately sold the idea of who he was, just by dialogue, great dialogue. There's quite a few memorable scenes and monologues in this movie that are really suspenseful and there's also humour, I laughed out loud at least twice while watching the movie.<br/><br/>One of the things I disliked about the movie was the ending act. It wasn't disappointing,it was actually very entertaining and somewhat unexpected, however when I thought about it some things didn't make too much sense and you could nit pick a few plot holes in it. I still liked it but it could've been more polished.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't really like was how Tarantino handled the non linear story telling at some points in the movie. In my opinion he usually does a better job in transitioning the story from past events to future and present events but here it felt a little bit abrupt. <br/><br/>Those two minor problems with the film didn't held me back from enjoying this masterpiece as overall it was great and I'll probably watch it a second time."
"Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer","9","5","25","26 December 2015"," Tarantino's new Movie:Kill Everyone Part 8
","Hateful Eight Hateful Eight is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Jenifer Jason Leigh, Kurt Russel, Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, and Micheal Madson along with Channing Tatum and Damian Bicher.<br/><br/>In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception. Will they survive?<br/><br/>FINALLY! My most anticipated movie of the year, made by my favorite screenwriter, who made my personal favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, is out and I got to see it in all its 70 mm roadshow glory on the day of its release. Luckily, my expectations were met with one of Tarantino's best works.<br/><br/>Tarantino dominates the spaghetti western genre, by surrounding a simple story with his trademark wit, energy, and skillful twists. He mixes gore with gaiety creating a genre bender like no other. With that said, Tarantino also allows his characters to develop over the course of this movie, thus creating a well-rounded emotional core.<br/><br/>What may very well be the best part of this movie is the banter between the characters. Since all the gruesome action starts more than half way through the movie, it is truly amazing how engaged and invested I was in the story, not at all anxious to get to the ""meat."" This is thanks to a handful of brilliant performances and the hilarious banter and monologues between them.<br/><br/>Though this may be true after the intermission, half way mark, ended, we, the audience, were treated to some of the most thrilling action sequences of the year, with a phenomenal score playing in the background. We are also treated to some ridiculously devilish twists that were foreshadowed in seemingly irrelevant scenes. There, really, is only one problem with these late game twists. This problem is since they appear so late into the movie, it makes the plot feel really convoluted. Though this isn't always the case, it does occur more times than it normally should.<br/><br/>The aforementioned acting in this movie was close to flawless, in particular, Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson is, for the most part, known for his epic one liners and his aggressive line delivery, not necessarily his acting chops. Well, he proves his worth by delivering a pitch perfect performance as Major Marquis Warren. Perfectly balancing his character's virtues and vices with a surprising amount of humor and finesse, he creates a truly compelling antihero and deserves a nod for it.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the best gives the best performance of her career as prisoner, Daisy Domergue. Embodying a character so different from anyone else in the cast, Leigh manages to take on one of the harder roles in a movie full of hard roles and I believe that, with her recent Globe nomination, she will take home best supporting actress. Although these two fine performers are the stand outs, the entire cast pulls off wonders with their respective roles. Tim Roth is back working with Tarantino, and is clearly happy doing it. Kurt Russel delivers a very nuanced (a word I never thought I'd use in a Tarantino Western) performance as Hangman Ruth. Bruce Dern is very good as is Damien Bicher. Walton Goggins is absolutely brilliant as Sheriff Mannix, delivering an extremely intriguing and over all hilarious performance.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight is a macabre black comedy like no other with a keen blend of banter, monologues, action, and masterful performances from its talented cast. Hateful Eight gets an A or a 9/10."
"carterjustin","7","4","19","5 January 2016"," Decent flick for Tarantino fans.
","As someone who watches movies just as much to enjoy art as to be entertained, I enjoyed this movie. My friends who are casual movie fans and who view movies much less critically than myself, did not. The film is basically a who-dun-it with very few set pieces that would work much better as a play.<br/><br/>Where to begin. I'll just throw out some technical aspects of the film and their respective rating. Plot 6.5/10 Screenplay and dialogue (in true Tarantino fashion) 8.75/10 Cinematography 8/10. Acting 8.5/10 Pacing 5.5/10<br/><br/>It was honestly one of Tarantino's worse films. Perhaps this is because it didn't feel like a movie, but a stage production. <br/><br/>The dialogue is all top-notch and carried the rather weak plot and pacing. The movie ran about 30 minutes too long, and was even self- indulgent at times. <br/><br/>There are highly political undertones throughout the film, and race is a major device used in the film that is set shortly after the civil war, so if that sort of thing upsets you, skip it.<br/><br/>Although the main characters were fully developed, I found myself not caring about any of them. None of them were likable, or even remotely relatable. They were, however, interesting.<br/><br/>This is my first review, so I know it's all over the place. But to sum it up--I'd only recommend this film to people who truly enjoy movies as art and story telling devices. Even then, I'd say skip it in theaters and watch it at home. I was let down overall with the film, however I still recognized that it was decently crafted and worth at least 6.5 stars. Not Tarantino's best, as it lacked the style of his earlier films and was way less compelling, but still worth watching on a rainy afternoon at home.."
"lucasvanstraaten-22418","1","2","7","15 January 2020"," The worst movie I've ever seen.
","Nothing, literally nothing is good about this movie.
The story is not only paperthin but also competely ridiculous.
The dialogue is extremely boring and for the most part completely irrelevant.
The whole movie is filled with irrelevant garbage that makes the movie drag on forever.
The action is lame, it tries to do something unique and entertaining but fails terribly.
The characters are poorly written and not interesting at all.
The pacing of this movie is slooooooooow, you could cut it down to a 30 min movie and it would still be really boring.
The decor was mediocre, nothing extremely bad, but certainly not appealing.
And lastly the music, it wasn't terrible but certainly didn't hold up to current movie standards.
It baffles me that there are people that pretend this movie is any good, all I can wonder is why?
There are so many good movies in existence, skip this pile of garbage and watch something else.
I'd rather look at a blank screen than sit through this abomination again.
Absolutely terrible, I wish Tarantino would retire."

","Utter garbage and anyone who says otherwise is blinded by the big names, the hyper-violence, abusive swearing and the misguided idea that Tarantino is good director. <br/><br/>He gives a great interview, talks a fantastic story and is hugely knowledgable about film, but he cannot direct and he certainly cannot write. He is an absolute one-trick pony with his fractured story-telling technique, and his attempts at homage are just cheap copies of considerably better works."

","This is an aptly named Western, as we learn there are eight hateful characters involved, although the one played by Kurt Russell isn't really hateful, just experienced.<br/><br/>It's another of those Hollywood geek movies, made for the geeks who worship ""Hate"" and Satanic ideology. The difference, however, is that again Tarantino pokes fun at the very dorks who love this sort of propaganda.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a comic sneer at the hate filled spaghetti Westerns. Tarantino does sneer at his own fans, it's obvious. And who can blame him? Again, we will hear all the Beavis and Butthead, brain dead, pothead, meth head, loud mouth brats insist this is the real West, but it isn't. These characters wouldn't last long in the real West, but the brats will never want to believe that.<br/><br/>It's a story of people who just think their demonic ideology enables them to be supermen, which is what Hollywood turned into after about 1965.<br/><br/>Still, with Tarantino, you get a few chuckles, so it isn't as bad as most modern movies.<br/><br/>But it's still worthless."
"gary-390","2","2","7","21 November 2016"," Disappointment
","I watched ""The Hateful Eight"" recently and I was disappointed.<br/><br/>I realize some people loved the movie but in my opinion it was garbage. I usually enjoy Quentin Tarantino films, Pulp Fiction still being my favorite.<br/><br/>This movie is unnecessarily long. The story line is weak and boring. The constant use of the ""N"" word is absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary and I felt very uncomfortable and offended hearing it over and over again...and I'm white. In this day and age Tarantino still loves to use this word and I find him to be a complete racist. It's completely wrong.<br/><br/>The use of blood and guts is typical Tarantino style but in this movie it seemed ""overkill"", pardon the pun. It seemed very unnecessary almost like saying..Hey I'm Tarantino and this is my cool style of blood & guts. In Pulp Fiction the blood & guts worked as the characters had to find a way to clean up the mess in the car. But in the Hateful Eight it was simply too much.<br/><br/>On a positive note the acting was fabulous. Kurt Russel was excellent and as usual Samuel L. Jackson delivers and if anything it was a joy to watch him in character.<br/><br/>This is my opinion, a lot of people liked the movie, but I didn't."

","I should probably mention that I'm not a Tarantino fan and haven't even seen his last two movies.<br/><br/>Kurt Russel in a snow blizzard, stuck in a small place with people he doesn't trust and with the score of Ennio Morricone. Sounds familiar? If not, go watch THE THING.<br/><br/>Look, this movie is not a western and I think it was a mistake to market it as such. It's a theater play of people just sitting and talking. I have nothing against that, but this movie is too slow, too long (almost 3 hours) and nothing much happens in it.<br/><br/>It was interesting for the first 45 but then it just goes on and on.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by Jennifer Jason Leigh's role. I expected something with a lot more ""teeth"" and she deserves much better and challenging roles."
"TxMike","Null","2","7","9 May 2016"," Pornographic violence, absurdist dark comedy with eight hateful characters in one room in the Old West.
","I saw this on DVD from my local public library. Set in Wyoming a few years after the Civil War, it was filmed in the Colorado Mountains. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie are the early outside shots of a stagecoach running on a snowy road in Colorado with the Rocky Mountains as the backdrop. I've visited there many times, rode motorcycles through the mountains, it never gets old.<br/><br/>We usually attach the descriptor ""pornography"" to graphic sex but here the pornography is the graphic violence, a Tarantino trademark. It seems to be his way of being absurd, as if to say 'If it is over-the-top graphic then it won't be taken seriously.'<br/><br/>There is a very good core of a story here, a bounty hunter is transporting a notorious and wanted female member of a gang to Red Rock where she will be tried and hanged, and he will collect the bounty. But a snowstorm forces them (plus a few others) to hole up in a roadside place of business. The rest of the movie, long at 2 hrs and 45 minutes, takes place in and around that one-room place of business.<br/><br/>The first hint that things might not be right is when they arrive and try to open the door voices from inside yell ""You have to kick it open"", then they have to take boards and nails to close the door. Much later in a flashback we see how the door was damaged to make that necessary.<br/><br/>The 8 main characters are all untrustworthy and the story is to see which would prevail. There are shootings with blood spurting out, often complete heads blown off. The blood and gore take over and the story becomes secondary.<br/><br/>This has many interesting points and good characters but in no way is a good movie. The highest ratings are from young male viewers who seem to like the cursing accompanied by all the blood and gore. But for me, I could never recommend this to anyone I know.<br/><br/>When I first learned about this movie last year I had no intention of seeing it, but my curiosity got the best of me. I am glad I saw it, to know what a really poor movie looks and sounds like."
"kodeykesler","2","2","7","20 April 2016"," Small description of the movie and its flaws
","Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' Shot Down!<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight"" is shot in 70-millimeter format. This format gave the movie a different type of quality that you see in today's films. Although, shooting with this format was intended to capture the beauty of the vast snowy plains the majority of the film was shot inside of a stagecoach rest stop, a popular place for dangerous bounty hunters and tasteless outlaws, leaving you wondering what the outside world looks like. Shooting inside one location makes the film unexciting compared to the western genre and other Tarantino films. Holding to many characters within on stop makes the movie extremely hard to follow not to mention extremely uneventful!<br/><br/>The movie opens with a wide shot of a stagecoach rolling through snowy terrain. Occupying the wagon is John Ruth A.K.A ""The Hangman"" (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter, traveling with a grimy ill mannered prisoner cuffed to himself named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Ruth is transporting Domergue to a town named Red Rock to collect a favorable reward and to watch her hang. On this gruelingly long expiation across a featureless landscape they cross the pass of some other unappealing souls. Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a previous Union soldier and as well a fellow bounty hunter, and a former Rebel Soldier, claiming to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Located in this infamous stagecoach stop there are a few more skeptical individuals to add Tarantino's beefy character stew. Starting with Oswaldo Morbay (Tim Roth), a British man that claims to be a hangman, BOB (DemiÃ¡n Bichir), a interesting cattle owner. Joe (Michael Madsen) a typical cowboy that doesn't like conversation and always has a corrupt smirk on his face. Lastly, a slimy racist Union general named Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern). <br/><br/>Within the rest stop no one is actually saying who they really are and it portrayed that it's a going to be a big game of cat and mouse trying to find out who is who. Overwhelming,it feels suspicious and you can begin to believe that everything isn't what it seems and soon things will break out into some morally correct violence as any other film directed by Tarantino but, It sure does take a while to get there! Tarantino treks through each characters savagely influenced flashbacks and visits each character's past of similar back stories and over the top gruesome murders. Tarantino lengthens the movie to a point where you lose a large amount of interest of what is going on. It starts feels as we are trapped in this unexciting building and have no clue what's going on as if we are one of the characters he had produced. Although, he does add his unique stamp of comic relief that does grasp your attention but after the dreadfully dull conversations between characters you can't find the energy to laugh. So cowboy up and enjoy the film's run time of 3 hours and 7 min of black hearted dialog and anti-climactic buildup.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film categorized in genre of westerns but you don't get to see as much of the wild frontier as you would expect in the western genre. The hateful 8 is not my kind of movie mainly because it to long and hard to follow the reason the characters are there in their first place but no one could have done this story better other than Tarantino. When it comes to characters' twist and gory over the top scenes Quentin Tarantino truly has a movie composing gift. In the story final scene, you can unquestionably relate the movie to its ghastly title. Yes, justice was finally served near those last 7 minutes of the film but unfortunately it was at the expense of my Saturday night."

","I am going to struggle to fill ten lines reviewing this. First and foremost, i tried to enjoy this as i love Tarantino's work but this was twice as long as it needed to be and was lacking in anything remotely interesting. The usual dialogue padded out every scene to the point it became annoying. The characters were reasonably developed but again we've seen them all before. As this rambled on it became increasing predicable in both plot and dialogue. The use of the 'N' was well publicised and was, i feel unnecessary. This became a film that was, for Tarantino, an autonomous vehicle, blindly visiting all his previous stories, picking up the usual actors along the way and asking them to use their old scripts. Very disappointing and by his normal standards, very lazy too."

","A refined Quentin Tarantino in a long film of three hours. One of the brightest plots I've ever seen. It's quite slow, though; you have to be patient for about an hour and a half, but I think it is a necessary slowness, to weave all the tension and plot for the grand finale from the half of the movie onward. And it's not necessary to say that the grand finale is dyed in all the blood that Tarantino loves and a little more. I was surprised it didn't make the nomination for best director or best original screenplay. From all the movies I've seen of 2015, for me this movie was definitely the one with the best direction. Jennifer Jason Leigh got a deserved Oscar for her magnificent performance as an actress in a supporting role.<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/crymovies/"

To aid in this perception, Russell emotes as if he were back in his Disney days. The whole thing is typical of Tarantino's ha-ha blood and gore, and cheaply accomplished through the Surprise! plot he usually manages with a defter hand.<br/><br/>Apparently the entire effort was treated as a joke by all participants at the expense of the people paying good movie to watch a film. Further proof that the Academy looks no further than the names involved in any given project. The stars I'm giving are for cinematography since nothing else about this film deserves one."
"samfarrow5","10","2","7","5 March 2016"," Top Notch Writing from Q.
","This is a film made especially for film fans and die hard QT fans, so if you are wanting an 'Easy Watch' or a 'Chilled night in', I recommend you do not watch, because this film will have you sweating in concentration and heavy thought.<br/><br/>The opening 30 minutes are dominated by quick but in depth dialogue, which is truly crucial to the storyline, so pay attention! The snowy opening to this film provides an early baseline for the leading 3 characters. Firstly, 'John 'The Hangman' Ruth', a fierce bounty hunter with set intentions to return a criminal to justice. 'Daisy Domergue', the criminal, captured by Ruth, cheeky and desperate (but not shown) to escape the grip of 'The Hangman'. Finally, Samuel L. Jackson's character Major Marquis Warren, also a bounty hunter, but unlike Ruth, tends to slay his victims as it seems easier than travelling in caution with his bounty's to the rope. Already, within 30 minutes into the film, the audience is eager to learn more about character motives and lengthier back stories.<br/><br/>When the 3 characters, now travelling with Walton Gioggins are forced off track, due to a blizzard, they must seek shelter within a confined cabin, occupied by 4 more potentially shady characters.<br/><br/>From this point, the film begins to open up, revealing dark back stories, Samuel L. Jacksons a personal highlight, perfectly written by Tarantino. As the movie unfolds and creates a deeper storyline, no one is safe and the audience is left confused at who is who, in turn creating a suspenseful murder mystery type narrative.<br/><br/>Although not Tarantino's best FILM, the writing is undeniably a high ranking best for the man and definitely the best aspect of the film. Shot beautifully by Robert Richardson, who consistently makes movies look spectacular.<br/><br/>A great film from start to finish and one to be remembered immediately after watching."

The screenplay keeps the flow of the film and it gives you a refreshing feeling.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is not like ""Django Unchained"", with the development of the history happening in opened scenes. This one is like Tarantino's first: ""Reservoir Dogs"". The evolution of the characters takes place in a room, a closed dirty room, and there are some flashbacks to understand the facts, just like in ""Reservoir Dogs"". It includes a ""Tarantinian"" humour that made me scream with laughter.<br/><br/>In brief, this joy is a breathtaking film which was much better than my expectations and amazed me."

","First, if you're one of the few who say this movie is 'a waste of time' or 'plain boring' then please stop lying to yourselves.<br/><br/>I watched this movie not long ago and I've got it say its pure class. Another one of Tarantino's greats. There is a slow build up but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, the build up is really good and intricate. The plot itself is really good and when it ties itself together your like 'ahhhh, this is something else'. It is a simple plot but portrayed in a complex and clever way. But don't expect gun fights, blood and gore every 10 minutes which is what we do with all of Tarantino's films.<br/><br/>Acting: Amazing, which you can expect. The cast does a great job of keeping you engaged with the plot and keeps you interested throughout, which helps considering there are only 2 main sets so it may seem quite claustrophobic at times.<br/><br/>At first it took me a while to get into it, with the build up and heavy dialogue, but now I look back on it and think what a great film it is. These days, directors and film makers are too scared to show what they want as it may not agree with society so they wouldn't dare put it into film, but this movie, Tarantino has been brave enough to do all this and create a great piece of art without offering any apologies. This film is humours, cold, mean and dark all at the same time, so I would defiantly give this film a watch."

"Hassan_Scarborough","4","2","7","12 February 2016"," Waste of time and talent
","Aside from the vulgarity of this film I thought it was a good idea that was poorly executed. It's not linear, and fans of Taratino's work won't be surprised by that, but the narrative and almost cartoon like effects and gore turned, what could have been a great contemporary western, into a campy action film.<br/><br/>It's already tiresome that Tarantino uses the same group of actors, but the addition of a narrative, and break down of each act in the film was unnecessary and took away from the suspense.<br/><br/>It started out good, then formed into a mystery of sorts, then it was, as if, Taratino panicked and thought the audience was too stupid to digest what was taking place and switched to outlining the main aspects of the characters motivation and the overall pace of the film.<br/><br/>Another issue was the continuity errors. Most of his films have very obvious continuity errors, but the errors in this film were so glaring, it wasn't even funny.<br/><br/>And as always it's an 'N-Word' fest. Which seems to be the core element in all of Taratino's work. He seems to be obsessed with this word and Samuel L. Jackson seems always willing and able to oblige. Then to put three other actors of African decent in the film, only to get shot is even worse.<br/><br/>I get it. Show Caucasian people as callus, cruel, and racist. In Django Unchained it was understood and even somewhat acceptable because it was a period piece and that is simply how the times were. Here, same thing, but again, with the dialog floating between contemporary and past, it made it hard to take the whole film seriously.<br/><br/>Taratino is someone who has some good ideas, but a terrible at fleshing out those ideas and really needs to sit down with another writer to flesh his ideas out. He needs to also try a film that is not focused solely on race and race relations.<br/><br/>Even as a Taratino fan, I thought that this film was a waste of time. I gave it a four, only because it did have some entertaining moments."
"OttoVonB","10","2","7","30 January 2016"," Near-Pitch Perfect Tarantino
","It's 10 Little Indians in the snow, except it's a Western and there's 8 of them (so the title suggests) and, 8 films into his career Tarantino has almost made peace with the kind of films he really makes: wonderfully clever B-movies. There is no shame in that, quite the contrary, and the only blemishes on his latest - and undeniably most focuses - opus, are the moments when it tries to be something else.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight is a very claustrophobic chamber piece, locking us up in a suffocating space with some interesting, complicated and unnerving characters that will not be to every audience member's taste. The pure innocence of Basterds' Shoshanna or Django are nowhere to be found, and the closest we come is tough-to-love Hangman Kurt Russell and a top-of-his-game Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>If you came here looking for Django's Mountain Cabin, you're in for some initial confusion. This is a much more intimate, restrained (until the bonkers last hour) beast, and all the better for it. There is dark fun to be had, but there is also a very real anger that makes it more interesting. You will laugh, but often, shortly after and by design, you will wonder whether you should have, and that is the sign of a mature, well-crafted piece of work.<br/><br/>This being Tarantino, his overbearing swagger does intrude once or twice: first, with chapter headings that arguably serve only to break the mounting tension, and second, with the over-hyped use of the Ultra-Panavision format. Though DP Robert Richardson's work here is faultless, the use of the format itself is little more than a gimmick, and neither makes nor breaks the film (unless you've seen the roadshow version in one of several reported instances where the projectionist screwed up). Ennio Morricone's score is effective, but don't go into this expecting the great man's twilight masterpiece, particularly as his most memorable cue is recycled from 1982's The Thing.<br/><br/>In the end, this is one of the best modern screenwriters we have embracing the range of his talent, and applying a more disciplined and patient focus than ever. The result is, in this era of dime-a-dozen prequels, sequels and reboots, a thing of beauty."
"DarthVoorhees","8","2","7","29 January 2016"," Tarantino's weakest but really is that saying much?
","I really liked an awful lot about 'The Hateful Eight'. It is a film for the Tarantino fanatic and while weaker in other areas it does deliver his excellent dialogue. It also really marks some new nuances in his abilities as a storyteller which are interesting to look at. The problem is that it is a big letdown after the masterpieces 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django'. It's still an interesting film but it just needs a lot more polish in setting up the overall story and how it relates to it's characters. There's a lot of presence and mood in 'The Hateful Eight' it just needs a little bit more... <br/><br/>I feel as if this film exhibits the least amount of character development we have ever seen in a Tarantino film. While the dialogue is interesting and pops there just isn't as much interest on my part. Here's what I liked most about the picture. The dialogue is outstanding as always. There's just a rhythm and poetry to it that is as effective as the best moments in Tarantino's most beloved works. My personal favorite moment of the picture is when we get to see the dissection of Samuel L Jackson's Major Marquis Warren. He shares an exchange with Bruce Dern's character that has all the tendencies of a great Tarantino scene. There's a lot of humor and build up while dealing with the darker nihilistic sides of the character. It's theatrical and grandiose but also very organic. Jackson rightfully takes his place as Tarantino's muse. The film is very literary I noticed. In fact Tarantino comes to a point where he narrates long stretches of it himself. It's fascinating to see this evolution. 'The Hateful Eight' probably would work better as a stage play than as a film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately aside from Jackson's character the film doesn't really have a lot of character development and it hurts the picture. It is especially noticeable in the crucial characters of 'Hangman' Ruth and Daisy. I am sure that this probably wasn't Tarantino's intent but unfortunately 'The Hateful Eight' comes across as a fairly misogynist film. Jennifer Jason Leigh's Daisy ends up pretty much being a punching bag the entire time and it's sort of depressing and over the top. The plot vaguely seems to suggest her character is the most evil of the bunch but frankly I don't see it. You see an awful lot of horrible stuff happen from each and every character and I don't see why Daisy has any special emphasis. If Tarantino had developed her as much as he did his other villains this wouldn't have seemed as bad. We just know nothing about her and so I don't care really. Do not take this as me complaining about Tarantino's flair for gore and violence. Tarantino's most enjoyable iconography has come from adding dramatic flair to gore. The problem is gore with out any sort of mythos or metaphor or commentary is just boring and can be off putting. If 'Hangman' Ruth or Daisy had more of a back story or if Daisy herself had been the leader of the Domergue gang this would have all been solved and I'd probably be more enthusiastic about the film.<br/><br/>It's one of his weaker efforts but I liked a lot about it still. It's hard not to like even a weak Tarantino film especially one with this great a cast."
"akshay-ak-kumar","7","2","7","24 January 2016"," Mixed Bag !!
","I'm a big fan of Tarantino's work and my favorite is Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>So after enjoying Inglorious Basterds and Django, I waited patiently for this movie. When I saw the trailer, my mouth was watering. And alas last weekend, I saw the film and my final says its a mixed bag.<br/><br/>Frankly, I initially left the theatre happy and satisfied but as a week passed by I realized that I was also disappointed with movie and Tarantino's writing. I saw somewhere some potential being wasted.<br/><br/>The plot of actually 9 and not 8 strangers all waiting in an inn for the blizzard to calm down is very delicious on paper. However, Tarantino takes a lot of time setting up the stage.<br/><br/>The story is divided into 6 chapters and you will need patience to sit through chapter 1 to 3 because the story is not moving; its building up. And when chapter 4 starts, the movie picks up speed.<br/><br/>So I was disappointed with the first 3 chapters because the dialogues are flat. It lacks the sharpness seen in Tarantino's movies. Its also a bit long and one will become restless. Some of the characters are interesting and some are not at all.<br/><br/>Tarantino also throws in parts which focus on the white man vs, black man relationship in the US which is actually a pointer to the current challenges the US Society is facing.<br/><br/>All the actors perform exceptionally well. However, the star of the movie is Jennifer Leigh. She is just brilliant and deserves an Oscar Nomination.<br/><br/>And like his previous fiim, in this film to justice will be served in the end."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","3","13","10 January 2016"," A well made, but hard to defend film
","The Hateful Eight is such a strange film as far as ""ratings"" go. Most movies, I have a pretty good idea on whether it was a good film or not. The Hateful Eight is... between a 4/10-8/10... yeah... the movie is either bad or pretty good. This film is such an odd-flick because rarely has a movie captivated me so well, but then had little to no pay-off for that captivation. Yeah, the cinematography is gorgeous, the aspect ratio was neat, the dialogue is smart and witty, but... in the end... there isn't a whole lot to this movie.<br/><br/>Now, to review this movie it should be fair to also bring in references of Tarantino's other films. You know in Inglorious Basterds where the spies are drinking at a bar full of Germans? Where the characters are all vaguely trying to figure out who is who and the tension just slowly builds? That is this movie. Yes. The Hateful Eight in its entirety can pretty much be summed up by that one scene in Inglorious Basterds. And this makes sense, because he also did the same thing with Django Unchained where the second half of the movie is mostly just dialogue and building tension with dialogue, so why wouldn't Tarantino just make an entire film about ensemble dialogue?<br/><br/>This is both smart and annoying at the same time. While The Hateful Eight can be praised for how smartly made it is, it can also be criticized for how pointless it is and how the movie doesn't do much with what it has. You see, The Hateful Eight is a ""Who did it"" movie, along the lines of Reservoir Dogs or The Thing. Now, for a ""Who did it"" movie to really work, there needs to be more than just ""one"" mystery. For the most part, you need a series of mysteries that lead the audience to the culprit. There need to be multiple elements that throw the audience off. And while this movie has multiple ""suspects"" to throw the audience off, the entire plot revolves around only one mysterious plot-point and not multiple mysteries.<br/><br/>For me, this is a little frustrating because the audience can't really solve a mystery with only one point. They need multiple points. So any attempt to solve the mystery doesn't really work because you are never given enough information to solve it. The other issue is *MASSIVE SPOILERS* that EVERYONE is the culprit in this movie. Granted, that is a slight exaggeration (three of the main characters aren't, but out of 8-11 different characters that isn't much). So, essentially the audience could've guessed anyone and they would've been right. And that is a big problem with a movie that plays itself like a mystery. There is no pay-off for paying close attention to the movie. You could shoot blindly in the dark and you would get the correct answer on ""who is behind this"". <br/><br/>Overall, that is probably my biggest gripe with the movie. The movie is long and is careful to give the audience tid-bits of information on the characters, which you think will help out later on, but they don't. Nothing that happens in the movie really helps the audience figure out the mystery or even guide them in the right direction, and unfortunately, that is one of the most important elements of the movie to get right.<br/><br/>However, the movie is clever with how its characters work. Every character in the movie (Whether you like them or not) is evil. The main character (played by Samuel L Jackson) is very interesting because he is a liar. If you believe his stories, he is one of the most evil psychopaths in the movie. If you think he is always lying, he is actually a pretty smart character who is mostly doing the right thing. This goes with all of the characters. Every character is both likable and down-right evil.<br/><br/>Did the infamous run-time of this film really bother me? Not really. While it is a long film, it is also continuously engaging and interesting. Unfortunately it never really pays off, but it was still fun to watch... up to a certain point. A tiny nit-pick would be that there are random narrations in the film. They are supposed to be cheesy, but they are unnecessary because they describe what is going on screen. If the narrations described events we didn't see, it would make sense, but they don't... they simply describe what is happening.<br/><br/>The last gripe on The Hateful Eight is that this is the most psychotic and pointlessly gruesome of Tarantino films. Other Tarantino films will have stylized violence, goofy violence, or so much blood that it is unrealistic and looks more like a joke (Django Unchained, Kill Bill); however, this film isn't light-hearted or very jokesy with its violence. It is just down-right disturbing at times. This kind of works to the effect of the film, but it gets a little over-the-top at times... I feel like it tries to be funny with its violence at times, but it just comes across as sick (but again, that is kind of the point of the film).<br/><br/>All in all, The Hateful Eight is a technically well made film and it is an interesting film. While I did enjoy the first half a lot, the second half was kind of a let-down. What should've been a tightly woven mystery ends up being a dark, cartoony, gore fest to constantly trick the audience's expectations of who is the most evil. I could see some people hating this film and some people loving this film. I don't even know my true feelings of the film. On one end, it is technically amazing. On the other end, its pay-off isn't so good.<br/><br/>Make what you want of it. Be warned, it isn't for everyone."
"daylanwetherbee","8","3","13","8 January 2016"," A pure film that people can hate
","Solid Tarintino film. The Hatefull 8 makes you feel like your stuck in a frozen icebox along with the Hang Man ( Kurt Russell) You know your there for something exiting but not quite sure what till it happens. Like Quentins other films this one has good dialog but maybe too much for some to stay listening. And also like Quntins films there is good colorful violence that all can enjoy. The Hatefull 8 cleans up like Terintinos Reservoir Dogs and moves like his Death Proof. If you didn't like this film the first time I strongly suggest you watch it twice and pay attention to little props like the cigarettes and other things connected to each character."
"umme4uke","9","4","20","5 January 2016"," Best since Pulp Fiction
","I was starting to lose faith in Tarantino - he was trying to say too much, or got too big for his story telling boots or something - but this is a return to form.<br/><br/>Gripping crime narrative with some great but simple dialogue and interesting characters well portrayed. It felt a lot like a Western Reservoir Dogs to me and Reservoir Dogs is still my favorite Tarantino film.<br/><br/>It's a definite departure from films like Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained, which are a more epic in scope and I think suffer for it. I find Tarantino's style is better confined to the type of film with smaller scope and limited scenes, that gets gritty with the story and characters.<br/><br/>So, if you liked his earlier films, or character driven Westerns I'd recommend this film wholeheartedly. If you prefer Tarantino's later films, you may not enjoy this one as much - though it still has all his trademarks and is an enjoyable ride nonetheless."

","Quinton took a fantastic two hour script and stretched it over three hours play time. It has a great plot, great acting, great cinematography and all the usual goodies and quirks you can expect from a Tarantino movie/plot. However the fact that this movie was made unnecessarily long made it quite torturous to watch. It does manage to keep you attention, however there are many moments during the film where the next scene can be predicted. At a point, it almost felt like I was watching a documentary. I am pretty sure if it was not a very famous director/writer making this movie, it would not have received all the positive reviews."
"ryanmerino","6","4","21","2 January 2016"," As a Tarantino fan... This is disappointing.
","I like to read reviews that hold a certain weight to them. There are a lot of amateur critics in the world that seem to jump at any chance to skewer a director for their perceived failure. There are also a lot of people with bad movie taste that think they are the cream of the crop when rating movies for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to group myself with any of these people... I'm simply here to tell you that I found the movie boring and the acting forced..<br/><br/>Of course, I've seen a lot of great movies where the main actors depend on the success of the film to define their careers. What I'm seeing in this movie though, is a lot of established actors going through the motions to collect a paycheck and an equally established director lose sight of why he makes movies in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't know what went wrong with the movie to tell you the truth. Maybe it was the geographical stagnation that displeased me. I'm used to seeing a lot of different settings in a Tarantino film. But this one just kind of, hovered in the same boring spot. The first Evil Dead movie did the same, but at least it went all out to distort the visual and auditory perception of the viewer, making every scene interesting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie focused on some sort of pre-Freudian intellectual dialogue that no one can relate to.<br/><br/>I really had high hopes for this movie and hoped that it would be on the level of Inglorious Basterds or Kill Bill... But it was too slow, led by a lazy and boisterous Samuel L. Jackson and a robotic Walter Goggins.<br/><br/>I wish that Tarantino just made the Vega Brothers movie instead."
"blanbrn","8","4","21","1 January 2016"," A long drawn out blood western, mixed with race and politics and themes of search and find.
","""The Hateful Eight"" is certainly not a bad movie, yet really for me it wasn't a good one either as it's long drawn out style of conversations between character is a little to long and made me feel tired. If you know anything about Quentin Tarantino you know that the director likes to make long films and his themes often mix race and politics and most of the characters are on search and find missions that usually end in a blood type destroy mode for all involved. And that's a pretty good sum up for rightfully Quentin's 8th film called ""The Hateful Eight"". This film can be a tribute somewhat to the old style B western films of the 1970's and it's a tease of action and adventure. Set in a snow covered Wyoming after the civil war this tale involves the travels of a bounty hunter(played well by Kurt Russell)who in his wagon carries a beat up and wild female prisoner(played strong by Jennifer Jason Leigh). Upon the journey they encounter a former Union officer(played to crazy form by Samuel L. Jackson)who wants to cut a deal yet all in involved have the intentions of blood, guns, and mayhem. Rounding out the cast in supporting form is Bruce Dern, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Demian Bichir. While most fans of Tarantino will like it and western B film fans might have a joy still to me it's not Quentin's best it's much of a tease of dark blood humor as I was asking for more still it's an okay film to see."
"saketkt","8","4","21","24 December 2015"," The Hateful Eight deserves an 8. And the letter's not real man.
","What's not there to like in a Tarantino movie? I found the movie hilarious, not joking. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome. Even the sheriff was hilarious in the last scene. There is not much visual aesthetics in most of Tarantino's films. Around eighty percent of the movie is shot in a cabin. By no means that's bad. It's just the characters, the way Tarantino usually develops them, and the dialogs that make his movies so damn good. Besides, details; anecdotes; and metaphors are plenty in this one. I love the way Tarantino's characters use stories to get their point across. It's like Bamn! You hit the sweet spot. The Hateful 8 was no different, though the music score was disappointing. Also, the pace dropped mid way, but it picked up later on.<br/><br/>This movie is about six bounty hunter, a horse carriage driver, and a sheriff (I am not sure-was he a bounty hunter too?) stuck in a cabin due to a blizzard in a tale of twist and turns. Kurt Russel is transferring a bounty to a town to hang her. On his way, the company picks up Samuel L Jackson, and the sheriff. Following their arrival, Samuel L. Jackson senses something's a misplace. The company encounters four other men waiting already in the cabin. It includes an actual hangman, an old retired southern black hating general, a Mexican acting as a caretaker at Minnie's, and a Joe Cage traveling to meet his mother. Pretty Company. There is a traitor(s) among them who conspire(s) to free the bounty. Samuel L. Jackson slowly unravels the mystery and springs the trap that the earlier company had just walked into. Yeah, obviously he met someone unexpected, and he ends up losing something precious. I love the way he screams- here and in Django Unchained too.<br/><br/>IMDb should add comedy to the already listed genres -drama, thriller, mystery-of this movie. Just enjoy the movie, and Tarantino fans don't be too critical."

","The movie is a whooping two hours and forty five minutes and, to put it mildly, it's not fast paced. That being said, the shots are grand, the acting very good and the story weird enough to make it a classic. I mean, what could possibly go wrong, with Tarantino directing and writing a movie about Kurt Russel stuck in a frozen unforgiving place with a bunch of people, some not being what the seem they are?<br/><br/>Inappropriate The Thing references aside, the only issue with this film is that it is slow and it doesn't really have a resolution or character evolution or, one might say, a point. He made this story solely about the characters and that might make the viewer feel a bit bored and certainly a bit confused about some tactical decisions characters make (sometimes it seems that they do things just in order to let themselves speak later).<br/><br/>Not Tarantino's best, but a good movie nonetheless.

The opening scene however was average, one could even argue dull and dragged out. That was the tone for the rest of the movie. Dragged out. <br/><br/>This movie could have easily been 2 hours long and not lose any of the storytelling.

","The Hateful Eight is a dialogue driven film that is highly entertaining and enthralling enough. Of Tarantino's films, this ranks up there with the best, and in the recent years it is better than both Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained...by a mile, and they were pretty good. I guess the question isn't if this movie is or was good, but rather where it stands and ranks in Tarantino's best. I would put it just below Pulp Fiction, and just above Kill Bill Vol. 1, about tied with Jackie Brown, but surprisingly slightly better. It is definitely one of his best. Don't listen to the negative reviews. This is definitely a good film and I went in to watching it skeptical because I heard some criticism. One of the biggest was the length, but I actually didn't notice it really. It's long, but you just have to put up with it. I enjoyed the character developments, mystery, tension, and screenplay that extended the time. Overall, this is definitely a good movie and much better than Django Unchained, which also had a similar western style to it."

","Tarantino can do it all. He can make a seemly very long movie and grip you with intensity. Admittedly, of course at times it drags but no more than most movies can do. At three hours and seven minutes, this movie is almost destined to be plagued with some drawn out scenes/dialogue. Doesn't bother me as much as some but if you're expecting high- intense, long gun battle scenes. You will be disappointed. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie is as great of an overall cast as it could be. Tarantino draws out the best in actors, I don't know how.

"chrisschock","9","4","22","3 January 2016"," My first review of a movie in over 11 years on this site.
","I never write reviews and I am stopping with this one. This is as much a review of the power of cinema as the quality of the content of the movie.<br/><br/>Holy hell. Never have I really seen two different versions of the same film before. Let me begin by saying that I was fortunate enough to catch the 70mm roadshow version on a massive screen, with a flawless projection of the film.<br/><br/>It was glorious. It was grand. I have had experience with 70mm IMAX on a true IMAX screen for films like Interstellar and The Dark Knight Trilogy, so I knew how powerful and visually rich things could get...but never have I been able to experience an entire movie shot with full on Ultra Panavision. The detail, depth of field, colors and just warmth of picture were astounding. My wife, who is the least interested or self admittedly perceptive of resolution quality, i.e. she really doesn't understand the big deal in the difference between blu ray and regular DVD etc...was as blown away by the look of the movie as I was. So if it got thorough to her it means something.<br/><br/>Now that being said...I went to see it again a few days later, at the same theatre, however due to a lack of clarity with the online ticket purchasing I wound up with tickets to the regular digital version on a more modest sized screen and the difference was staggering.<br/><br/>The entire movie was changed for me and not in a good way. It lost all of it's soul. The absolute feast for the senses which was the 70mm was but famine on digital. I was watching a completely different movie. It was like watching a DVD, not a blu ray, at my house on my decently sized 1080 TV. What I saw with the 70mm was a FILM. <br/><br/>I cannot see how anyone with eyes, upon watching the 70mm was not immediately arrested by the sumptuousness of the picture, and certainly not anyone who sampled both formats. <br/><br/>The content of the movie was wonderful. I think it is Tarrantino's best since Kill Bill and were it not for other pictures like Mad Max, Sicario or Mr. Holmes, it would be a shoe-in for best picture and it's actors serious contenders for all the major awards.<br/><br/>But to sum it all up, please, see this in 70mm while you still can. The true majesty of film was brought forth by this wonderful format. It makes all the difference in the world in terms of sheer immersion into the movie going experience. I am rather excited to hear that Nolan's upcoming WW2 film may also be shot in Ultra Panavision and even more excited by how well this movie has done both critically and commercially in regards to the power of the 70mm roadshow presentation.<br/><br/>I for one would gladly pay a premium price for a truly premium format as 70mm as opposed to all of that 3D hocus pocus crap; and I think anyone who has the eyes to see would agree."

"laotzunietzsche","10","4","22","2 January 2016"," A spoiler-free thematic analysis
","There is a scene near the beginning of, The Hateful Eight, where, to prevent one of our intrepid anti-heroes getting lost if it became necessary to venture from the relative safety of the building in which they are holed up to the outhouse—which was some distance away—a ""rope line"" was made between them because of the ensuing white-out conditions of the on-going blizzard. This consisted of a man laboriously pounding stake after stake in the snow and threading a rope through a loop at the top of them. The scene is several minutes long. And Tarantino uses the epic scope of Ultra Panavison and his razor-sharp 65mm lens in an intimate manner, putting us right in the snow with the character. We feel the freezing wind sting our faces and sweat under our parkas. Narratively, though, the scene seems wholly unnecessary. We do not need to see the rope line built to know it has been. And neither it, nor the outhouse, really figure much into the rest of the story (not to say they don't at all). Nonetheless, beyond even helping establish the fierceness of the storm, the building of the rope line is one of the most important scenes in the film. It serves an essential purpose. In fact, if one fails to understand the significance of it, a full understanding and appreciation of the film on a thematic level is not possible—regardless of how much one actually enjoys watching it.<br/><br/>There is a temporally long, but slow-moving tack and pan that opens the film. This establishes a non-static image which rhymes thematically and visually with an image near the film's conclusion. And there is something very significant about the samenesses and differences between the foregrounds and backgrounds of those two shots. Similarly, as in the previous example, if one does not grasp this, one really cannot fully understand the film thematically, if at all. Oh, sure, you can still enjoy the it. If you've liked Tarantino's previous work, odds are you will enjoy this, too. However, it could get a little draggy for you if you don't have a good feel for why we are, basically, spending three hours in a room with a bunch of people who, for most of the film, just do a lot of talking.<br/><br/>In this analysis, I am endeavoring to only say things not mentioned by others so, for example, I am not going to mention things like Ennio Morricone's wonderful score, or Robert Richardson's dazzling cinematography, or Courtney Hoffman's sumptuous costuming—except in passing. . . Now, without giving anything away, over the course of the film, several people enter a room that is emblematic of a world where there is no moral compass. (Did it ever have one? Was it lost? How?) At the film's conclusion, one has been forged. The problems along the way are uniquely American, as is their ultimate solution. Issues like race, identity, the nature of history of truth, of performance, etc. are encountered along the way.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I cannot tell you why the opening and closing images are so important, nor why the rope line scene is so key, without spoiling the film for you—or, at least, without imposing my own interpretation. Bu trust me. They are. Tarantino certainly thinks so. He appears twice in action as a director in the large, glorious theater program that one receives if one attends the ""roadshow"" that is showing the film's 70mm print. In the two page image one encounters upon first opening the program, he is shown filming the rope line scene. The last photograph in the program is of him creating the film's opening image, the one that was discussed. (He only appears one other time in the program, in a small picture of him talking to an actor.)<br/><br/>So you have your clues. Go be a sleuth—for art! Also, try to get to the roadshow. They have not made a 70mm Ultra Panavison narrative film in fifty years. Seeing it is, quite literally, the chance of a lifetime."
"facebookemail456","8","4","22","29 December 2015"," Tarantino: Greatest Artist of our Generation
","It has been a few days since I saw this movie, and I have thought about it a lot.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to see in on the 70mm roadshow, and it was fantastic. The fact that there was a program, and an intermission to go get more drinks made it quite an event. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself It was exactly like I expected. When I first saw the trailers I thought ""Ok this won't be one of Tarantino's best, but it will still be good an entertaining, and worth a watch"". That is exactly what it was. If you are a Tarantino fan see this movie because it has everything a Tarantino movie usually has.<br/><br/>That is when this interesting thought dawned on me. When compared to Pulp Fiction, Django, and Kill Bill this will probably drop pretty low on Tarantino's list. However, when compared to the many, many other films released this year it is Light Years ahead of everything. <br/><br/>This is such a unique plot of having almost the whole movie in one room. the last movie That did it so well was 12 Angry men, and a lot of Reservoir Dogs. The Dialogue, acting, directing is way better then the average movie. Yet most people I have talked to said ""eh, it's alright.""<br/><br/>Tarantino is so far ahead of everyone, so amazing, so perfect in his movie making that our expectations are ridiculously high. We expect him to make one of the best movies every single time because for the most part he has. This is the equivalent of people who are like ""Yeah Lady Madonna is alright, but no the Beatles best."" That is an awesome song, but when compared to the rest of the work is just average.<br/><br/>So I guess my overall review comes to the fact that this movie is easily one of the best of the year, but Tarantino fans won't see it that way. Tarantino is, in my opinion (do I have to mention that even though it's a review and self implied) the greatest artist of my generation (the millennial's), and us seeing this as an average movie only proves his greatness."

","First off I love Tarantino movies, my favorite being Pulp Fiction. While that is still my favorite, this has become my second... and I've seen them all. Saw it on Christmas day to a packed audience in Florida. The wintry Wyoming scenes were incredible as well as the interaction of the characters. Bruce Dern's performance was similar to his role in Nebraska... he has aged well. Both Samuel Jackson and Kurt Russell were superb and entirely believable as allies in this survival against ruthless. Nice to see Madsen and Roth in there, they both had very good performances. Lots of action, surprises and humour. Don't miss this, it will win some Oscars imo."

","Count me among those who really, really disliked this movie. In general, I've had extreme reactions to Quentin Tarantino's work. Either I've really loved it, or ... well .. I really haven't. ""The Hateful Eight"" definitely counts among the latter group. I suppose one should give credit for the title at least. ""The Hateful Eight"" sums up my feelings about the characters perfectly. There's not a single one among them who I like; not a single one I would trust to look after a nickel for me. But they're also really not amusing or interesting. There's just nothing appealing about any of them. Which means that you get stuck sitting through almost 3 excruciating hours with them. At one point it seemed this movie had gone on forever, but then I checked and discovered there was still almost an hour to go. My Lord, it was painful. It does eventually seem to establish some sort of direction or purpose relatively late when we start dealing with the murder mystery - but in all honesty by the time that happened I was struggling to stay awake and just waiting for the torutre to end. It was truly a painful experience watching this. (1/10)"

","Good movies are an exception nowadays; in my humble opinion of course. So many films are a bus-ticket-big story full of plot-holes and incoherences serving as an excuse for loosely linking action, special effects and general showing-off. None of it here. If the above is your kind of movie : move along. You'll feel bored. I also assume most of the bad reviews are from that kind of public. (After all, there is no accounting for taste)<br/><br/>The movie, served by the music of Master Morricone, is a perfect homage to the spaghetti-western, but also its own beast. Visually, the snowy outdoors are beautiful; the costumes are very nice and the decors nicely detailed. The dialogs and interactions, delivered by very good actors, are well-written and add color and depth to the characters. Tarantino shines particularly at this. The story, simple and complex at the same time, unravels at a very nice and well-mastered pace. I could not, like I'm sadly used to, guess instantly what would happen and when. I've not been bored for one second during this almost three-hours movie.<br/><br/>Warmly recommended."

","In the space of a few weeks Australian movie lovers and even more so fans of Westerns have had the rare opportunity to be spoilt for choice for their Wild West needs. All offering something different, we've had the visually striking The Revenant, the direct to disc cult classic in waiting Bone Tomahawk and perhaps for many the most anticipated 70mm filmed production in some time, The Hateful Eight, the 8th film from the master himself Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>Another lovingly crafted homage by QT, this time to the widescreen glories of the Western heydays, The Hateful Eight sees the wordsmithing wizard create a film that seems destined to one day turn its way into a stage production as more so than ever before this is a near 3 hour long film that rides almost exclusively off the back of Tarantino's way with words and where films like Reservoir Dogs did the same in many respects it wasn't quite to the scale or length of Eight's tension riddled opening chapters that aren't afraid to cause a major case of numb-bum for cinema goers but draw you in thanks to the mystery and intrigue (and a dark sense of fun) as to where things may end up.<br/><br/>Divided into 6 chapters of varying length and intensity, Eight's beginning 4 segments are classic stuff. Filled with intrigue, backstory and of course hilarious dialogue and situations that we should feel bad for enjoying, you'll be totally hooked into the mystery that QT has crafted and it's a whole load of fun trying to figure out who's playing who and who wants what in the cosy surrounds of Minnie's Haberdashery. It's then somewhat of a shame that QT's closing chapters feel like something akin to a letdown and no amount of comical blood spray or desperate acts of survival can cover up the fact the film starts to feel not only slightly to longwinded but a little bit of a fizzle out considering the fantastically constructed slow build that preceded it.<br/><br/>Front and centre of this slow build is a typically strong cast of QT regulars and newbies and each character actor has their moment to shine, with the films best dialogue stolen by the perhaps never better Samuel L. Jackson as Major Marquis Warren (who takes many of the films greatest lines), Tim Roth as the smooth talking local hangman Oswaldo Mobray and Walton Goggins as the soon to be local town sheriff Chris Mannix and with these men leading the charge it's quite clear that the whole cast was having a blast chewing on the dialogue heavy scenarios created for them. It's also great to see Kurt Russell (sporting what could be the year's best movie beard, sorry Leo) back on fine form and Jennifer Jason Leigh is well deserving of her recent Oscar nomination for her turn as the conniving Daisy.<br/><br/>It would be great for Tarantino to one day give himself tighter editing restrictions and The Hateful Eight like many of his more recent films could've easily trimmed 15 – 20 minutes of screen time and lost none of its impact but overall we cinema goers should be appreciative of his continuing effort to make and produce unique movies that are lovingly crafted reminders as to why cinema is such a fabulous medium to enjoy.<br/><br/>Far from Tarantino's best work, The Hateful Eight is still mightily entertaining stuff that's meticulously shot, scored and scripted and a film that for 3 quarters of its run time threatens to be a new classic of the Western genre only to finish in a slightly disappointing manner. Still, for fans of unique cinema events and supporters of the man that has now given us 8 highly memorable films, The Hateful Eight will be one of the year's most darkly enjoyable (and blood splattered) movie events.<br/><br/>4 inconvenient doors out of 5"
"Bravesfan82","8","2","8","25 January 2016"," Another Tarrantino Gem.
","This is a shortened review. For my full length review, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/<br/><br/>The plot of The Hateful Eight is very straightforward and simple: a bounty hunter named John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is transporting a wanted fugitive (Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) through the mountains of Wyoming to town so she can be hanged for her crimes. Before they can complete their journey, a blizzard forces them to stop at a halfway point and wait out the storm with a cast of interesting and potentially treacherous characters. <br/><br/>Among those characters is Major Marquis Warren, a former slave and retired Civil War Calvary hero, embodied by the magnificent Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is one of Tarantino's favorite actors and he has another great role in The Hateful Eight. Warren is funny, charming, and devious. He's a bounty hunter himself and is on somewhat friendly terms with Ruth, so they make a pact to help each other out until the storm clears and they can be on their way again. Jackson is able to portray Warren as both likable and despicable, sometimes in the same scene, and this makes for a very intriguing character to follow. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are a mix a different archetypes - the gentlemanly foreigner (Tim Roth), the Confederate general (Bruce Dern), the cowboy (Michael Madsen), the Mexican (Damian Bichir), and the Rebel outlaw (Walton Goggins) - but all are perfectly realized and unique characters played by talented actors. There's not a wasted character or performance among them and they all interconnect wonderfully. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell is generally good in most films, but he delivers an excellent performance here. John Ruth is a cold, calculating, untrusting son of a bitch. He routinely beats on his prisoner, who admittedly deserves what she gets, and uses the threat of violence as his icebreaker for conversations with new acquaintances. Russell hits all the right notes and makes Ruth a truly memorable character, someone who is as quick with a gun as he is with a joke. <br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh really shines as the malicious and disgusting Daisy. She's obviously a dangerous psychopath and rampant bigot, but she's also really funny. I wouldn't say she's a likable character, but she's a fun one to watch. <br/><br/>Walton Goggins does the nearly impossible and virtually steals the film from his more famous costars. His Chris Mannix is something of an enigma and you're never quite sure if he's immensely stupid, slyly intelligent, or some weird combination of both. He's fiery patriotic and shows almost childlike reverence to Dern's retired general, but also pays a decent amount of respect to Major Warren, displaying his ability to play both sides. Throughout the film, I was never sure if I could trust him, but I loved watching his story and character unfold. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is full of extreme violence and over the top blood and gore. Those are a staple of Tarantino's style and if you're into that kind of thing you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is a little less than three hours long, but I never felt bored and it certainly didn't feel like I was sitting in the theater for anywhere near that amount of time. The mix of humor, action, and suspense really kept the film moving. <br/><br/>Considering the majority of the film takes place in one large room, Tarantino did an excellent job at making a beautiful film. The landscapes (mountains and woods covered in snow) add a lot to the beginning portion, but even the inside of the cabin itself is nice to look at. The set design is intriguing (the cabin really feels authentic and lived in) and the walls and doors let in just the perfect amount of light and snow from the outside. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight isn't perfect, of course, and a couple small things did bother me. <br/><br/>For one, the soundtrack was a bit uninspired for a Tarantino film. I can't really remember any of the songs used, which is unusual. The score - composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone - was excellent, though. <br/><br/>Another oddity that bothered me was a weird decision to use voice over narration in just one scene towards the middle of the film. It was a jarring change of style and I don't think it added anything to the film. Of course, Tarantino provided the narration and I feel he might have used the technique as a way to get himself into the film. If that's the case, I guess I'm happy he went with that approach rather than casting himself in a small on screen role. Tarantino is a wonderful writer and director, but an absolutely terrible actor. His work in Django Unchained is easily the worst part of that film and I was happy not to see him in The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>Compared to Tarantino's other films, I think The Hateful Eight lands somewhere in the middle, but again I'm a huge fan and really like or love all but one of his features. It's not quite as good as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or Jackie Brown, but is on par with Django Unchained, and I liked it more than either of the Kill Bill films, Inglourious Basterds, and certainly more than Death Proof.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Tarantino's, I'd highly recommend seeing The Hateful Eight. If you're just a fan of westerns or action comedies, and don't mind excessive violence, gore, and language, I'd also recommend checking it out."

","Is it parody?, partly. Is it satire?, for sure. Is it a commentary on the absurdity of frontier life?, a bit of that too. This movie is so bold and subtle it is great theater to watch. The wide screen film format is a wonderful feat of cinematic tradition. The story evolves with dramatic, intense suspense as we learn about the role and background of each character. The stage is set in Minnie's haberdashery. A coming together of events that seem random, but turn out to be carefully orchestrated. An old fashioned mystery style who ""done it"" carefully directs our thinking and attention to each character. Jackson is the pivotal character and he is masterful to the end. One of the best movies. Sure there is gratuitous gore, but it is so over the top, it becomes satirical and speaks to the fascination we all have for it."
"stimpy_tr","9","2","8","24 January 2016"," An expert in non-annoying exaggeration
","I think this movie is one of the best movies of Tarantino. By time he has become an expert in non-annoying exaggeration. Maybe he has corrected himself after my Django review in which I had warned him. Here are some reasons why I like this movie a lot. I've already watched it twice and I think I'll watch it more. The opening score is excellent thanks to Ennio Morricone. The close-up to the crucified Jesus is also very nice. The characters are all unique and they are given almost equal importance with respect to one another. This is achieved not only by the script but also by the outstanding performance of actors.<br/><br/>As well as Tarantino touch is concerned, I can't pass without mentioning some of them since I have already checked the spoiler alert. The craving of John Ruth before asking for permission to see the Lincoln letter; the Lincoln letter itself; the close-up to the two horses white and black in front in slow motion with a great snowy view in the background; the broken door of haberdashery and nailing it each time again and again; Minnie's struggle to speak French; the great diversity of the slang terms and accents used all throughout the movie; the Mexican himself; the laughters of Samuel L. Jackson; the way Chris Mannix eats the stew; the long final scene; the fabulous ending; the two snowshoes behind Lady Domergue when she is being hung.<br/><br/>As I mentioned these Tarantino touches wouldn't be so impressive without these actors, namely, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins. I would like to congratulate them all."

","First, you gotta watch this one the big screen, preferably the one with the overture, 12 minutes longer runtime, and the 12 minute intermission. Old. School.<br/><br/>Second, you're unlucky if you live in a scissor-happy society, like I do.<br/><br/>So, in spite of that, I trudged to the local cinema, a screen little bigger than the average home cinema, with a good friend, and proceeded to try and enjoyed what was left of the movie.<br/><br/>All actors are phenomenal in their roles, a testament not just to their acting talent, but also to their recognition as such, and the casting that the writer/director did, at the time of conceiving the flick.<br/><br/>This also has to be one of the best scored Ennio Morricone movies, ever, and I do hope he gets the Oscar statuette he so deserves. This guy's been scoring for years now, and most of his work has been iconic, including Sergio Leone's 'Man with no name' trilogy in the 60s, all the way to this one. It's definitely been 1 heck of a journey.<br/><br/>Unlike what some have been saying, the twists that begin playing out in one of the final acts, spanning over the last hour/so, is kept grounded, and is all the more impactful for that, not just due to the (Tarantino-esque) bloodletting and gore that happens, even though there's less of that locally. Also, I did not get to hear most of the colorful language spouted by typical Tarantino characters, and my impression of the movie is still a good one in spite of everything (sigh).<br/><br/>Most of the players are those who've worked with QT earlier (Sam L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Zoë Bell, James Parks, Dana Gourrier...with Roth and Madsen almost re-living the g(l)ory days of their being Reservoir Dogs?), but the one who's been given a plum character with one of the strongest arcs ever put to film has to be that belonging to (his new male muse?) Walton 'Justified' 'Shield' Goggins, and I've been waiting for this actor to sink his teeth into a meaty role like the one he's been gifted by QT in this master-work. Demián Bichir, Bruce Dern (shame on you if his filmography is new: 'Nebraska', 'Last man standing', 'Silent Runnings', 'Coming home', 'After dark, my sweet', 'The cowboys' and many, many more....) and other new actors to QT's table also acquit themselves perfectly, with the first actor who's really good in almost anything he does, hidden behind one hell of a beard and accent (but is good nonetheless). <br/><br/>Another character with one hell of an arc belongs to one among a total of 4 female characters in the movie (at least the one with most run-time among them), enacted by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and this has to be one of the best performances this actress has ever given, in spite of the fact that her repertoire (not of late, sadly) has included some of the toughest female characters ever committed to film. She's more than up to this task, and completely owns every frame she's in, and due to the unpredictability of what she might do, even whenever she's with the mighty ensemble, our eyes stay riveted on her actions, kinda like waiting for the other shoe to drop, to describe the whole situation mildly.<br/><br/>The photography by Robert Richardson (Hugo, Inglourious Basterds, Shutter Island, Django unchained, Kill Bill, U Turn, A few good men, JFK, Platoon - for my money, the greatest living DOP we have, and I'm so looking forward to his upcoming work in Ben Affleck's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's 'Live by night') has to be some of the best ever committed to film, and wish this one had had an IMAX version of sorts ( that I'd got to watch the roadshow theatrical version sometime). This deserves multiple viewings, on the biggest screen there is. <br/><br/>Now, obviously, this is a QT movie, so it is not for those with weak stomachs. Seriously. Even the chopped version, since what's in your head, during those missing frames, might actually be worse than how it was actually filmed. I still do not know how it was actually filmed, and while that's not a good thing, I'm sure you get my drift. If ppl wanna judge this work of art based on the violence (and the language, and the threat of violence, and the feigned violence...) that they (get to) see, or not, on the big screen, obviously, they're welcome to, but, if that's their sole focus, they might just be missing the entire point of this subliminal work of QT's which, for all its obvious, and almost childishly gleeful pretentiousness (the title cards tout this being QT's 8th work...really, QT? Like we wouldn't know already?..anyhoo) ranks among the best he's ever done. Plus, all the racist slurs against both African-Americans and Latin-Americans seem, to me, to be intended to portray the period as it must have been, warts and all, though a case might be made for overuse of various slurs. Long story short, in my humble opinion, everything that is there in the flick seems intended to propel the narrative and not for any other self- effacing reason, though the case has been made by most QT haters that its the latter and not the former.<br/><br/>This one harks back to his writing for 'Inglourious Basterds', closer to that spiritually, than anything else QT has ever done, perhaps with a sprinkling of 'Django Unchained', which is still being underrated by most, especially since '12 years a slave' released in a neighborly fashion. However, I can't help feeling that he might have been in a hurry to wrap things up, a feeling I did not ever get during 'IB', perhaps since I watched that the way it was meant to be viewed, on glorious XD, show after show after show...."

","Yes, entertaining. I read a few reviews that call it dull, slow, boring and the like. It's not. Guys, go see Star Wars, this is not your movie.<br/><br/>It keeps you interested from start to finish. It could be no other way. It's by design, but you have to like the genre to begin with, which is not western, but Whodunnit. As such, it has more in common with ""Murder on the Orient Express"" than with ""The Searchers"". More of an Agatha Christie stage play than a John Wayne or Clint Eastwood flick.<br/><br/>Of course, that's not all. It's a Tarantino movie with all that implies: gory violence,racial slurs,brilliant dialogue...Yes, I said brilliant dialogue. Many around here might be expecting more ""royale with cheese"" type of stuff, which I guess by now must bore Tarantino to death. He explores themes like hate (it's called the HATEFUL eight, get it?), mistrust,justice,...And he does it intelligently and manages to increase tension with each passing minute.<br/><br/>The performances are exceptional. And what a cast. Kurt Russel in particular, but all of them shine. Jennifer Jason Leigh receives a well deserved Oscar nod. Some might not agree or might not understand how hers is a beautiful performance, but acting is reacting, and she gives a masterful lesson here, and in difficult conditions I might add.<br/><br/>I understand that if you were born in the US this film might get deeper under your skin, in a disturbing sense. Many could be bothered by the racial tension, the n-word, the Civil War theme and the way it's portrayed. However, I can't understand how anyone can say that Tarantino's ""black kicks white ass"" antics are offensive, because ""what if it was the other way round"". Has anyone around here seen ""12 years a slave""?<br/><br/>I realise it might be one of those ""love it or hate it"" movies.But don't let that bother you. Give it a try. If you hate it, fine. But if you love it, it's one of those you might want to see again and again."

","In no way shape or form is this in anyway a bad film. In fact far from it but, this truly shows Tarantino's fearlessness to touch on a seemingly controversial subject. Mostly considered what happens to one of the characters makes this a tough one to watch without closing your eyes. This is very brutal, even for a Tarantino film. However the first half is mainly build up and allows you to basically play a Tarantino style game of Clue. One thing that is outstanding in this film as is with all of Tarantino films is the dialog is like music to my ears, and when you get talented actors to perform those lines like Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell it makes the situation that much easier. Also, the cinematography was gorgeous to look I thought it might have been Roger Deakins, but it was a collaborator with Tarantino that being Robert Richardson, who does a marvelous job. The reason that I can't totally fall in love with this like Django Unchained is just the brutality isn't satisfying like in Django, I actually enjoyed it when someone got their head blown off, but in this again I don't mind it, its just kind of a head scratcher in terms of why he chose to beat up this one particular character who at one time thought we was rooting for. Maybe I need to watch it again to get a better understanding of the meaning behind the happenings. One last thing I need to say is bravo to the cast of this film. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins all do a wonderful job. And of course Tarantino is still one of the best directors of our generation. Now to grade this film.

","Finally Tarantino delivers us a real Western. Yet, ""The Hateful Eight"" is much more than just that. The multiple homages to that and to other genres are more than the wet dream of cinephiles, is the opportunity Tarantino takes advantage of to recreate the type of cinema that's hardly ever done anymore.<br/><br/>What was his singular cinematographic language in the 90's has almost become stereotypical nowadays, that's why he takes his particular subtleties (which to him can include blowing up heads) and includes them in a theatrical and operatic period piece. It's almost a literary type of cinema, that dares to take its extensive time and space to sufficiently develop its characters and story. It's a cinematographic novella in which its inevitable violence isn't just strong (or, even worse, unnecessary, like in some of other titles from his repertory), it's powerful, and gracefully it never overpowers the themes of justice, ethics, morality, race, gender and politics, that give this epic essential content. This is where ""12 Angry Men"" meets the first scene of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", with all which that could mean.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is magnificent; it isn't a tribute to great films, it is one."

Still, it is Tarantino, no doubt. His famous semi-paradox dialogs, camera, somewhat dirty ambient, a lot of swearing of course. And a great homage to western movies, mixed with detective genre. Russell is back. And his performance is really great. It seems that all of the crew did it in a so casual, effortless fashion. Madsen, Roth, Jackson - that's so tarantinous. J.J.

When I saw the ""western, black guy"" announcement, I thought ""Oh, no, another Django"", but I was wrong. This is (in my opinion, of course) better than Django."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","15","6 January 2016"," Audacious Tarantino western epic is bloody, but astonishingly engaging
","Quentin Tarantino began his career in the early 90s with the raw crime-thriller 'Reservoir Dogs', but it wasn't until his second film, the massively acclaimed black comedy 'Pulp Fiction' when he really took audiences nationwide by storm. After a string of widely popular films, with the exception of the grindhouse thriller 'Death Proof' which is in my opinion, his weakest film; this largely influential director takes a bold step into the western genre with this audacious western epic 'The Hateful Eight'. This film set in post-Civil War Wyoming, follows bounty hunter John Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), also known as ""The Hangman"", who travels the snowy lands on a stagecoach manned by six horses, to an old town of Red Rock to turn in a notorious murderer Daisy Domergue (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh). He encounters former Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who is carrying three dead bounties to turn in, and later Chris Mannix (played by Walton Goggins) who claims to be upcoming sheriff of Red Rock. When a wild blizzard hits, these people take shelter in an old cabin where they meet cowboy Joe Gage (played by Michael Madsen), English handyman Oswaldo Mobray (played by Tim Roth), old Mexican Bob (played by Damien Bichir), and former Civil War general Sandy Smithers (played by Bruce Dern). With everyone unfamiliar with each other, tension become increasingly heated when each of them revealed not to be who they say they are. <br/><br/>This film dealt with some significant issues during development. One of which in particular began when the script was unexpectedly leaked online. This originally prompted the frustrated Tarantino to cancel the project and instead, publish it into a novel. Eventually, the director overcame the frustration and moved on with the project; and the result was a highly entertaining western film shot in classic 70 mm cinematography. This film is shot using rare 70 mm Ultra Panavison camera-work which has not been used since the 1960s, with Khartoum (1966) being the last known film using his camera. What becomes of this unique cinematography is a luxury widescreen picture to a powerful view of the cabin in which serves almost entirely as the film's setting. With the film set in one room for a large portion of the time, it reduces the sense of claustrophobia.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino takes advantage of his typical filmmaking style in what maybe his boldest film yet. Filled with racially charged dialogue and colorful language, the film illustrates authentic racial tensions between the characters, and the concepts pays faith to the racial discrimination that ran rampant during the Civil War era and years after. Although set as a western epic, this film manages to squeeze a few elements of comedy in the mix, with the use of gallows humor that tends to shock, but at the same time, amuse the audiences. The dialogue is somewhat similar to the dialogue in 'Django Unchained' with its heavy and shameless use of the N-word, and is definitely enough to make some viewers uncomfortable and potentially turn them off. Those who have grown fans to Tarantino's previous works, however, will come with less shock. Now as the plot revolves around distinct characters and the tensions that arise between them, the film is very talky (even more so than 'Inglourious Basterds') and there are some lengthy conversations that drive the film for most of the first half. But thanks to the sharply written dialogue by Tarantino, the film moves a solid pace to where the three-hour runtime feels engaging and less of a boredom- fest. Then the second half, following a short intermission and overture, turns into a bloodbath. Scene after scene, this half features some gruesome violent scenes, some of which are a bit stomach- turning, with an intent of startling viewers, especially those who aren't used to Tarantino's style. The entire second half is where the plot takes a turn to a ""who done it"". During this time, viewers are dragged into shocking revelations by about the characters, which gradually heightens the suspense. Yes, this part does a feel like a homage of 'Reservoir Dogs', but at the same time, its surprisingly engaging.<br/><br/>With such a star-studded cast, viewers can surely root for some powerful performances, and as you might expect, these performances are tremendous. Samuel L. Jackson who is a veteran to Quentin Tarantino's works, gives what is probably his boldest performance since his career-defining role in 'Pulp Fiction'. Kurt Russell who plays the ruthless bounty hunter, is quite powerful in his rather shocking role. Although he played the sadistic stunt driver in the grindhouse flick 'Death Proof', it is nowhere near as memorable as his prickly character here. Jennifer Jason Leigh who is new face to Tarantino's work is quite fascinating, and by the second half, shockingly nasty. But this does not deny that she is quite engaging in her role as the only female in the ""hateful eight"". Tim Roth and Michael Madsen, collaborators in Tarantino's debut film ""Reservoir Dogs' are strong here, as so is Bruce Dern, Damien Bichir, and Walter Goggins who are also new faces. Along with these tour-de- force performances, is a shocking appearance of an actor who many may never have would be seen in a Tarantino picture; and I would rather not give him away. It is hard to say which actor would receive an Oscar nod since most of them (if not all) are quite memorable and dedicated to their roles.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a genuine demonstration that Quentin Tarantino still has the incredible directorial caliber he is known for today. Thanks to a decent screenplay, character writing, stellar performances, and a powerful direction; this earns a spot as one of the best films of the year, at least in my opinion. It is astonishingly entertaining and a must-see, especially for those who are Tarantino fanatics."
"The_Film_Cricket","8","3","16","5 January 2016"," The wages of sin is death . . .
","Picture in your mind the output of a Quentin Tarantino movie if it were written by Agatha Christie. Try and imagine ""Ten Little Indians"" wrapped in reams of Tarantino-style dialogue and splattered with buckets of blood and guts and there you have the idea of The Hateful Eight, a retro spaghetti western that's as brilliant as it is brutal. After 20 years, Tarantino is still the most creative filmmaker that we have, a director who mines cinema's past while making it all seem fresh and new. How well does it work? Let me put it this way, it was nice that when I finally tore myself away from Star Wars that Tarantino would be there waiting with one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is, essentially, a Bottle Movie. For three hours, it traps eight worthless human beings in a cabin in the midst of a blizzard of Biblical proportions and lets them do what despicable people do, especially when they all have guns. It opens staggeringly with the vision of a wooden stake carved into the image of Christ on the cross. If the Bible reminds us that the wages of sin is death, then the sinners at the center of this story should not be surprised by their fate.<br/><br/>The movie takes place somewhere in 19th century Wyoming at a time when the wounds of The Civil War are no longer bleeding, but the scars – emotionally and literally – still sting. In the midst of this blizzard we begin with a traveler and his companion riding a horse-drawn stagecoach to a place called Red Rock. The man is a bounty hunter named John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and the woman is his bounty, a beleaguered soul named Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Ruth never stops reminding us, or her, that she has a date with the hangman's noose.<br/><br/>Along the way Ruth's stagecoach comes across a wayward traveler, a fellow tracker named Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). Ruth recognizes Warren who was a highly respected Major from the Union Army. Legends of his exploits are as famous as they are infamous, but the most persistent is the legend that he carries a personal letter that he received from The Great Emancipator himself in his coat pocket – everyone wants to see it.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers ahead What happens along the way is far too complicated to completely explain here. Tarantino's characters are never just one thing; they have dimensions, histories, side notes, personal tics, sins, successes, and legions of enemies far and wide. The destination for these travelers is a place that might have been a rest stop on the way to damnation itself, a far-flung haberdashery with more amenities then these people probably deserve. What's waiting there brings tension all around: A charming Englishman named Mobray (Tim Roth), a quiet drunken gunslinger named Gage (Michael Madsen), a wet-behind-the-ears sheriff (Walter Goggins), a former Confederate General named Smithers (Bruce Dern), and a narrow-eyed Mexican stable man named Senor Bob (Damien Bicheir). All of these characters seem to know each other, if not personally then by reputation. One of the greatest achievements in this screenplay by Tarantino is that every character is given a full backstory, not quirks, not traits, a history. We learn not only their names, but their sins as well. Each has a story to tell, each has a mean-streak ten miles wide, and each will pay greatly for it.<br/><br/>Right away we sense that something is happening at this tiny haberdashery but we aren't exactly sure what. We can sense it the moment that the stagecoach arrives at the front door. There are clues and questions: Why is there are piece of candy on the floor? Why is one of the chairs covered in fur coats? Why does the Mexican stable man seem so distant? Why is the latch on the front door missing? It is Warren who pieces things together. He notices things that the others seem to overlook, and he who controls tries to control a situation that threatens to become a bloodbath. Little by little, piece by piece the mystery of this wayward store begins to reveals its mysteries. That leads to a great virtuoso scene with Sam Jackson at the center doing what he does best.<br/><br/>Much more of this story I cannot reveal. Much more of this story I could not reveal. It's so complex yet so approachable and so engaging. We're there every second even though 90% of the movie takes place in the same room. We're so interested in these people because Tarantino always makes them interesting. He creates a gaggle of horrible people who have done horrible things and watches them all get their comeuppance one by one. The story's sense of moral decay has put off many critics, but I won't go there. I feel that I'm looking at Tarantino's vision of Hell on Earth, a place so placid, forbidding and dark, and filled with nasty – yet, interesting characters – that deserve each other. This is one of the best films of the year."
"SerDarioTaranFulci","10","4","25","27 December 2015"," The best films experience of 2015
","Even though i had read the script, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This movie had more suspense and build up than any other Tarantino movie. I love how this film took its time to verbally and visually flesh out the characters and everything paid off in the end.The ending was also much better than the original script, and took me by surprise.<br/><br/>Anybody who wants a less stylized, subtle Tarantino flick will be very happy with this. I know many have not liked his post Jackie Brown films and this is, as some say ""a return to formula"". I love when Tarantino stylizes his movies, but it was a nice change. Even though he did back to back westerns, this film is completely different from Django. This movie is definitely not for the low brow fans of Tarantino who are just there for the fast paced violence. Although the end of the film is very violent, many people will be squirming in their seats.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of suspenseful, 3 hour 60s Italian westerns and Tarantino, this will be one of the best movie going experiences you will have in your life. Really hope QT finally gets the best director Oscar, he deserves it. Sam Jackson and Jenifer Jason Leigh both deserve to be nominated as well.<br/><br/>As for the 70mm experience, it was great to return to film and the sound quality was perfect. I absolutely hate digital projection,its pretty much a giant computer screen that someone presses play on. Not only that, but if we don't sit in the back row, my eyes hurt so bad afterwords and my girlfriend gets nauseous. Anyhow, we were given giant booklets with info on the film and its history once we entered. There were no previews or obnoxious advertisements, the film simply began. The overture was short, but very epic and Ennio's score was not his usual epic Spanish horns that QT has used many times in the past. The score was very tense and unnerving, which fit the film wonderfully. While I love his old stuff, you can tell he was going for something completely different. The intermission was silent for about 8 minutes, and then a song began to let people know it will be starting back up soon. I have not seen the theatrical version (cant wait too though) but I am guessing the narration once we returned will be altered because it had a ""when we last left our characters"" feel that wouldn't work in a movie without an intermission. <br/><br/>This was the best time I have ever had at the movies. I drove 4 hours to see it and it was completely worth it. I may just have to make a second trip. Tarantino once again has proved that he is the greatest director working today."
"kdiamond666","1","2","9","23 September 2019"," Typical Tarantino
","Even though Tarantino puts out some decent stuff, let's face it he's a 1 trick pony. Virtually every film he makes is a variation of 'I Spit on your Grave' & made for a Generation that wasn't around to see Exploitation movies when they first arrived. This movie is no different. I feel I might have mislabeled it as Typical Tarantino though. It's actually terrible. The fanboys are gonna love it no matter what. They'll ignore every overly contrived plot hole to get to the obligatory gratuitous violence. This movie is so bad Kurt Russell can't save it. This movie is so bad, that I stopped it when the narration came in mid movie because I thought the DVD had malfunctioned. That's not even an exaggeration. Kurt Russell carries this movie half way to greatness. You'll think my review is BS up until the Intermission, where Tarantino shows up to show hids true colors. Afterwards you'll be just like me, swearing that he made the entire thing because someone bet him he couldn't go an hour in a movie without showing an insane amount of violence. Ignore the raving Fanboy praises & Avoid this movie at all cost."

What I can't work out is the high rating.<br/><br/>I would rank this among the most overrated work yet from this director.Until now Deathproof and Inglorious vied for that honour but this is leagues ahead in every department.<br/><br/>Everyone by now knows the story and the premise of the movie. 8 hateful people in a room.<br/><br/>The pace was like "" molasses "", the unnecessary narration and the clumsy plot tell of the coffee were neither clever or imaginative. It was as if someone thought half way through the script they should hurriedly make sense of something.<br/><br/>Dern, Goggins and Russell were good with Roth turning into a Christoph Waltz impersonator, Lee just being manic, Jackson being Jackson and everyone else looking disinterested.<br/><br/>Semi political overtones and meaning lend nothing to the film least of all the totally hamfisted scene of Jackson walking a naked man through the snow.<br/><br/>Too long by half, juvenile dialogue and an assumption by the film makers that the public will be taken in by the directors name over the title.<br/><br/>On the plus side the scenery and the score were great.<br/><br/>It may be Tarantino's 8TH film. It's definitely his worst.<br/><br/>See it for yourself and be honest."
"rubenm","5","2","9","24 January 2016"," Repetitive instead of provocative
","Quentin Tarantino has made so many great films that it's hard to accept he can make a weak one. Tarantino, like Hitchcock, has become one of those mythical directors who will be admired for anything they do. The standards by which their work is judged, are different form those of other, more ordinary directors.<br/><br/>The truth is, 'The Hateful Eight' is just not as good as most of his other films. It's too long, there's not enough suspense, there's too much of Tarantino's trademark gory violence, and it just lacks the magic touch that make his other films stand out.<br/><br/>The story is rather straightforward. Eight different tough guys are locked up in a hut during a blizzard. They distrust each other and end up shooting and killing. The characters are predictable, the shootouts made me yawn and the snappy dialogue is missing. There is only one surprising moment, with a subsequent flashback to explain it, but the buildup is just so slow and boring that this temporary source of excitement doesn't compensate for the tedious and uninteresting chapters preceding it.<br/><br/>After eight films, we know that Tarantino can get away with anything. He doesn't have to show it one more time. The splattering brains, the sadistic violence, the abundant use of the word n****r: we've seen it all before. And now, it's boring instead of daring, repetitive instead of provocative."

","Just how bad is the Hateful Eight!<br/><br/>Watching the film I was constantly waiting for a moment of genius<br/><br/>And what a wait! If there is an art of making a movie concise QT doesn't have it.<br/><br/>The running time of over 3 hours is close to LOTR territory; but not an adventure to save Middle Earth but a little trek through a blizzard and a B&B stopover.<br/><br/>***spoiler alert***<br/><br/>The first third of the plot is borrowed heavily from Chicken Licken. <br/><br/>***spoiler over***<br/><br/>That is kind of the level we are talking about. The dialogue is often pantomime style. You almost expect someone to shout 'he's behind you'; except here its accompanied by one of the Ugly Sisters blowing someones brains out. <br/><br/>Yes, obviously it comes with QT's usual level of grotesque nonchalant violence, constant use of the N word and cheap sexual references. Does this make him cool and irreverent or just plain childish. <br/><br/>The plot also contains a who dunnit scene and a twist that would have Christie and Hitchcock turning in their graves.<br/><br/>Yes the movie is well shot and produced but so is a Miley Cyrus music video. <br/><br/>Enjoyablebut not special."
"stefan-brus1993","10","2","9","23 January 2016"," Thank you!
","If there is one thing that has been made clear in the last 25 years of cinema that is that Quentin Tarantino NEVER disappoints. Reason why I am typing this further is because of IMDb and their 10 lines of text necessity, not that i don't like it, I very much enjoy it, it's just that you need not the introduction to see Tarantino film and he has made sure of that through these 25 years. I must admit that i was a bit worried at the beginning of the film, but that was probably because i saw every interview and every piece of information available online and most of them were centered around the couch scene, but i must SAY that I have not SEEN the leaked script mainly because I did not want to ruin my experience of the movie and I have realized that watching the interviews before watching the movie was a bad idea. Story enfolded extremely well throughout the whole movie and every scene was amazing and on the spot. The most likable moment of the film was Major Marquis Warren lying on the bed with his hands on his ""crotch"" and laughing when Sheriff Chris Mannix refused Daisy's proposition. That could have been an Oscar nomination but I am not the one to nominate. Thank you for reading."
"assassinelena","6","2","9","21 January 2016"," Disappointing
","Greetings my friends. First of all I've rated 6 just for Kurt Russel. I have been a fan and follower of QT ever since I can remember, no need to mention the movies I have been waiting this particular one with great hope. After been informed about the cast, the plot and of course the trailer. Thought it will be his masterpiece. In addition, in one of his interviews QT had stated that ALL of his followers would be amazed of his brilliance. Anyway, what the freaking hell was that. Unfortunately, all my depression sessions went down the drain (yeah he did that). After listening the first minutes of the dialogue inside the wagon I started thinking how many are they going to get inside. I started worrying if there are going to be 8 of them. But then I realized that there is no room for 8 people in the wagon. The torture continued inside the cabin with the door. (You have to kick it. KICK IT). After this happening over and over again I took my first anxiety pill. And then we had: dialogue for no reason, blood for no reason the N word for no reason. We had a poor grandpa sitting in a rocking chair verbally abused and Samuel L. Jackson talking about his little Johnny for no reason. Papers been exchanged all the time about the identity of everyone over and over again. The magnificent dialogue about the letter of Lincoln. It feels like that QT saw a dream and he thought about filming it, being totally incoherent. To conclude, the only thing I felt like doing is to taste the Mini's stew. Was it that good? Please someone make a parody out of it, I smell money. At some point I felt like he was mocking me. He wasn't the QT I knew. Ps this is my first review. He made me write a REVIEW. And from what you have read above for no good reasons."
"soccerspud","6","2","9","19 January 2016"," Only Fanboys will love it
","If you want to watch a 90 minute movie morph into a 3 hour movie with scenes it doesn't need, poorly developed characters and a cast that doesn't meld together well at all.

This is for you, oh, and Fanboys, you'll rave this is Just Tarantino"" and ""You just don't understand.""<br/><br/>The dialogue was lacking, the entire time. There were a couple quotable lines, but for it being a 3 hour movie, it lacked. My favorite actor in the entire movie Walton Goggins is written much better in the FX TV series Justified, and I was disappointed with the sheer inability for Tarantino to bring this amazing actor, and maybe even character, to life.<br/><br/>The plot had legs, I mean, how can you go wrong with a 21st Century take on 10 Little Indians, but the big reveal is revealed far too early. The beginning took too long to develop, and when it did, it finished way to quickly, but somehow leaving an hour 'til the movie ends. <br/><br/>I love Tarantino, his work is some of the best in the business. However, this time, I feel, like he wrote past his reputation and we just need to call it as we see it. Tarantino dropped the ball, and with a 44 million budget he has(d) no excuses."
"temrok9","6","3","17","9 January 2016"," Pointless, as always
","With so many reviews already, I guess there aren't many chances one will read this one;despite the fact I found many things in other reviews I agree with, I wanted to put down some thoughts of mine regarding the cinema of Tarantino.From my rating, it is obvious that I am not among those who loved the movie;yet, I think we should take into account what he does in a general context which may explain the reason he enjoys a cult status and has so many devoted fans.To begin with, the cinema of Tarantino reflects a certain personality(of himself), it is recognizable at once, the way one immediately recognizes a Woody Allen movie;even the actors speak in the same way, not to mention the things they say and the pose they take to say them. To me, the dialogues seem pointless very often;I do not believe that phrases, even in a movie, serve only as information vehicles, but I do believe that they must bare a certain load of meaning, so I find small talk(as in some praised Linklater movies), or pose-talk(as in Tarantino movies) boring. I admit that every movie of his has a certain charm, and this is also true about these Hateful Eight, but this charm is based mainly on the concept(the basic idea) and his very interesting mixing of actors, music and other film memories in his own way that is sick with verbalism and pointless violence.When I say pointless violence, I must stress the fact that I do not object to it morally, and that I like a lot of movies who go for the gore, even having fun with it , as Tarantino does, but somehow in his films(in this one, for instance)he seems to do it in an exhibitionist way, not serving the purpose of the film, but trying to show off, to convince everyone, including himself, that he is clever. This way, his movies retain the personality I mentioned but they never have any meaning at all.What I mean by the word meaning is not some great statement about life(we hear many such things during his movies)-since I declare myself a fan of b-movies- but a certain attitude towards life every piece of art(adventure movies too) holds.From time to time, there are glimpses of meaningfulness, but the general feeling is of the narcissistic enjoyment of a supposed meta-look. What is the purpose of the 70 mm, for example, in this movie, since there is no meaningful use of it(watch the movie of John Carpenter or Robert Altman to see what cinemascope means)?So, was it fun?to me, so and so;sometimes I got bored, sometimes a little engaged. I guess others found it more suitable to their taste(and that is in no way objectable).Tarantino has a certain place in the contemporary cinema, and this movie is no stranger to this place.Every time I say to myself I won't watch his next movie, but every time I do."

","Only a Great Director (TM.) would have the gall to make a movie like this. If this were a book it would be a short story or a novella at most. As a Tarantino movie it's three hours long.<br/><br/>The movie also attempts to be a mystery, and being this unwound is fatal to it. Mysteries need to be taut, so you pay attention. There were times during ""The Hateful Eight"" where I stopped watching.<br/><br/>I'll never know what happened to Tarantino's ability to write good dialogue. ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were nothing but quotable lines. Where were the quotable lines in any of the movies he has made since? How many lines can you remember from them, if any at all?<br/><br/>Tarantino made a great movie with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", and an absolutely appalling one with ""Death Proof"". ""The Hateful Eight"" is like the bridge between the two. It may not have memorable dialogue or characters, but at least they don't prattle on about god-knows-what for an hour before getting killed, only to introduce a bunch more vacuous motor-mouths who do the same thing.<br/><br/>It's still very well made, well acted, and feels like a lesser work from a great director."

Today I rewatched it and I noticed the mention to Red Apple Tobacco that is also mentioned in his latest movie, just showing how much effort he puts in his writing and that he wants to connect his movies by some way.<br/><br/>If it bothers you the cursing, racism and violence in this movie maybe you should just go and watch Disney productions because without all of those aspects this wouldn't have portrayed the reality of that time as faithful as it did. Tarantino is never afraid of portraying reality as it is and that's why I said that this is not for everyone because a lot of people can't deal with reality. And let's not forget that all of those things and the purpose to make various social critics. This movie isn't underrated because it's bad but because of the sensibility of people.

Whenever things start to get boring new information is revealed to us.

","This is a fine piece of storytelling - a mystery, western, and political drama - all artfully melded together by a seasoned crew and talented actors.<br/><br/>The action is set in antebellum Wyoming, in the heart of a raging blizzard, in a frontier bar. Setting is very important here.<br/><br/>The period is meaningful for the political currents that flow in nearly all the characters. Feelings about the American civil war are very up-front, with complicit atrocity present in nearly all the characters. The war brought out horrible things in these people, and we see how they deal with that shared knowledge, both personally and to each other."
"nicolelow-09773","10","1","3","18 December 2019"," The Hateful Eight
","Maybe you noticed that Tarantino shares much in common with Guns frontman Axl Rose? I'm noticed. Both came into immediate fame and large successes early in their career (Tarantino with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Rose with Appetite for Destruction), met widespread acclaim and fandom across the globe, and had personalities that stretched way out their respective industries that often earned them a streak of notoriety in the press.<br/><br/>
But Tarantino and Rose differ on how they followed their instant celebrity. While Rose alienated his band mates and friends and turned Guns N' Roses into a parody of itself, Tarantino has bolstered himself with a series of equally originally and satisfying pictures that varied between genre and style. So even though The Hateful Eight on the surface may appear self-indulgent, with its extravagant promotion of its 70 mm projection, notorious production issues, and high profile staff (which includes a score from legendary composer Ennio Morricone), Chinese Democracy it is not. In fact, The Hateful Eight is arguably the most exciting and rigorous movie Tarantino has done since his magnum opus Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>As with Tarantino's previous picture, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight is a western, though set in the snowy fields of Wyoming in the 1870s instead of the pre-Civil War era south. Bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) has just caught notorious murderer Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and is taking her to Red Rock to be hung, accompanied by an ex-slave turned into Northern Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and incoming Red Rock sheriff and former confederate Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). After getting hit by a blizzard, the group arrives at a cabin known as Minnie's Haberdashery, met by its gruff Mexican caretaker Bob (Demian Bichir), cunning hangman Oswaldo (Tim Roth), southern General Smithers (Bruce Dern), and stern cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen). After meeting all of these peculiar characters, John suspects that one of these men is in cahoots with Daisy and is determined to protect his bounty no matter the cost.<br/><br/>With its claustrophobic setting and eccentric ensemble, The Hateful Eight recalls the starkness of Tarantino's raw debut Reservoir Dogs. While that comparison is completely valid, particularly in the picture's structure, The Hateful Eight doesn't feel like a remake and makes much use of its western scenery to expand upon Dogs' setting. The snowy plains of Wyoming, shot in actuality in the Colorado Rockies, adds extra tension to the limited backdrop, and the theme of racism comes central into play. Django Unchained dealt with this by satirizing the Blaxploitation genre to present a rewriting of history through its eponymous protagonist's revenge against slave owners. In The Hateful Eight, Warren fills Django's shoes but comes in constant odds with the white men surrounding him, particularly with his background for killing confederate soldiers as well as having a letter from Abraham Lincoln, earning the ire of Mannix and General Smithers. Whereas Django lived an ultimate fantasy, Warren settles with having to put up with oppression during the post-Civil War era, learning to deal with system racism and n-bombs. Jackson has rarely been in fine as form as Warren, giving him the spunk of Jules while playing into his bitterness.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is similarly magnificent, in particular Walton Goggins. Goggins has long shined on TV in roles in Justified and The Shield, and is simply in top-notch form as Mannix. He portrays the sheriff as a boisterous and seemingly racist man yet reveals a different side of the character in the second half of the picture as a more nuanced figure than I thought beforehand. Goggins' interactions with Jackson make up for many of The Hateful Eight's best scenes and he deserves multiple accolades for his performance.<br/><br/>The selling point of The Hateful Eight though is undeniably its cinematography. Filmed in 65 mm film using the same lens that captured the mighty chariot sequence in Ben Hur, The Hateful Eight is one of the most gorgeous theatrical experiences I've ever seen. Robert Richardson's photography beautifully captures Wyoming's rugged setting in a way digital cinematography can't tape. Every detail, from the snowflakes to Russell's muttonchops, is recorded through Richardson's elegant film, and the crispness of the images made me feel as if I was watching a modern day Sergio Leone movie, further emphasized by Leone's collaborator Morricone providing a gigantic Stravinsky-esque score. Tarantino's decision to project The Hateful Eight in 70 mm may appear as a haughty one but displays the picture in the greatest form possible. With the screening's."

"davidmvining","10","1","3","25 November 2019"," Tarantino's best film
","A group of people are stuck in a small place in the middle of a blizzard that keeps them from escaping all while questions of who is actually who they say are abound, but enough about The Thing.<br/><br/>Out of all of Tarantino's movies, this is the one that feels most like a novel. I know people equate it to a stage play, mostly because of the amount of dialogue and the limited location, but I feel like it has more in common with a literary creation than a theatrical one. Scenes play out at the kind of pace that you might expect from a book. They're steady and about building character more than anything else. I love luxuriating in these long passages as we figure out who the people in Minnie's Haberdashery are.<br/><br/>The movie begins some miles away, though. On a mountain road, a black bounty hunter sits alone on a trio of corpses he's trying to bring into Red Rock, Wyoming. A stagecoach drives up carrying another bounty hunter and his live bounty, one Daisy Domergue, wanted for murder with a price of $10,000 on her head, dead or alive. The two bounty hunters come to an agreement to allow Marquis Warren onto the stagecoach as long as he helps protect John Ruth's bounty. The interactions between all three range from outright hostile (between Ruth and Domergue) to cautiously respectful (between Warren and Ruth). Warren eventually shares his Lincoln letter with Ruth, a letter written to Warren directly from Abraham Lincoln from when Warren was a cavalry officer during the Civil War.<br/><br/>As they get closer to Red Rock, they pick up Chris Mannix who says that he's the new sheriff of Red Rock, but with the blizzard bearing down on them, they can't make it to Red Rock. They're going to make it to the only place between them and the town, a haberdashery run by Minnie and Sweet Dave, neither of whom are actually there when the three arrive to find the door broken and won't shut all the way without nailing in some boards to keep it in place. Something is obviously wrong.<br/><br/>Tarantino, though, doesn't press that feeling just yet. He's got three hours to tell his story, and he's not in a huge rush to get to the end. The first half of the movie is really just scenes of getting to know the hateful eight characters. Aside from the four in the carriage, there's also the Confederate general, the cowboy, the Mexican, and the little man. There are connections between some of them that get dug out. Mannix's father was an officer in the Confederacy, and General Smithers had heard of him while Mannix had certainly heard of Smithers and revered him. Warren and Smithers had actually shared a battlefield at Baton Rouge, a battle noted by Warren for the savagery the Confederate army had exhibited towards the black Union soldiers, but Mannix, as the representative of the law, isn't going to allow Warren to cold-bloodedly murder Smithers no matter what Smithers ordered in the war, especially in the service of the Confederacy. So, Warren places a revolver next to Smithers in his chair and then proceeds to tell Smithers a tale about how Warren had met Smithers' son when he had come looking to collect on the bounty the Confederacy had placed on Warren's head. I'm fairly convinced that Warren lies extensively through the whole story (Tarantino offers it narrative credence by showing it occurring on screen instead of just allowing Warren to tell it), and it is enough to get Smithers to reach for the gun. Warren, though, is too fast and kills Smithers before Smithers can do the same to him.<br/><br/>So begins the death at Minnie's Haberdashery, an act of vengeful murder masked as self-defense.<br/><br/>That murder, though, is of a vastly different character as what comes next. It serves as a distraction for the poisoning of the coffee pot which ends up killing Ruth and their driver O.B. (not one of the hateful eight, apparently). These killings are done to weed out those not in on the rescue of Daisy, and suspicion, as well as tension, suddenly shoots up. We, as the audience, have known that something was wrong since they first arrived at the remote haberdashery, but we could never quite put our own fingers on it. Warren, though, has an inkling. He's been the Minnie's before, and he points out the inconsistencies, executing one of the three remaining of the four he had found upon first arriving (Mexican Bob). Gunplay ensues including shots fired from under the floorboards.<br/><br/>Tarantino then does a signature jump backwards in time for a chapter dedicated to the events leading up to the beginning of the film. We see four men jump from a stagecoach earlier in the day. They settle in, we get to know the people already there including Minnie and Sweet Dave, before the four unleash hell and kill everyone except General Smithers whom they keep alive for character and to help sell the reality of the situation without Minnie around. One of these four is Jody, Daisy's brother, there to save his sister from the hangman.<br/><br/>Jumping back to the present, we see how the rest plays out, and it's apocalyptic in feel. People die, blood gets splattered (especially in Daisy's face), and everyone's bleeding out. It seems like the movie has embraced nihilism completely, but I would disagree. Mannix and Warren are the last two alive, and they're both dying. Mannix asks to see this Lincoln letter that Warren has, and Warren hands it over. Reading it over, we recall an earlier scene where Mannix called the letter a complete fiction and Warren copped to it, but in their final moments, Mannix finds great solace in those invented words from Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>Like in much of Tarantino's work, there's an element of the metanarrative at play, and here, in The Hateful Eight, it demonstrates the power of fiction to move us. Warren probably invents the story of Smithers' son's death, and it moves the old general enough to throw the rest of his life away. Daisy swears to a story of fifteen more members of her gang waiting to come and kill Mannix and Warren if they don't let Daisy go, and the story has an effect for a while. And finally the letter that Mannix has called a fake (which he crumples up and tosses aside after reading it) soothes him in his final moments after the worst day of his life.<br/><br/>So, why do I love this movie so much? I remember off handedly mentioning the fact that I think that this is Tarantino's best movie to some people, thinking the comment was uncontroversial, and I was completely unprepared for the blowback. Some people hate this movie as much as the characters hate each other, and I honestly do not see why. Yes, the movie is slow, but it's slow in much the same way Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained, and Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood are slow. All four movies take their time to build characters and set the scene before throwing their characters at each other to bloody result. The characters here are awful people, but so are most of the characters in all of Tarantino's movies. I love hearing them talk, egging each other on, and even beginning to respect each other. I love the 70mm cinematography, even if most of it is relegated to the haberdashery. I love the score from Morricone. The performances are great. The Hateful Eight creates a world that I simply love to luxuriate in. I simply love it as a film, and yes, I do think it's Tarantino's best work."

This movie has a slow pace but that was a not a problem for me as Tarantino delivers dialogues that will make time pass by very fast.

","I just watched ""The Hateful Eight"" for the first time last night. I'm a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and I think no director can make a movie quite like he can. Having said all that, I found ""The Hateful Eight"" to be a bit of a letdown because the first hour is so slow to get moving and then when it picks up in the second hour, it's better but there isn't a lot of memorable moments.<br/><br/>Here's a brief look<br/><br/>-Samuel L Jackson is a bounty hunter transporting dead criminals in the middle of a blizzard and then runs into a stagecoach that has another bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) transporting a rebel prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged. Later on, they meet an outlaw (Walton Goggins) who just became the town sheriff.<br/><br/>-Then they take shelter in a general store where the owners are nowhere to be found but they find four more strangers all with a secret. Among them are Bruce Dern as a former General, Michael Madsen as a suspicious cowboy and Tim Roth as the town hangman.<br/><br/>After they're all introduced, something happens and it turns into a whodunnit/stage play.<br/><br/>My basic problems with this movie are as follows
-There are scenes that just happen and there isn't a whole lot of back story to them
-This movie has double the amount of N-words as ""Django Unchained"". The big difference being Tarantino wanted to depict the brutal subject of slavery so, while I don't condone the word, I felt it made sense for ""Django"". Here, I felt they were saying it just to say it so it was really unnecessary.
-Every other scene involves Jennifer Jason Leigh getting punched in the face.
-Lastly, there's a sight gag that involves the door being too hard to open. It was funny the first couple times but it just kept going and it had nowhere else to go.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people loved it but compared to his other movies, I found it disappointing."

I'm saying this because if you expect a beginning with a lot of action, like Django, it won't happen. Nevertheless, there is not a single reason why that should be something bad and it isn't. And to end this quick introduction, Tarantino delivers once again.<br/><br/>Tarantino follows the same structure he's used before but his style did change a lot for this movie. It is interesting as it gets and you will definitely not get bored with this (unless you're expecting an-Inglorious Basterds amount of violence which is why I mentioned the first thing). There is quite an amazing deepness that we get of the main characters and their stories. Tarantino also likes to get to a specific time in history and represent everything about it, the social and cultural aspects, and he does it again in here. And the violence does get screen time, don't worry, but it is in just the right amount to build tension and also to not make the story longer than it should be.<br/><br/>Quite an amazing movie, I totally recommend it.

","Somehow this Tarantino flick got me bored. And that is really the first time EVER that I got bored at a Tarantino movie. The masses seemed to love it though. The worse Tarantino's pictures seem to get, the more tickets he is selling at the box office. The average western fan will probably like this western anyway, because it does press all the right buttons that need to be pressed to please the audiences that like westerns. For a diehard Tarantino fan like me however, this movie is his worst ever.<br/><br/>Tarantino often has said he will only make 10 movies in his entire carreer. This was nr. 8. After nr. 10 he promised that he will retire and start making theatre plays only. I do think Tarantino has got the talent to make another brilliant movie, but if not I hope he will stick to his own promise and retire pretty soon.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight originally was meant to be a theatre play and it would have fared better if it had indeed become a theatre play, because the dialogues are more suitable for a theatre than for a movie. The dialogues and scenes are incredibly long drawn and slow, without much change of scenery. Somehow these theatre play dialogues feel unsuited to be transformed to a movie format. For the first time ever I got bored at a Tarantino movie! Not a great record.<br/><br/>Fortunately Tarantino will return to the gangster genre with his next movie. I am in dire need of another good Tarantino movie after this slowburning boring theatreplay mess..."
"blademan-95603","4","1","3","5 March 2019"," Thanks to John Carpenter By Way of Howard Hawks
","Tarantino's films have always been highly derivative, with in his case, a particularly powerful influence from the horror, gangster, action, Science Fiction and even Kung Fu genera films (many of them trashy) put out during the 70s and 80s... due in large part to his more than usual exposure acquired (as he seemed to believe that recommendations were part of his job), while working as a video store clerk during that era.
He has said as much himself, many times, being uncommonly open and honest about it, while even giving specific credit to many of the individual films and directors, by name, who and which were directly inspirational.
In other words the ones he stole from.
Who in their turn, may have stolen or been stolen from somebody else, while perhaps being less honest about it. Hey, which every writer director film maker and studio does as a matter of routine, whether by repeatedly pumping out some formula in film after film, or in cases where the theft is so obvious it can't be disguised, perhaps referring to an homage, or bereft of any other idea, in complete unmitigated purloinment even going so far as to use the same title (done all too often, and badly)? They call it a remake.
And I believe when you look at this latest film offering, and think about it, and if you're at all familiar with the efforts of John Carpenter who himself, much like Tarantino, was strongly influenced by the work of others, particularly Hitchcock, almost to the point of parody in a couple of instances... you'll see his remake version of Howard Hawks's (a director famous for having twice remade versions of one of his own films)* classic Sci-Fi offering of the early 50s, ""The Thing"". With Tarentino even going so far as to cast the main protagonist in that classic re-make of a classic, Kurt Russell, as one of the primary characters in this not exactly a remake but close enough to the Carpenter version to almost call it so.
I could go on and make a case for this comparison, and if I were a professional reviewer I would of course be obliged to, but I think I'm so right about this observation, that my making the connection here to anyone familiar with those films if they didn't catch it themselves, will see the strong obvious undeniable parallels and striking similarities right away.<br/><br/>* ""Rio Bravo"" becoming ""El Dorado"" being transformed as ""Rio Lobo"" all with John Wayne."
"ludzureklamas","9","1","3","20 February 2019"," Tarantino being himself. Just as he should
","A lot of the criticism aimed at this film seems to be based on the fact that it's long, tedious and relies too much on dialogue. But that's the thing about Tarantino - his films have always been wordy and dialogue-heavy. Think of all the non-stop banter in Pulp Fiction and Reservoir dogs, all the verbal flourishes in Inglorious Basterds and even Kill Bill. That's what makes him special. His writing is just as showy and over-the-top as his sense of humour and action sequences, that's what sets him apart from the rest of the crowd.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight has dialogue in spades, but not for a single moment did I find it boring or redundant. Excessive, certainly, but that's the whole point. I felt that it was used masterfully in order to build character and maintain suspense. By the end of the picture my feelings for the characters were so contradictory that it took about too days to process them. And when it comes to writing and acting, I consider this effect a job exceptionally well done.<br/><br/>As for the generous 3+ hour screen time, it seems a bit misguided to bash a film for it in the day and age when people have no problem binging through a season or two of TV in a single night. What would happen if The Hateful Eight was 1.5 or 2 hours long? Could it tell the same story in an efficient manner? Most definitely. But is filmmaking really only about efficiency? Would it have the same sense of time and place, the same sense of character and isolation? I seriously doubt it.<br/><br/>The only thing that stuck out for me was that the acting looked a bit stiff in the first chapter, but that's pretty much it. Everything else - the cinematography, the pacing, the story, Morricone's soundtrack - was spot on. All things considered, this is definitely one of my favorite Tarantino films out there."

","(No Spoilers) The eighth film by Tarantino, and he's still going strong with another really good movie. However I do have to say I was a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me get started with the positives of this movie. Basically everything is good to great until I get to some of the story elements. The cinematography is great, the dialogue between characters is great, the acting is great, the score is really great, I mean it's a very well made movie. There really isn't much to complain about except some tiny nitpicks. Seriously though, the actors and the dialogue between them is always great in Tarantino movies, they have some genuinely great and thought provoking lines, and then some seriously hilarious lines.<br/><br/>Now onto the story, with one of my biggest problem, the pacing, and basically most of the 1st act of the movie. We spend about an hour in a stagecoach, and while the initial set up is needed, it's way too long. I mean it's barely that important to the story apart from the set up. It honestly starts to drag a lot till we get to the main part of the movie. Once were at the cabin Is when stuff starts to really pick up. Honestly for the first half of the movie I didn't really know what the plot of the movie was, it was only till around half way into the second act where I got it.<br/><br/>The second act is when we get introduced to the other characters in the cabin which are all great. We basically get a murder mystery plot. I loved that section of the movie, but I feel like it could've used more time there. I mean the main mystery is resolved pretty quickly. I really like how this movie isn't linear showing you parts in different times, however there was this one section that should've maybe been placed later on in the movie. It was fine where it was, but I felt like having it that early on kinda ruins some of the suspense. I mean if I'm being honest I did see some of the twists coming, and while most of them are good, there are a few that don't really matter. For the most part though the though this movie was pretty unpredictable.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is the movie just is too long, and doesn't focus enough on the best parts. A lot of the sequences feel like they could've been resolved quicker, and others feel like they were resolved too quick. Now I'm not someone who gets bored that easily with long movies, I love slow burns, but this just focuses on the wrong things. Not to say that those sequences are bad, not at all, but I just feel like it could've been so much better than it was.<br/><br/>Overall I really did still enjoy this movie. All the actors do fantastic jobs, and the character interactions are just too enjoyable. There's some great thought provoking lines, which I wish they focused a little more on. The characters were just very well written. It gets political in some moments, and while I do think there are some good moments with it, I feel like they went to far in some areas. Regardless of that the technical aspects are just great like always. I especially loved the soundtrack. I just really enjoyed this movie, but I can't ignore that some of the moments needed more time, and some of the moments dragged on for too long.<br/><br/>8/10"

During the groups stay at the Colorado stagecoach lodge, a story begins to unfold with conflict among the characters that involves many metaphors, nonlinear story telling moments, and even a mysterious poisoning. Samuel L. Jackson playing Major Marquis Warren a civil war veteran, who was pen pals with president Lincoln, introduces the first of many life ending conflicts with General Sandy Smithers portrayed by Bruce Dern after murdering his son in a form self-justified life preservation when hunted by the generals son for a bounty. As the story continues to unfold the viewer continues to learn more and more about Kurt Russell's character John Ruth and his bounty on Daisy Domergue played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Soon information is revealed to us that Daisy has refuge at this particular stagecoach lodge. Flashing backing in time we learn that her brother Jody Domergue portrayed by Channing Tatum, has taken over Minnie's lodge in order to save his sister from the hangman Oswaldo Mobary played by Tim Roth; telling us that the characters we have met, are not truly who they claim to be. As the story continues to unfold we learn how the scene has been set for John's success to free his sister and the true nature of each and every character that we meet in the Colorado lodge. The hateful eight is a story that focus on characters and their development as the story is told. The film shows that people are not always what they tell you they are, nor what they seem they are. Even towards the last minutes of the film we end with a metaphoric resolve of the death of Daisy Domergue we see the sheriff hang our main protagonist as we think she is going to live, for the last time in the film showing us people and their paths are not what we always think they are going to be."

"michaljanik","1","1","3","20 May 2018"," The Hateful Eight review
","As I was leaving a movie theatre, I did not know if I have been to a cinema or a butchery. The last film of Quentin Tarantino is incredibly brutal. In fact it is all about killing and nothing else. In addition it lasts as many as three hours and seven minutes.
 To begin with, I will discuss the plot. The eight of bad people meet accidentally in tiny roadside inn. Some of them are criminals, the others are head-hunters. As a result of a terrible snowstorm they are all stuck. Soon they start to kill each other. Awful. That is the plot.
 The movie does not differ much from others of Tarantino. It got some top prizes like an Oscar. Main characters are played by some famous actors. The soundtrack was composed by Ennio Morricone. The Hateful Eight is the first western, since Sergio Leone's productions, that has been decorated with his music.
 All in all, the motion picture is definitely not worth watching for the reason that there is nothing pretty about it. Moreover, even if there was any secret message between the lines, it is impossible to get it because of overwhelming brutality of the composition. I would not recommend it to anyone, even my worst enemies."

","Just plot alone and the cinematography (the wide screen shots are amazing and brain seared) were well worth the price then throw in the acting and you've one hell of a film. There were indeed sequences (one in particular) that were really sadistic and unnecessary, from my perspective, but all in all this just may be Tarantino's best. A Tarantino film is an unforgettable experience despite, perhaps, wanting to put particular scenes out of one's mind. Think how many Tarantino written and directed scenes that easily float to the top of your consciousness (I've dozens) and you realize this guy knows his craft and is a master of his craft! I wouldn't want a child to see this as it's far too graphic for an impressionable mind but I'm glad I saw it (I think)!"

"jpeterseni","9","1","3","20 November 2017"," Can't Fathom How Anyone Would Consider This Less Than A 7/10
","I have seen this movie 5 times now and have decided it is time to take to the Internet to defend it. Even though the movie has a high rating for this site 7.8/10... I find it appalling all of the political comments from people that don't understand what makes a good film and giving it a negative review.<br/><br/>The locale is in the 1800's for crying out loud. This is a period piece and it is not 2015. Grow some thicker skin or stick to Disney movies... why are you even watching a Tarantino film if you think this world is all pixie dust and fairy tales? It is time to face a dash of reality.<br/><br/>On to the review: <br/><br/>This film has a magic about it that captures the terrible winter seasons in Wyoming. My girlfriend and I have made this a tradition to watch at the start of winter. Tarantino has a knack for setting up the location and Haberdashery that by the end of the movie you haven't even realized it has been set in one room most of the time. It is just that immersive. You will feel like you are there, spending time by the cozy fire after braving a terrible Wyoming blizzard and enjoying a freshly brewed cup of the Haberdasheries coffee.<br/><br/>Regarding the length, It may be long but it is certainly engaging. The reviewers calling this movie ""boring"". Sorry to break this to you, but you have awful taste. The dialogue between the Hateful Eight is a constant romp. Each syllable oozes with entertainment, in part, due to the great performances of the entire cast.<br/><br/>The plot is also a gem that somehow manages to keep you on your toes, trying to figure out each character's motives and end game scenarios. The only gripe I have is I wish there was a bit more backstory included with the eight. Although, it does a decent job for most of the characters. By the end, I was hoping to have a bit more light shed on a few of them.<br/><br/>As far as Tarantino films go, this one is unique and a welcome addition to the family and on of my favorites."

","Despite being a whopping three hours long, this film does not really bore me at all. Which was one of the things that scare me the most before I saw it. I really like how the movie was not afraid to show the racist stuff in the time period such as the word N igger (I put that space in there to make it allowed). I also like how all of the characters perform in there characters and the music was actually really good but it was quite loud to listen to on netflix. I also like all of the references that they make to stuff such as Mary Todd and Lincoln as well as the Civil War. And the effects of the film weren't really in your face and doesn't take away from the viewing. The only problem to some people but it wasn't for me is all the racist stuff, but honestly it doesn't really bother me at all."
"farcryfolk","Null","1","3","19 August 2017"," I'm positive I'm bored
","This movie should have been Tarantino's foray into horror. If only!! I know some fans will disagree, but this movie was incredibly boring. Good acting. Good film making. Dialogue is interesting. But what would have made this movie a complete change of pace is if all these dangerous characters meet up in the first hour and in the second hour they find out they are holed up in a place that has a bloody history, maybe a twisted haunting or maybe even some kind of wendigo or something sinister that makes itself known and how it tries to get in there at different times. Slowly they all go crazy during this ordeal. In between the horror and the suspense scenes you have your trademark Tarantino dialogue that sets these characters. Yeah. All that. As I was watching this movie I kept thinking, what if something was trying to get in? Something they had to keep out. Something more dangerous then all of them. Cause lets face it. There is nothing more dangerous then being bored. However that is merely a matter of opinion. The cold grizzled fact of the matter is that, The Revenant was a similar bleak mood in some ways, but far superior. Betwixt these two well made movies, go with Revenant. What is truly interesting is that rumor has it Tarantino got the idea for Hateful 8 from The Thing. Its a fascinating and brilliant idea that does not register the way I wanted it too. But I commend the man for his setups. He knows how to keep us in suspense. Tarantino is a master craftsman with an obvious love for his source material. Its just my opinion but Hateful 8 would have been the perfect opportunity to make a superior western horror movie. A nice cross genre art piece with his trademark style and vitality. I tried hard not to expect too much. I tried hard not to fall asleep. Worth your time if you are a die hard fan. But most die-hard fans will agree its not his best. I think its better if your holed up inside with a storm going on outside, as you curl up and watch it. Because those kind of situations seem to make a movie play out better. Kurt Russell, as always, is the real reason to watch."

","I'm late to this because I didn't go to the theater to see it and I'm glad I didn't! <br/><br/>Others have given the premise to the story so I'll just dive in... even if we buy into the belief that a murderous band of cutthroats, killing everyone in the haberdashery but leaving Bruce Dern alone is beyond far fetched; he'd be dead too if were in real life... but he needed to live so fluke of all flukes, the man who killed his son (Samuel L Jackson) happens to arrive so he could goad Dern into a fight and killing him giving one of the gang time to poison the coffee... contrived much? <br/><br/>Then, Oswaldo (Tim Roth) , out of the blue, asks 'which one has a letter from Lincoln?'... how would he know that? That little tidbit was shared while on the stage and Jackson's character was a rider they just happened to pick up on the way. <br/><br/>When John Ruth (Russell) realized he was poisoned, instead of pulling his pistol and killing Daisy (Leigh), he starts beating her up... that makes zero sense. <br/><br/>Tarantino makes an over the top violent piece of crap that takes three hours to watch... only reason I gave it the time to watch was I was home sick and it filled in the time...

"em-632-781000","8","1","3","20 March 2017"," All the signature marks of a Tarantino film, well crafted.
","Some of us, I guess, consider Tarantino films a guilty pleasure, although there must be quite a few of us judging by the box office receipts that his films collect, to say nothing of the accolades, and the ""A list"" of actors who people them. Always, by more conservative viewers, considered slightly ""over the edge"" in terms of violence, sexual innuendo, and bad language, (as in his prolific use of the ""N"" word), his films are nevertheless very entertaining, and this one is no exception. Its primary appeal is in the casting of a group of very good actors who carry off their roles with exceptional skill. The plot and the dialogue are likewise imaginative, and come, again, from the apparently fertile brain of its director, who also wrote the script. Sam Jackson, as always, is a stand out, as is Jennifer Jason Leigh in her Academy Award nominated role as the quirky outlaw Daisy. But I have to say that Walter Goggins kinda steals the movie. He and Jackson, who shared the screen in Django Unchained, are a potent combination, and Goggins has grown into an actor of wide range, and considerable appeal. I confess that early on I dismissed Tarantino too lightly, but have come to consider his films highly accomplished entertainments. If you like westerns, with inventive plots, this one is not to be missed."
"gbill-74877","7","1","3","11 January 2017"," Good but not great
","All of Quentin Tarantino movies are fun to watch, and I can always feel his appreciation of filmmaking as a craft as well as his joy in film as pure entertainment. The setup to 'Hateful Eight' is fantastic, with beautiful outdoor shots in snow country, and an interesting concept, characters being added one by one as a bounty hunter stops to pick up those imperiled by an oncoming blizzard. Tarentino assembles a fine cast with Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh among others, and Bruce Dern turns in a great performance. There are some deep moments amidst the violence, Jackson saying in one scene that ""The only time black folks are safe, is when white folks is disarmed"", and Tim Roth's character expressing the thin line justice walks in a speech ending with the line ""For justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being justice"" in another. I liked how the stories behind each of the characters are gradually revealed, and how the story behind what happened earlier in the haberdashery that everyone is holed up in is told in a flashback chapter. In other words, there's a lot to like here. And yet. And yet. How the story plays out was somehow not completely satisfying, maybe because I felt like it lost focus, and fell back on extreme gore and graphic moments to try to carry the day. I was also not a huge fan of the ending. It's a good film for sure, but not great, or Tarantino's best."

"cdjh-81125","9","1","3","15 October 2016"," An Amazing Mix of an Intriguing Mystery, Stylish Violence and Engaging Dialogue
","Quentin Tarantino is not only considered to be one of the greatest directors working today but one of the best of all time and The Hateful Eight is just further evidence of this as its one of his finest efforts. One of the reasons for this is its central mystery because who can't get behind a good mystery and with Tarantinos Dialogue your just constantly engaged and intrigued by what happens next and makes you want to go back and watch it again to see it in a different light and perspective. To have an an engaging mystery you need intriguing characters and they all are because they're all just so different it makes their interactions fascinating. We have Kurt Russell in one of his greatest performances making for a very charismatic and likable lead you get the impression that he has a very strong moral code and helps you get behind him more and want him to survive the night. Samuel L Jackson gives the greatest performance he's ever given since Pulp Fiction he's just perfect as Major Warren he's entertaining and mysterious and that's another great thing about this movie your never 100% sure on any of the characters even after the credits start rolling you don't know if any thing they said during the entire run time was the truth. Before this film I hadn't seen much of Jennifer Jason Leigh but she blew me away in this movie she was just so despicable and disgusting and it takes a special kind of actress to pull it off as well as she did. The location of the log cabin in this movie was perfectly utilised you feel like your their with the characters feeling as cold as they are. Under the wrong direction this movie could have been so boring because this movie is mostly dialogue very little action so Tarantino directs this movie wonderfully never making you feel bored or any less than invested. Visually I would say that this is Tarantinos best movie the cinematography in this movie is incredible This snowy landscapes look amazing and suck you into the world they are building. Unfortunately the one thing that stopped this movie from being perfect was the last 20 minutes with giving away to much it just fails to keep the intrigue and suspense of the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight was one of my favourite movies of 2015 and if one of my favourite Tarantino Movies and for me it holds the title of being Tarantinos most addictive movie.<br/><br/>A/97%"

With it's outstanding dialogue, excellent music, and impressive performances, The Hateful Eight is much more than just 3 hours of talking and violence. It's brilliant and powerful, arguably making it the best movie of 2015. Not to mention the fact that Mr. Tarantino decided to show this film in a special roadshow event presented in 70MM, making for quite the experience."
"LordMaxentius","8","1","3","11 October 2016"," Underrated, one of Tarantino's best
","Quentin Tarantino's ninth film (eighth if you count Kill Bill as one film) involves eight strangers who seek refuge in a stagecoach stopover called 'Minnie's Haberdashery' due to an incoming blizzard. There is a series of very tense long scenes, a ton of dialogue and a fair share of plot twists towards the end. <br/><br/>As a big fan of Tarantino (being a producer of short films myself), his latest work struck me as one of his best. I was surprised however, when I found out that a lot of people disliked it, saying it was too similar to his other works, unoriginal or boring. Sure, the shots are typically very long and the scenes are quite drawn out, but as this is meant to be a Western, that is to be expected. The long scenes may be annoying for some, but they help build up the tension and had me on-edge for the entire film. Furthermore, it is most certainly not unoriginal. In fact, I think it's one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. The plot is not something I've ever seen before, and it is definitely not a rip-off of any of his other films. <br/><br/>The score, the first complete movie score by Ennio Morricone in 35 years(!) is perfect and sets the scene brilliantly. The acting is also spot-on, with Kurt Russel delivering a great comeback in the role of John Ruth, Samuel Jackson impressing as Major Warren and Walton Goggins doing a superb accent in the role of Sheriff Chris Mannix. The plot is also great (as mentioned earlier) and I would be lying if I said that I anticipated any of the plot twists. <br/><br/>All in all, another brilliant film by Tarantino with a flawless plot, brilliant cinematography, great acting and an epic score. If you haven't seen it yet, then you definitely should.<br/><br/>8.4/10 (8)"

"BlueFairyBlog","9","1","3","27 September 2016"," Hateful, but not Awful
","Writing a review of any Tarantino work usually causes me to exhale loudly in anticipation, knowing I will have to try and untangle the controversy in order to form a coherent opinion of the film. Tarantino uses controversy as his currency, and many of his films are reviled for it. Tarantino doesn't shy away from race, gender, history, or black comedy, and in this newest Western there's a lot to talk about, a lot to flinch at, and much that delights the ears and eyes. Without further ado, let's pick apart ""The Hateful Eight,"" the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>The Weinsteins made Tarantino a critical darling with their backing of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" and have been behind the wunderkind ever since. The Oscar glory has faded some since the nineties, but ""The Hateful Eight"" garnered an impressive three nominations and subsequent win for Ennio Morricone's score. Morricone is one of the least observed masters in the industry, especially when looking at John Williams, who was especially honored at the ceremony this year. His win was especially deserved for this film, who's score was beyond memorable, and lent true depth to the candidly amazing visuals of the winterized mountain terrain. Jennifer Jason Leigh was up for Best Supporting Actress, and I had previously stated that I think she should have won over Alicia Vikander, which is a position I still maintain. I might be a bit biased because I believe that Leigh is one of the greatest actresses of this generation and doesn't get the credit she deserves, but there's no arguing on the point that she had an out and out outstanding performance as Daisy Domergue. As always the cast is an ensemble, which always creates due tension in the plot. The story is set in a post-Civil War nineteenth century where the purveyors of the war are all huddled in an inn against an oncoming blizzard. Adding the tension of Daisy as captive, and a possible accomplice among the ranks of the strangers at the inn, it's clear that something insidious is afoot. The controversies of the film include: abject violence, most of it directed at Daisy, the subject of slavery and racism, brought to attention by Samuel L. Jackson's former war hero rattled by a former Confederate general and soldier at the inn, and the obvious language and visuals. The violence against Daisy is calamitous, but adds something quite complex to the plot. Daisy is the main villain of the film, because she is a murderer and gang accomplice, so she is treated as such by her keeper, Ruth (Russell). If she were played by a man this would be in keeping with the time and place of the story, and here it adds authenticity to the narrative.<br/><br/>The film itself is great, if a little long winded. The entire exchange between Major Warren (Jackson) and General Smithers (Dern) was so strange and long that it took a lot away from the plot, yet still it was needed in order to establish important themes later in the story. The use of cinematography, costuming, music, and Tarantino's patented mis-en-scene created such a carnal experience on screen that it could be nothing but brilliant. Yet another great addition to the Tarantino canon, and a truly thought provoking watch."
"PetarNeo","10","1","3","30 August 2016"," Not the best but maybe second best QT movie
","One more absolutely amazing movie written and directed by Tarantino. Seriousness and violence of all characters is so amazing and he manages to keep us interested all the time. Quentin keeps making his own movie world of amazing characters that are well developed and makes a great movie environment. Westerns could be something that we could see him making to the end of his work as movie director. With his humour and shooting he shows us his signature. While watching movie we just keep waiting moment when everything is going to get unsolved and Tarantino manages to keep us all anticipating that moment and bringing it up simultaneously. Daisy is perfectly bringing character up and at the end she shows us what she really is. At the end Mannix and Warren are showing us how bad ass they really are. Morricone has shown us how talented he is in making fantastic original score for movies. 4/4"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","3","29 August 2016"," An admirable addition to the canon.
","Nobody makes movies like Quentin Tarantino and I'm a huge fan of his work. This is the eighth film that he has both written and directed (one of the reasons for the title) and I've seen them all - I think ""Kill Bill"" (really two works) is my favourite - except ""Death Proof"" which I decided to miss out. Like his seventh film ""Django Unchained"", this is a western of sorts but, whereas the previous story was set just before the Civil War, this one is located in the period just after the war. In both cases, race is a major theme.<br/><br/>In some senses, ""The Hateful Eight"" is like a Shakespearean tragedy: it is largely set in one location (a snow-bound cabin in the depths of Wyoming), there is lots of glorious dialogue delivered is slow, measured tones, the tension is relieved by a running joke (a door that needs nailing shut against the biting wind), and at the end the stage is littered with bodies. Tarantino is always ready to take his time and the narrative is built up and the characters introduced in a slow, even leisurely, style but, when the action comes, there is plenty of duplicity and revelation in a veritable blood-fest.<br/><br/>In a fine cast with some of the director's favourite players, the eight of the title are portrayed by Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson as bounty hunters, Bruce Dern as a former civil war general, Walton Goggins as the sheriff of Red Rock, Tim Roth as the one Englishman, Michael Madden and Demián Bichir as mysterious strangers, and the hapless prisoner Jennifer Jason Leigh who gets it in the face in more ways than one. If not Tarantino's finest work, this is an admirable addition to his canon."
"KahnuevsKrake","7","1","3","29 August 2016"," Visually stunning, but lacks in story...
","I've seen this film at a regular cinema, in 70mm film and in the home. While the film is visually and stylistically stunning, unfortunately I think the story does let it down. Considering Tarantino is known for making great movies and I am a big fan of his work, I was bit let down this time around, it wasn't a bad film by any means, but by Tarantino standards, this is probably his weakest film since Death Proof in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Visually this film is stunning. I saw it in 70mm film and the picture quality blew me away, it was a cinema experience like no other. I could really see the benefit of 70mm's super wide aspect ratio as the film did feel almost like a stage play and enabled the audience to see characters at opposite ends of the cabin. I'm glad I saw it in 70mm, because now it's out on Blu-ray and iTunes, the home media doesn't even come close to doing the the stunning cinematography justice.<br/><br/>But with that said I would probably would have let that slide if the story was more exciting. With such a stunning group of actors on board, I had high hopes, but unfortunately most of the characters were not particularly likable, nor very interesting, although Jennifer Jason Leigh was very good as the villain and she made me laugh a few times and Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson had their moments, the rest of them I didn't find particularly interesting or likable. Yes, the film is called 'The Hateful Eight' for a good reason, but the main characters didn't have enough qualities that made me want to at least root for them.<br/><br/>Basically it's a three hour film set mostly in a cabin where a bounty hunter is taking a dangerous prisoner to be hanged, and on the way another bounty hunter and a guy who claims to be the new town sheriff hitch a ride in his stagecoach and shack up in a cabin with a bunch of other individuals during a blizzard. They don't trust each other and, well, being a Tarantino movie you can pretty much guess what's going to happen...<br/><br/>The idea had potential, it was well shot, well directed and there was a stellar cast involved, so there was a lot of promise here. But unfortunately pretty pictures and great cinematography aren't enough to make an otherwise OK film a great one. It wasn't bad by any means, but the lack of likable protagonists and the predictable plot let the film down for me, plus the fact it was three hours long didn't do it any favours, because it dragged on at times.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, like Avatar, they were both great visual experiences in the cinema, but once you see them on home media, the best part of the film is then lost and you're left with an OK film on digital media that simply doesn't do the visuals justice. It's such a shame."

","Imagine if 3 great directors (Tarantino, Leone and Bergman decided to pick and choose from their well known themes to create a Western version of a Russian wooden doll. Within are smaller dolls each one with a different yet similar twist to the story.<br/><br/>While the choice of music was somewhat plodding (except during the credits by Roy Orbison), both the interior of the way station and the exterior snowy blizzard outside add to the tension and dialog of the actors. I can quite imagine this being presented on stage with little loss of momentum in the story line.<br/><br/>The introduction scenes are straight out of a Sergio Leone classic. Almost expected Eastwood appearing as in Pale Rider with religious icons surrounding his appearance. Instead Samuel Jackson reprises his swagger and style made famous in Pulp Fiction and Snakes on a Plane. If you like this, then Hateful Eight is your glass of whiskey.<br/><br/>Jason Leigh knocks it out of the park. I have not seen such abuse of a woman on screen treated with such indifference by the males in the story. Yet her ability to balance catty wit with female physical pain is like watching a train collision in slow motion.<br/><br/>Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern play themselves adding some but not much color to the plot . Kurt Russell however, exposes a few old tricks that make his the most memorable role. Both Jackson and Russell get to spar with some delicious dialog that makes you pause.<br/><br/>The story, once unfolded to the last doll is a bit thin. Tarantino covers up this deficiency with his usual bloody scenes of gore, which I think is his one weakness as a director. Every actor gets to play some form of wounded human - guns, knives, bottles - the usual stuff.<br/><br/>The writing is excellent though the N word gets to replace the F word in every scene. Not sure if that was an important motif to get the point across of the denigration of black Americans during and after the civil war. A little overdone but provides fodder for Samuel to strut his excellent delivery style. His face alone in one scene, silent and watching, is something most actors cannot repeat.<br/><br/>This is a film you need to watch twice. First time to see the story unfold. The second time to pick one or two actors and focus on how they play their roles. In my opinion, this film was much better than the Revenant due to the acting, which rescues the film's meager story."

","One either loves or hates his movies. This one falls in-between. Good premise that goes on much too long. OK acting by most, but a 'little-over-the-top"" by Jackson and Leigh. <br/><br/>Two large plot holes or shortcomings mar the movie. SPOILER ALERT: Earlier in the day section when the baddies kill the people at the Haberdashery, how and who could have cleaned up all the blood stains so fast? Except for the covered chair, no way could they have washed and cleaned the whole place. Even worse, at the end, you have two guys to age weak and can hardly move, yet they are able to make a great looking noose, with nary a blood stain from the girl or themselves on the rope. They are actually able to get up on the rafters to sling the rope around, get down, put Leigh in the noose, again, nary a bit of blood, and able to pull the noose? Incredible feat which defeats the whole film. I aghast that Tarantino himself, or the crew or even the actors didn't think about the implausibility of all this. A mess, for sure. <br/><br/>Since about 90% of the film takes place in a stagecoach and the interior of the cabin, why the wide screen, 70 MM? Should have been filmed in black and white with just an old-fashion 1.33 camera lens. The more I think about the film the less I like it. <br/><br/>Another factor that doesn't make sense is the lie that the Jackson character tells the Dern character. Very offensive scene, and the blood-shed that follows is also overdone. Tarantino would be ashamed of himself for this one."
"john-o-loven","8","1","3","1 July 2016"," For justice delivered without dispassion, is always in danger of not being justice.
","The essence of this movie is neatly captured in the bar scene between the Hangman and the Bounty Hunter, John Ruth. The finishing turn out of The HateFul Eight all boils down to this conversation about justice and moral.<br/><br/>First, lets get the story straight. A bounty hunter is on his way of bringing a woman to the town where she is to be executed for her crimes. The thought of this being society's civilized way of bringing her to justice is brought up by a man that happens to be the woman's coming executioner, the Hangman. He then compares this scenario to one where her victim's relatives comes to the cabin where she is, and murders her brutally. He asks the difference between these two scenarios, and tells that the second scenario might be more ""thirst-quenching"", but might not be the right thing to do. To this the bounty hunter responds that it is the right thing to do to her, but maybe not to others.<br/><br/>In this scene, that takes place relatively early in the movie, Quentin Tarantino pretty much discusses the ending of his movie. In the end, the woman is not brought to the town for execution, but is relentlessly hanged by her throat from the cabin ceiling by her excited killers, and a great deal of other men are killed alongside with her.<br/><br/>But the message not only holds for the woman being hanged. Also her fellow men lying dead on the floor all have bounties on their heads, and might just as well be in her situation. So the true question is whether or not the means by which a result is met are irrelevant, if the result is still the same. The same holds true for the other, innocent, characters that die in this movie. All people die, and is it really that important when and how this happens?<br/><br/>Maybe it is, since Tarantino chose the more brutal way of telling the story. After all, this is, as the Hangman said himself, more ""thirst-quenching"". And isn't that what the audience really wants to see? Maybe this is just Tarantino's satirical way of showing his audience what the filming industry has nowadays become: a mediocre pastry without any depth only designed for pleasing the viewers flat desires.<br/><br/>But we all know that isn't true, since the way the moral of this story is being told comes close to being a masterpiece."

","Another film that demonstrates how good Q could be IF ONLY he found a good collaborator. So much of this was good and so much better than the appalling self-indulgent nonsense that was Inglorious Bastards (sic). Set up was good, characters were fully (if clumsily) sketched out, script was great.. to a point. BUT... the violence and the monotonous single theme pitch. <br/><br/>Key point - if everyone behaves like a psychopath, then everyone is A BAD GUY. Personally I think that trying to normalise killing someone is a terrible thing to do, and anyone who tries/ does kill someone is at least morally compromised... sadly (and this is not just a QT thing of course) this seems to STILL be a moot point, though way down from the late 90s high/low point. Oddly the thing I liked about Reservoir Dogs was that it made the point that violence always has consequences, not the opposite.<br/><br/>In this film, the killing was gratuitous, frequent, and, most inexcusable of all, made the film worse.<br/><br/>But the thing that made the film dull was the constant - and I mean constant - race references. I mean, seriously? Did they really not talk about ANYTHING else? I mean, not even misogyny - which, judging by this film was at least a constant...<br/><br/>As per Django, the denouement was rubbish. Made no sense and I think was actually impossible. Gave the viewer the sense that they were running out of film...<br/><br/>In short - enjoy the ride.

","Whereas the film has a slow start, it is totally worth it to sit through it. Tarantino has once again proved that his unique style of filming - with great focus on detail and with a lack of rush - can entertain, intrigue and capture viewers till the end. While some scenes tend to be way too bloody and brutal for my personal taste, the highly interesting plot makes up for this. The film makes you want to understand everything, making the film increasingly more interesting once the plot starts to develop. Furthermore, the setting and beautiful landscape deserve to be mentioned. I would have rated the film higher if the beginning would have had a slightly faster pace."

"brutzel","7","1","3","31 March 2016"," A Western or sorts, too long, talky, but still good
","In the dead of winter with a snow blizzard coming up fast, Bounty Hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to Red Rock for hanging. On the road, the stage coach meets up with another Bounty Hunter, Major Warren (Jackson) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new Sheriff in Red Rock. Of course, no one trusts anyone. They stop for shelter at Minnie's store where we see other characters of ill-repute. Why are they there? This can't be good.<br/><br/>We just know all this will result in terrific shootings. Kind of reminded me of the Smoking Aces movie where there was a shootout within an elevator. So I bided my time. The problem here is that it takes too long to get to that point. John Ruth takes guns away from everyone (except from the Major) to insure his and Daisy's safety. In the meantime we get to hear everyone's story and this is where talky, talky, talky comes into play. All this could have been shortened without losing any of the story. <br/><br/>I see you are looking for the twist. Well, here's the thing: about Chapter 4 or so we come to see what happened before the stage coach with John Ruth and company arrived at Minnie's store. Now the real story begins. <br/><br/>Notables: Michael Mardsen as Joe Gage who says he is going home to see his mother; Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, the Hangman going to Red Rock; Bruce Dern as Confederate General Sandy Smithers going to Red Rock to see the grave of his son killed in the Civil War; James Parks as O.B . the stage coach driver; and Demian Bichir as Bob, the Mexican who tells everyone he is just minding the store for Minnie who left for a while. Channing Tatum as Jody: comes in really late. Can't say more.<br/><br/>This can be considered a classic WESTERN WHO-DUN-IT and we follow Major Warren's logic and see that he makes a lot of sense. I know in the past I have always accused Samuel L. Jackson - many times – of playing a character who likes to pontificate. So true in here as well. But truth be told, he is extremely good at it. Kudos. You almost expect him to ask you ""what's in your wallet?"" from an ad he's in. Ha! The telling of the General's son who performed fellatio on the Major was quite unnecessary.<br/><br/>The shootings are what we come to this movie to see. Hey, this is a Quinton Tarantino movie! Ever see a watermelon blown away by a shotgun? That is what you will see when shots are fired at the heads of some characters. The CGI is unforgiving and there will be blood everywhere. <br/><br/>The cinematography is so good that you wished you could take a picture of some scenery, put a frame in it and hang it on a wall. <br/><br/>Although this is quite talky for most of the movie, the acting and dialogues are spot on and quite engaging. It's just that too many characters have too much to say. Ha! (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes."

Yes, I agree, it's not a 10, but the characters are interesting and it moves along keeping viewers on their toes trying to figure out the who's really who; something you question starting within the first 10 minutes. Although I normally am not a fan of excessive violence, for some baffling reason, I am not turned away by it in his productions. When it happens, it's over the top.(Not unlike the Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote.) It is, after-all, a Tarantino production. And FYI a big screen theater is not needed to enjoy it. The outdoor scenes are so limited, the panorama lost is offset by the ability of pausing a DVD for snacks and bathroom breaks. Put it on your list."

First of all I will say that I did enjoy this movie. I think Tarantino is a little overrated. I have liked his films, but I think sometimes he tries too hard and it shows. This one had a little of that in this but everything else made up for it. There are a few little issues I had with this though. First of all, I don't usually complain about the length of a movie unless its slow moving. While I won't say this was slow it could have been trimmed down quite a bit, some of the scenes went on a little long and some were repetitive. Overall, one of the better Tarantino films in my opinion, but essentially a remake of Reservoir Dogs, which isn't a bad thing. I give this a B."
"Mobithailand","8","1","3","27 March 2016"," Most Tarantino Fans will probably like it.
","Although tipped as an early runner for a heap of Oscars, in the end, the only nominations it received were for best supporting Actress (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and for cinematography and music. About par for a Tarantino film. It won for music. (Ennio Morricone)<br/><br/>I have always been a keen fan of Quentin Tarantino, who wrote and directed this epic western, but I don't think it is one of his best. Having said that, I am not a particular fan of the western genre, as in my younger days, it was done to death, both by Hollywood and by the television networks.<br/><br/>But of course, a Tarantino western is no ordinary western. Darkly comic and violent as it is, in some ways, it is more like an Agatha Christie murder mystery – and is often just as silly and superficial. One man is poisoned, another is shot in the head, another has his head blown clean off and another is hanged, and so on. Almost to the end, we don't know who the baddies and goodies are – in true Christie fashion.<br/><br/>The film is a massive 3 hours in duration. It is set just after the end of the civil war and nearly all the action takes place inside a single room of a stagecoach stop in the middle of the Wyoming prairie. Outside, a violent snowstorm prevents anyone from leaving. It could have very easily been a stage play and who knows? One day, it might be just that.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast, including Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell, are outstanding, although I am not convinced that Jason Leigh should have been nominated for best supporting actress for playing the part of a deranged, violent criminal gang leader. But the superior acting by one and all and the regular insertion of grizzly violence keeps the simple plot moving along quite well.<br/><br/>I suspect that Tarantino had planned to make a western masterpiece, but in my opinion, he didn't quite make it. The dialogue is good, without being outstanding. For me, the film was missing something that would take it right out of the ordinary. It didn't quite make the sum of its excellent parts.<br/><br/>I can't fault the cinematography, the acting, the brilliant direction, and the great music score and for this reason, I rate this quite highly. The Hateful Eight is not for everyone, but most Tarantino fans will probably enjoy it, unless they are heavy smokers."
"Reno-Rangan","8","1","3","24 March 2016"," ...And then there were none.
","I'm neither Tarantino nor Nolan's fan, but love watching their movies. As usual these director's films are highly expected by all, that's including me. This one started off quite like a normal western, so I thought it wouldn't be like the director's previous film 'Django Unchained'. In fact, it was considered for a sequel to that, but the director felt this story and the previous character Django failed to blend, hence 'The Hateful Eight' was born with Samuel L. Jackson playing an important role.<br/><br/>Solid eight from me for this QT's eighth film. But I felt the movie was kind of inspired by 'And Then There Were None'. It was not about to find who's the killer or next to be killed. The character introductions were at its best and an excellent twist in the middle. This sets in a cabin with eight strangers struck there after the snowstorm. But after an unexpected event the suspicious started to mount and brings chaos. Then takes us to the flashback to reveal something the story that did not mention in the earlier part which's very essential for coming back to the finale.<br/><br/>The 80% of the movie was just talking, but the remaining stunt sequences were so powerful. All the eight, plus, supporting character were exceptional, but the director's favourite Samuel L. Jackson nailed it as his character is a bit above from the rest. The entire film was shot is a couple of locations, but the major portion takes place in a cabin and it was a limited cast movie. These days, western movies are shrinking, only a very-very few good movies are made every year. In the time of superheroes, a movie like this is really very precious, so definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"mistergutsy2299","7","1","3","22 March 2016"," Mediocre Tarantino Film = Good Film
","The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's eight film (actually it's his 9th but either he doesn't count Death Proof or Kill Bill is now 1 film, I'm not sure) and suffice to say it is not among his best. But even a mediocre Tarantino film is still a heck of a lot better than most movies put out these days.<br/><br/>The story is that while delivering a fugitive, bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (played by Kurt Russell) encounters another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and Sheriff Chris Mannix (played by Walter Goggins.) He's untrustworthy of these people but soon a large blizzard forces him to take these people with him into a cabin filled with even more unsavory characters and from there a mystery emerges<br/><br/>Once again Tarantino manages to bring out some truly great performances. All the actors in this film simply own their characters, bringing them to life in such an authentic way. John 'The Hangman' Ruth is my favorite out of all the characters. Having an incredible mustache probably has something to do with it.<br/><br/>An interesting element of this film is that none of the characters in particular are people you'd want to root for. They all have some dark secret about them that utterly wrecks their moral abilities and causes us to see them in a different light. This could of course be a negative to some people as it would make it hard to sympathize with the characters.<br/><br/>And the way the film creates suspense is done through Tarantino's signature dialogue and the simply MASTERFUL soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. It is a work of art that looms like a specter in some scenes, brilliantly creation tension. It is most definitely worth buying.<br/><br/>However the film has its good share of cons.<br/><br/>Much has been made about the movie being filmed in 70mm and in the first few scenes set in the wilderness of Wyoming it looks fantastic! It rivals the backdrops and scenic views scene in the Revenant. But unfortunately it is then wasted. I don't understand why Tarantino would film the entire movie in 70mm and then stick us in a cabin for 2/3rds of the entire film. Some say it helps you get into the film more because it feels like you're really there but I say that it's a waste.<br/><br/>And everyone mentions the whole 'mystery aspect' of the film in their reviews and synopses. Some even say that this movie is a Western version of The Thing but that's simply not true. The mystery aspect of this film starts off great! You're really into it and piecing things together and trying to figure out this mystery alongside with the characters but then BAM! The mystery is solved and taken care of in about 10 minutes flat. It just feels like it goes by too quick and the movie would have been far more interesting if it had just started with this mystery.<br/><br/>And that is ultimately my major complaint about The Hateful Eight. The movie is simply way, way, way, way too long. It runs for about 3 hours and that's simply too long for a movie like this. Perhaps if more happened in the film then those 3 hours would fly by. Django Unchained is almost 3 hours and no one complains. But this movie doesn't have a lot to fill up those 3 hours. The dialogue would help, but the dialogue in this movie doesn't capture your attention like it did in other Tarantino films. I really feel as though many scenes could be shortened or even cut out.<br/><br/>As I left the theater I felt a strange sense of familiarity with this film, as though I had already seen it before. Then I realized I have, and it was a movie by the same director! That movie is Reservoir Dogs and it shares many similarities with this film but the difference is that Reservoir Dogs isn't 3 HOURS LONG!<br/><br/>Overall The Hateful Eight isn't a bad movie but it's certainly not Tarantino's best. If Tarantino is being true about only making 2 more films then retirement then I hope that his last 2 are outstanding. <br/><br/>I'm going to give The Hateful Eight a C+"

Tarantino's style has long ago fixated at black humor, action and extreme violence. The difference with this film is it's theatrical nature as most of it takes place in just one place where eight characters hate (or about to hate) one another and keep on talking revealing secrets and weaknesses. The long duration of the film (3 hrs) is quite tiring but still the performances by the cast (especially Samuel Jackson who is always great) along with some great as well as extremely comical dialogs will pay you for your trouble. Jennifer Jason Leigh got a deserved Oscar nomination (you' ll have trouble even recognizing her) and Ennio Morricone easily won the music Oscar. The film's plot climaxes slowly but it's second half is satisfying and the movie ends in a massive splatter scene. I'll never forget the extremely graphical Samuel Jackson monologue (no need for spoilers here). You can't compare the film with the epic masterpiece called Django Unchained but it's still one damn good authentic Tarantino experience.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Quentin Tarantino's eighth film produced by Miramax is a dialogue heavy, violent Western that strikes a very similar chord to his first film Reservoir Dogs. The primary action in this film takes place in a single room, Minnie's Haberdashery. All the actors were on point though some only had a few moments to shine.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell plays John Ruth, a rough bounty hunter. There were so many instances where he smacked around his bounty, Daisy Domergue played brilliantly by Jennifer Jason Leigh, that I'm surprised advocates against images of violence against women aren't up in arms alongside the cops who also claimed to boycott Tarantino's film for an appearance at a Black Lives Matter event. Leigh gives Domergue vicious character and though a viewer doesn't know it at the beginning, eventually one can see her viciousness. <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson deserves the most praise and rightfully graces center stage in the poster. The heavy-lifting of the dialogue fell to Jackson's Major Marquis Warren. His taunting of the Confederate General Sandy Smithers, an old Civil War vet played by Bruce Dern, gives of the most amusing and disturbing monologue of the film. Major Warren is also responsible for a lot of the gun-slinging and violence as the end heads towards a climax. <br/><br/>I've been a fan of Walton Goggins since his performance as Shane in the Shield, and he delivers as the Sheriff Chris Mannix with classic Goggins flair sounding just right spouting Tarantino dialogue. It's nice to see an actor who had shown such promise become such a star alongside a great director. <br/><br/>See more reviews at swilliky.com"
"zurablobjanidze","9","3","18","29 December 2015"," This is Good!!!
","The brilliant and pitiless Quentin Tarantino now gives us a vast American epic set mostly in just one room. In fact, the various sections and corners of that room start to feel as distant as cities or deserts. At one stage, a character suggests dividing this space to represent the Unionist North and Confederate South, and it's not too much of a stretch to imagine, although the slippery brutal amoralism of one and all is such that tribal-loyalty partition was never going to work.<br/><br/>Tarantino's The Hateful Eight liveried: 'Reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs'<br/><br/>Read more Tarantino has created another breathtakingly stylish and clever film, a Jacobean western, intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing his own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale. Moreover, Tarantino now makes a serious star of Walton Goggins, giving a hilarious performance as the deeply unreliable Chris Mannix, soi-disant Sheriff Elect of Red Rock, Wyoming. And Ennio Morricone has composed a score which is as sinuous and catchy as anything he has written: a theme with a tense and gloomy tread, coolly cranking up the tension."
"Jonmurgie","9","2","10","9 February 2016"," Sheer brilliance
","As with most Tarantino films there was a lot of controversy surrounding this, not least of which was the debacle that became where you could actually see the film! As a Cineworld Unlimited member I was somewhat disappointed that they decided to not show the film at all (a dispute with the distributors over the 70mm formats exclusive showing at an Odeon screen) so this meant having to make an alternative choice of where to see the film and I went with the Gloucester Guildhall which is a fabulous little venue and I can highly recommend it to anyone who wants a little bit more of a niche cinema experience.<br/><br/>Therefore this review is a bit late from the UK release date as it wasn't shown there for a couple of weeks, however I can instantly say it was well worth the wait as this is one absolutely amazingly brilliant film!! Possibly my favourite Tarantino film on first viewing (his other 7 films have grown on me over the years), reeking with all the usual Tarantino style, script, gore and soundtrack that make his work the beauty that it is.<br/><br/>Set sometime after the civil war the film doesn't venture very far by way of sets and scenery, the majority taking place inside one large building, but it doesn't need to. With the cast as strong as they are (most being veterans of previous Tarantino films), each and every actor played their role to perfection so you're captivated from the very opening scenes right to the last fade to black some 3 hours later. Yes, it is 3 hours long but it absolutely doesn't feel like it! There are plot twists and turns the entire film which keep you focused and on edge. Each scene is considered, complete and leaves you wanting for nothing. The occasional Tarantino silliness is thrown in here and there, but it's what you expect and is all part of the fun and yes there are a few laughs to be had too.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film, it's just so good! Basically if you've not yet seen it then you've only got a bit more time before it disappears from the handful of cinemas which are showing it so get in quick."
"CinematicInceptions","8","2","10","5 February 2016"," What Resivoir Dogs could have been. Highly interesting and entertaining.
","If you gave this basic plot to Frank Darabont, you would have a much different story. You could keep the title the same, and even have a couple of deaths, but then the remaining characters would eventually come together and put aside their differences and enact justice on Daisy Domergue, who would probably have killed whoever was already dead in some detestable way. Instead, with Quentin Tarantino, we get a story of interconnected strings pulled so tight that they have no choice but to snap. The post-civil war setting was perfect for the character's hatred for each other. There aren't many points in American history that had as much internal tension as the era of Reconstruction.<br/><br/>I'll try to keep spoilers out of my description of the story because you should really see the climatic events pan out on their own. Some people can't keep their eyes open that long and are bored by the long stretches of dialogue, which is understandable. But it's worth the effort to pay attention through act one even if not much seems to be happening. Tarantino has made pretty good use of the almost three-hour runtime with how he develops the characters. The only point I thought could have been cut out was the sequence when Chris Mannix and O.B. create the makeshift fence between the stable and the outhouse. At the time, I thought it might come into play later, but it doesn't.<br/><br/>Otherwise, almost every minute is treated with reasonable value. My favorite thing that came from the extended length was that it let you forget about characters and start to like them-- until they did something to make them just as despicable as the others. SPOILERS AHEAD!! For instance, I had totally forgotten that Joe Gage was even there until he helped O.B. bring out General Smither's body. All of the characters have a little something to like about them, and a fair sight more to dislike about them. Major Warren seems agreeable enough until he relates how he raped General Smither's son. Oswaldo, Bob, and Joe Gage seem to be causing no trouble until we learn that they killed Minnie and Dave. Chris Mannix and General Smither's generate a nice friendship at first, then we find out that it is driven by their extreme racism. John Ruth is respectable for the pride he takes in his job as a bounty hunter, but eventually we lose some respect for his character when he slips up rather incompetently. Daisy Domergue is introduced as an ugly sort of person, but we end up rooting for her character a little as she uses her power as the most needed person in the room to her advantage. Her life is important to everyone else in the room, so she uses it as a bargaining tool. The other characters, being O.B., Minnie, Six-horse Judy, Sweet Dave, and Jody add some level of normality since they, O.B. in particular, are outside of the web of hatefulness.<br/><br/>The script was very well done with a couple of minor flaws. The slow pace was a little problematic and some of the dialogue didn't work great, such as the bit when Major Warren explains why he doesn't believe Bob's story. Otherwise, Taratino's screenplay brought the characters to life like few others do. This was helped in no small part by the stellar acting. All the parts were well played and well cast. The camera work was stylized and engaging as it tends to be with Tarantino. The score was also a great point of execution that did its work in setting the mood. The intermingled comedy was quite well done as well between the running joke with the door, the small bits of violence early on, Tim Roth's eyebrow movement, and Chris Mannix's obnoxiousness. Normally, characters like Mannix come off as a lot more annoying than funny, but I though Walter Goggins absolutely nailed it with his performance. The action is way over the top, as expected, adding more to the spectacle than the excitement.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you still can. I was very glad I did since it wouldn't have been as enjoyable or interesting to watch it in separate sittings. It is very long, so make sure you prepare yourself for that however you need to. If you're looking for a good time to stop or leave, I would recommend the beginning of chapter 4, but I'll warn you that it only gets better from there. I liked the chapter breaks because it allowed me to kind of process whatever had just happened. There's a lot of blood by the end, but the violence and language has been toned down from Django. So watch it under theatrical conditions and be prepared for an immersive and stunning cinematic experience. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."
"brownsqjr","8","2","10","4 February 2016"," It's a great movie
","While Quentin Tarantino maybe polarizing figure outside of filmmaking, there's denying that he has a talent when it comes filmmaking and The Hateful Eight proves that. This 3-hour epic tells the story of bounty hunter who takes his prisoner to haberdashery to escape from a blizzard and it's filled with several shady characters that may also want the bounty.<br/><br/>As if with any Tarantino film the cinematography is excellent. Every shot is well placed and allows the audience to become intertwined with the film environment. Now without giving too much a crime happens midway through that puts the characters at odds with each other. This is meant to be callback to classic mystery stories, including the isolated location, bad weather, and the fact anyone could have it. But the films biggest strength lies with its characters and dialogue. A recurring theme through out the film is each character is not who they say they are, leaving their history open interpretation, kind of like Clint Eastwood's The Man with no name. Each character is complemented with some of the most crisp dialogue ever written. Every line is either witty, funny, philosophical, and just plain hilarious. <br/><br/>If there's one problem i have with the film is that doesn't feel as memorable as Tarantino's previous films. I don't know it felt like something was missing, but that's just a nitpick.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hateful Eight is very energetic enjoyable film and i recommend it all Tartantino fans."

","In short, this movie is a good one as another well-acted harsh Western movie; but as an Oscar nominee and an excellent piece of cinematography! NEVER! First, the storyline has serious shortcomings. It doesn't make sense, and it's not catching in any way. Second, the level of violence is just too much. It exceeds an entertaining level and approaches a psychotic sadistic level. I don't understand why such a movie has to be praised at that level?! Third, this movie hangs on any vulgar tricks such as nudity and crazy ferocity to make up for it's weak scenario. Forth, I am not a music expert, but as an audience I would say that the music like all other parts of this movie was a bit too much in some periods (and of course nice in some, but not at the Oscar level). Fifth, while watching this movie, a thoughtful one would struggle with himself why I'm watching this?! Why such a movie has to be made in the first place? Here I'm not going to deny any of its good features like good acting and directing, but what I mean is that good actors/actresses basically, can play anything perfectly. The question is that how a director has to get them into play."
"chloe-webb-01","3","2","10","27 January 2016"," Definitely not a classic
","OK, so what do you think when you think of a Tarantino movie? Me, well I think of: great camera angles, impeccable actors and acting, brilliant or witty dialogue, terrific screenplay, quirky and intense soundtrack, bloodshed, suspense, cleverness, plot twists, strange and just a style that is his own. Let me just be upfront and honest about this movie, there were quirky uses of songs- but they did not work. There were good camera angles but bad lighting. There were outrageous displays from characters but nothing we had not seen before, and far less convincing. There was a great cast, yet no actor truly shone through. Apart from Kurt Russel and those beastly mutton chops and handlebars being his facial hair. The costume designer went overboard and it led to confusion. The set was intriguing at first but soon came to be the reason I was doubting the storyline and what was transpiring. Yes there was blood, and the catering to the brutality fanbase. But characters dropping one by one is hard to believe in such circumstances. Tarantino has used several of previous success and ideas from his catalogue and tried to apply them to this movie. He is scraping for ideas and desperately trying to somehow have the wow factor. To me, it was history repeating itself, it left me yawning and wishing he would cast someone besides Samuel. L Jackson."
"joshvonhousen","10","2","10","27 January 2016"," One Of The Best Of 2015!
","Now, a lot has been said about this film in regards to how slow going it is, and, to be fair, it IS really slow going for the first hour or so. But, once Samuel L. Jackson tells his tale of forced oral sex, things really start to switch around. The story soon picks up and becomes a very taut and suspenseful story. In many respects, this film is better than Django Unchained, and here's why. First of all, the story. Django was just your simple revenge film. Yes, it was a great movie (You know, besides Jamie Foxx), but the story itself wasn't all that new or inventive. However, The Hateful Eight is a story of distrust and mystery that is very original. The only movie that I could possibly compare this to in terms of story is Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino's debut film (Michael Madsen's even in it!). Secondly, the setting. The first 35 minuets or so of this movie takes place on a stagecoach. But, the whole rest of the movie takes place in this small cabin. It almost gives the movie this claustrophobic feeling. Plus, it shows how much Tarantino can do with hardly anything at all. It does so much with so little in terms of suspense, action and atmosphere. Plus, every single actor in this movie is absolutely perfect in their role. The performance that stands out to me the most in Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue. She is AMAZING here! I buy every line she says, every look she gives. Plus, the make-up artist in this movie did a fantastic job making her look absolutely beaten to a pulp. The cinematography is also great, in case you expected any less from a Tarantino film. Now, there are some nitpicky things you could point out in this film, but before you do that, I would encourage you to watch the Nostalgia Critic editorial ""When Is It Right To Nitpick?"" But, the last half of this movie is very suspenseful. You want to find out who the liar is and their motivation and whether or not our characters make it out alive. I saw this movie twice in theaters, and even the second time around, even though I already knew what was going to happen in the end, I was still on the edge of my seat! I would've watched it a third time, but our local theater took it out. It's a movie that has fantastic rewatchability. It's not necessarily for fans of Tarantino is general. Although it is probably one of the goriest Tarantino films, it is not for the masses. It IS slow going, but, if you're patient, the payoff is incredible."
"furtherdownfilms","8","2","10","25 January 2016"," A Review by Nathan Fischer
","The Hateful Eight is the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino, and it oozes with his signature style and dialogue. I have always considered Tarantino to be one, if not the greatest director of our generation and he continues to prove himself with The Hateful Eight. The plot is quite simple in this one. Eight (or more) travelers find themselves held up in a wide open house when a blizzard hits the midwest. They are then forced to not only get along, but survive. This is a classic mystery story where no one is who they say they are and everyone is a suspect. It would be going in to too much spoiler territory to say anything more, so lets talk about the performances. Everyone is on top of there game here but some definitely stand out more than others. Samuel L. Jackson steals the show in my opinion. This is perhaps the greatest role he's played in over 20 years. Jennifer Jason Lee also gives a memorable performance that she seems to be relishing in. Its good to see her back on the big screen. Kurt Russell is probably the most sympathetic character of all these horrible people. He turns in a role that is campy and believable all at the same time. I have to comment on how terrifically written this movie is. It is mostly all dialogue and it is Tarantino in top form. He takes his time with his characters and lets them really chew on the environment and pace their lines. This movie is almost three hours long and 90% is dialogue and I was never even close to being bored. Its also beautifully shot with spanning mountain landscapes and endless hills of snow. It really puts you in the setting. Thats not to say that this movie is for everyone. It may come across as slow to some and when the violence kicks in, it really kicks. But for me, this is everything I could have wanted. Tarantino has done it again and shown the world that he can make some of the best movies of our time."

I was really disappointed about that, and now after I've seen the movie I still think, if the movie never done we can be less. <br/><br/>The character and the actors are brilliant! Oscar nomination is correct, but in my view the film was too long. Seriously 3 hours? Yes, I know it's a western and I didn't have any problem with the long slow scenes, I was a problem with the plot. that was too long. At the end of the movie I've seen too much Samuel L Jackson. I really love him, but his character was too much for me.<br/><br/>And the other thing. The genre wasn't clear. Of course it's a Tarantino movie, but the crime line wasn't enough or was too long. I didn't find the balance between the crime line and the western line. <br/><br/>My other problem was the mystery and the twists. They was calculable and we got all of them in a really short part.<br/><br/>As usual Tarantino's characters and the dialogs are amazing, the tension is great.<br/><br/>This isn't the best Tarantino movie. This isn't the best Samuel L Jackson performance. But the movie is good.<br/><br/>If you have to choose between Revenant and Hateful Eight... Choose the first!"

"hepodcast","7","2","10","13 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight: Tarantino Stripped Bare
","The Hateful Eight does not seem likely to end up as anyone's favorite Quentin Tarantino film, but it may be his most important. Tarantino has been exploring the landscape of revenge for four films now. In Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 he brought all manner of stylized violence to the screen culminating in the killing of a man who didn't seem to live up to the hatred the main character felt. In Inglorious Basterds he put our own love of violence at odds with Nazis reveling in the deaths of American soldiers. In Django Unchained his hero took vengeance on the entire concept of slavery by proxy.<br/><br/>The Hateful EightBut where all of those films had a liberal dose of cinematic sugar to help the medicine go down, The Hateful Eight slides down the gullet bitter and sticky. It feels like the end of a journey, of a man who has realized that when you give an audience sugar with their medicine, you only create an audience addicted to sugar.<br/><br/>The film opens with the image of a stone crucifix, the face of Jesus filling the frame, weather worn and draped in snow, looking more like a monster than a man. A stage coach rides past the cross through the white blanket of snow, shortly stopping in front of another figure: a black man seated atop three dead bodies in the middle of the road.<br/><br/>These are the images that set the tone for the rest of the movie, a stagecoach with a lawman and a criminal caught between a stone-dead god and man's cruel justice.<br/><br/>The lawman is John ""The Hangman"" Ruth a bounty hunter whose defining characteristic is his insistence on bringing in his bounties alive. The criminal is Daisy Domergue, a rough woman whose head is worth ten thousand dollars to the Hangman. The black man is Major Warren, a Civil War veteran turned bounty hunter. After an uneasy negotiation, John Ruth takes Major Warren in to his care, and the stage coach rolls on until it encounters another traveler lost on the freezing road, a former confederate soldier turned sheriff. This odd posse makes their way to Minnie's Haberdashery where they find four more men taking shelter from the oncoming storm.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight reviewed The feel of the film isn't quite like anything else Tarantino has ever done. It's still unmistakably his work, but where many of his other films feel wild and bombastic, The Hateful Eight seems staid and contemplative. The whole story unfolds like a play. Dialogue has always been one of Tarantino's greatest strengths, but here the words go on and on, a string of seemingly endless introductions and explanations and negotiations.<br/><br/>The mystery that unfolds in the movie's three hour run time isn't truly a mystery at all. It runs in a straight line from beginning to end, and while there are moments in the film that might be counted as surprises, the plot never truly twists in a way that redefines itself.<br/><br/>The directorial style, too, is more grounded. The images on screen are still immaculate, but they're not tinged with the same wizzbang whimsy that has defined Tarantino in the past.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino stripped bare.<br/><br/>And it's all to a purpose. It's easy to draw comparisons between The Hateful Eight and Tarantino's previous film Django Unchained, because they're both westerns that deal heavily with the problem of slavery in America, but in some ways the two films couldn't be more different. Django Unchained saw Tarantino trying to craft a new and better history, one in which the black man rose up against his white oppressors and rode off happily into the sunset, but The Hateful Eight paints a far bleaker picture.<br/><br/>If the violence seems more brutal here than in Tarantino's previous work, it is only because it has lost its sense of play. This is not violence playing homage to Tarantino's favorite films, but rather violence that reflects the brutality of the world.<br/><br/>There are no heroes in this tale. John Ruth beats his helpless prisoner without hesitation (an act that elicited a disturbing number of laughs in the theater I was in). Major Warren is just as bitter and spiteful as the Confederates he meets along the way. He lies and manipulates those around him, and justifies himself at every turn.<br/><br/>He wraps his lies around him like a blanket. And there are blankets everywhere in The Hateful Eight: the blanket of snow on the ground, white and cold, obscuring the harsh landscape beneath; the quilts and skins used to keep away the cold; blankets covering the evidence of the misdeeds of the past; blankets denied to a freezing enemy. Comforting. Covering. Concealing. The blankets are all lies.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a bleak picture of a cold world filled with rotten men. Their trust is fleeting, their truces self-serving, and if they manage to put aside their differences it is only unite in common hatred against another.<br/><br/>For more reviews like this, go to HumanEchoes.com"

","If you go to see a Tarantino movie, you have some idea of what to expect - the unexpected!! I did find the first hour somewhat plodding in pace and felt it could have been edited down a tad. But once the real story kicks in, it's kinda like a Tarantino version of an Agatha Christie whodunit. That's not a criticism, just an observation.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell are just superb in their characters - I hope they get nominated for Best Actor come Oscar time. A great cast with a typical Tarantino storyline. If you are a fan of Tarantino, you will love this one too. Everyone can argue which is Tarantino's best movie - I wouldn't dare to suggest that my favorite would be everybody else's.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it - but my attention waned a little in the first hour. A good movie that benefits from a large screen! I also agree with one reviewer who says there are political undercurrents in the storyline - I felt that too! But don't let that put you off. I look forward to revisiting this movie in a couple of years. It will always be considered as a Tarantino classic."
"graupepillard","8","2","10","10 January 2016"," Hateful Eight is quintessential Tarantino - I am a big fan.
","Quentin Tarantino's films are wildly original, despite his cinematic homage to great directors. I know there will be an excess of violence, blood will hemorrhage, splatter and ""spritz"" over everything and everyone, while the characters keep on talking literally to their dying breath. Dialogue which is both amusing and penetrating is the linchpin of his movies - refreshing in its fearlessness in talking about issues of hate, misogyny, and racism that have oozed under society's surface veneer of civility, over the centuries. Tarantino's approach is not to preach but to show through his characters their appetite for revenge, greed and the conceit of self- interest.<br/><br/>THE HATEFUL EIGHT opens up with panoramic shots of horses galloping in rhythm pulling a stagecoach silhouetted against vast mounds of white snow; an infinite vista emptied of form with only a white light flooding the screen. We are blinded by the beauty and the calm stillness of the landscape; short-lived - the drama begins. Words slice through the silence and language becomes a weapon; Tarantino's unique verbiage becomes a tool that wounds and spills blood setting the stage for physical slaughter.<br/><br/>Bounty hunting for the most ruthless, becomes the chosen profession of both former Union and Rebel fighters who are skilled in bringing ""accused criminals"" - those WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE back to small frontier towns to be hung. Trials are an afterthought - the reward is in the successful transport of prisoners to the ""hangman."" In this movie, there are at least 7 men and one woman who are itching to shoot each other down with very little pretext. All the lives of the ""hateful eight"" converge and ignite at Minnie's Haberdashery - a cabin with a stable and outhouse set like a punctuation mark in the center of the pristine snow-covered terrain - a warm space serving food and drinks for drivers and passengers and a shelter for the exhausted horses. <br/><br/>Like a lot of Tarantino's movies, his characters are mysterious - past lives and actions are questionable - truth weaves in and out of the picture; the agility of ""the talk"", the facility of the tongue to deceive is always hovering in the fetid air. The first person we see emerging from the all-encompassing blanket of snow is Samuel L. Jackson halting a stagecoach speeding to keep ahead of the blizzard, and confidently hitches a ride - frozen prisoners - all dead in tow. Jackson gives a terrific performance as Major Marquis Warren - a grizzled legend in the land, not only for bringing in his bounties ""dead"" rather than alive, but for being a pen pal and confidante of President Abraham Lincoln, a letter from Ole Abe reverently folded up in his breast pocket - the letter being a catalyst for discussion and a symbol of the former black Union soldier's stature. THE HATEFUL EIGHT bristles with post Civil War disputes - the war might have ended a few years before but a peace treaty does not allay animosities that run deep from generation to generation to this very day. <br/><br/>We next meet the wagon's occupant, John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) handcuffed to a swollen, blackened eye Daisy Dormergue (great performance by one of my favorite actors - Jennifer Jason Leigh) being brought into Red Rock - for the $10,000 reward. We are never told what Daisy was charged with, but the racist venom spewing out of her mouth reveals a grotesque spirit which is palpably visible on her battered face. Tarantino's over-the-top violence does not coddle women and it is difficult to watch Daisy being a punching bag and receiving the brunt of ""the hangman's"" brutality, but Tarantino literally does not pull any punches especially when he is dealing with a fanatical bigot. Another passenger, who is frozen by the extreme elements, is added to the group - Walter Goggins plays Chris Mannix an ex-Confederate soldier and the newly appointed sheriff of the town where the hanging will take place.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at the rest stop, the action begins - 4 men are already there waiting out the blizzard - with a mesmerizing performance by Bruce Dern as Confederate General Sanford Smithers - an elderly man whose claim to fame is the slaughter of a black Union Calvary Division. To round out the ""hateful eight"" picture we have Tim Roth (always a favorite of mine) as the actual Hangman of Red Rock complete with a phony British accent, suave and ironic (reminding me of Christoph Waltz's character in Django Unchained,) and Michael Madsen - a Tarantino ensemble regular as Joe Gage - a laconic stranger lurking in the background, quietly observing the scene. And then there is Bob (Demian Bichir ) dubbed ""The Mexican"" who seems to be running the joint - claiming that Minnie is out of town. For Major Marquis Warren who misses nothing - it all does not add up.<br/><br/>What ensues in this darkly lit claustrophobic space with occasional bursts of light from the door opening and closing by the storm's wind is mayhem. Tarantino's ability to use language is irresistibly seductive and I was never bored. Shards from words piercing the atmosphere infuse the room with a straining tension. Rapier wit together with brutish violence dominate the expansive monologues. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is interesting in that of all Tarantino's movies - this one is intentionally the most constrained by the oppressive limited space; ultimately there is only the outside and the inside."
"antharper","7","3","19","4 January 2016"," Everything is great, just the story is slow and lacking.
","Very early on in the film there is this beautiful close up shot of the horses pulling the waggon through the snow, and I thought to myself 'this is going to be great'.<br/><br/>And it was. The cinematography, the score, the characters, the acting (Tim Roth especially), all of it was top notch. But the story and the length of the movie let it down. The movie spent an hour introducing the first four characters, which could arguably have been shortened to fifteen or twenty minutes at most. Things only get interesting at about the one and three quarter hours mark when the tension starts to rise between the characters and all hell breaks loose, becoming more distinctly Tarantino like (you'll know what I mean), rather than a low budget western made in the fifties.<br/><br/>All in all, it's worth a watch if you're into 'who done it?' types of movies, but don't go into it thinking you're going to get Kill Bill meets the American West, like my friends did."
"tgrock","7","3","19","3 January 2016"," Good Film, but Tarantino's Weakest
","The Hateful Eight is basically Reservoir Dogs in a Western setting, but it takes twice as long to tell the story. The reason for this is that it shows the back story of the situation in great detail unlike Reservoir Dogs. The first hour takes places outside the box and the rest of it in it.<br/><br/>This first hour could have been taken out of the movie though or edited significantly. The dialogue in this first hour supplies a lot of back story for the main characters, but then they talk about this AGAIN and AGAIN as each main character introduces himself to the another new character. Hence, the movie could have just started with the characters in the box.<br/><br/>I adore all of Quentin Tarantino's films, but I have to say The Hateful Eight is his weakest. Even though he is a master of building up suspense, the journey to the suspense takes way too long. (The payoff is great though.) The biggest detractor to The Hateful Eight is that it's not very fun. All of his previous pictures had moments of fun, whether through humor, the alluring dialogue, the style, or the action scenes. Here the tone is bleak throughout and the dialogue is very dry."
"ejomayes-829-146276","9","3","19","3 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight is a depraved delight
","In keeping with the vast majority of Tarantino's oeuvre, The Hateful Eight is a whip-smart smorgasbord of snappy dialogue and visual splendor. True fans of the perpetual envelope-pusher will delight in the vinegary verbal exchanges shared between his richest cast of characters yet; a motley crew of cold-hearted criminals whose over-the-top personalities are instrumental in keeping the audience engaged for the entirety of the film's rather outrageous three-hour runtime. Master cinematographer Robert Richardson expertly captures all of the glorious slow-burn action while employing an arsenal of old- school techniques that leave the film feeling pleasantly reminiscent of an earlier, tried- and-true Western aesthetic. As a partial homage to the gunslinging greatness of the 60s' Spaghetti Westerns,The Hateful Eight comes complete with a marvelous score from legendary composer Ennio Morricone, a beautifully ominous drone that works to heighten the hair-trigger tension that comes to a boil in the film's final act. The real cherries on top of this cinematic sundae, however, are the Oscar-worthy performances delivered by Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggins, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Each brings a uniquely unhinged authenticity to their respective characters that commands the audience's full attention whenever their bruised, bloodied and endlessly expressive faces appear on screen. Speaking of blood, I feel obligated to issue the following understated warning for those unfamiliar with Tarantino's work: it's violent, and The Hateful Eight is no exception. For those able to stomach a high level of gross-out gore and cringe-inducing brutality, this film is a guilty pleasure that's as cool as a Wyoming blizzard."

It is like being with QT for that duration.<br/><br/>The movie is the best so far by Quentin surpassing Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds.

The impact of this movie is such that you may watch it in summers but you feel the coldness of blizzard even then. There are some negative reviews circulating on internet and those are very right! because those reviews validates an average mind, a mind who will tell them to chew on the rose rather than smelling it. <br/><br/>Anyone who can just soak in or feel or get into the movie while watching it, will love it by the core of the heart no matter she/he can be a fan of Woodey Allan or Tinto Brass."

","I have waited for this movie for a long time and I must say it's worth every bit. Went to the theater with high expectation and I actually got more than expected. Quentin Tarantino showed us that we can still make classic movies based on characters and dialogues. It reminded me of ""12 Angry Men"" where you will not get a single chance to get bored. Every character is important, no one can be unnoticed. And as the name suggest, you'll hate them all. In the era of overdoing vfx, this is surely a treat for true movie lovers who want to cherish a movie for a long time, not just 3 hours. It not just entertain you, it'll keep you guessing till the last scene. ""The Hateful Eight"" is a perfect example of how to make movies without depending on vfx and it surely should be included in the curriculum for the film students. Last but not least, even if you're not a fan of Quentin Tarantino, go for this movie. Perfect casting, trademark Tarantino wit, stunning cinematography, unique background score, it has everything to keep you glued with your seat for 3 long hours."
"scotthduke","9","3","20","3 January 2016"," The Great Hateful Eight
","Quentin Tarantino did it, again. I went in knowing very little about it, which is what I like to do because otherwise you set expectations subconsciously. At any rate, his style of directing and writing has always been one to, at minimum, wake up the viewer from the typical cinematic experience we're used to. I've made it a point to see his films on the big screen because I know I'll be shocked. This film is no different. There are great landscapes and smart conversation in the opening that eventually lead to the destination where this film unfolds. It's broken up into chapters with a straight forward story with only one instance of flashing back. Its not your typical western, and you shouldn't expect it to be coming from Quentin. Definitely see it while its in theaters, and if you really appreciate film - you can catch it in road show format. See the film's website for locations near you showing in 70MM."

","Tarantino grows up<br/><br/>More mature cinematography: The cinematography in the outdoors scenes (first 20 minutes) is thoughtful and evocative.<br/><br/>More mature dialogue: The best dialogue Tarantino has written yet, thanks to a more nuanced political awareness than ever before. <br/><br/>More mature plot: The forces at work in the Hateful Eight are more complicated than the usual ""Tarantino's revenge story"". The Hateful Eight keeps us guessing until the end, and this means there's more room for the viewer to think, rather than just feel.<br/><br/>I had thought that Tarantino was slowly winding down as a filmmaker. Now I can't wait to see where he goes next."
"iatamargo","8","3","20","2 January 2016"," A unique addition to Tarantino's filmography, though not one of his best
","""The Hateful Eight"" is a great addition to Tarantino's filmography, but not one of his best films. Though it bears similarities to ""Django Unchained"" in the sense that it is a Western concerned with black history and containing a black lead character, and to ""Reservoir Dogs"" in terms of its locked-room plot structure, large set of characters questioning each others' motives, and inclusion of Michael Madsen and Tim Roth, ""The Hateful Eight"" manages to feel unique and new. Perhaps this freshness is due to the film's snowy setting, a rarity in the genre apart from Sergio Corbucci's fantastic Spaghetti Western ""The Great Silence,"" or its slower, more focused and mature tone as compared to Tarantino's explosive, ADHD fantasies exemplified by ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" or the fact that ""The Hateful Eight"" is much more of a pointed ""message film"" than any of his other movies, which as he notes, are essentially pulp fiction. Regardless, it stands alone among QT's filmography and feels like an exciting and new direction for him as filmmaker.<br/><br/>The film, however, has some issues and, for these reasons, is not one of his best. The biggest problem with the film is that it is meant to be a pressure cooker, in which each successive conversation raises the tension so that viewers will eventually wait breathlessly, racked in anticipation of a sudden eruption of violence, just as filmgoers would as they watch a young scream queen search the house after she hears a bump in the night. Apart from a great scene between Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Dern, the film never quite reaches its pressure cooker aspirations to gradually reach the heights of this mode of dialogue, done better in the opening to ""Inglourious Basterds"" and the classic ""Say what one more time!"" scene in ""Pulp Fiction."" <br/><br/>Tarantino's troubles with transitions are particularly noticeable here as well. Though he has been excellent at covering up this weakness in his direction by using his signature chapter breaks separating tonally distinct sections, and by stopping music abruptly and comically to start scenes of dialogue after sections without it, these transition methods seem clunky and overused in ""The Hateful Eight,"" particularly at the halfway mark when the movie completely switches tones. As ""The Hateful Eight"" is more of a gradual, tension builder, the script would have benefited by smoother transitions, slowly moving the tone of the movie towards its eventual bloodbath/gore-fest feel by introducing this ambiance gradually. As it is, however, the chapter breaks, abrupt musical cut-offs, and various tone shifts dissipate tension rather than build it.<br/><br/>In addition to falling short of its nerve-racking aims and being plagued by pressure-deflating transitions, the use of 70 mm film stock, though perfect for the wonderful landscape shots concentrated at the beginning of the film, is unnecessary as the film almost entirely takes place in John ""The Hangman"" Ruth's stagecoach and Minnie's Haberdashery. The spectacle of these early shots left me wanting to go outside, just as much as the freezing characters wanted stay in. The use of 70 mm thus felt like a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Finally, though I appreciated the film's positive message of uniting blacks and whites in the cause of ""justice,"" which is particularly timely in light of the Black Lives Matter movement, it came off as simplistic and naive, ignorant of the crux of the problem in our current racial tensions: what is ""justice"" in these flashpoint legal cases that have polarized our country, and how does each person's race enlighten or obfuscate his or her view of it? Though ""The Hateful Eight"" flirts with these questions during great conversations between Major Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), Sheriff Mannix (Walter Goggins), and General Smithers (Bruce Dern) about their sordid histories in the Civil War, an ultimate message dealing with these complex themes would have been much more resonant with modern American audiences. Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" feels more current in this regard.<br/><br/>All of my criticisms aside, ""The Hateful Eight"" is a great film. The music by Ennio Morricone, featuring his trademark Spaghetti Western sound with a twist of Blaxploitation bass line a la ""Shaft!"" perfectly summarizes the film's inspirations and aspirations, and is just plain fun. It's one of the best original soundtracks in years.<br/><br/>The characters are even more fun than the music: Kurt Russell's ""Hangman"" Ruth, ostensibly a Snake Plissken BAMF is really a Jack Burton buffoon, and it's a joy to see him in this type of roll again. Samuel L. Jackson is as intimidating as ever, as is Madsen menacing. Walter Goggins is a standout as the stupid but lively ex-Confederate Chris Mannix, while Bruce Dern, Tim Roth and Jennifer Jason Leigh all do great work in their respective roles. Keep an eye out for the lesser-known James Parks as stagecoach driver O. B. and Demian Bichir as Bob, the two funniest characters in the movie.<br/><br/>As a huge Tarantino fan, saying that this is not one of his best does not mean it is in any way a bad film. Mid-level Tarantino is still better than the vast majority of movies that I see each year, and ""The Hateful Eight"" is definitely one of the best films of 2015."

","8.25 of 10. Like a sequel to Django Unchained (2012) that takes place in the wild west about, fittingly, 8 years later. It's also better largely because it is not a literal sequel.<br/><br/>Set during a harsh Wyoming winter a bit more North than the easy-to-film grounds of the Southwest, we get a look at the bounty hunters and the people with bounties on their heads - sometimes they are both. This serves up the cold, hard setting of accidental and intentional meetings that provide the base for the film and its characters. It also helps, outside of the exaggerated and excessive intro, make the length of the film feel less like walking for 2 hours naked through the snow.<br/><br/>Despite complaints about the length, it does go swiftly, when it's not narrating, with the combination of satire, mystery, and gore-horror-like scenes. Whether it's skill, luck, or Tarantino's recent affection for seemingly expired actresses.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, when I saw the good, but not nearly as great, Gun Woman (2014) last year I was thinking that was a film Quentin would like to make, but definitely not a western. It makes me think that inspired him to feature Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is definitely the star in this."
"i-am-so-original","6","3","20","24 December 2015"," Tarantino wallows in blood and carnage, and delivers the first disappointing movie of his career
","Tarantino has always been known for his outlandish violence, his offensive dialogue, and his inappropriate story lines. However, like a true filmmaker, he has used these devices towards his own strengths, crafting nuanced and complex movies that just so happen to have a lot of blood. But with ""The Hateful Eight,"" fittingly, his eighth movie, Tarantino instead abandons these complexities, and instead gives us a fairly simple indulgence in violence and masochism.<br/><br/>I won't summarize the plot, as we're on IMDb, and judging by how you're on the user reviews, you have a general idea of what the movie entails. <br/><br/>THE GOOD<br/><br/>The film is loaded with Tarantino's signature hypnotic dialogue, and the performances are all outstanding, chief among them being Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who has been nominated for a Golden Globe for her venomous, hate-filled performance. The cinematography, at least for the first twenty minutes or so, is breathtaking in its gorgeous snowy vistas and the rough, mountainous terrain. Even when the film moves into the stagecoach, the film looks beautiful and fittingly claustrophobic, as the camera always seems to frame characters perfectly during rousing monologues.<br/><br/>THE BAD<br/><br/>Even if the dialogue is your typical Tarantino fare, it seems like it could have used some editing this go round. Tarantino has always been one for indulgence, but this movie takes it to new, and often exhausting heights. This is a two hour movie stretched perilously over three, and the dialogue suffers for it. Characters babble on at times, and the same themes are rehashed throughout. While ""Django"" used racism towards thematic relevance and a social observation, ""Eight"" instead uses it as a means to reach the violence. It has no meaning, no gravitas, outside of being a means to an end. <br/><br/>I also got the sense that this movie is violent simply for the sake of being violent. After bloated, almost boring hours of hearing these characters talk, the blood comes fast and hard, and it seems like Tarantino is simply using this movie as a statement. He's saying, ""Yes, I am violent. Just watch this."" The movie seems like an indulgence on his part. It often doesn't reach farther than being a blood-soaked romp. <br/><br/>OVERALL<br/><br/>Is it a bad movie? No, of course not. It's probably impossible for Tarantino to make an inherently bad movie at this point in his career. But what it is is an excuse for a proved, controversial director to pride himself on his excesses, whether it be through tiresome talking scenes, unneeded language, or excessive blood and carnage. It's Tarantino being Tarantino, and it's more than likely that his fans will lap it up. But for everyone else, the movie is an excuse for a director to pride himself on what he does, even if that means creating a movie without purpose or any sense of timing or humility."

","The Hateful Eight and is set after the American civil war and follows eight people trapped in one location because of a blizzard but as said by Kurt Russell ""one of them fellas is not what he says he is"".I thought this film was excellent,out of Tarantino's eight films he has only let me down once with Death Proof, his direction of this film is masterful. This film is almost 3 hours long and it's almost nothing but talking and still you don't get bored because of the excellent writing. The 70 mm camera is used for some beautiful shots of the woods and the cabin where they are stuck as well. The casting in this film was spot-on, Samuel L. Jackson gave what is probably his best performance since Pulp Fiction,the rest of the cast did a phenomenal job with a little short screen appearance by someone I won't spoil.I won't give away the ending but will say that the third act had me biting my nails.In conclusion I think this film well deserves your time and money and might be one of my favorite Tarantino films."
"nick-sultana","10","2","11","17 January 2016"," Tarantino At His Usual Best
","Having been a big lover and fan for Quentin Tarantino's films since witnessing Reservoir Dogs back in the early 2000's, we come have reached to his 8th feature film in his amazing career and now he returns to another 'Western' based film but not a direct sequel to Django Unchained but as an epic, 3 ½ hour presentation called 'The Hateful Eight'. Jay and I (along with some of our friends) had taken the opportunity to watch this in the glorious Ultra Panavision 70mm print that Tarantino had used when filming this movie (he calls it the 'Roadshow version') and features an overture and intermission segments that appear in this version but the digital release (that's due for release on January 21st) will be altered down to a less wider screen size and loses some of the shots that don't appear well on standard digital formats but most of the plot will still be intact but runs at a shorter running time of 167 minutes compared to the 187 minute version. What makes it so 'glorious' is that the picture format is bigger, wider and the vintage camera system used produces a sharper and clearer image that suppresses today's HD format. The result is an amazing experience that will impress but can be seen at only exclusive cinemas that have his format, so fingers crossed if this does surface on the Blu-Ray release later this year.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and easy to follow in five chapters, we first meet Major Marquis Warren stranded with three dead bounties being transported to Red Rock and hitches a ride with the well-known bounty hunter John Ruth and his prisoner Daisy Domergue who he plans to see hanged for her crimes in Red Rock. John is suspicious for anyone trying to steal Daisy for her substantial bounty from him, and along the trip they also meet Former Lost-Causer militiaman and the supposed new 'Sheriff' of Red Rock Chris Mannix who convinces John to hitch a ride to town in his coach. Having a wild blizzard fast approaching behind them, they stop for the night to get shelter from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, where other unknown lodgers reside from the blizzard; Bob (the caretaker of the Haberdashery while the owners are on leave), Oswaldo Mobray (the hangman of Red Rock), Joe Gage (a quiet cowboy on his way to his mother's) and Sanford Smithers (a former Confederate general of the Civil War). A suspicious Ruth disarms all but Warren, but it becomes a long night of suspicion, deception and whom to trust for all these eight strangers as who is really telling the truth.<br/><br/>The first act of the film is more of a character build up, where the audience is introduced to the eight strangers where they state where they come from and what is their purpose to the plot. The casting here is well chosen, with Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madson, Demián Bichir and Bruce Dern each playing the leading 8 characters while there is a small supporting cast that handle themselves easily and don't overthrow the leads. The best performances are a tough to pick as all the leading cast gave solid performances, but I give high approvals to Jackson, Russell Leigh, Goggins and Roth for making their characters believable and kept it going throughout the five chapters. The second act of THE picks up more on the brutal, over the top and bloody violence that occurs in Tarantino's films while resolving the plot and getting closer to the climax that gets bold and suspenseful, the results are great but there are moments where it could you make you feel uneasy and quench in your seats. The plot overall is great and carries the spirit of a Western film and as well a stage play but on the screen, but it can be long and dull ride for those who hate dialogue driven films as the violence plays out more in Act 2 but I thought each of the characters were given solid moments of seriousness, establishment and at times humour when needed.<br/><br/>The cinematography is as beautiful and detailed throughout like the recent acclaimed film 'The Revenant', having watched the 70mm print we can see that Tarantino's camera work captures not only the characters on-screen but the snowy and yet detailed environment of the mountain scenery and cabin location (as most of the film is set inside of the cabin after we are introduced to each of the eight characters). The music score here is composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone (known his musical scores for other westerns such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and other excerpts used in Tarantino's previous films) has composed an entire original score that mark not only new work in recent years but the very first film for Tarantino that uses an original score than having to used licensed music and scores from various films. The music plays out as mysterious, engaging and yet at times feels like a horror film but it suits to the film so well that it won not only a Golden Globe for Best Original Score but an Academy Award nomination in the upcoming 2016 Oscars (due for air on February 28th) alongside with nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).<br/><br/>Overall, The Hateful Eight can be seen by some as the weakest work from Tarantino as Django, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and even Reservoir still have a huge following and acclaim from fans and citric alike or seen as a great form of film but not as strong as the previous films. I however think that this is a solid presentation that keeps me hooked with character development, plot and the Tarantino quality that I have known of and earns a spot on my list of top films for 2016, alongside The Revenant."

","I've seen this movie is not getting good reviews. After reading a few I understand the viewers were disappointed somehow, probably because It's not the type of film they wanted to see. I can see this happening. <br/><br/>But The Hatefull eight is a really good film. It is not related to western movies in the way Django is, not in the same fashion, but I found it to be at the core of western pulps. It reminded me so much to the old western comic books I read when I was a child, inherited from past decades. The intrigue, the environments, the place. It was just amazing. I think that when looked at from this viewpoint, the films falls into place. It's just sound. I believe this movie is at the core of the old pulp fictions.

","Let's start with the good. The Hateful Eight is very entertaining. If you're a fan of Tarantino's style, not merely gory violence, then you will definitely like it at least. And for a three hour film it didn't feel long, or dragged out. When the credits rolled I was almost surprised that it was already over. Overall it is a good film, for the first half at least. After that is when we come to the bad.<br/><br/>Roughly around the second third of the movie all the story that was previously built gets thrown out the window. It goes in a whole new direction and not for the better, because it feels like someone just got bored with making up a mystery so they abandoned everything. The movie feels almost unfinished, especially due to all the weird edits.<br/><br/>Then of course there is the subject of violence towards its female character - Daisy. In the Kill Bill films most of the violence towards women was done by other women, it's all part of the same cartoonish world. But here, towards the end, it broke the illusion for me. It took me out of the film completely to see such violence done to a female character.<br/><br/>This could have been among my favourite's of this year, but by the end it left a bad taste in my mouth."

","The eighth film from director Quentin Tarantino brings together his stock cast for a gruesome whodunit in the wide open Wyoming winter, just after the Civil War. The gang of eight is made up of Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), ""Hangman"" John Ruth (Kurt Russell), Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), Bob (Demian Bichir), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), and O.B. (James Parks). After the script was leaked, Tarantino vowed not to make the film and turn to making one of the other projects in his reserves. I am more than happy that he changed his mind. As an avid Tarantino fan, I knew what I was getting into with this movie, although there were plenty of theatre goers who did not. Tarantino is an acquired taste, I'll concede that, but a taste that keeps on giving once one has gotten accustomed to it. <br/><br/>Our story begins as we see a stagecoach, helmed by O.B., traversing an especially brutal blizzard. Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, has himself a take and is trying to make it to the city to collect his reward. Hoping for a ride, he meets John Ruth, a fellow bounty hunter, and his take, Daisy Domergue. Reluctantly, Ruth allows Major Warren to travel with them as they are attempting to make it to a mutual friends' haberdashery to wait out a couple of days of the fierce blizzard. Once they arrive, they see the haberdashery is being taken care of by unfamiliar faces. Bob is tending to the horses and the food and there are several travelers already inside. This unexpected setup doesn't sit well with the entrusting Warren and Ruth. After questioning the temporary inhabitants, Ruth and Warren are convinced something is amiss and distinguish themselves as the seekers of truth. Committed to finding out who among them is the rat working to ensure Ms. Daisy's release, a good old-fashioned whodunit emerges. In typical Tarantino fashion, a violent outcome ensues as the mystery unfolds, and the conclusion is nothing short of the tangled sort of web Quentin is so proficient at weaving.<br/><br/>Again, it must be noted that I am a huge Tarantino fan. I tried my best to remain unbiased through this review, but that is extremely difficult. Tarantino is just a master at what he does. The camera usage in this film is incredible. There is a beautiful shot looking down on the group through rafters in the ceiling. Long shots abound in this film which remarkably captures the vast wilderness, as well as the subject on screen. One of my favorite moves was a lens change as Daisy was entertaining the group with a song. There was a pivotal scene unfolding in the background and Tarantino's shift of focus was like something out of a classic film; stunning. <br/><br/>Tarantino's camera work is unrivaled by many modern day auteurs, and much the same could be said for his writing. A Tarantino stronghold is his excellent knack for writing dialogue. The script is very dialogue heavy, and coming in at over 3 hours, could have the effect of weighing down the film. But, because it's Tarantino, I never looked at my watch until the film was over and I was walking to the car. The scenes heavy with discussion are so intimate and riddled with relatable references that the audience just becomes immersed in the oratory. There are few directors like Tarantino who become so immersed in the research of their films. History buffs will be impressed by the realism in conversation achieved with the details described between characters. Tarantino thrives when one of his characters knows something no one else does. We've got one of those characters in this film and the careful, thoughtful interrogation in hopes of revealing the information is artful, to say the least. A five-star film from an outstanding director, Quentin Tarantino! This film is a must-see for fans of the auteur. I would suggest this film also to a student of film, as long as they can overcome the violence and gore. It is really something to see such crafty camera use come together on screen. I for one, certainly hope that The Hateful Eight is far from the last Tarantino film and that he gives us much more to enjoy, and keeps them on film!"
"ReneWirtz","10","3","21","27 December 2015"," 70mm Roadshow Is Amazing Experience
","When I first learned that Quentin Tarantino's eighth movie was shot on 70mm Ultra Panavision I got quite excited. The last movie to be shot and projected in this ultra-wide format was Khartoum in 1966 so when I found out that the movie was going to go on a limited release roadshow I got quite a bit more excited. The road show is projected with analog equipment and includes 13 minutes of additional material that will not be in the digital release. At the time of typing this it might already be too late, but if you have the opportunity, go see the roadshow version.<br/><br/>I bought two tickets for the 10.55pm Boxing Day showing in the only theater in the Atlanta metro area to show the movie 8 days prior; to my surprise tickets were not sold out. My wife and I drove to the theater in Atlantic Station and we had our tickets scanned a little after 10pm. Upon entry we were given a program, beautifully made on lush paper containing beautiful photos and a little background information on the movie. Seeing the program made me realize that we were actually experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime event. After getting drinks from the concessions stand we took our place in line, since the showing that started before ours was still running. There were two snake lines, roped off in velvet. The wait was about 20 minutes and when the door opened the lines quickly moved and in less than a few minutes we sat down on the recliner seats in the upper half of the auditorium.<br/><br/>Right on time the movie started. Well, not really, the movie opened with an Overture. The overture starts the original score by Ennio Morricone, which was his first original score in 40 years! Naturally, after the overture the movie starts, a glorious 3-hour long ride. Because we went to see the roadshow version, it was analog and watching it play is like listening to music by playing a record on a turntable: it's perfectly imperfect! The movie shakes, light flickers and it shows with a little grain. This is a far cry from the current, ""perfect"" HD digital quality of most movies and TV shows. But if you love cinema, and if you are as ""old"" as I am it will transport you back in time where movies were still a wondrous and wonderful thing, it is thrilling and exciting, it is a rare treat.<br/><br/>The movie follows the quintessential Tarantino-format with the story broken down into 6 chapters (with an intermission after chapter 3!). Each chapter is announced with a title card and chapter 5 includes narration. As per usual, the chapters are not in chronological order but this time only one chapter is not in sequence, but the order makes perfect sense. As with all Tarantino's movies the language is foul and the violence is graphical and perhaps a little gratuitous, which of course, makes sense with the involvement of longtime Tarantino collaborator and The Walking Dead special effects supervisor Greg Nicotero. The wide angle, but still very close-up, camera work also pushes the viewer right into the middle of all the violence.<br/><br/>The cinematography by DP Robert Richardson is spectacular to say the least and the use of almost antiquated Ultra Panavision lenses and widescreen format are both a tribute to old Spaghetti Westerns as well as a unique approach and use of said technology. One expects many lush outdoor shots, but the overwhelming majority of the movie takes place in just two indoor locations: a stage coach and a haberdashery. This ultimately aids to focus the viewer's attention to the storyline and acting. To be fair, the story and its arc seem a little contrived but, again, this is all standard Tarantino. As is the magnificent acting. The actors portraying the eight protagonists ... or really the eight antagonists, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Demian Bichir, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern, all blend into their roles, become their characters, pretty much turning the movie into a fly-on-the-wall documentary instead. (Personally I thought it was amusing to see Tim Roth play a delightfully flamboyant English character and part of me wonders how many armchair critics will complain about Roth's fake English accent not realizing he is, in fact, a Brit.) Clearly, the roles were written with these specific actors in mind and they do not disappoint, there are several Oscar-worthy performances, with Walton Goggins' being the most noteworthy as the opportunistic would-be sheriff of Red Rock!<br/><br/>As noted above the movie is a Western, but it is not a classic one; John Wayne would be rolling over in his grave if you'd call this a classic western. Moreover, as with all Tarantino's movies there is a socio-political subtext which isn't for So, all by itself The Hateful Eight is not the best movie ever, but looking at purely at the artistic aesthetics in combination with experiencing this as the first 70mm roadshow in almost 50 years and with the first original Morricone score in 40 years, the whole package definitely became an unforgettable experience, one that may never have a repeat again. Thank you, Quentin Tarantino, for this awesome Christmas present!"
"Rendanlovell","9","3","21","26 December 2015"," A masterful film.
","Quentin Tarantinos eighth film 'The Hateful Eight' is upon us. And after seeing the film all I have to say is, go see this movie. Like, as soon as possible and, if you can, in glorious 70mm. This allows you to see the film in an ultra wide format. Not many theaters will get this awesome format so if you have a theater near you playing this film in 70mm go see it. Even if you can't view it in this special format this film still should not be missed. It's a once in a lifetime type of movie. Just being able to go see a film this good in theaters is a treat. The one thing that many are writing this film off for is it's lengthy run time. Clocking in at nearly three hours. In my opinion this makes the film that much better. Somehow Tarantino has fashioned a story that is so involving you will want more by the time it ends. The crazy part is, this isn't a new way of storytelling by any means. It follows eight (or nine depending on who you count) people that all take refuge in a lodge in order to avoid a blizzard.<br/><br/>From early on it becomes clear that no one really likes each other. Slowly, their hate for each other begins to come out in the worst ways possible. It's such a simple plot that it's a wonder how extraordinary it is. Just like his other films this is due to seriously impressive writing. The dialogue is razor sharp in each and every scene. <br/><br/>And, as an added bonus, the characters are very fleshed out. Each one has a different voice on each situation that comes up and they react as they feel they should. The film never uses its characters as vessels to move the plot along. No, 'The Hateful Eight' evolves as our characters do. Each separate action comes with a reaction that feels completely natural for the film.<br/><br/>This leads to some of the funniest scenes of any movie this year. It's pitch black humor stems from the loathing for one another. But this isn't all the film has to say either. In fact this film, unlike some of his others, has a very mature subplot. A subplot that isn't just relevant in the stories universe but our day and age as well. It talks a lot about race relations and prejudices. And although we may hate some people, it's in our human nature to band together against someone who is infinitely worse without a second thought. <br/><br/>It's an interesting idea that I have witnessed first hand. You may dislike someone at work or something until someone worse comes along that both of you hate. Then, suddenly, you become friends with that person in order to expel the universally hated person. It's on these reasons that 'The Hateful Eight' thrives. It's a superb film anchored by an excellent cast playing excellent characters. Characters that you care very much about. Although it has a more mature plot it's still a whole mess of fun. It's bloody, hilarious, and pumping with energy. If there is a theater nearby playing this film, go see it."

","Absolutely brutal, and I'm taking a half-star just for that reason.<br/><br/>Kidding (mostly.)<br/><br/>Tarantino really pulled one off this time, and that's saying something for a guy with films like ""Pulp Fiction"" & the ""Kill Bill"" series under his belt. His other films, written or directed, never quite reached those apexes, but were still good popcorn fare. He's back and definitely flexing his chops with this one, and he, and his excellent cast (Jennifer Jason Leigh nearly out-boxed Samuel L. Jackson! Nearly.) Complete with signature snappy dark comedic dialogue.<br/><br/>Don't know if I'll revisit it - the violence really is off-putting for me - but it *is* worth a revisit."
"tye1138","7","3","21","26 December 2015"," One step forward for film two steps back for Quentin Tarantino
","This year has been pretty uneventful film wise. With a few decent indy's and very few decent studio films, the expectations were high for the ""end of year"" academy nod films like 'The Revenant', 'Carol' and 'Hateful Eight'. I personally have been excited about 'Hateful Eight' since I learned about it being shot on 70mm using Ultra Panavision anamorphic lenses, photochemical finish and distribution on 70mm. Being a cinephile, my excitement for 'Hateful Eight' was pretty high and after watching some test footage in June at cinegear expo, I was aesthetic with the results and was looking forward to the final piece. <br/><br/>I was able to see 'Hateful Eight' about three weeks before it's release during a special private screening for industry members. I was extremely excited and I wasn't shocked when I left the theater dismayed with what I saw. I knew from the very first trailer, I wouldn't like the film. The score, cinematography, acting and beautiful locations, couldn't help the weak, unrealistic and completely plagiarized story. Yet, I was excited to see it as many times as I could, to get the 70mm experience and see how different theaters presented it. <br/><br/>After my third screening, I've come to terms with 'Hateful Eight', it's pro's and con's. <br/><br/>It's very easy to come down on this film harshly. It's a bloody massacre with some audience cringing moments that are really unnecessary. Its also a pretty weak story, a re-hash of Duel at Ichijoji Temple mixed with some classic television western's. However, Quentin clearly wanted to make an almost silly western, something over the top and very circumstantial, that was his goal. After meeting him in person and talking about the film a bit, I understood what he was trying to do and ya know what, it actually does work. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not personally in love with 'Hateful Eight', I think it could have been a lot better. However, it's fantastic cinematography, wonderful score, beautiful locations, excellent production design, fantastic costumes and phenomenal cast, really make it worth watching. Those who can get past the rip off nonsensical story, who can laugh at the silly moments and enjoy a fun piece of entertainment, will really get a lot out of this movie. It's nowhere near the caliber of 'Inglorious Bastards' or ""Django', both of which were masterpieces of cinema, but it's not that far away. I have a hard time giving it a bad score because I did see it three times in the theater! I also can't give it an excellent score because it's not excellent. So I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10, which is pretty realistic in my world."
"SquigglyCrunch","9","3","22","30 December 2015"," A Different but Still Great Tarantino Movie
","I was somewhat skeptical about this movie. I haven't seen a whole lot of Tarantino's movies, but I've seen enough to know that his movies are quite over the top in terms of violence. So when I heard that he was making a near 3-hour drama I was curious as to how that would turn out. The ratings plummeted after it's release, but I still wanted to see it. And I sure am happy that I did. <br/><br/>The plot is almost non-existent until a little over halfway through the movie. With a movie of this length you'd think that would be a bad thing, but the movie up until then was still very interesting. You get some character development, plenty of built of tension, and even a bit of blood. When the plot does pick up, however, it becomes clear who made the movie, and it's awesome. Near the end of the movie there is a bit of back story which I thought would be where the movie ended, so I was disappointed, but it continued after that, which allowed it to redeem itself. <br/><br/>The characters are the primary focus of the film it seems. Much of the movie is spent either in a carriage or a saloon. There's lot's of dialogue and that helps to develop all the characters, which is very interesting. <br/><br/>Overall The Hateful Eight is a great addition to Tarantino's list of movies. The plot is good and the characters are great. The back story felt a little forced and unexpected at first, but the movie quickly picked itself back up. In the end I would definitely recommend The Hateful Eight. I can see why people wouldn't like this movie, but I think you just have to go in to it knowing that it's a drama, not an action movie."

","This is my first time writing a review on IMDb, One thing that i'm gonna say is, Tarantino did it again. this is just like. Reservoir Dogs with a different setting & era, and also so much better than that if you ask me. Unfortunately, there is so many people here who hated and bad criticize this great masterpiece. They said this is a boring movie, dude, i think you're not that kind of a man who loves a long drama movie with an unexpected action in it, you're just that kind of a man who loves a blow up action movie with so many things get burned in it. And again, they said this is a pointless movie, boy, if you said something like that, it means you didn't get the story aren't ya?! You guys don't have to mind what haters say about this, just ignore them, start to watch and I'm sure you gonna love this Quentin's new masterpiece, highly recommended from me, very worth the money of a ticket And by the way, this is an update for my top 5 favorite Tarantino's movie after watching this: 1.Pulp Fiction 2.The Hateful Eight 3.Django Unchained 4.Reservoir Dogs 5.Inglourious Basterds"
"natione","5","2","12","15 January 2016"," Νot bad, but not good either
","I really liked all of Tarantino's previous films, but this one I don't understand. Too many things in this film seem out of place, too many dialogues are repeated over and over again and most of the scenes last more than they should have. This movie could easily be 30 minutes shorter and still be longer than absolutely needed. <br/><br/>Now, being a Tarantino film, it shouldn't come as a surprise that everything in this movie is there because Tarantino absolutely wanted it to be, so everything has a meaning in the greater sense of things this movie wants to say or project. While I can get behind this in some cases, I couldn't find the meaning and purpose for many scenes and/or dialogues, or maybe even characters. This movie seems like 10 smaller ones (with variable length), cobbled together with only a thin connecting tissue holding them in order to form a coherent movie. <br/><br/>It's not all bad though. Samuel Jackson is predictably good, so is Jennifer Jason Leigh. There are a few good laughs in the movie as well. <br/><br/>I think it's a pure 5/10 movie: not bad, but not good either."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","6","2","12","11 January 2016"," Flawed, fun in places
","If Quentin Tarantino has achieved anything in his love letters to the spaghetti western genre, it's his notable subtraction of the noodles from aforementioned dish, leaving decadent swaths of scarlet marinara sauce to be flung about the screen as blazing bullets rock various characters to their bones, sending blood all over the place in quantities that defy physics or biology. He did it with Django, and he does it again with The Hateful Eight, a somber, simmering snow opera that fell just south of winning me over entirely. Don't get me wrong: there's much merit to be found here, and as usual QT has a solid gold ear for dialogue that is as pleasing to the ear as Ennio Morricone's unusually restrained, palm sweating score. He also shows his uncanny knack for chasing awesome actors out of the woodwork and casting them in his films. In his attempts to resurrect 70mm panavision he has achieved undisputed success. I'm also a sucker for both Agatha Christie style mysteries and snowbound locations (and what locations!!), both of which are in abundance here. And yet.. something just didn't quite click for me, story wise. Perhaps it's the fact that trailers had worked my imagination up to impossible heights of intrigue that couldn't be brought to the table with this tale. In that regard, I suppose it's my own fault. In any case, the eventual revelations just didn't feel as profound and fitting after having sat through the endless, tantalizing set up. But oh, what a set up. QT deliberately marinates his characters in a stew of unease and malcontent, each player a grizzled picture of vague evil intent, firing missiles of distrust and loathing at one another until the ill will is as thick as the snow drifts they fight through. In the throes of a gathering blizzard, bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell in a sly nod of the head to beloved R.J. Macready, only saltier and far meaner) leads shackled prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh in the best performance of the film) to the town of Red Rock, to be hung. Along the way, and with much chatter, he picks up two stragglers: pissy fellow hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L.Jackson) and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). They arrive at Minnie's Haberdashery, an oasis in the sea of winter, where four other undesirables have already shacked up in refuge: Owaldo Mobrey (Tim Roth earns his keep and then some) a self proclaimed hangman with some serious pep in his step, crusty confederate Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), Bob the Mexican (Demian Bichir is restrained comic perfection) and dangerous looking cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen, that gravel voiced wildcat, is always awesome). They all hunker down to ride out the storm and quickly begin to realize that one or more amongst them isn't who they say they are, and there's devilry afoot. Sound intriguing? It did to me too, and I can't say much about what exactly let me down without giving stuff away, but it just felt like such a pedestrian knockoff of a second act after the absolute slow burning joy of a guessing game which preceded it. Maybe it's a bit like a Christmas present: you spend months in a giddy daze wondering what you'll get, you get there Christmas morning and there your present is: shiny, gleaming and filled with endless possibility, but unmistakably shaped by your specific anticipation of what lays within. You open your present... and there it is, mystery evaporated, no longer a present but an actual object, or in this case a story that you must wrestle with to appease the lingering wonder of what you expected, as opposed to what you got. I know it's too much to expect every film to be that perfect Christmas present that is as satisfying wrapped as unwrapped, but with QT's stuff I feel I always act that way a bit, having pictured my definitive version of the films before having seen them, and feelng somewhat underwhelmed. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it: It's chock full of macabre surprises, earnest performances and expectedly nasty violence. Jennifer Jason Leigh owns as Daisy, a frothing feral beast. Leigh has no shortage of courage in taking on courageous, unflattering roles, and she dives right into this one with fists and teeth clenched, eyes narrowed and a steely will to survive. It's truly a blessing to see her on the big screen again and I hope to see more in the future. There's one casting decision which almost ruined the last act for me. I won't spoil it here but the 'actor' in question is so unbelievably untalented and sticks out like ten sore thumbs in his ineptitude, really making me wonder about QT's sanity. The rest of the cast makes up for it in spades though, particularly Madsen, Roth and Russell. Goggins also gets loads to do and does it with grinning flair that would make Boyd Crowder proud. The cinematography by legendary Robert Richardson is staggeringly beautiful. The wintry Vistas sweep by in splendor, eventually moving inward to the firelit cabin where everything has a burnished, lived-in texture that's transfixing to look at. If only the story had the weight and impact I was expecting, I could have given this glowing accolades, but there's always next time. Gorgeous Tarantino outing with a cast that chomps at the bit relentlessly, and although it ultimately falls short, it's quite the piece of cinema all the same."

","When Tarantino movie comes to theaters it is usually always a special event, and I watched all of his movies since Reservoir dogs in theaters, but I think this was the last one. This movie only confirmed that Tarantino is overrated for some time.<br/><br/>First part of the movie until break (before poisoning coffee) was boring. Dialogues by which you can recognize Tarantino, but they already become shabby and uninteresting- seen already in past movies, but this time with a little lower quality. In role of Tim Roth are forced characters played by Christopher Waltz in Django and Bastards. It seems like Tarantino wanted Waltz but it would be stupid same role 3 times in a row so this was compromise. <br/><br/>After the coffee poisoning comes more interesting period, but unfortunately only for a short time, coming to an end with lots of twists and unnecessarily too much blood spoils everything. I know that people will say it's Tarantino, but he must evolve, he was once a revolutionary, now it is no longer nor original nor interesting.<br/><br/>Music Ennio Morricone, that part I like, not the rest of the music.<br/><br/>Only Reservoir dogs and Pulpfiction were very good (masterpieces) Tarantino movies, everything else is overrated and he is living on past glory. All movies are in the same mold - dialogue, music, characters, actors ..."
"i-rispin","9","2","12","10 January 2016"," Hateful 9 (out of 10)
","No-one luxuriates in language and characterisation like Tarantino, and how his actors revel in the delivery of his lines. Walton Goggins' gives a bravura performance with camp flourishes, as the pitiable and at times Gollumesque maybe sheriff Chris Mannix. Jennifer Jason-Lee deserves an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Daisy Domergue. Whilst this is a long film, it's not like you didn't know what to expect. For my taste, the use of the 'n' word became childish after a while, as if Tarantino acknowledges that it's taboo, and decides to break it over and over again, like a big naughty toddler. The only flaw, however."

","I know this film won't be for everybody. It can be excessive, sure. But, if you're a fan of Tarantino I think you'll really like this. It has the stylized violence, the witty dialogue, the stand out characters you've to come expect and enjoy from his films. <br/><br/>That being said, it wasn't my favourite Tarantino film. I didn't start really LOVING the film until almost half way through. It was hard for me to find a character that I truly liked and wanted to root for. Every one of them is truly awful. I guess that's to be expected though when the film is called The HATEFUL Eight. Tim Roth was a little too cartoon-y, Walter Goggins was a little too stereotypical hick. If I had to pick a MVP for the first half, I would go with Samuel L Jackson. He had the best performance out of the bunch especially his ""pictures in your head"" scene. Even though I instantly disliked his character at that point. <br/><br/>The second half though really picked up for me. I liked the ""whodunnit"" nature. And despite what I said about Walter Goggins before, this where I think he shined and actually became my favourite character overall. Not only did he have the comedic timing when necessary, but I especially loved the scene between him and Jennifer Jason Leigh when she's trying to bargain with him. <br/><br/>I also really loved the score for this film, and thought that deserves a shout out. The production design and costumes were pretty great as well. Make-up was good except I think they could have tried to make Jennifer Jason Leigh's black eye more realistic. It kind of looked like it was just make-up applied around her eye. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed watching the movie. Would recommend."

","Wow, I just watched this, and it was so great! It's a big movie, it's a slow movie, it has very a classical feel to it. The photography is just so good, those snowy mountains and the inside of the fireplace wood house, with all it's details, wow. As good is the outstanding and special score, which enhances the picture so perfectly. The acting is very detailed and entertaining, there were also some hilarious character-driven jokes. But it's for adults, don't take your little kid with you for this... There is blood and brutal violence, but gladly this movie is not about that. Sometimes Tarantino does violence for it's own sake, but not this time. Nonetheless it's part of this story. Also the ending is perfect, but I won't spoil it for you. There are some twists during the storytelling, but not the lame, cheap, overdone and unbelievable type we get so often. And the movie wasn't boring for a second, I was always very interested what would happen next. I don't always like Tarantino movies, I didn't like Django and Kill Bill that much, but he always brings quality movie-making, there can be no doubt about that. My favourite of his movies was ""Inglorious Basterds"", but this is as good as that was. This hasn't been of course the greatest movie I ever saw, don't get me wrong. But it was damn fine entertainment and experience.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: of course, if you have attention span problems, or if you _only_ like to watch 3D action video gameplay movies, like the _new_ Star Wars (grrrr) or all the Marvel products, and if you can't live without a constantly shaky, zoomy cam, which cuts every 2 seconds to let you feel ""the action"", you won't like this. You also won't like this, if you need melodrama in every movie you see, this isn't about saving the world or love."
"sparemethedetails-805-162279","7","2","12","9 January 2016"," Its a good film, but it has many, many problems...
","On the plus side the second half of the film is funny and engaging. Once the story gets going it is a good story, with a decent amount of violence. I liked the music, it enhanced the paranoia in the room (although i wouldn't call in 'classic' Ennio Morricone)<br/><br/>Now the problems...<br/><br/>It is far, far too long. Nothing happens for the first 90 minutes. I know Tarantino loves his dialogue but unlike previous films where it is funny or pop-cultured, this dialogue is just plain boring. A 10 minute scene about Samuel L Jackson discussing whether he can get onto a stage coach for example. I don't even remember what happened for the first half hour of them being in the cabin. The first half of the film was an hour too long...half an hour would have been plenty to set up for the second half. <br/><br/>Although I am a fan of the violence and swearing, again it was taken too far. This film almost seemed like a Tarantino parody film. The violence seemed done for the sake of it in places. It felt like Tarantino was just going through the motions of making a film, like he had a list of cliché things to put in, ticking them off as he included them<br/><br/>The writing was weak, and there were plot holes everywhere. It seemed like Tarantino knew how he wanted the film to end but didn't know how to get there so just shoe-horned in plot. For example wouldn't it have been simpler if the 4 men just shot and killed Kurt Russell and SLJ as they came through the door? What exactly was their plan? Poison the coffee and hope all would drink it at the same time? Why did Channing Tatum shoot SLJ, then wait underground while he got himself onto the bed (very injured) so he could point a gun at him? None of it made sense if you probe even a little deeper. <br/><br/>Why shoot the film with panoramic cameras in the setting with beautiful western vistas, only to set the whole thing in one room?<br/><br/>Then there were the little annoying Tarantino 'quirks'...The yellow titles worked well in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, they were OK in Inglourious Basterds and Django, but it felt completely out of place in a western. If you want to pay homage to your favourite genre of films (which he clearly did as he persuaded Ennio Morricone out of western-retirement, and used panoramic cameras) don't slap large yellow titles all over it. Why was there a New Zealander in the film? Completely out of place. Why the ridiculous Tarantino voice-over halfway through the film explaining things which really didn't need explaining (a 2-second shot of Daisy seeing someone poison the coffee would have sufficed) Of course he did all these things because he always has, and is so stubborn about how he makes films he couldn't ever change. <br/><br/>The best way to describe the film is that he went 'too Tarantino'. He lost sight of making a good film in order to make a 'Tarantino film'<br/><br/>I rated the film a 7 despite the numerous problems because I am a sucker for his style of filmmaking, but my rating is going down the more I think about the film"

","Breathtaking cinematography presents a great contrast, in the vast, open, desolate land (Colorado, standing in for Wyoming) in the first 45 minutes, and even in the confines of the haberdashery. The relatively small space is still photographed to appear massive, and in great detail. We're sealed in there, by the nearly blinding snowstorm, these eight disparate characters, and remarkably beautiful lighting.<br/><br/>The dialogue was sharply written and delivered impeccably by all involved, especially the under-used Bruce Dern. Some of Kurt Russell's lines quotes, nearly verbatim, lines from The Thing (a film which I enjoyed when younger, but upon rewatch last year, I hated, and didn't even bother finishing) Even the basic premise of grumpy people trapped in one location during a blizzard, while facing certain death from an unseen enemy, recalled that film's same basic idea. <br/><br/>For the first two hours, this film is a great, wild ride, some of the most fun I've had in the cinema this year. Unfortunately, the film goes on for an hour too long, presenting a couple of twists which make the entire ordeal seem pointless. If Captain Cupcakes was in the cellar waiting to shoot them all along, why didn't he do it when they walked in the door at the start? Was he just waiting to hear Jackson's story about (allegedly) forcing Dern's adult son to blow him, and listen to Leigh serenade them on acoustic guitar? <br/><br/>That odd twist made the film largely seem pointless, and made me wonder why this basically eight-act film was going on for three hours, when it just spiralled further and further out of control in the final 45 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for its writing, cinematography, and acting, but just be prepared for an absurd, blood-drenched just for the sake of being blood-drenched final third."

","Will attempt not to spoil too much about this epic yet contained and intentionally claustrophobic Western by Quentin Tarantino, but that's after having to disclose it's only a Western in the Civil War time period, rural-rough location, dramatic score, and dusty, cut-throat characters. THE HATEFUL EIGHT is really a Mystery, and for the most part, could have been set in any century involving an eclectic roomful of people, and, as already known/shown in the Samuel L. Jackson-led expository trailers, somebody's not who they're supposed to be.<br/><br/>The first act overrides Tarantino's last venture simply by looking and feeling like we're really outdoors as opposed to a contrived exterior set, which DJANGO UNCHAINED, especially during the sequence following the opening credits, really seemed like...<br/><br/>With gorgeous wide shots of snowy mountainous regions and a soundtrack by none other than Spaghetti Western guru Ennio Morricone, HATEFUL sounds like the real thing while you can genuinely feel the freezing cold as a stagecoach full of our central characters, including Kurt Russell's fitfully nicknamed bounty hunter The Hangman is bringing Jennifer Jason Leigh's grotesque white trash Wanted killer, with more bruises than brains, to the town of Red Rock... alive, not dead... while semi comic-relief Walt Goggins plays a supposedly future sheriff and last but not least, Sam Jackson, as Major Marquis Warren, explains what's up, both on the road and within our central location where 95% of the picture takes place: a barroom/way-station where no one can leave to Red Rock (a sort of geographical McGuffin) since there's a big bad blizzard raging outside.<br/><br/>Although Tarantino has publicly denounced John Ford as any kind of Western Genre influence, leaning more on Sam Peckinpah and of course, Sergio Leone, some of the best and most effective character-developing dialogue takes place inside the vehicle itself, and is reminiscent of what's arguably Ford's best film, STAGECOACH, that catapulted John Wayne's career...<br/><br/>And if anyone on board takes the Alpha Male Wayne role it's Russell's no-nonsense John Ruth who, during this three-hour plus cinematic stage play, maintains the best verbal momentum throughout (basically doing a Duke impersonation)...<br/><br/>His anti-chemistry/reluctant-partnership is strongest with Jackson while there should have been more palpable angst towards Leigh's Daisy Domergue - whom he's literally, annoyingly chained to. Yet both seem as if they're in completely different movies, and Russell's is much better... if only he captured anyone else but Leigh, an actress that, despite being otherwise talented, is downright embarrassingly campy here.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, putting the forgettable Ennio soundtrack aside, EIGHT isn't Leone-influenced but more an overlong hybrid of RESERVOIR DOGS, which co-starred two wasted HATEFUL characters Michael Madsen and Tim Roth (the latter doing a pallid Christoph Waltz imitation)... which was Tarantino's first film; set inside a warehouse with a group of crooks while one holds a secret that can change everything... and Agatha Christie...<br/><br/>And why it would be nearly impossible to sit through this a second time - EIGHT is a bonafide whodunit, especially during the third and final act where the tables twist and turn so much, you'll wonder if all the previous dialogue and dialogue-driven, camera-wielding suspense was effectively good, bad or ugly since, like any Mystery-based vehicle, the end result makes everything else matter... and ultimately, in this case, nothing and no one matters much at all."

","The key (for me) to The Hateful Eight is that it is fine, fine theater.<br/><br/>And that means that it flows like a vital river--as does all good theater.<br/><br/>It's like a natural phenomenon. But, of course, it's also somehow special, and in that way for which Tarantino is known: Create a scenario in which quiet deceptions and general moral ossifications are flung at high velocities against the wall, examine the data from the scattering, and draw your own moral conclusions.<br/><br/>These are ordinary theatrics. The amazing thing is how Tarantino makes them compellingly ponderable, in real time, on the big screen.

"Bored_Dragon","9","1","4","29 October 2017"," Who did it murder mystery anti-western
","Tarantino's last movie belongs to western sub-genre known as anti- western. While classic western has clear, even black and white distinction between good and evil, where we know from the start who's good and who's bad and we are drawn to root for good guys, anti- western brings more realistic picture of Wild West. In old movies white folks are good guys and Indians are cruel primitives, or sheriff against evil gang and similar fairy-tale plots. Pretty unfair and unrealistic. Anti-western is trying to show things in shades of gray, from the ""villains"" point of view, making them just another people who are fighting for their spot under the sun.<br/><br/>This genre by itself raised up my expectations. And when you add Tarantino as writer and director, Morricone in charge of music, and in leading roles we have Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, this movie is masterpiece in advance. Board game ""who-did- it murder mystery"" played out as theater play and made into movie. Everything is played out in single room and it's based more on dialogue than action. It starts slow, gradually builds atmosphere and culminate in explosive finale. Almost everything in this movie is Oscar material, from the screenplay, scenography, camera, directing to excellent acting. Jackson is expectedly great in a role that's perfect for him, but Jennifer Jason Leigh definitely stole the movie with her absolutely magical performance. Still, movie misses ""that something"" for me to rate it ten out of ten.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Tarantino has made some great movies but don't include this one in that portfolio. His attempt to write an Agatha Christie mystery makes ""Murder She Wrote"" look like Shakespeare! There were great opportunities for this all-star cast to share great dialog that could be added up by by the Agatha character, I won't tell you who, to make this a very good movie. Unfortunately, ""Q"" gets an F for overly brutalizing racial diatribe, senseless vulgarity and vernacular more consistent with Jackie Brown than an 1870 mystery. <br/><br/>There were stupid set mistakes and nonsensical passages with bodies in the well, which was their only source of water. It was a snowy open area where bodies could have been left anywhere out of sight. The cabin was a slaughter house but no one smelled blood when they first walked in; come on. The front door was being nailed shut when there were four chairs and a table that could have been propped up against the door. It all adds up to a lazy writer producing a bad script.<br/><br/>The overuse of blood becomes humorous and the film becomes anticlimactic at the end.

""The Thing"", which Tarantino saw as the main influence for this movie, was capable of creating a similar atmosphere in 109 minutes. Was the Hateful Eight so special that it deserved a whole extra hour?<br/><br/>I like Tarantino's style, and Kill Bill is one of my all-time favourite.

Excellent performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell. Although the scene about Marquis getting oral may have been disturbing to some.

"Monster0352","10","1","4","2 January 2017"," Tarantino Delivers!!!!
","When I went to see the film The Hateful Eight, this would be my second time watching the film, but this time it will be in Ultra Panavision 70mm. There is not much difference with both films except the fact that there is an overture in the beginning of the film that replaces the previews. There is also a 15 min intermission that takes place around the fifth chapter of the film. Besides those two distinct differences the films are the same. From the beginning of the film the cinematography is incredible. You can immediately notice it's a Tarantino film by the shot. He has a unique style of cinematography that makes his films incredible. The dialogue in this film makes it Oscar worthy for Best Original Screenplay. <br/><br/>This film is about how a Bounty Hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) crosses paths with another Bounty Hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) whom both have bounty's. One alive and three dead. They end up riding in a stagecoach together to shelter in Wyoming to beat a blizzard that has arrived. Ruth's bounty is Daisy Domergue with a bounty of $10,000, and he will do what ever he has to do to protect his bounty whom he seeks to hang. On their way to shelter they encounter the new towns sheriff, Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Mannix seeks a ride on the stagecoach. Upon the arrival of the stagecoach to Minnie's Haberdashery they are greeted by 4 individuals whom they have never seen except one. General Smithers. The General fought against Major Warren in a previous battle. As the story progresses with spectacular dialogue, the unknown individuals are not exactly who they say they are. Which in turn end up poisoning a pot of coffee that Ruth and his stagecoach driver end up drinking. They both die from ingesting the poisonous coffee. This in turn makes Major Warren suspicious of everyone else. Long story short, Daisy Domergue's brother ends up being the mastermind behind the entire gang who are trying to disrupt Ruth's plans of hanging Daisy. Everyone basically ends up dying. <br/><br/>In closing, my personal experience viewing a 70mm picture was fantastic. For a film buff to experience this is a treat in its self. The rarity of this also enriches the experience. I personally thought the film was exquisite. Beautifully written with captivating cinematography. If you grew up on Tarantino films than you know what to expect. There are several things that made my film experience better and one of them was the performance of Walton Goggins. His performance as a sheriff should catch the eyes from the Academy for an Oscar consideration. He literally capitalizes his role above all others. Taking part in viewing this masterpiece has been beneficial for me in this class, because it gives me a new appreciation for a lost art. Instead of dreaming of what a 70mm movie would be like with an overture and intermission, I lived it."

","I've waited a long time before I watched this movie. It was clear to me that this would be heavier stuff, not so light-footed like Pulp. In this case I wait until I'm in a certain mood, a moment, where also Viscontis Damned', Herzogs Aguirre' or 'Apocalypse' would be fine. And now after watching 8' I have to say, yes this moving picture is also about the damned and it's drawn perfectly and consistently. It is definitely entertaining, disturbing and shocking at the same time and never boring or implausible. For me that's pure art.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are some in the US they don't like the picture because it's about dark facts of a supposedly great era in history. I recently read about the Trail Of Tears, the Seminoles, the role of Afroamerican People in that conflict and later in the civil war. Yes that's not all glorious events and I can understand some people don't like to be remembered. I had that feeling while watching Inglorious', because my Grandfather was a German Soldier. And even I know he hated the Nazis (he helped Jews to escape in his trucks) I had some difficulties to accept how partially stupid the Germans where shown in Bastards'. But - who could blame anybody to do so?! <br/><br/>There are countless other massacres in human history and nobody knows if we really will not experience something terrible again. Fear and hate are spreading out all over the world like never before the last 70 years.<br/><br/>There is this wooden Jesus statue in the movie and I guess that's not a coincidence. He told us to meet the stranger like meeting him. This movie is about people who do not trust, who dominate and hate each other. So this rough movie is about bloody hell, visually and mental."

","The western movies lasted an hour and a half and they had a story like that, maybe it's the problem.<br/><br/>Spoiler: <br/><br/>The first thing I have to say, to be honest is that Tarantino, I do not like it. I just liked Kill Bill, vol.1 since the 2 is completely different. In this case we repeat again. For me it's a very slow movie. It only takes about an hour to introduce the characters. Where that left to present the characters with a plane as in Gilda. It does not have so much gore and sure that its fans that annoy to them, to me it bugs me the little that has.<br/><br/>Having a room with many characters, John Ford, had a golden opportunity, to demonstrate, as he did in Kill Bill, what a good director he is, planning and staging, but no, I'm sorry, neither planning nor staging. All short shots and one by one, in case we get lost. Inside the house, it seems that it is also difficult for him to take pace, this does not advance. I will not deny that you have a nice picture, if you have one. This along with the make-up and costumes is the only thing that saved the film. It has become interminable. It's true that it's a serious movie, but this man does not capture me."

The characters are all Tarantino like, not realistic of course, just really interesting and fun. They fascinate and keep you on your toes, you never know who is telling the truth and who isn't. Sometimes there did seem to be a bit too many characters involved, and it was hard to keep them apart in the beginning, but the movie is so long that it gives you the time to get to know everyone a bit.<br/><br/>A really captivating flick that keeps surprising you at every turn.

","Although I appreciate Tarantino's recycled Pulp Fiction genre of non-linear storytelling, I've avoided some films because of their gratuitous violence. <br/><br/>However, I LOVED Django Unchained. So, given the hype about the Hateful Eight, award nominations and all, I was excited to see it. As the yawns set in, all I thought is how recycled the characters from Django were. Tim Roth as Christoph Waltz, Samuel Jackson as Jamie Foxx, the oppressed, yet outwitting winner of battles, racially and otherwise. <br/><br/>Yes, Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance was entertaining as was Kurt Russell's, seeing them both stretch their comfort zones. But, for me, that didn't compensate for what seemed like a longer, contrived, reiterated version of Django with a few changes in weather and peripheral characters."
"lasttimeisaw","7","1","4","10 October 2016"," Old tricks from Mr. Tarantino
","In post-mortem, if we must find a fall guy for the calamitous upshot of Tarantino's latest gory saga THE HATEFUL EIGHT, which of the hateful one do you pick? Without too much struggle, I will say it is the bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Russell), who insists on taking his quarries alive to see them hang, even in the case of Daisy Domergue (Leigh), who is wanted dead or alive. If only he could ape the fashion of his fellow black hunter Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), the story would have ended in a more insipid but undeniably more efficient and casualty-less note.<br/><br/>The truth is, sometimes, once a certain reputation has been established, to alter it may not be all that easy even if it means less trouble involved for pragmatic reasons, and surely, John Ruth doesn't care for the easiest way, he sticks to his gun until he meets his maker. Or the same thing can be referred to Mr. Tarantino himself, who has become overwrought to retain his brand of overripe violence and loquacious confidence, which obstructs his attempt of going further.<br/><br/>Tarantino's script is also cagey about the backstory of Daisy, what she has done to make her a wanted outlaw worth 10,000$, a quite obvious concern no one cares to broach during their over- elaborate political and radical prattle, even gauging by her last name alone, Ruth or Warren should have gotten an inkling about what could happen en route to their destination, a town called Red Rock in Wyoming. That is unfortunately a scriptsmith's job to pre-empt these inauspicious after- thoughts from audience, which rarely happens in Tarantino's previous output.<br/><br/>This one-day stretch story occurs in the same time frame of Tarantino's previous DJANGO UNCHAINED (2012), a few years after the American Civil War, but structurally much more stage- oriented, with the preponderance of the happenstances being hemmed inside a stagecoach lodge (imitate a big soundstage) due to a blizzard outside, it tellingly reminds us of RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a similar whodunit trope (initiated by Tarantino's own voice-over) also takes place just when all the political rebuke, repetitive woman-beating, racist teases and gross provocation start to pall. A tangible intensity duly engages when a flashback chapter narrates the horrid slaughter happened earlier at the exact place, we were all haplessly sitting in the darkness, waiting for the blood-spluttering brutality to pour out. Afterwards, it goes without saying, no one can come out of the shoot-out unscathed, and a frontier justice (deliberately elucidated by Tim Roth's Oswaldo Mobray with an unsubtle Christoph Waltz impression, earlier in the casual padding) symbolically settles the score in the money shot, to suggest after all, there are righteous heroes in this trigger- happy milieu crammed with hateful individuals.<br/><br/>The film is shot in the rare Ultra Panavision 70 process, credits must be given to its cinematography for its sporadic but grandiose snowscape by DP Robert Richardson, while most indoor shots are fluidly choreographed and unobtrusively operative. Much kudos to Morricone's Oscar-winning score as well, palpitates closely with the film's mood swings and flares up when the visual grandeur emerges.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh finally joins the Oscar-calibre echelon after being the most overlooked actress (as for as Oscar is concerned) of her generation, her performance here is unabashedly attention- grabbing, even when she is sitting there wordless, motionless, often chained with Russell's Ruth, she is enigmatic to regard (stunning makeup work here too), although her Daisy turns out to be out-and-out evil, when the crunch hits, there is a wishful thinking that she might get her way, not because we are rooting for her, but her feral, blood-covered ferocity is such a zinger on the screen, especially for female characters. Among the rest seven, Samuel L. Jackson is finally first-billed in a Tarantino's picture after a collaboration stretching over two decades, his swagger and flair is undeniably fetching, his arch ambivalence hangs tough until he gets shot in the balls (his manhood bravado gets its comeuppance). Walton Goggins, plays Chris Mannix, the supposed new sheriff of Red Rock, unexpectedly becomes the most important asset in the third act, in spite of an almost farcical front in his greenness, while all the others are typical Tarantino pawns, including the secret hateful No. 9, Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>For my money, THE HATEFUL EIGHT can still quench the thirst of Tarantino's devout cinephiles, since he knows exactly what they want, the excesses of unrepentant gore, piled-up body counts and the psychological maneuver, but if you are intrigued to see if he has learned any new tricks, the answer will be disappointing."
"cflores-37970","8","1","4","8 October 2016"," Great, but not his best
","I love this movie, but I still feel Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained are his best. People say it's a 'very long' movie, but me personally, I don't care as long as the movie is good. People only hate long BORING movies. With the dialogue and action that you usually get with a Tarantino movie, there's rarely ever a dull moment. The cinematography (70mm) look is just immaculate. It all looks so good. The writing/dialogue, well it's by Tarantino so obviously A+ BUT my slight issue with the film is in the 3rd Act. There was a hint of an even bigger shootout than the one you initially get in the cabin. The Domingo Gang if I remember correctly. I was getting even more excited when the villainess-Daisy of the story brought them up because I rather enjoy the Tarantino carnage. But, they're foiled as a lie and that never happens... a bit of a let down in my opinion. Still, there's so much tension in the plot once they're all in the cabin that you're wrapped in and trying to calculate what's going on along with Sam Jackson's character. It's a great movie, even though I just have a few complaints about the 3rd Act and ending. They probably won't upset anyone else and even with those complaints it's still a movie I really enjoyed and would see several times."
"photoe","6","1","4","14 September 2016"," Tarantino finally jumps the shark...maybe
","I really enjoyed this movie 2/3 of the way through. I didn't think it was too long. I loved the dialogue and interaction of the post-civil war northern characters (jackson and Russell) and the southern ones (Dern, Goggins).<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever seen such great dialogue between characters of this time period. The arguments about morality and war, and race, with Jackson, as always, written such a strong, relentless, unapologetic part. I really believed all these characters were tough as nails, hardened by years of experience. Jackson's interactions with Dern's southern general character escalate to what is the film's peak, a shocking and grim revelation that is still believable, considering the circumstances, and Jackson's unapologetic view of American life. Jackson even offends a growing fan of his, Kurt Russell's bounty hunter, by revealing him to be a sucker for a story about being pen pals with Lincoln, but Jackson explains it in such perfect terms, about needing to disarm white people in America, that you understand, and maybe even learn something directly from Sam Jackson himself.<br/><br/>This stuff is all great. Then there is a poisoning that sets off the final act, as it were, and that's where everything goes south. First off, in what is a perfect film so far, we're subjected to Tanantino breaking the wall indulgently, as he does so often, by narrating some sequences. This is annoying, but passable.<br/><br/>Then we're subjected to scene two of the requisite Tarantino bloodletting, which is a flashback to a massacre of the original occupants of the haberdashery, which includes multiple innocent and friendly women. This seems, at first, to just be a pointless exercise in establishing the rotten characters of what turn out to be gang members tied to Daisy, the main female character/prisoner. The scene seems truly gratuitous, but may have another purpose...<br/><br/>Then we return to the scene where Jackson is finally slowed is not stopped by being shot from below by a gang member hiding in the cellar. He is shot in the testicles, and we are told this. Immediately the film loses too much reality for me. He would either be dead or totally immobilized and bleeding out, and yet somehow we are led to believe he can still shoot, talk, though he apparently can not move off of a bed.<br/><br/>There's a lot of grim violence back and forth, including the sawing off an arm, for no reason other than its supposed to be funny. At the end, Daisy, the main female character, is hanged over a rafter by the ex-northern Major played by Jackson, and the ex-rebel marauder, played by Goggins, in what appears to be a uniting of former enemies in the goal of hanging a woman (we are told how awful she is repeatedly, and she is verbally abused relentlessly, including tons of uses of the B word, which in a way, does not seem real period to me, but I can't possibly know.<br/><br/>On face, it looks like Tarantino has lost his mind at the end. He engages in pointless violence, even by his standards, and the film's end centers on lynching a woman who is part head of a terrible gang, but the film doesn't quite do enough to really villainize her, mostly because she is such a cartoon character.<br/><br/>The only possible explanation I can find for this film is that Tarantino is saying that even men divided by race, were still united in their hatred of women. This would also tie into the massacre scene. The race hate is clear in the movie, but the gender hate is a lot less clear.<br/><br/>Either Tarantino completely lost his mind, and just went for the humor and terror of abusing women, or he was subtly making a statement.<br/><br/>To my view, he made that point in FAR TOO SUBTLE a manner, because most of the men I watched the movie seemed to see it as carte blanche to treat women and minorities poorly. Tarantino did such a great job illustrating racial issues, I'm not sure why he had to drag gender hate into the film, and not quite outline as clearly as he needed to, because without the rationale I offer, the movie is just blatantly and pointless violent and misogynistic.<br/><br/>So I guess I'm a bit confused."
"paulg-67221","8","1","4","3 September 2016"," Good but a little over-rated
","This is a Tarantino film so right of the bat, this film has good dialogue and music. Morricone's score is good (not his best but I've heard worse by him). And the cinematography is good (it was shot in 70mm after all).<br/><br/>Now, I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to explain why I feel this film is over-rated.<br/><br/>The movie is set almost entirely in one location and is mostly people talking to one another. On paper this doesn't sound too bad, Reservoir Dogs was mostly in one location and is mostly people talking to one another. But Reservoir Dogs is more interesting and was a lot shorter. Keeping a film in mainly one location is feasible. 90 - 100 minutes? Yes. 3 hours? No. There's very little to keep interest throughout the movie, Reservoir Dogs solved this problem by using flashbacks regularly at different locations to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>It also takes half an hour to get the plot moving. That's a sixth of the film's running time devoted to getting to the location. Here's a better way of doing it: have John Ruth's carriage arrive at the Haberdashery right after the opening credits. There, I got them to the location without wasting half an hour. At most, it should only take 10 minutes to get the plot moving. In that time, I could watch an episode of The Simpsons with a complete, satisfying story.<br/><br/>Why was this film shot on 70mm? It looks good but there isn't much justification to use it. It would have better suited Kill Bill (Volume 1 at least), Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained. There is nothing visually that could warrant 70mm. Say what you want about Nolan but his use of 70mm and IMAX is justified because he makes large-scale action films.<br/><br/>One particular silly moment was when Michael Madsen's character confessed to poising the coffee very quickly. The film may as well not setting up the mystery if the perpetrator will admit to it so quickly.<br/><br/>When Channing Tatum didn't show up and his name was in the credits, I suspected he would show up as a surprise villain. I was right. He was under the floorboards. I also figured out Michael Madsen's character poised the coffee, my logic was wrong but I still got it right. But to Tarantino's credit, I was surprised John Ruth was killed so early on.<br/><br/>I gave this film a 7/10 because I do like it and I have to admit that it is well crafted, despite over indulgent."
"kira02bit","5","1","4","1 September 2016"," Better than expected, but self-indulgence does it in

On one end of the spectrum, I find Pulp Fiction to be an overrated mess, while I think Jackie Brown is a bit underrated and Kill Bill has some incredible moments and performances in it. Inglorious Basterds, is two-thirds a great film (actually the film takes flight any time the Basterds are not on screen) and one-third amateur hour. Still, Tarantino has enough cache to ask for and get concessions that many filmmakers only dream of.<br/><br/>Case in point, The Hateful Eight. Tarantino released some prints in 70mm format requiring some theaters to revive a now-dormant format to accommodate him. His film rings in at a whopping near 3-hour running time and some prints feature an intermission. To say that The Hateful Eight is a tad self-indulgent would be an epic understatement. People seem to either passionately loathe or love this film. I am in between. One must give Tarantino some point for chutzpah in combining a western homage with an Agatha Christie-style mystery - and given that I am a fan of both genres, I should have loved this film. But I did not.<br/><br/>The setting is wintry Wyoming, where bounty hunter Kurt Russell is in the process of returning fugitive criminal Jennifer Jason Leigh to the hangman in Red Roch via coach. Along the way, they encounter first Samuel L. Jackson's legendary bounty hunter who begs a ride and then Walton Goggins, who claims to be the newly hired sheriff of Red Rock. The coach stops at the expected destination of Minnie's Haberdashery for a respite, only to find some strange characters in place rather than the much-discussed Minnie and her usual crew. These include embittered former Confederate Bruce Dern, Mexican barman Demien Bichir, soft-spoken cowpoke Michael Madsen, and the British hangman of Red Rock Tim Roth. When an intense blizzard strands everyone and people start dying off one by one, the questions raise as to who is responsible, who is next and is anyone who they truly claim to be.<br/><br/>On paper, it sounds like a great concept. Unfortunately, Tarantino's self-indulgent, heavy hand too often botches it and prevents it from reaching much higher than a curio piece. Considering that Tarantino went for the 70mm prints, it seems foolish considering that after the opening moments, there are almost no outside scenes to make it worthwhile. Pretty much all of the action stays in the claustrophobic cabin that comprises Minnie's. I would also argue that Ennio Morricone's Oscar-winning score is immensely better than the film in which it resides.<br/><br/>Ditto, the running time is ludicrous considering how slight the story is. Tarantino tries to distract from this with minor flashbacks, camera tricks, coy voice-over narration by Tarantino himself, and - at the two-hour mark - a lengthy flashback which introduces a completely new set of characters to discuss what happened at an earlier point at Minnie's. You will either find these conceits inventive or frustrating.<br/><br/>Equally frustrating is that Tarantino seems to think that he makes his screenplay edgy by packing it with streams of needless profanity and racial/sexist insults. This does not make it authentic, it just makes it difficult and unpleasant to listen to. I think this film may well break a record for how many times the ""n"" word is utilized and that is followed by the use of the ""f"" bomb. It becomes wearying fairly quickly and undermines any genuine ingenuity present. It also becomes apparent quickly that none of these people (with the exception of the bystander coach driver James Parks) are worth any rooting interest, but the flashback sequence where one character goads another with an on screen memory (or lie) about sexually violating that person's dying son is pretty repellent. Ditto, the constant scenes of male characters beating and brutalizing Leigh's sole female become a bit much. There were times where I thought that Tarantino must be getting back at every woman that would not date him with this character.<br/><br/>The actors try their best and succeed on varying levels. Jackson and Russell are both solid, if a bit predictable, in their performances. Dern conveys the simmering tension of a racist Confederate cooped up with a black man in authority well. Bichir, Madsen and Roth are underused, while Goggins fares better than expected. If any performance stands out though, it is Leigh's. She seems to be the linchpin holding everything together. We are never told what crime she committed, but Leigh convinces us that it must have been pretty heinous. Her character suffers beatings and indignities galore and yet comes through it all with a malevolent smile. She is ultimately no better or worse than her fellow travelers, but she seems to be the only one having fun with her role and the only one who projects menace even when being victimized.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is not very engaging emotionally. It is a tough obstacle to become involved in the plight of people, who are almost immediately revealed to be ethically beyond redemption and capable of mind-numbing atrocities. The best one can summon is an intellectual curiosity to figure out what is happening and who is in on it. But still by the end, I found myself not caring who lived or died, which does not make for a very fulfilling film experience. I would recommend this solely for Tarantino fanatics and the mildly curious. Anyone else should probably go elsewhere."
"coggla","6","1","4","13 June 2016"," Starts with promise but ends with more of the same
","I would say this review contains spoilers but Tarantino is so predictable, the following should contain no surprises.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a writer of some caliber, and that was evident, more or less, in the first half of The Hateful Eight. His characterization and little moments of comic relief that penetrate an otherwise bleak and tense landscape are clever. And there's no doubt he has an eye for cinema.<br/><br/>As he likes to do, the film has been titled with chapters, which was unnecessary and somewhat pretentious. Is he trying to make a comparison to a literary work? And the sudden ""appearance"" of a narrator about an hour into the story, offering a brief, yet mostly self-evident explanation of events was also odd, perhaps lazy directing. Tarantino played masterfully with time in Pulp Fiction, sending the audience back and forth to assemble the narrative piece by piece. But here, it is done a little clumsily, even using an on screen cue ""Yesterday"" to jump back to the story's prelude.<br/><br/>The performances from the three main stars - Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh were impeccable, really stepping into their roles and clearly having fun with their characters. At times, it seemed, Jackson was reprising his character Jules from Pulp Fiction, but, in part, that was in the writing and direction of Tarantino.<br/><br/>With a few notable exceptions such as Jackie Brown and Mallory Knox, Tarantino doesn't create characters for women very well. This was painfully evident in the minor characters of Minnie and Judy, both being vacuous and perky female stereo-types. If it was to highlight the contrast between their innocent nature and the gruesome, undeserving fate in which they met, then that is bordering on cheesy pantomime. But I'll give Tarantino the benefit of the doubt on this one and say it was a parody of the two dimensional supporting female characters of old Hollywood Westerns.<br/><br/>In contrast, the central character of Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), with relatively few words, came close to stealing the show. Somehow she managed to just hold on to an indefinable essence of femininity through a pervasive wildness, hostility and incivility. Never playing victim or seeking empathy, on the contrary, often maligning and mocking her captors. There was light and shade in her character, though mostly darkness, at times almost summoning Linda Blair's character from The Exorcist.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half. Tarantino set the scene very well for what could have been a gripping, suspenseful interplay between characters. But alas, the second half descends quickly into a silly, bloody gore-fest that we've all seen before (eight times according to the opening credits). I am by no means turned off by violence, but it's just ridiculous, gratuitous trite, reminiscent of the second half of From Dusk Till Dawn - just different characters in a different time and location.<br/><br/>I truly hope Tarantino matures in his film making. He has so much promise and potential beyond mindless slaughterhouse nonsense. I can't help but feel that when he puts pen to paper there is a little boy inside of him who was relentlessly bullied in the school yard and harbors intricate and gory revenge fantasies that he needs to get out. Hopefully the eighth film has finally depleted those fantasies and he can get on with using his talents to make more original and thoughtful pieces. I don't want to go to my grave thinking Pulp Fiction was a fluke.<br/><br/>Those that gave this one star are passionately overstating their dislike (I mean, really, Chipmunks: The Squeakel is a one star movie). I will take the hang man's advice and judiciously give this a dispassionate 6: an average of 8 for the first half and 4 for the second."
"leonblackwood","3","1","4","18 May 2016"," Boring and very offensive! 3/10
","Review: What an awful movie! As a black person, I was extremely offended with a lot of the dialogue, and it took way too long to get going. I liked Kurt Russell's character, John Ruth and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Daisy Domergue), played her role well, even though she was totally racist but the rest of the characters weren't that great. Samuel L. Jackson (Major Marquis Warren), wasn't too bad but the movie really didn't have to be that long. The fact that most of the movie is filmed in a bar, didn't help matters and when the plot started to unfold, I totally lost interest in the whole thing. The script was awful and the gory scenes were way over the top. On the plus side, it was good to see Tarantino had got rid of the long, unnecessary speeches, which I found extremely boring but apart from that, it's hard to find a good word to say about the whole project. It does look authentic, in a old time western type of way but there wasn't any depth to the various characters, who all had sketchy backgrounds. It amazed me how many shots the characters were able to take, and the gruesome poison scene went a bit too far. Anyway, I think you can tell that I really didn't enjoy this movie and I didn't find the offensive script pretty bad, so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This movie is definitely not in the same league as the Quentin Tarantino's smash hits, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and judging by his recent releases, I doubt that he's going to hit that form again. Death Proof, Grindhouse and the Kill Bill franchise, we're also disappointing but this movie and Django Unchained are full of racist remarks which go way too far. Jackie Brown was a watchable movie with some great characters but I'm surprised his movies haven't been boycotted because of the heavy racism in a lot of the scenes. Regardless of my views, his movies will always make money, mainly because of the impact that his earlier movies made but I haven't heard many comments about this movie, which seemed to come in and out of the spotlight pretty quickly. I did stick with the film because I was intrigued about the direction of the movie but I wasn't happy with the outcome. I just hope that his next project has nothing to do with the West because he really is going in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>Budget: $44million Worldwide Gross: $156million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery/crime/dramas starring Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir, Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern, Zoe Bell, James Parks and Channing Tatum. 3/10"
"austin0731","8","1","4","16 May 2016"," Quentin Tarantino does it again
","Out of Quentin Tarantino's Western films, most notably Django Unchained and the Hateful Eight personally I think that the hateful Eight tops Django. Why? Well though Django definitely tops at being completely extravagant and completely insane killing sprees it lacks the intricacy that I feel The Hateful Eight has. It does have substance, while Django is much more of style over substance. That is not to say that the Hateful Eight lacks the Western style and tone that Tarantino gets on point, just as Tarantino always delivers the Hateful Eight is no different, exciting actions and exhilarating fast paced story is vintage Tarantino. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight really is like a game of 'clue', what's great is that it does that very well and keeps us guessing throughout. The end game was not predictable and any of the 'eight' could've been the 'bad guy' or perhaps all of them. When the guessing games are over we still get an amazing Tarantino styled shoot out and confrontations (no spoilers) it was quite impeccable, I love that ending and final act reveal. It captures the sense of danger of the era much better than much any Westerns that I have seen while still being fun and exciting. <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson performance is probably my favorite, one of the biggest mysteries of the eight and all. His monologues were delivered with such power and was just so well done I really expected him to be an Oscar contender. In addition this time round he is a lot more likable than ""Django Unchained's Stephen the butler"". Samuel Jacks had great flair just as all of the characters. Another one of my favorites is Kurt Russell who owned the scene whenever he was in, while being fun and likable. Each character was so colorful and diverse. They had very clear character traits very different from one another making it very interesting to see their interactions with one another.<br/><br/>The film like many of Tarantino's film has such diverse themes that are all executed in a way that gives the film so many directions and makes it so jam packed with essence and story. The score was also amazing, it seemed to fit so perfectly well with the mystery theme of the film and just had a pinch of excitement and fun in there as well. The music just is the film, it represented everything that the film represents. The setting of the story was set in this very isolated, cold location which gives a sense of fear and distrust through such a harsh surrounding.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film on a whole was amazing, especially in these character moments where one of the characters just break down the situation, it is so well written just as the ones in Django. Every time there were characters going on about the situation or some past or even when they were breaking down how they were about to kick-ass it was great. A lot like those Christoph Waltz monologues in Django. Fantastic dialogues and great characters make The Hateful Eight one of the best all year."
"dworldeater","8","1","4","1 April 2016"," I heart The Hateful Eight
","As far as writer/director Quentin Tarantino goes, in the past I had not been a great admirer of his work for the most part. However, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by his new film, The Hateful Eight. I would compare The Hateful Eight as a combination of two of QT's previous films, Reservoir Dogs and Django Unchained.(both titles are Quentin films I like) Throw in a huge nod to John Carpenter's The Thing for the frostbitten tone of the film and for the general theme of mistrust. The Hateful Eight is a beautifully shot and epic film with an equally impressive score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. The scope of the film is massive and by having the benefit of seeing this in the theater, if you had not then you missed out. The Hateful Eight looks and sounds amazing, but the film is a gritty, bleak, bloodsoaked whodunit taking place in a brutal blizzard in post civil war Wyoming. Our main cast is an unsavory bunch with some less rotten than others, but overall everyone is pretty bad in this film any way you slice it. That dynamic does not work against the film or make it less interesting and our cast did a fine job portraying these violent miscreants. QT has redeemed himself for his poor use of Kurt Russell in Death Proof by casting Kurt as the rugged bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth. Tarantino regulars Samuel Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madson were all excellent. Casting western legend Bruce Dern gives the film a lot of credibility and class as Bruce was one of the few actors around to have worked on westerns with both John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. His performance and presence was great and enhanced the film in my opinion. Jennifer Jason Leigh gave a real gutsy and cold performance as despicable sociopath Daisy Domergue. This western is QT's bleak tale of frostbitten darkness that is harsh as the North American frontier in the heart of a blizzard. There are campy elements that go a little over the top, but this is kept to a minimum as this is Quentin's most serious film to date. There is a bit of dark humor and QT's violence is much bloodier than ""Bloody Sam"" would have went. Overall, I really enjoyed what I saw here and in my opinion this is QT's best film to date."
"skilletfreak01","9","1","4","31 March 2016"," Tarantino at his best!
","Tarantino at his best! in stunning 70mm, this film is visually beautiful. Quentin Tarantino is the master of dialogue and he's at the top of his game here, as the dialogue is ninety percent of the film. I was never once bored, and often the scenes were quite tense. And of course Tarantino's unique style came in to play, the one that says I'm Tarantino and I don't give a f***, I make what I want, how I want. The entire cast brings their A game, there's not a weak performance there (not even Channing Tatum). overall this film is excellent, only a couple small flaws I saw(which I wont specify as to not spoil anything),and if you like Quentin Tarantino's previous films you should love this, this film could have been an hour longer and I wouldn't have minded."
"snowatom","5","1","4","6 March 2016"," Well..... eh...
","I will make this a shot one. <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's movies always are just ones to watch. <br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>The thing that makes his movies so spectacular (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) is the way he lead the audience of track, by not showing the movie in chronological order, and when he finally reveals who's who and their back story, you always get a little annoyed that you hadn't figured it all out by then, as all the signs suddenly where all so obvious. This is what he does best.<br/><br/>In this movie, you don't get the same feeling, as the pointers, hints and small details are just not given the proper way. So when people finally are revealed for who they are, and their back story, you don't sit back with an ""aha feeling"", I should have seen that coming, but more of a, ""well so that's how it all fits together"". <br/><br/>To make an example from another movie not by QT is The Sixth Sense. If you would see this movie again, you would wonder on how you were unable to figure it all out. Of cause someone will figure it out during the movie, and sadly those people won't find this movie experience as good as they were to smart ;o) <br/><br/>I miss this in Tarantino's 8th movie. When going back and seeing it again, the pointers, hints and small details are just not enough for one to figure it out if you wanted to, ruining the magic of this kind of movie making."

","As the title of this review suggests, Tarantino has put out another fantastic film.Some directors skate by with one or two major successes, only to direct a lot of junk. Tarantino is not one of those directors.<br/><br/>The casting was brilliant, and all the actors played off each other very well, no one stealing the spotlight, and letting each character shine through.<br/><br/>Is it violent? Yes. Is the language harsh (possibly offensive)? Yes. But honestly, it's a Tarantino movie...what did you expect? He's not exactly known for fluffy rabbits hopping through the meadows. Violence and language are some of the staple elements in his films, so if you watch this and complain about either of those two things, you're watching the wrong movie.<br/><br/>For everyone else (especially if you're a fan of Tarantino), then this is a must see."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","22 February 2016"," Tension, atmosphere and gore
","As a whole this film feels almost like a parody of a Tarantino film. But in a good way. It's definitely the one where he takes his directorial style the furthest, separating his normal mannerisms and segments clearly from one another, allowing us to enjoy them on their own, and making this feel almost like two films. The calm one at the start with nothing but conversations and character building, and the ultraviolent second one with blood, guts and gore spraying on the walls.<br/><br/>It feels premeditated and a bit too clear cut for my personal tastes, but I cannot deny that it works. The first half of this film is intense, with a group of travellers getting trapped inside a mountain trading shop during a blizzard. One of them is a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) escorting a prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the next town over to be hanged. And all the rest of them are hiding secrets as well. Secrets which start to unravel as the night passes.<br/><br/>It's a very dialogue-heavy movie, which is great because Tarantino has once again pulled in an ensemble cast. We haven't seen Russell in anything that significant in years, but he is one of the best actors in this film by a wide margin. Gruff, determined with a mean streak mile wide, but even wider code of ethics, jaded and grim though they are. Leigh is also a shining character, with an Oscar nomination well-earned. But it's Samuel L. Jackson playing another bounty hunter that once again steals the whole show. Every scene he's in is captivating, intense and frightening beyond belief.<br/><br/>Pretty much the only real nitpick I have is that I kind of hope the story had played out a bit differently. The early talk about this movie had us believe that Tarantino was going to direct a classic closed room murder mystery, with one of the characters getting axed off and the rest of the film being the characters trying to find out who the murderer is. Now, that's close to what we end up getting, but still far enough that I cannot help but feel a little bit disappointed. Because can you imagine Quentin Tarantino directing a classic murder mystery straight out of Agatha Christie books. It would have been amazing.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a great film. Not one of Tarantino's best, but still heads and shoulders above its peers and well worth a watch for all fans of action, western and mystery."
"ragnar-46222","7","1","4","17 February 2016"," The film he wanted to produce...which is what you get
","So as I have sat through the others, and enjoyed as much as they made me enjoy. From the stolen .. sorry..reinterpreted story of Reservoir Dogs (and yes I know that is not his first film), right through to the h8ful Eight. It is what he wanted to produce. Don't come looking for tempo, deep story, guffaws or tears. You won't get it...You won't like it..so Don't do it. However, if you wish to regale at his known brat pack pulling out stellar performances, with gimmicky voice overs, excellent wardrobe and settings. But then again as others have mentioned, it is a theater piece set on screen. It works well, as a backdrop to the Tarantiniesque blood fest that ensues. I don't agree with critics saying that Tim Roth was a playing a 'pompous' character which would not have been correct for his social standing....ofc not, he was playing Tim Roth, and the rest did exactly the same. The film smacks of the usual clichéd moments and soundbites, the verbal jousts are evident and in abundance. They always seem to end with Mr Jackson shutting someones mouth in one way or another. So if you liked Django (and personally I preferred Django Unchained). Then go see the new brain splattering, eye candy from the master."
"dromasca","9","1","4","14 February 2016"," a cynical exercise in evil
","The movies fans word is divided in two - those who love Quentin Tarantino's work and those who hate it. There is almost nothing left out, if you have seen a film by Tarantino you either liked it immensely, or you felt insulted, disgusted and exposed to the worst of the bad taste. You probably dreamed about it the night or many nights after. You did not forget it completely. And it hardly left you indifferent. 'The Hateful Eight' will just deepen the abyss between the camps. Tarantino made not only another film but one that will confirm everything bad that haters dislike and will make delirious of evil joy the fans who admit they are fans and those who still feel it's good to be cautious nowadays in admitting they are fans.<br/><br/>'The Hateful Eight' is full of quotes. The story is a crossing of action Westerns and Agatha Christie's mysteries - meaning that not only that there are a lot (and I mean a lot!) of gunshots, horses, two bounty hunters, one criminal on her way to be hanged and one sheriff (or maybe none) on one side, and characters that play roles and are being discovered by the smart detective via traps and dialogs (a lot of dialogs and I mean a lot!). The music is by Ennio Morricone who composed the unforgettable tunes of the spaghetti westerns half a century ago. There are references to Spielberg's Lincoln and to Tarantino's previous movies and especially Django Unchained which dealt with the same period and the racial relations from a very different perspective. However, if you have seen the film you will get to the conclusion that the quotes are intentionally non-respectful. The 'mystery dialogs' are long and verbose, and will make the action film fans checking if they did not enter the wrong cinema hall. The Lincoln starts and an apparent moral anchor to twist into an interpretation that I will not reveal but which looked to me like Tarantino telling Spielberg - this is what I do to the kind of themes you beat me with at the Academy Awards in 2012. Tarantino takes no prisoners. He is taking classical material, blending it, smashing it to the walls, shooting at it and spitting it back mixed with blood and poison. Sometimes literally.<br/><br/>Then, it's a movie by Tarantino. If you are a fan you will get plenty of the gore stuff you like, you will get villains who can look charming for a few minutes an commit atrocities or be victims of atrocities the next ones. It's a well told story which proves again that Tarantino is in the big league of American film directors (together with the Coen brothers, Scorsese, Spielberg and Woodie Allen) who can invent and tell a story like no one does out of America. Acting is superb to the point that we hardly recognize Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell or Jennifer Jason Leigh. The vision is kitschy, is dark, is violent, there is no place for kindness, no morals, no values. It's Tarantino."

After 10 minutes it is all set in a barn / shack /house.<br/><br/>The characters are introduced like an Agatha Christie Novel and the plot is weak. If you like boring films this is for you.

"bix171","8","3","23","27 December 2015"," Good But Problematic
","Quentin Tarantino's last two features were revisionist histories of the antebellum South and World War II and ""The Hateful Eight"" is nothing if not a revisionist approach to the film western as studio Hollywood has presented it and the way it has been consumed by the movie-going public. Tarantino pulls out all the stops here, at least in its initial engagement, lovingly presenting it in eye-popping anamorphic 70 mm that highlights his careful staging and Robert Richardson's equally detailed cinematography, with the first quarter of the film taking place in a Wyoming blizzard and the remainder in an overstuffed cabin. (The production design is by Yohei Taneda and the set decoration is by Rosemary Brandenburg.) The large-scale presentation finds Tarantino creating a post-Civil War scenario in which the players are Tarantino's forte: dirty, cold-blooded sadists (the film is hyper-violent to say the least) that an old school presentation this large would never have considered. And the first half features some of Tarantino's most expressive writing: having gotten his revenge on Nazis and slave owners, he can turn his attention to detailing strong characters and while racism remains an important theme in Tarantino's work, the film is ultimately about his love of storytelling; and his cast commits to him with absolutely no false notes. But it's here where he slips up, with a second half that seems filled with arbitrary characters and flashbacks to create story continuity (and where the topic of racism provides a slip in that continuity); and while the story's not exactly a mystery, the way the narrative is delineated seems somewhat unsatisfactory, with viewers unable to fill in the gaps by themselves--by leaving Tarantino to explain it all to us, he renders much of ""The Hateful Eight"" somewhat pointless."

"ArchonCinemaReviews","9","2","13","12 January 2016"," Mature filmmaking that stashes away some of Tarantino's trademark techniques, a film you have to stick with til the end
","No one comes up here without a damn good reason.<br/><br/>On January 1st I attended a 70mm screening of Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight at City Cinemas East 86th Street, one of the few Manhattan theaters selected to be part of the 98-theater national roadshow. The $20 event was presented like a traditional stage performance, complete with a large colorful program handed out prior to the screening, zero previews–supplanted by an opening orchestral overture–, and a full 15-minute intermission. During halftime, a family of three seated to our left (a mother, father, and their grown daughter) voiced their discontent with the experience. The mother in particular seemed distressed by the first hour and half ordeal, audibly grumbling and fidgeting as the movie lumbered along, apparently baffled by the grueling pacing and seemingly directionless narrative (admittedly up to that point, not entirely invalid). She also expressed a bit of physical discomfort; they left and didn't return. What a terrible mistake to begin the year.<br/><br/>I've never understood why people walk out of movies. No matter how little you're enjoying yourself, leaving the theater early amounts to abandoning a financial commitment and, more importantly, rejecting a foundational principle of storytelling – don't judge it until it's over. Walking out is nothing more than a performative act of impatience. Besides, the world outside is a storm of reality and the theater is a temporary shelter. Why not stay seated, invest a relatively minor additional amount of time in your surroundings, and revel in your fully informed disgust later on? Even better, hang around, you may despise everything around you at the moment, but you might be surprised by how an extra hour and a half changes everything.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a stunning behemoth of a movie, one half raising a sledgehammer, and the other half slamming into and through the plane of your gut. It implores you to be patient. Tarantino has toiled for over two decades to reach where he is today, now arriving at his eighth film as a man whose vision commands such rarefied respect among fans that he can get away with staging a live reading of his unfinished script, canceling and then un-canceling a film, forcing theaters to equip themselves with antiquated and highly- specialized 70mm film equipment, and insisting that audiences endure a massive three hour run-time. But the payoff is all there, locked in step with the insanity.<br/><br/>The opening overture is essentially the first character of the story, composed with swelling, delicate menace like the rest of the score by the legendary Ennio Morricone (marking a significant left turn for Tarantino, who traditionally cobbles together inspired soundtracks full of decade-hopping rock and pop tracks). In the opening shot, a six-horse carriage containing the bounty hunter ""Hang Man"" John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) races through the blinding snow of the Wyoming Mountains in a desperate quest to outrun a blizzard. On their way to Red Rock, where Ruth intends to have Domergue hanged, the carriage picks up two unexpected guests in Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a decorated former Union soldier and now bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), former Confederate fighter and new sheriff of Red Rock. Together with their steadfast driver O.B. (James Parks), the travelling quadruplet forms an unlikely unit in the shadow of the recent Civil War, partnered by destination, bound by the storm, but tense in opposing beliefs, politics, and moral codes. Their numbers double when they stop to hole up in Minnie's Haberdashery and wait out the storm. A Mexican named Bob (Demian Bichir) has taken over as temporary steward while Minnie is out of town, providing shelter to the dapper British hangman of Red Rock Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), a Confederate general named Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), and a mysterious cowboy named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen).

","I'm a big Tarantino fan, and this one just doesn't do it for me. Several issues here: 1. Tarantino apparently enjoyed the Bounty Hunter concept from Django so much, that he redid it here. I expect much more from Tarantino. 2. Lots of unnecessary killing, which doesn't even make sense. The whole concept of ambushing the civilians at Mimi's is downright stupid. (Pull out a gun, line them up outside and shoot them...?!) 3. Over usage of Gore, when there was no reason to.<br/><br/>The plot had some good points, the dialogue was ho-hum, nothing impressive. Any other director, I might push them up to a 7.5. But for Tarantino, I expect better."
"Prismark10","7","2","13","8 January 2016"," What lies beneath
","Quentin Tarantino's eight film is The Hateful Eight. By this time we know what to expect, lots of talking, some of its fast and loose.<br/><br/>Even though the publicity blurb mentions John Carpenter's The Thing as an inspiration (Kurt Russell even riffs a line from that film about going without sleep,) it really is an Agatha Christie style mystery done Tarantino style.<br/><br/>We visit the snowbound wild west post civil war where the wounds of war are still raw.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell is bounty hunter John Ruth better known as the Hangman. Where other bounty hunters kill and take the bodies for the reward. He brings them back alive so they can hang. He is taking back Daisy Domergue, a female captive with a big reward for her head. On the road he meets Major Warren (Samuel L Jackson) another bounty hunter and they ride together until they meet the designated new sheriff also on his way to his new post at the town they are heading to.<br/><br/>A blizzard means they have to hole up in an inn where there are other people staying. Bruce Dern is the bitter, racist confederate General Smithers trying to find the fate of his son. Tim Roth is Mobray on his way to the same town as the sheriff to be the new hangman. There are several other people, we believe that some of them are bluffing. Ruth thinks that one of them is not what he claims to be and lies have been told.<br/><br/>As I said there is a lot of chatter, maybe too much, lots of suspicion, lots of rubbing people up the wrong way. We do wonder what this is all leading to, as maybe events are unravelling too slowly and then bang, the bodies start to fall and Tarantino does his reveal.<br/><br/>The film has dark twisted humour, mean characters bristling with menace, bloody cruel violence. In his heart it is a visceral mystery thriller told in a slow simmering style."
"GillianNieboer","8","2","13","6 January 2016"," Perfectly executed Western style Tarantino
","The cinematic style of Tarantino is undoubtedly present in this movie. The slow paced style of typical Western movies is well executed. It can be said that the story line may be simple yet you will be always wanting to know what is happening next. Therefore well executed movie and I can recommend watching for an enjoyable 3 hours of movie pleasure.<br/><br/>Most Tarantino fans will definitely enjoy the style of this movie, therefore on a small note you can expect to see similar violence as in his previous movies.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend seeing this movie in its original format 70mm shot as this gives the further feeling of vintage of to this movie."
"manfourallseasons","8","2","14","7 January 2016"," Suitably Impressive
","Quintin Tarantino's number eight is yet another feather in the cap of the man who has unleashed a number of groundbreaking films, on the movie going public. Together with Django Uncahanied, this movie, turns a new twist on the modern Western. Both these films are rewarding in their own way for viewers who are willing to adapt to a fresh take on a classic genre. Many of his fans will not like the political undertones of these last two films, but more importantly, many neutrals and many of his most vocal critics will take notice of the growing maturity in his movie- making skills and choice of topic. The use of the outdoor elements in this one is fine touch, together with the timing of the flashbacks, a notable Tarantino trait. It's all about the politics however, and of particular note is the way the seemingly more compatible characters to Samuel Jackson's ex serviceman bounty hunter,are usurped by the man who may have been seen as one of his potentaily most lethal enemies, and not in an entirely predictable and hackneyed manner. One or two of them, see the error of their previous ways in this film and I expect that's the whole point if some of the viewers could do likewise. Some haters will always hate, but hopefully not like some of the hateful eight."
"bankofmarquis","9","2","14","6 January 2016"," Tarantino at his best
","I have just watched my new ""favorite movie of the year"".<br/><br/>I admit, award season has just started – and I have a TON of quality movies to catch up with – but, for now, my vote for BEST PICTURE OF 2015 goes to THE HATEFUL EIGHT.<br/><br/>That's right, Quentin Tarantino's 8th movie hits all the right notes for me. I understand that he can be an ""acquired taste"", but I acquired the taste long ago and I eagerly took a bite out of this Western and was rewarded handsomely.<br/><br/>What makes a good Tarantino movie? Let's go with8 elements.<br/><br/>The first element is dialogue. If you want a primer on Tarantino's dialogue, check out the opening diner scene in RESERVOIR DOGS or the first scene, in the French farmhouse of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS. Of course, most of you are aware of the ""Royale with Cheese"" scene from PULP FICTION If you like any of these, then you'll love the first hour of this movie. It is one long, slow burn while we get to know each of the ""HATEFUL EIGHT"".<br/><br/>The 2nd element that makes a Tarantino movie worth watching is fascinating characters. And you know what? The HATEFUL EIGHT has, yes, EIGHT of them.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Tarantino has a way of bringing out GREAT performances out of his actors. Certainly go no further than Samuel L. Jackson. Pick out his performance in JACKIE BROWN, PULP FICTION or my personal favorite, DJANGO UNCHAINED to see what he does in Tarantino's hands. He is front and center in this movie and he does not disappoint. I would LOVE to see his name called when the Academy Award nominations come out. Building on this centerpiece are fine performances from previous Tarantino players Kurt Russell, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Mix in strong turns from Tarantino ""newcomers"" Bruce Dern and Damian Bichir and this claustrophobic drama pops off the screen. Special notice needs to be given to the only female of the 8, Jennifer Jason Leigh and the surprise of this movie, Walton Goggins (Boyd Crowder from the TV series JUSTIFIED). They both go toe to toe with Jackson and the others on the screen and shine.<br/><br/>The 4th element of a Tarantino movie is lush cinematography. Filmed in 70mm Panavision, this film is something to behold and should be seen on a BIG SCREEN.<br/><br/>The 5th strong element of this film is one that I do not ordinarily equate to a Tarantino movie – a strong plot. This film takes place with the ""Hateful Eight"" trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery in the Wyoming mountains in the late 1800's during a blizzard. This movie quickly becomes a mystery ""whodunit"" with plot twists worthy of Agatha Christie or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This was a true surprise to me.<br/><br/>The final 3 elements of a classic Tarantino movie are violence, Violence and VIOLENCE. I liked how he handled the Violence in this one. As I stated earlied, the first hour of this 2 hour and 37 minute epic was a slow burn with dialogue intended for the audience to get to know the characters. After that, all heck breaks loose and guns are a-blazing and blood is a-flying and bodies are a-dying. HOWEVER, it isn't the over the top VIOLENCE of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS or the ending of DJANGO UNCHAINED. Tarantino shows much more restraint here and it pays off. Don't get me wrong, there is PLENTY of violence in this movie, but I think he applied it with a painter's brush and not a housepainter's roller this time.<br/><br/>All in all, I had a GREAT time with this movie and I can't wait to see it again (and again) to catch those subtle nuances that I surely have missed.<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the BANK (of Marquis).<br/><br/>Andy"
"Skaigear","10","3","27","22 December 2015"," Trust, fear, distrust, paranoia all play out in bloody perfect fashion
","There are no filmmakers quite like Quentin Tarantino. His ultra-stylized dialogues and savvy characters combined with usually (seemingly) simple stories has been a staple of his since Reservoir Dogs. Lots of directors are cookie cutters of each other, all expendables and mix and matches, but when Tarantino dies, I guarantee there will never be another Tarantino to take his place. The Hateful Eight, appropriately named, is the eighth movie of his controversial but stellar career, and another masterpiece following personal favorites such as Inglourious Basterds, Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. Like the latter, this movie is a western set circa the Civil War, but unlike the Django, it is a considerably ""smaller"" movie. Gone are the grandiose landscapes and epic locations of the former and arrived is a mostly one-set film that is performed more like a stage play. However if this is indeed a theatrical play I am not sure if I would like to sit in the front row in fear of the gallons of spraying blood that will undoubtedly ensue.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight takes place on a snowy mountain in Wyoming, a few years post-Civil War, where sentiments from the majority towards African Americans are still full of suspicion, meanness and hate. Samuel L. Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren, a bounty hunter, in need of shelter from the incoming blizzard. He meets John Ruth, a fellow hunter, en route on a stagecoach to the nearby town with his prisoner, Daisy Domergue, where she will be hanged for her crimes. The three characters soon have to be holed up in a haberdashery where they meet five other strangers: Chris Mannix the local sheriff, Bob the person temporarily in charge, Oswaldo Mobray the town's hangman, Joe Gage a cowboy, and Bruce Dern as retired General Sanford Smithers; and one, some, or if not all of them are not what they say they are.<br/><br/>The apparent obstacle of the film centers on Ruth's distrust of the six other men with his prized bounty prisoner, whom he believes they might be after. This creates a sense of tension and paranoia in the movie, a whodunit, and a ""who can you trust?"" Being dealt with the dilemma of having to take a side of one of these despicable characters is both difficult and uncomfortable, since as an audience member that is what we are conditioned to do with mediums of fiction – take the side and the perspective of the protagonist. With a more traditional movie, the protagonist will be easily identified, however with The Hateful Eight, it lives up to its namesake as it presents you with characters that are shady and two-faced, so much so even by the time the credits roll, you are still left with uncertainty on who exactly to believe in.<br/><br/>With our modern sensibilities, even the most ""likeable"" – and I use the word very loosely, character is hard to like since every one of them are either women-beating and/or racist epithet-saying jerks. With every white character using the N-word freely against the lone African American, Major Warren, we cannot help but to stand by his side, if just only for those moments. Race relation is one of the central themes of the film, which I do not doubt the always progressive-minded Tarantino deliberately left in contemporary messages. One of the lines spoken by Warren in regards to black and white relations will surely ring true with the mass and will keep you thinking well after the movie.<br/><br/>The film in whole is a mystery suspense film disguised as a western. Trust, fear, distrust, paranoia all play out in bloody perfect fashion in mostly one setting, not unlike a stage play. Its often eccentric and exaggerated performances mirror Broadway to great effect. The haberdashery, the location where the majority of the film takes place is just a medium-sized one room structure that houses eight strangers. This allows the story to play out more personal and close, and at times gives a sense of inevitable doom. Imagine locking two roosters in a small cage, something is ought to happen, and will probably not be pretty.<br/><br/>Tarantino is no stranger to violence, but a lot of other films are also violent, so what separates those film's violence and Tarantino violence? The answer is simple: the suspension prior to the brutality; Tarantino is absolutely masterful doing it. If you are familiar with his movies you know the setup of two or a few characters sitting around a table, ostensibly talking about mundane things that generally do not push the plot forward, but instead acts as a conduit to envelop the characters' true intentions. The performances from each one of the actors are great and the dialogues are razor sharp to keep you engaged, sometimes laughing, oftentimes holding your breath. Tarantino does a wonderful job in allowing the audience to know that things are not what it seem, he will let you in a little, but not too much. He keeps his secret to himself until he wants to let you know, but for now, just enjoy the ticking time bomb from underneath the table. In a Quentin Tarantino film, it is not a matter of if the bomb will blow, but when. The result is the use of violence that is not cheap shock, but earned reward.<br/><br/>If you liked Tarantino's other films, then this movie is a denser more personal version than all of his past works. If you do not like them, or feel offended by them, then this probably will not change your mind. At close to three hours, the pace is effortless, as lines between the characters will lock the audience in better than any gargantuan action scene from a summer blockbuster this year. Like Tarantino's other masquerading western, this is a violent film that will surely leave you in awe."
"plpregent","8","2","15","6 January 2016"," Delightful Eight
","Quentin Tarantino's eighth film is set right after the Civil War, and features plenty of very colourful characters: bounty hunters, an infamous most wanted female criminal, a wannabe sheriff, a hangman, a cow puncher, a former confederate General, among a few more. In the middle of a harsh blizzard, the fates of all these characters will cross paths as they find refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery. However, as they get to know each other more, and as they find out what brought each one of them to that place, a captivating, although slightly predictable story filled with deception, betrayal and murder will unfold.<br/><br/>The film opens with a lengthy and beautiful shot of a stone cross planted in the middle of a snowy Wyoming landscape, with Ennio Morriccone's dramatically intense music playing. The next few scenes feature a stagecoach in the middle of the blizzard, with a few crazy encounters during which the audience returns to a somehow familiar territory, which they'll be undoubtedly looking for: epic and tense conversations between colourful characters in pure Tarantino fashion. <br/><br/>After the first few chapters (yes, the film is divided in chapters), the first few characters that we got to meet mercifully find refuge in Minnie's Haberdashery. Needless to say, most of the film's remaining runtime will be spent in those closed quarters. <br/><br/>Mr. Tarantino makes it clear right from the start: he hasn't lost his touch for wonderful direction. The first few chapters set in the wintry Wyoming landscapes are amazing to watch, as every shot is cleverly calculated, the photography is stellar, and the weather is so well depicted that when the stagecoach finally reaches Minnie's Haberdashery, I felt relieved for the freezing characters. Those first few scenes were some of my favourite in the entire picture.<br/><br/>Setting a major part of the film's duration in the same room was a risky choice, but the set is so beautifully lit and decorated, it actually pays off. <br/><br/>In terms of storyline, it would be easy to draw a few comparisons with Reservoir Dogs for a few aspects: the way the story is broken down into chapters, which play with chronology in a similar fashion, the closed quarters setting, as well as all these characters suspecting one another of not being who they pretend to be. That being said, The Hateful Eight's storyline is a bit more linear and doesn't offer the kind of plot twists that Reservoir Dogs' story did. That being said, they're different movies, and comparing these two films would be like comparing apples and oranges. My point is, do not go in there expecting Tarantino's most elaborate and original storyline. That's it. And that takes nothing away from the film's numerous qualities.<br/><br/>The film's strongest asset is its characters. It does take a great writer to create incredible characters, and it sure takes just as talented and enthusiastic of a cast to bring them to life and make them shine on the big screen. We're talking about brilliance here, from the dialogue to the demeanour, everyone greatly impresses here, with Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh stealing the show on many occasions. Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson are all unforgettable, and each drew genuine laughter from the crowd. Unbelievable performances here.<br/><br/>Even though this is not my favourite Tarantino film, The Hateful Eight is one hell of a bloody, honest good time. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen (it was shot in beautiful 70mm, and it shows). Good, light-hearted character-driven picture with both funny and tense moments, a clever use of political undertones and a superbly depicted and photographed blizzard setting. Not a masterpiece, but definitely a treat to watch."

","They made a big deal about Quentin Tarantino filming ""The Hateful Eight"" in 70 mm. Great, I thought, I love big, wide screen westerns. You don't get to see them that often anymore. Then he films 90% of the movie inside a cabin. What?!? Oh boy, I knew then I'd been had, again, by QT. I don't like the expression but I'll use it anyway: QT jumped the shark many, many years ago. He fell into the same trap as Brian DePalma (one of my favorites). DePalma was great at paying homage (ripping off) Alfred Hitchcock. Then he began ripping off himself. QT payed homage to many different film makers. Now, he just pays ""homage"" to himself. Skip ""The Hateful Eight"" and watch QT's ""Reservoir Dogs"" instead. They're both the same movie and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is an hour and a half shorter."
"kastrino","5","1","5","8 April 2019"," Same old same old
","Typical Tarantino fair in his post Kill Bill era. Very slow pace, endless talking, gore and violence that this time looks more out of place than in most of his films. It was good to see Michael Madsen and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a leading role once again, also Tim Roth was great but that's about it. Personally I had very little interest for the outcome of most of the characters and to tell the truth the predictably grand finale seemed forced even for Tarantino's standards. I can't say that I am a big fan of Tarantino and his work, but Reservoir Dogs changed my life as a cinema goer back in the day. His next few movies built upon this premise but after Kill Bill Tarantino changed his style, a style that he retains in all of his movies and I admit I don't particularly enjoy it."

I just waited and waited for anything of interest to happen and it never did.<br/><br/>I can write you a story of a family being trapped in a snowy mountain, discussing irrelevance. Nothing of that would ever produce interest in Hollywood.

","Quentin Tarantino is a man who knows how to put together a good yarn. He can bring originality to what from the surface seems to have been done a million times. Unlike that other unbelievable tale set in the frozen forests, this one has a collection of despicable human beings who might or not be who they claim to be. For three hours he treats us to biting exchanges, full of sarcasm, insight, clever lines, and some situations that because of their ugliness shouldn't be funny, but we can't help laughing at human flaws.<br/><br/>Helped by a brilliant cast, including Jackson, Roth, Jason-Leigh, Madsen, and more, he keeps us glued to the screen, not wanting to miss any of the ""chapters"", the clues, the red herrings, the constant barrage of insults, and of course, the twist at the end, and a visual feast that will surprise even those who are accustomed to his usual display of violence.<br/><br/>One prisoner is being taken to Red Rock where she will be tried and hung. Along the way people join that party, and they eventually find their way to an outpost where things are to become more complicated. Set right after the Civil War, we find people are still affected by the political and civil wounds of the country. Jackson is a man who has never held back, and what is truly enjoyable in this tale is that there are no weak links, no matter how small the part is. There is no doubt: everyone is dangerous and not to be trusted. Unlike ""Force"" we don't stop to think whether it was the casting that ruined the part, or if the part was written that way. There is no ambiguity here. There are bad people, and there are really rotten ones. There are those who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and there are still plenty of surprises in a story that shines for its unity and consistency. Even moments of unspeakable beauty while horses pull their carriages speak of coming danger. It's pretty, but it's not safe. With the help of expert cinematographer Robert Richardson, and a killer score by the always sublime Morricone, everything in this film just works marvelously.<br/><br/>No moment in its three hours is wasted. We fear the cold, the dark corner in the room, and we later find out that no spot is safe here. No metaphysics here, no unbelievable shots of super strength, just damaged goods from the beginning. People come up with the more twisted reasons for doing what they need or want. However, there is also the need to survive, to learn, and hopefully to move forward. We don't get long takes for us to know how miserable the surroundings are in and outside any dwellings. We see fully developed human beings, who tell us their life stories with snappy dialog or a wink of an eye. Smiles, smirks, laughs all have meaning. People cry, shout, yell, slowly deliver a powerful message to their adversaries or to us. The film has acting, lines, and technical elements of first quality that impress us because they are good not because they might be hiding weak spots. The package is loaded with snakes, and you'd better watch your hands, your backs, or in some cases, your head.<br/><br/>This film ranks among Tarantino's best, and we are grateful that he continues to deliver some of the best cinema can offer. We can tell he loves movies, he loves writing movies, and we love him for that."
"brchthethird","8","1","5","28 April 2016"," Mostly solid parlor mystery a la Tarantino
","For the most part, Quentin Tarantino has been on a roll since the early 90's, and none of his films could be considered objectively ""bad."" Still, some are better (or more enjoyable) than others. After two solid (but imperfect) classics in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS and DJANGO UNCHAINED, his follow-up, THE HATEFUL EIGHT, was kind of a step back for me. By no means am I calling THE HATEFUL bad, but it had a mean streak that undermined the fun I usually expect from Tarantino's films. The plot involves a group of eight travelers to Red Rock who converge on a bar called Minnie's Haberdashery. While there, suspicion on all sides leads to conflict. As far as Tarantino movies go, this one fits right in. All the requisite elements are there: cool dialogue, a great soundtrack, and explosions of violence. The difference here is primarily one of pacing, which might turn some people off. I didn't mind it so much, but I would understand if others did. As indicated by the title, there are no likable characters to be found, although they all do have their moments to shine. My favorite characters ended up being Samuel L. Jackson's Major Marquis Warren (no surprise) and (big surprise) Walton Goggins' Chris Mannix. The only odd fit, despite being a prior Tarantino regular, was Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray, who seemed to be doing a Christoph Waltz impression most of the time. Generally speaking, all the performances were good, though. My biggest issue with the film itself has to be how the mystery reveals are handled in the second half. There were no clues given as to the answer, and revealing everything in flashback without hinting at anything first (at least that I noticed on one viewing) just smacked of weak writing. Ultimately, though, THE HATEFUL EIGHT has all of the Tarantino hallmarks and is a decent film for it. Also worth noting is the score by Ennio Morricone, comprising unused cues from John Carpenter's THE THING, an interesting detail that makes complete sense when you consider how thematically similar the two films are. My only reservations would be to people not yet initiated into Tarantino's style, or those who don't like profanity and graphic violence. Otherwise, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is definitely worth a watch."
"dcarsonhagy","2","1","5","4 April 2016"," Tarantino Has Run out of Ideas
","Since there is absolutely just about NOTHING to watch on television anymore, a friend and I decided to check out Tarantino's latest offering, ""The Hateful Eight"" last evening. I should have read a book.<br/><br/>This was one of the most stomach-turning assault on the senses I have ever witnessed. You are treated to several characters that no one could ever like, much less ""pull for"" in any situation. They are all indeed hateful, yet what Tarantino did to his characters induces more than just hate from its viewers.<br/><br/>John Ruth (played by Kurt Russell), an infamous bounty hunter, is on his way to Red Rock, WY, with his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) in tow. He is going to make sure she hangs and he gets the $10,000 bounty placed on her head. Traveling by stagecoach, they are trying to outrun a blizzard. Along the way, Ruth picks up Maj.Marquis Warren (played by Samuel L. Jackson), and newly elected sheriff of Rock Ridge, Chris Mannix, (played by Walter Goggins). They travel as far as they can but have to hole up in a haberdashery with four other curious fellows. I will not go any further into the plot.<br/><br/>Tarantino is well known for his excesses in his movies, and this one is no different. That being said, I believe Tarantino needs to be told by someone that sometimes less is more. This movie, which lasts close to three hours, is chock full of the ""N"" word (it seemed at one point, it was every OTHER word), the ""F""-bomb, G-d's, MF's; you name it; it's in there. I have said on many occasions that Tarantino is living out his biggest fantasies in his films, and one of those fantasies is being a misogynist. Daisy, it would seem, is only in ANY scene in order for her to either get punched in the mouth, pistol whipped, or to have her teeth knocked out. How Leigh ever got an Oscar nomination for this role still has me puzzled. And a flashback story the Major tells was simply nauseating. Also, someone please explain to me how Ennio Morricone received an Oscar for best musical score. <br/><br/>This movie is rated ""R"" and contains male on male sodomy, full nudity, graphic violence, and language. Adults (especially parents) are STRONGLY CAUTIONED about who they may let view this. I would say it should not be viewed by anyone under 18. For all of his movies, Tarantino has finally gotten his point across: He has absolutely nothing to say."

","Of all the QT films I have seen I would have to rate (or should that be r8?) the Hateful Eight as the least effectual. It seems that Tarantino operates at the height of his game when he is making his OWN movies and not paying homage to an obsolete genre with a pastiche (read fake) style.<br/><br/>Set in a post-civil war Wyoming the movie takes its time setting up the characters with a long prologue before finally arriving at the stagecoach outpost where our awful octet growl and point guns at each other for two hours. Tarantino never really seems to know what kind of movie he is making here, awkwardly fusing a western with a whodunnit, which would be fine under any other circumstances but he does it in such a cartoonish and immature way.<br/><br/>Even with a 3-hour running time (depending on which version you're watching) there's not enough breathing room for these characters to all have equal development. Tim Roth can only bring his Oswaldo Mowbray to life with a silly accent, while Michael Madness as Joe Gage has nothing to do but squint and channel his inner Nick Nolte. Kurt Russell and Sam Jackson work great together though, while Jennifer Jason Leigh makes for a truly vile lady villain.<br/><br/>Tarantino's super-duper indulgent 2.76:1 photography is almost entirely ineffectual for what is, essentially, a single-set stage play. The establishing shots are nice and all, but there's nothing here that could not be achieved with regular anamorphic Panavision. I saw a 70mm version of the movie and felt that the much wider screen only created problems. Pulling off a close-up in 2.35:1 is already hard to do, but here a close-up is nothing more than a very centered headshot with excessive picture information at the sides. This type of movie is completely unsuitable for the Super Panavision 70 format.<br/><br/>I was excited to hear Ennio Morricone's score, especially since Tarantino has been reluctant to have (original) musical scores until this point, but it's basically just one melody played over and over, with the exception of one track I am sure was pulled from the score to The Thing. It was a track I always felt was John Barry-esque and easily identifiable. Hiring Morricone to do the score proves that Tarantino thinks he's making a 1960s spaghetti western when really he's just pretending to, a trait that doomed those utterly moronic Grindhouse movies a few years ago.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was. I walked out of this mildly entertained with a large crowd of people who felt about the same. And why does Channing Tatum have to be in EV-ER-Y-THING? I so sick, sick, SICK to death of seeing him in movies. There is such a thing as overexposure, you know!"

","In Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight,"" we're reminded that beyond charity work, holding hands and singing Kumbaya in a circle, nothing brings two people separated by culture, race or religion together like a common enemy.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film's action takes place in Minnie's Haberdashery, a refuge for every wide-brimmed, black hat wearing western supervillian. It's the kind of place where John Ruth (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter affectionately referred to as ""the hangman"" because he always brings his man in alive to watch them hang, is the lesser of eight evils. <br/><br/>Russell plays Ruth like John Wayne's shadow--walking tall, talking slow, strong to his convictions, but wrapped in the nihilism of Eastwood's ""man with no name."" It's been said that Laurence Olivier could recite Shakespeare so well, it was as if he was coming up with the words himself; the same could be said of Tarantino's dialogue for Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers a monologue in this film so dastardly and wicked, that each breath should be captured and bottled up for risk of tarnishing the ozone. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Ruth's latest bounty, a cackling package of juvenile malevolence. Bruce Dern has earned his placed among the hateful eight through his prior work in westerns, as he's the first man--and one of few--to ever kill John Wayne on screen. ""The Shield"" alum, Walton Goggins, who reminds me of a young Bruce Dern, is terrific fun to watch as the proud, pisant son of a confederate soldier.<br/><br/>Whereas most Tarantino films are packed with violence from one end to the other, the violence here is more thoughtful and impactful, as dialogue becomes its wing-man, building it up until you're dying to meet it. <br/><br/>There is also an underlying theme of the elasticity of reality, as the film treats fiction and truth like blood and water: one drop of blood in a glass of water, and water's not water anymore; it's blood. But a drop of water in a glass of blood simply vanishes.<br/><br/>If ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is roller coaster fun, ""The Hateful Eight"" is page-turner fun. As great and rollicking as the dialogue is--and this could probably work as a radio play--it's taken to another level with every crooked smile and sideways glance. And ironically, despite the heinous cast of characters, the ending to the film is somewhat sweet.<br/><br/>Not perfect, but all I want.<br/><br/>(I was fortunate enough to see the film in 70mm. It's impossible to comment on how much better it was than a digital screening, or if the film hadn't been shot with anamorphic lenses, unless I was able to see the film in that fashion. However, there was a scene when Jennifer Jason Leigh was having a Ricky Nelson from ""Rio Bravo"" moment, and characters were moving in the background from one side the screen to the other, back and forth. It was here the huge aspect ratio really hit me.)"

","""Now, Daisy, I want us to work out a signal system of communication. When I elbow you real hard in the face, that means: shut up."" <br/><br/>Countless film enthusiasts were waiting impatiently for the new ""Star Wars"" movie last year. Believe it or not, I wasn't really. On the contrary, I was waiting for the new film by Quentin Tarantino. Sorry Tarantino haters, but Yankee Doodle Dandee, this was again a brilliant film by the most rebellious, anarchic director Hollywood ever saw. You have to give him credit for one thing : he remained true to his personal style. So once again we get a typical Tarantino movie with acrimonious dialogs, racist statements and a bloody apotheosis. The end result is a kind of ""Reservoir Dogs"" mixed with ""Django Unchained"", which takes place in a small space as in ""From dusk till dawn"". I hope Quentin's abandons the intention to make only 10 films. But isn't it time he changed his routine a bit? <br/><br/>Are you a big fan of classic Italian spaghetti westerns? Well you'll be enthusiastic when the movie begins in all its grand splendor. A snowy landscape with in the foreground a cross covered with snow. And while slowly zooming out, you can see a stagecoach approaching in the far distance. This is accompanied by music of Ennio Morricone and text in a font type that can be associated with old westerns. The moment this chariot stops willfully (after a long period) because Samuel L. Jackson, sitting on a pile of corpses, blocks the road, it's the start of a nearly 3-hour immersive cowboy story full of mystery and revenge. A kind of Cluedo in a cabin. Except that there won't be a solution that sounds like ""The colonel committed the murder with a candlestick in the billiard room"", but rather ""Which of the eight people who took shelter in Minnie's Haberdashery because of a snowstorm, will endure the storm"".<br/><br/>The hateful 8 are almost all old acquaintances of Tarantino and appeared in one of his earlier film projects. First there's Samuel L. Jackson, who recently starred in ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (after some less impressive performances) and in the past appeared in ""Pulp Fiction"", as the bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren. Samuel L. Jackson as I like to see him: raw, angrily defending himself and disturbingly brutal. The white bounty hunter John Ruth is played by veteran Kurt ""Death Proof"" Russell. A bounty hunter just like Major Warren, but suspicious and protective when it comes to the award he's getting for his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Along the way they pick up Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton ""Django Unchained"" Goggins), who's on his way to Red Rock, the place where Ruth wants to get his money. The blizzard however prevents them from traveling further and they have to sit out the storm in Minnie's cabin. And this in company of a Mexican called Bob (Demian Bichir), the executioner Oswaldo Mobray (Tim ""Reservoir dogs"" Roth), the wandering cowboy Joe Gage (Michael ""Reservoir dogs"" Madsen) and former general Sandy Smithers (Bruce ""Django Unchained"" Dern). So everything is prepared now for a thoughtful game of 'whodunit' with Domergue at stake.<br/><br/>Despite the long runtime (3 hours is a bit too much), the movie isn't boring for a second. The conversation at the beginning between Jackson and Russell is a foretaste of what comes after wards. Because the whole film is full of such hilarious conversations. The film is neatly divided into six chapters. The story is explained in detail painfully slow. And as required in a real Tarantino, the film is peppered with humor, rude and racist comments and an exaggerated end with massively flowing blood. And all this in a meticulously elaborate and detailed decor. It looks more like a Shakespearean drama.<br/><br/>Needless to say that the acting of the various characters deserve the most praise, because the film consists mainly out of brilliant dialogs. A memorable joust with witty arguments and dialogs which made sure the tension increased. The contributions of Russell and Jackson were in this case of a high level. The only rather bizarre choice for me by Tarantino is the presence of Channing Tatum. I would have preferred an appearance of Christoph Waltz.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm a huge admirer of the work that Tarantino always delivers. And yet I think ""The hateful Eight"" isn't his most successful creation, even though it's a wonderful masterpiece. Perhaps it's because I see through the concept that Tarantino uses and the surprise element is completely gone. The way the dialogs are structures, is indeed always the same. The repetitive nature of dialogs and the phrases that follow each other at breakneck speed as if they are fired by a Gatling gun. Patiently and meticulously the complete story is being formed. For the impatient viewer it appears as if it takes ages to finish. Of course there's the rudeness and inclemency both contextual as textual. And the usage of extravagant humor. And finally, the excessive, violent and bloody climax. These are usually the fixed elements that recur in a Tarantino. Except that each film is placed in a different setting.<br/><br/>But as a true Tarantino fan, again I can only conclude this was an exquisite film and I enjoyed it full three hours. I'm already looking forward to the next movie. Hopefully Quentin seeks an alternative approach, in such a way that he can surprise me again.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"scottshak_111","8","1","5","17 February 2016"," The Hateful Eight is a thrilling crime carnage that crawls and feeds on utter suspense.
","Quentin has a knack for making the awesome. Not only does he walk in with a dope gore crime drama in his baggage, but he directs the tale magnificently too.<br/><br/>Plot, strewn across three hours of engaging drama, entails six chapters akin to a book that have been well played by a stellar cast. With the front runner Quentin's ace Samuel L. Jackson under the skin of Major Marquis Warren, and Kurt Russell as John Ruth, a.k.a The Hangman, to do us the honours in the form of bounty hunters, with the latter carrying a brutal plot alongside in cuffs, everyone is headed towards a chaotic world waiting at Minnie's haberdashery. What is quite beautiful is the way the story unfolds. You almost feel like nothing's wrong and yet everything is! The theme is loosely based on blood law, where shooting a perpetrator is simply a form of justice nail and jackhammering it down is a perfect way to end it. But you need to understand if it's a bandit landscape, killing or shooting without a conscience, without batting an eye, is an acceptable way of living.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh is simply outstanding as Daisy Domergue. Tatum has basically a cameo of a role. Walton Goggins is exceptional. Demian Bichir's short stint as Bob can't be overlooked either. Both Madsen and Roth have done their bits nicely.<br/><br/>Ennio Morricone's theme is addictive as he weaves a thrilling score to complement the tale. Sometimes fed in by awesome songs like Apple Blossom, Now you're All Alone and There Won't Be Many Coming Home, cut off superbly by Quentin frames, the end product turns out to be sheer delight.<br/><br/>Tarantino's head is a cruel world. Bullets and gore are his favorite props. But it's never confined to that. He always has a unique story to tell, which makes for a great movie watching experience. You can almost sway to the Tarantino rhythm as he prolongs frames for emphasis. But sometimes you do wish some editing to take over and snip off some unwanted bits quickly and be over with. What the movie misses on is gut-wrenching tension that used to be the crux of Quentin's earlier works.<br/><br/>Another downside of The Hateful Eight is at times you feel everything enacted. There is a fluency missing in the flick that fails to connect every act. With a screenplay that appears being 'read' and crispy lines that fail to mingle with others, for a touch of the innate, it seems more of a theatrical put-on act. It is only by the time you reach Chapter Four that you begin enjoying the flick truly, for it is then when sham paves way for clarity and things become more dramatic.<br/><br/>However, leave out the above minute details and The Hateful Eight is still a gorgeous criminal entertainer that speaks only of brilliance. Go watch! Tarantinites shouldn't miss it for the world!"
"movieaddict_bh","8","1","5","14 February 2016"," Tarantino does it again!
","Let's start from the beginning. First, the script was unfortunately leaked online, forcing Tarantino to pull the plug on the whole movie. Some time after, Tarantino decided to share the opening monologue with fans in Comic-Con. The applause he received led him to change his mind and make the film. <br/><br/>If you're going to compare this movie with Tarantino's previous work (Django Unchained, Inglorious Bastards), then this movie might disappoint you. However, if you go in with absolutely no expectations, then I have no doubt that you will enjoy it. Although I rate most Tarantino movies as either a 8.5 or a 9, I felt that this movie deserved no more or less than an 8. <br/><br/>Lets take a look at some of the main characters, Samuel L.Jackson plays a bounty hunter by the name of Major Marquis Warren, Kurt Russell plays another legendary bounty hunter by the name of John Ruth, and Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Daisy Domergue (the prisoner). <br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson delivers his usual witty one-liners and creative curse insults which will no doubt excite most audiences and make hardcore Tarantino fans remember his role in Pulp Fiction. Kurt Russell delivers a satisfactory performance. But the main surprise is Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is arguably the least known star in the film. The exceptional performance she delivers in this movie won her an Oscar nomination for Best Performance by and Actress in a Supporting Role. Tarantino has created another star in Jennifer Jason Leigh, just as he did with Christopher Waltz in Inglorious Bastards. <br/><br/>One of the downsides in the film is that it's 3 hours and 7 minutes. With very long scenes of slow dialogue. Other than that the film is entertaining, a classic, and definitely worth watching."
"jtindahouse","9","1","5","14 February 2016"," Not Tarantino's best overall but the second half is incredible
","I had heard mixed reviews from people I knew going into 'The Hateful Eight', some saying they were let down, others saying it was Tarantino's best yet, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Then, at about the one hour mark I realised I wasn't enjoying myself as much as I usually am in one of his films. Something just wasn't right. I'm always very patient with dialogue in his movies, because even if it has nothing to do with the story at hand, it's still usually a pleasure to listen to. However I wasn't finding that on this occasion. It didn't feel like a Tarantino film. I was aware that he had, at one stage, decided to pull out of making it due to the script being leaked, and I wondered whether in fact this had been an attempt to not make a film based on what was a weak script. Then the second half kicked in and things got a whole lot better.<br/><br/>The first half, in comparison to the second half, of this film are chalk and cheese. As soon as Samuel L. Jackson's character begins a certain speech, about a certain thing he did, things ignite and never cease. Sadly a lot of damage has been done to the reputation of the film in that first hour and a half or so, but things just become so damn entertaining after that that you're almost willing to completely forgive. When Tarantino is in form there is no filmmaker in the world that can match him. He has an ability to do things that if any other filmmaker in the world tried they'd seem ridiculous. However when he does them, they seem unbelievably stylish and effective. He also always gets the best out of his actors.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh has been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance here and rightly so. Of the main characters she's the only female in a very violent and ego-driven lot, and yet she completely holds her own. To be honest I was barely familiar with her as an actress at all before this, but now if I see her name in something I will take note. I don't think she quite has a shot at winning the award but her nomination is undoubtedly thoroughly deserved.<br/><br/>Nearing three hours in runtime is really testing the patience of a lot of film goers in the modern day. There are filmmakers who can pull it off without you even noticing this is the case, and Tarantino is one of them, but 'The Hateful Eight' is not. There is not enough happening in the first half to keep the audience's attention and while the pay off is unquestionably brilliant, Tarantino is good enough to make the set-up equally entertaining. He failed to do that here. That really is the only criticism though of an otherwise incredibly fine film. As always I can't wait to see what the man does next."
"dancochrane-26963","9","1","5","13 February 2016"," Amazing
","It appears this movie is like marmite, you love it or hate it.<br/><br/>I am most definitely one of the former. I find it hard to understand the people who give this film a one star rating. Sure, its not full on high octane action and I would imagine if this is what your after you would get more pleasure from watching The Transformer ;) or more seriously Django Unchained.<br/><br/>However, the premise of this film is superb and the way it is shot is amazing. I was hooked from start to finish. It was just what i would have expected from Tarantino taking on a spaghetti western.<br/><br/>Excellent."
"rtcnz","7","1","5","13 February 2016"," Utterly captivating but ultimately a bit hollow
","As always, Tarantino commands the viewer's attention effortlessly. Once again, there are brilliant characters, snappy dialogue, and violence almost elevated to an art form. It's buckets of fun.<br/><br/>The ""hateful eight"" aren't good guys. There are two bounty hunters (Jackson, Russell), a criminal on her way to be hung (Jason Leigh), a new sheriff (Goggins), an elderly general who used to be a confederate (Dern), a hangman (Roth) and a 'cowboy' (Madsen). They're trapped in a cabin during a blizzard. And so the premise is, Kurt Russell's bounty hunter says: ""One of those men's not who he says he is"".<br/><br/>It's a tantalizing mystery, a hook, and I would never spoil anything for anyone. Except to say I sort of expected...more. The entire film is captivating but the first half is perfection; the second half gets a bit messy. It's like an Agatha Christie book - a needlessly convoluted murder plot is revealed... when in fact the whole thing SURELY could've been done a little easier? It gets messy, and even though the last few scenes are a lot of blood-n-guts-y fun, I walked away feel a tiny bit short-changed. Tarantino's earlier two films, Django and Inglourious, always leave me feeling exhausted, elated, inspired, excited. This one left me a bit ... meh.<br/><br/>Still, any Tarantino is better than none at all, and a 7/10 is hardly a bad review. It's hard trying to outdo yourself when you've set the bar too high. I still say this is a must-watch!"
"Ziya90","6","1","5","12 February 2016"," Has justice been done?
","Hateful Eight is less cheesy than ""Django"", but the movie has problems of its own. This time, Tarantino gives us a more solid Western but also, gives us a little nasty work (no pun indeed) For the first time, in a Tarantino movie, I found some dialogs very unnecessary and uninteresting especially in the first two acts. Conversations in Pulp Fiction, Basterds and even Death Proof were brilliant, moving and smart. To watch Kurt Russell years later as the main hero (or at least one of them) was pure joy, a nostalgia, especially for 90s kids, but since his character is not deep or dominant caused by Tarantino's lazy script, his effect on the screen doesn't continue long. The character cannot be an unforgettable character like some other Tarantino characters. Michael Madsen by his offbeat character, was entertaining, but a bad-ass character would fit him much better. Just to throw us a curve, Tarantino wastes him. The character's low key manners don't make the movie brilliant or something. Then another plot twist in the flashback sequence, then another plot twist etc. all those u- turns don't give you goosebumps. The star of the movie is Leigh like Waltz in ""Basterds"". It was not acting, something else. It was just crazy and it may get Merly Streep roll in her bed! Tim Roth is the movie's Christopher Waltz in ""Django"". As for Samuel L. Jackson, anything to say? He is extraordinary! Leigh and Jackson steal the show whenever they have that chance! Zoe Bell was disappointing in her role. I am terribly sorry. Channing Tatum was good and solid, but he needed more adequate screen time. The flashback sequence is terrifying, it reminds you Kill Bill, but the tone of this sequence doesn't have an integrity with the other chapters. It sounds like a short film itself. A really impressive and shocking short film, but inside the movie, it was little odd. By the way, some cruel and vicious acts of some characters have a difficulty in giving us a ""hateful"" effect against them because of their portrayal in the previous chapters. My ""hero"" of the movie was Daisy and I can understand ""this film has some misogynist"" criticisms, not because of those punches, but because of that disgusting final who may give you vomiting! In the movie "" Inglourious Basterds"", we love Shosanna and then we hate Shosanna and then again we love Shosanna, but later we hate Shosanna. It is like Mr. Tarantino has a confusion about some of his characters written by him. In ""Hateful Eight"", for example, there is a character that ninety nine percent of the people would hate or there is another character with some repulsive actions, but later, they become hero. Sorry, but what? In contrast with the hype, ""Hateful Eight"" is not a bloodbath like ""Django"" or ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" It is not an action movie also. Don't expect gunfights like ""Unforgiven"" or like some other Western classics. The cowboys in this movie use their brains rather than their guns, but it is not like a smart chess game between cowboys. Also, slow-mo effects lessen the effect of some action moments. The character Warren played by hilarious Jackson loses his charm after his confessions. As said before, Russell is just great, but his potential was wasted after a while, because of some plot twists. Finally, in the final moments, I don't believe that there is anything for catharsis or anything that would make you cheered up. After the end credits, I asked myself, has justice been done?"

","This is the first time I actually come out of a Tarantino movie, majorly unimpressed. I am so sad about that. I didn't love Django as much as everybody, yet I still found lots to enjoy about it, yet this time around I really feel uninspired by it, something that never, ever happened with Tarantino. Now, I don't want to give the impression that I am the number one fan of his, I'll admit up front I am not. I love almost all of his movies and he is a filmmaker that taught me a lot about cinema, but with the exception of the masterpiece ""Inglourious Basterds"", I've never fallen head over heels for his work.<br/><br/>Yet, lets give a break to all the depression here. My vote for the film is still positive and deservingly so because it does have many things going for it that I managed to appreciate. The fact that I am talking so negatively about it is because I am so used to high standards with him it is strange to be in this place where I actually have something to actively criticize about his film.<br/><br/>Before that I will say that the score of the film is fantastic. The sound is fascinatingly crafted and contributes more than the cinematography in giving the film a vibe. Talking about cinematography, I'll admit I didn't see this in 70mm but on a standard screen and I found it to be pretty standard on that front. Nothing really exceptional, the thing that's really to like about it is how beautifully it is lit and how exceptionally broad and warm the color palette is, and it fits right into, thanks also to some really admirable production design. Yet, at no point in the film I thought: ""wow look at that shot"", it all went pretty over the shoulder.<br/><br/>There is an interesting conversation to be had on this film because I truly realized how the photography wasn't serving the story the majority of the time. Now, of course it is extremely difficult to make that work in such a narrow setting, ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Dial M for Murder"" being the best examples where they actually found a way to tell that story visually too, despite being locked in a room for all film. Yet here it is absolutely disconnected.<br/><br/>And this really brings me to the focal point of this film and it's problem: it is not ever telling a story. You take something like the opening scene of ""Inglourious Basterds"" which might be as perfect as scenes get. You look at what the characters say, how the camera moves, how the actors are placed. Everything there is about telling the audience something, making them feel every drop of sweat of the farmer. Now, I look at the entirety of ""The Hateul Eight"" and it seems the total opposite. I couldn't believe the dialogue I was hearing, for heaven's sake, the characters talk exposition for three hours straight! At no point in this film there is a genuine conversation with subtext and tension. You are constantly told by the characters on screen what is going on, what was going on and what will be going on, there is absolutely no space left for storytelling and tension. No wonder the photography is so disconnected, it wouldn't be possible to give any type of context on a screen to these conversations since they are absolutely emotionless. I was truly baffled by this, I was constantly unimpressed and unengaged and I wonder how could I have possibly been so if the film is just a three hour exposition! And it doesn't stop there because it also feels the need mid way through to get Quentin Tarantino himself to start explaining the plot to us. I truly wonder how can it be possible for someone to get emotionally engaged in such a narrative. And the more I write about this the more I realize how cheaply the film is built around this. Not to mention the fact that it is so dam unnecessarily long. There is a scene in which it takes 10 to 15 seconds for a character to get his glove off. I found myself thinking constantly: ""you could have told that whole thing in two shots and two cuts"" whilst the actual movie was taking twenty minutes to do so.<br/><br/>Basically I think the screenplay of this film is really its big weakness, because I think too that as a director, Tarantino manages to pull off some really good stuff here. Spot on casting, amazing performances from everybody, it is so unfortunate their dialogue is so boring, but thanks to some truly brilliant collaboration between the cast and the director, they manage to make three hours actually bearable. Tim Roth being the big stand out for me followed by some inspired work by Walton Goggins, that is simply brought down by the fundamental problem of the film.<br/><br/>This is a really big step down in my opinion for Tarantino and I realize that even more so after having written this review: it is incredible how I found the dialogue to be bad, that is surreal to say for me with Tarantino. Still, this isn't a failure of a film by any stretch of the imagination, it still offers a good serving of fun and acting that can be still enjoyed at a certain level."

","""One of them fellas'll kill everybody in here..."" John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino movies, such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, linger like pop culture artifacts long into the memories of geeks and movie lovers. The Hateful Eight will follow along those lines with its emphasis on light-hearted violence that supports themes of racism sexism, and nationalism, among others.<br/><br/>""The Hangman"" bounty hunter John Ruth is transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to be hanged in Red Rock, and Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) has a couple of dead bodies to be transported in the same stage coach for collecting his bounty. Stuck at a way station in a Wyoming storm in post-Civil War, they and five other shady types spend two days sizing each other up and eliminating the bounty competition.<br/><br/>Underneath the gruff exterior of each eccentric character is a point the gifted director is making: Daisy is a woman, most unusual to be hanged in any age, but just as unlikeable and ornery as any of the rotten men--a sure-fire comment on today's egalitarian military.<br/><br/>Warren is regularly referred to as ""Nigger,"" reminding us that racism is both in our history over a hundred years ago and our present. Yet, he commands the stage as he demands respect even to claiming a personal letter from President Lincoln, a comment on the liberation of blacks long ago and the lingering combat with whites.<br/><br/>Some will be put off by the pervasive violence. However, violence is a part of the Tarantino experience, a statement about the dangerous culture we live in and the need to trivialize it in order to defeat it.<br/><br/>Besides, some of the film's humor comes from the unexpected mayhem and t casual way characters commit it (think Travolta and Jackson characters in Pulp Fiction). Fortunately most of the characters seem to deserve their fates, making the experience cathartic to some degree.<br/><br/>Because much of the action takes place inside the station, Tarantino is able to compose his shots like a stage play in which the antagonists can face off against each other in the frame, whose 70 mm projection allows for serious space between to emphasize their individual isolation. That's not to say the director is negligent in his wide open shots outdoors--the snow covered landscape with the six horse stage coaches in the distance is thrillingly made for the 70 mm. A nomination should be forthcoming.<br/><br/>Although The Hateful Eight is not my favorite Western, as The Magnificent Seven is, it ranks next to Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles and Tarantino's Django Unchained for tickling me about the genre I grew up on.<br/><br/>""Now, what would make a man brave a blizzard and kill in cold blood?

Especially his early work, I've seen both Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown a least half a dozen times each.<br/><br/>But to me he is sloping down. The long pompous dialogs are his trademark, and no Tarantino movie without them - but - everything within reason. To receive a 8/9/10 star IMDb-rating, a movie also needs to have an outstanding story, momentum and be captivating and it *really* takes time before The Hateful Eight even begins to approach that.<br/><br/>I all fairness I liked the movie. People that are giving it 1-3 stars are clearly overreacting. My girlfriend walked out near the end, which is really a shame, because that's when it gets entertaining!<br/><br/>I'm sure that if any half famous director had made this movie, it would have received negative criticism or simply be ignored. But Tarantino can get away with it, due to his back catalog. And that's a shame..."

","I can NOT recommend this movie to anyone, it was 2:48min long and it covers events that happen in a period, that covers less than 24hrs, during a snow storm. Lots of of gratuitous violence, blood and gruesome deaths (14-15, I lost count). Very, very dark western comedy, with lots of male on female violence (only 3 females in the movie). Wait for the DVD or cable release, it should be on HBO by May. (I enjoyed the time spent with my brother, I wish we would have seen Concussion instead.)The over use of and the very offensive use of the N-word, (I don't believe IMDb, will let me post the word or anything close to it)just for a laugh. No doubt the movie was setup like a comic book style movie, part of the Sin-City movie series."
"reknob","7","2","16","2 January 2016"," Typical QT frustrating stuff
","As always, there's good stuff here from QT but yet again, his indiscipline and self-indulgence drag this down to a 7 for me.<br/><br/>QT is an undoubtedly capable writer but he is constantly let down with both the editing and what seems to be weak direction with respect to forcing his actors to deliver in a particular manner.<br/><br/>Top of that list, I'm afraid, is Samuel L. Jackson who despite a generally good performance here, looks and sounds like he's just stepped out of 90's Compton and while that's always a problem for me in all his roles, it's all the more jarring in a period setting like this where all the other actors are delivering appropriate accents and mannerisms.<br/><br/>As for the other actors, they are uniformly terrific. Kurt Russell is always good value and I was delighted to see Bruce Dern here still showing he's got the acting chops and then some. Special mention should also go to Jennifer Jason Leigh who I thought led the bunch with QT quite clearly pushing her towards an Exorcist looking appearance - she was superb I thought and I could push her for a Best Supporting Actress nod here ...<br/><br/>I gather there's some fuss about the usage of the 'N' word here and while I think that's certainly an issue in the past, I don't have any problems with it in this setting. It's just post-Civil War for crying out loud and given the characters, it would seem inappropriate for that word *not* to be flung around all the time. Unfortunately, the issue I do have with it, and the 'MF' word is that yet again, Samuel L. Jackson is involved and I'm starting to have problems remembering a film where he *didn't* fling those words around all the time and it has become very, very off-putting for me and absolutely stops me from seeing him as anything else but Samuel L. Jackson, the guy who will look and sound the same in every film and you can bet your bottom Dollar that he'll be saying 'N' and 'MF' a lot, even if a film is set in 11th Century England ...<br/><br/>Clearly, the guy is doing well in terms of making money and getting into decent productions but I for one started avoiding his ""work"" some years ago because he ruins everything he's in for me - he's the black Keanu Reeves - I only managed to see this because of the amount of spare time I have over Xmas, otherwise I would have ducked it like all his other films ...<br/><br/>All in all, this is worth a watch but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it ...<br/><br/>Here's hoping that QT will, eventually, get a grip on himself and start making films that hit everyone in the right spot, not just himself and, presumably, his large gang of 20-something fans ..."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","16","24 December 2015"," Brutal, disturbing, tackles the real issues about violence.
","I loved Inglorious Basterds, and while I liked Dgango, so much of it I found to be just really messy, overlong and overall it just hasn't fared so well with me over time. When I heard of The Hateful Eight's runtime, I was concerned. I was afraid that like Django, it would run for far too long. What's interesting about it is that unlike with most Tarantino films, it started off kind of unengaging. I spent the first hour really developing an investment in these characters, so it isn't until after its first hour that I was completely on board with it, and from then on it sailed pretty smoothly. I don't think its runtime is a problem at all because it takes a while for it to totally connect, but when it does it only gets more enthralling. It's an oddly paced film, even for Tarantino, but it all seems to work. It's as if he wanted a film that was basically the extended version of the tavern scene from Inglorious Basterds. Moreso than with Django and similarly to Inglorious Basterds, I feel like there's a lot of thoughtful weight to the dialogue and what it means for the overarching thematic issues that Tarantino has been interested in exploring recently. I think Django, while kind of fun, is sort of meaningless. Here, I think he tackles the real issues of what violence is and what it can do. It's not a pretty film, and as a result the violence doesn't seem as cartoonish as the violence from Basterds or Django. It really, really hits here, so I'm not entirely surprised it isn't as well-reviewed as those two. It doesn't feel big or long just for the sake of it, there's a density here that will need to be further explored. It's a hard film to like. if seen on the surface I think many may have problems with all the violence, in particular towards Jennifer Jason Leigh.But that character didn't have to be female. It really didn't, and in the usual films of this type, it's usually a male. The fact that it is a female gives the proceedings so much more relevance and, as someone who was fearing having to witness that considering I'm always very critical of violence towards women and how it is portrayed, I was surprised at the levels the film was working at. In particular the final scene with Jennifer Jason Leigh is particularly brutal and disturbing, but it cemented the kind of issues I was sure Tarantino is wanting to hit at. Jennifer Jason Leigh strangled and choking to death as two men are hysterically laughing? On a visceral level, it's powerful, but kind of encompasses everything the film is trying to do and say about violence against certain groups. <br/><br/>In terms of its ensemble, really fantastic and one of the best casts he's ever assembled. The standout is definitely Jennifer Jason Leigh (and whether she is supporting or leading is another question). Overall I think this joins Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds as one of Tarantino's best films, and I do wish it wasn't getting as much criticism but at the same time I get it. In that respect, it's a little like The Wolf of Wall Street and (considering that I know it will get a lot of vitriol thrown towards it, I hope like Wolf it's a little re-evaluated with time."
"jakew500","8","2","17","5 January 2016"," This movie is intense
","With Hateful Eight Tarantino set out to mimic the spaghetti westerns he use to love in his youth, and I guess he sort of accomplished that in his Tarantino sort of way. IF anything, the Hateful eight is intense. The entire movie the amount of tension in the room is palpable, and incredibly believable. Throughout the movie you are anxiously trying to figure out who in the room is the one Samuel L Jackson's character is accusing of lying. Overall the film was very enjoyable, though I feel at times it went a little too far just for the sake of having gone that far. Other than those brief excursions into the insanely overly sexual and graphic it was an overall great film, with some great twists, that you should absolutely not bring your kids too or anyone else you care about for that matter."
"tmwest","9","2","17","5 January 2016"," Cool, tough and great dialogue!!
","Some films are inspired by real life, others like Tarantino's, by other films. And if Django followed the track of Sergio Leone and the spaghettis here he turns to the tough, violent, budget conscious westerns of the fifties. It reminded me of two John Derek films ""Ambush at Tomahawk Gap"" for its toughness and ""The Last Posse ""besides the toughness, the flashbacks. Why were those films so significant for us, western lovers of the fifties? Because we were inundated with cheesy cowboy films of the Roy Rogers-Gene Autry kind, their cheesiness in a minor or major way present in most westerns of those times those two I mentioned not included, of course. And why this reference to ""The Magnificent Seven""in the title? Because those seven were cool, man, those were cool! And Tarantino took the spirit of these films, he is cool, tough and great dialogue! Congrats Tarantino, you did it again!"

"joelnovac","8","2","17","2 January 2016"," A very calculating Tarantino film that is definitely worth watching
","So I saw The Hateful Eight and it pretty much met my expectations. It was a really great western style movie with great dialogue. While it never really went above and beyond my expectations for a Quentin Tarantino movie, it was still really great. Overall this might be one of the best acted Tarantino movies I've seen. It has really fantastic fleshed, and unique character who all have great chemistry. Even smaller character like James Park and Channing Tatum were unique and solid characters that really added to the movie as whole. Jennifer Jason Leigh is actually really fantastic in this movie and is now part of the ever growing list of great female performances from this year. Another thing that's great about this movie is the score. It adds so much to the movies fantastic tone and is really reminiscent of older westerns. This movie is actually not as over the top as most Tarantino films like Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds were. It does get extremely bloody at some points but it's very calm and calculated which is what made it so great. Not to mention, the stunning visuals and great cinematography. Something else that made this so great, which can be seen in some of his other movies like Reservoir Dogs, but especially in this one, is that this movie felt EXTREMELY like it was written like a play. Especially the way all the characters are visible just hanging out, even though they aren't the focus of the scene. That sad, let me just say, seeing this in 70mm is most definitely a necessity to truly experience this movie. My problem with the movie was in the end I won't say what it was but if you've seen it you might know. Let's just say it has to do with a rope and how the hell they we're able to do that in their given state. Over all this was pretty great and everyone should check it out."
"poisoncupcake74","Null","2","17","31 December 2015"," Quentin Tarantino fans wont be left out in the cold!
","This is a western about a bounty hunter taking a fugitive to the nearby town to be hanged. Along the way, he picks up 2 guys separately who found themselves stuck out in the snow. They arrive at a cabin where there are no signs of the owners, just 4 strangers. Not all of them are who they say they are. I wasn't sure what the hell to think of this movie when it started because the movie was 2 hours and 48 minutes. But I'm so glad I went. I saw it at a roadshow (that was 3 hours and 7 minutes!) in 70mm, very cool and everyone who went received an awesome collector booklet. The movie is dialogue-heavy and action-light for the first hour but exciting, bloody and fun the rest of the time. Great for my bipolar. The whole way through the movie it was humorous, the dialogue, while long winded, is smart- as most Tarantino films are, and this movie flows like a play. Every character is extremely paranoid of everyone else and the N word gets said constantly in case you've never heard it in your life. That said, every actor plays his/her character brilliantly. The first half really sets up the story & the second half is where everything happens. My only criticism is that during the first half, you could get bored since the set up takes so long. Then again, if you are a fan of Tarantino, you will already be expecting this from his movies, and the second half of the film is well worth the wait. My rating: All the Cupcakes you can eat for 2 hours and 48 minutes. ðŸ˜‰"
"hughboyd88","9","2","17","29 December 2015"," Another classic by Tarantino
","The Hateful Eight is a great film. In my opinion, QT has yet to make a bad film. Death Proof is an average film and Jackie Brown is a bit above average, everything else is exceptional.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this is a Tarantino film through and through. It leans heavily on its dialogue and has lots of over-the-top violence with characters who have a propensity for the n-word. Basically, if you don't like Tarantino's style this film isn't for you. I've seen a lot of hate on IMDb for this film, but truthfully I feel as if there is a vocal minority of IMDb users who hate on any popular recent film (the new Star Wars comes to mind), with The Hateful Eight no exception. However, take it from a Tarantino fan that this is a movie worth seeing. At no point was I bored during the film's 3 hour run time, and found it to have every ingredient that makes up a great QT film, with enough violence to satisfy, some moments of hilarity, and lots of great monologues.<br/><br/>Three of the best things about this film are its great cast, excellent score, and beautiful cinematography. Of course, this is to be expected. Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth never disappoint, which is why Tarantino keeps casting them. Jennifer Jason Leigh is probably the standout performance, however, convincingly portraying a truly disgusting human being with ease. Channing Tatum also gives a solid performance, no matter what his haters have to say. Another predictably great part of the film is Ennio Morricone's score. He's probably my favorite film composer, and makes a soundtrack that would please even Sergio Leone. The cinematography also is astounding. While the outdoor scenes are obviously the most dazzling, the interior scenes still do not disappoint in terms of cinematography. I would also recommend that anyone who lives near a theater showing the roadshow to check it out, as the wider screen makes the pictures even greater.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the film to me, however, was the twist reveal near the end. I felt like revealing Demian Bichir's, Michael Madsen's, and Tim Roth's characters to all be working with Daisy to be a bit of overkill. While I see why QT employed the twist of having more than ""one or two"" characters to be allies of Daisy, it seems like he took the least developed characters and lumped them all together. The one I found most disappointing was Michael Madsen's character, as I felt he would have been much stronger if he had his own back story and motivations. I found his fabricated story of visiting his mom to have been a more interesting path his character could have taken.<br/><br/>In the end, Tarantino falls short of a grand slam but still hits a home run with his newest film. I would highly recommend it to anyone who does't hate Tarantino and has a stomach for violence. I left the theater feeling that my ticket price was more than validated."

"mouad33","Null","2","17","25 December 2015"," is it a wsetern ? is it any good ?
","I think that in this movie Tarantino tried to use his passion for the westerns but in his own way.H e wanted it to be different.So we can definitely say that this movie resembles a western only in the fonts used at the beginning and the end and some of the scores of the movie which remind us of old spaghetti westerns but rather than that the movie is different from every other western I've ever seen. In what way is Tarantino's movie different? I'll mention just a few points First every western movie is in the outside, usually the desert or the mountains the vast west from this comes western the old country this is the first movie where events are in the inside.second not once have i seen a western in snow so this is an addition which i personally like nevertheless it's new. third the theme of the westerns rather focus on the relation between the white men and the Indians or Mexicans natives vs settlers whereas Tarantino chooses the white men vs black men and this is valid for both Django and this movie. Is this movie any good ? personally i liked it and not just because it is a Tarantino movie or because it is a ""western"" but because the narrative is good there is something that this brilliant man brought in this movie and because the dialog is very Tarantino like amusing has a lot of hidden meaning has some dark humor and has simply Tarantino in it what i can say bothered me in the movie was the pace which is very slow in the first hour and half but i guess Tarantino used it for a purpose i just don't know what it is"

HATED ""The Martian"". In fact I walked out. (Tooo many idiot millennial kids trying to act like they are rocket scientists? Ugh! Such unbelievability). But to me Hateful was completely believable and the details. No spoiler but just one part when they are stepping off the stage coach and the emphasis on the step off of the coach, it was exact! And the costuming! So pure and beautiful. It was all there for me folks. Right off the bat I was grabbed, by the scenery, the score which by the way is Amazing, the cinematography and the actors! Kurt Russell with the coolest handle bar mustache and Jennifer Jason Leigh. So here they are off on their adventure, meeting up with Sam Jackson. The story line was intriguing. Loved it!!! Really not so violent just cartooning violence which I find different, the Tarantino way. 3 hours but time flew by!!!! I think if you are young and stupid, you will not like this movie. Oh and especially if you are morally a racist. (Or amorally?). It does show North vs South during that time period so I also loved that side of depth. In addition to a woman being part of this gang and how she is able to hold up. Lots of Sam Jackson but he really was so great!!!! Best Movie of the Year so far bar none!!!!

"kenholt57-557-275499","8","2","18","2 January 2016"," The Hateful Eight - Classic Tarantino
","First, let me start off by saying that Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino are my two favorite living directors. While I respect Nolan more as a serious artist, I have to say Tarantino has the knack for producing some of the most entertaining movies in his short career as a major director. While Nolan's Inception, Interstellar and Memento are some of the best thought provoking films I have seen as of late, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was more entertaining than any of them (on a MUCH smaller budget). And therein lies my dilemma: Pulp Fiction is the ""high water mark"" that I tend to compare all of his films to, and so far, he seems to always come closeÂ…but a little short of that marker. That being said, The Hateful Eight is one of his closest.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Quentin's snappy repartee between characters that is often a hallmark of his films (you'd better be) then you are going to love the first hour and a half of this movieÂ…if you aren't, then maybe not so muchÂ…it IS a bit drawn out, yet essential to setting up the back-story of his characters. This is one instance that I wish he had been a little (okay a lot) more concise. He could have easily left 30 to 45 minutes of this back and forth between characters on the editing floor with little harm to the film. An hour into this 3-hour plus movie I was beginning to wonder whether or not I had made a mistake by coming to see it before reading its reviews. I had not. The movie DOES pay off in the end but be warned; many viewers may find it a slow boil. Also be warned that the last hour of this film is extraordinarily graphic, both in violence and sexual content, even for a Tarantino film, so you'd better have the stomach for it. <br/><br/>It's hard to say more about the story without giving away some of the plot twists. It is a western that evolves into a old fashioned dinner table murder mystery, then ultimately a story of ugly retributionÂ… there are no saints here (far from it) but perhaps a little redemption at the very end. It has all of the nihilism, gore and non-linear time line facets common to Tarantino's other movies as well as well cast familiar veterans of his previous films. Additionally, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walter Goggins, Bruce Dern, Kurt Russell and Channing Tatum all give exceptional performances that are all but eclipsed by that of Samuel Jackson who once again demonstrates why he is a Tarantino regular and one of the most prolific and sought after actors in Hollywood today. Jennifer Leigh deserves accolades for convincingly portraying a character bearing no resemblance to anything in her repertoire. She may even get an Oscar nomination for it. She deserves it. Very entertaining: 8 (out of 10) stars."
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","18","2 January 2016"," Not Nearly Tarantino's Best, but Still Entertaining
","While The Hateful Eight is nowhere near Tarantino's best work, it's still a very enjoyable piece of art. I think that's what Tarantino makes, works of art. Art is always up for interpretation and The Hateful Eight is really no different. Saying it's not his best work doesn't mean much considering he has made some of the most significant and influential films of the past 25 years. Even though I would probably rank it 6th among all of his films, there's plenty to love about the film.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the performances are great, in particular Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson. Although I will say, Tim Roth's character had to be written for Christoph Waltz in mind because his character feels a lot like Waltz' character in Django or Inglorious Basterds. Tarantino's script is good but it doesn't leap off the pages like his other films do. I can't really see it having too many lines that are quoted for years to come like Django or Pulp Fiction. The rest of the eight (or really 9 people) that fill the cabin during a massive blizzard have some good moments, but no scene will really blow you away. Tarantino's ultra violent style is present, but the film's structure is much more in the vain of Reservoir Dogs than it is Django or Inglorious Basterds. I really expected this film to be a 3 hour version of the pub scene in Inglorious Basterds, and it wasn't. The tension just wasn't there. As much as I loved Ennio Morricone's score, it didn't really add to the film in the way I hoped.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it was a lack of development in the characters, (because you really only get to know half of them), or maybe it's just that my expectations were so high, but The Hateful Eight turned out to be a good but not great outing at the movies. Tarantino does however do a great job at setting the scene throughout the film in terms of the blizzard and freezing atmosphere the characters are surrounded in. So much so that the man sitting next to me mentioned to his friend that he was feeling cold just by watching the film.<br/><br/>The film presents itself as a mystery in the same vein as Clue or even Murder by Death and it does have some surprises along the way where you find yourself guessing throughout. With that said, I'm not sure the result is worth the 3 hour wait. I'm not totally sure Tarantino needed to make it that long. The Hateful Eight is worth seeing though, but maybe it's a film you see at your house where you can pause it every chapter instead of one long viewing.<br/><br/>+Tarantino setting the scene and scope of the film very well<br/><br/>+Performances, particularly Jackson and Leigh<br/><br/>+Morricone's fantastic score<br/><br/>+Some surprises<br/><br/>-Not as memorable as some of his other films<br/><br/>-Length may not be warranted<br/><br/>7.7/10"

","The brutal depiction of violence in this western will definitely do your appetite no good. The unsightliness of the blood and gore is not for the squeamish . Tarantino leaves little to imagination as minute after minute the various shades of violence come into play . As far as acting is concerned, the cast has done a good job. The conversational sequences are fairly entertaining although not as witty as the ones in Pulfic or Ingbat. Still for the minimalist tone which the movie maintains the dialogue and screenplay is well written and presented. <br/><br/>Walton Goggins (yes I had to check the cast and crew page to know his name) gives a stellar performance . For me , one of the better characters in the Tarantino franchise. <br/><br/>There have been wayward allegations of misogyny against the movie. But in fairness, according to me this is one of the few , if not the first action thriller where women characters are treated on the same plane as men - be it in dialogue, depictions of violence or verbal abuse. The director has done well to erase the line between masculinity and femininity . Sex and gender play a very minor role in the character development in the movie , which is truly groundbreaking. <br/><br/>If at all, I would be critical about the unapologetic exhibition of messy violence -both direct and anticipatory . <br/><br/>I would have loved to rate this flick higher (and I may change the rating next year) but for now I feel it is a solid western thriller and can do with a decent 7 against its name."

","It seems that a lot of the negative reviews here have a theme of people comparing 'Hateful Eight' to other Tarantino flicks. If you do that and expect the same sort of movies he made in his younger years, you will be disappointed. Tarantino is one of those filmmakers whose very name gives a certain level of expectation to the viewer before walking into a theater (same goes for Scorcese, Coppola, etc). If the preconception isn't lived up to, he's crucified out-of-hand for making useless garbage. That's really too bad. If you're truly a Tarantino fan, then you won't mind the lengthy dialog and anything else other reviewers have ranted against. I guess I'd say that if you liked 'Death Proof', you'll like 'Hateful Eight.' I very much enjoyed this film, and would definitely recommend it if you're able to disassociate it from the name and just watch the movie."

"Tokyo55","8","1","6","10 September 2016"," Django Unchained: Volume 2
","No doubt, Django Unchained: Volume 2 is what this film was originally meant to be, but I guess he couldn't get Jamie Foxx, so decided to make it The Hateful Eight, so he could use his favorite actor, Samuel L. Jackson. I'm surprised he didn't get Christoph Waltz to play Oswaldo Mobray, though Tim Roth did manage to ape Waltz's speech pattern & lines quite well. I guess it was purposeful, either by the actors or Tarantino, for Jackson & Roth to use EXACT lines & mannerisms used in Django Unchained, but I found that to be odd, insulting, unprofessional, and unsettling. If I hadn't seen Django Unchained, I'd probably have given The Hateful Eight a 9 instead of a 7. I was protesting Tarantino's, racist, anti cop rhetoric, so wouldn't pay money to see it in the theater, but for $5.99 On Demand, I had no choice, as I've adored several of his films. From the trailer, I was never overly excited to see it, but found it surprisingly good for the most part, despite a molasses slow start and unnecessary filler. I'd like to see his ninth film with 100% actors who have never been in his films before. Seeing the same actors again & again has gotten old, well prior to The Hateful Eight. Surprised that some reviewers found this to be excessively violent, as I found it much more mild than his usual violence, though it did lack his comical excess, that tends to make the violence less disturbing."
"jcooch25","9","1","6","23 July 2016"," A Tarantino Film.... and a lot more.
","The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's eighth film, and again it does not fail to amaze. It's beautiful cinematography, stellar story telling and excellent acting all add to this great cinema experience.<br/><br/>Tarantino has a style unlike any other, and while many reviewers give this movie a 1,2,3,4,5 even 6 star rating, complain about a slow pace and unnecessary violence. First of all, when has Tarantino ever failed to shock with his over the top violence? I could not disagree more about the violence being unnecessary. Without spoiling the plot, Tarantino's movies always have a climactic blood bath scene, which always resolves the film long feeling of tension. Yes, of course other directors can achieve a similar story telling experience with a faster pace and limited gore, but come on.... if you complain about Tarantino presenting too much violence, why do you continue to watch his movies. Did Django's climactic gore scene not bother you but this movie drove you crazy? I'm sorry if I keep discussing people's inability to understand Tarantino directs bloody films, but seriously they need to stop complaining, this movie is great. While I do think at times the pace is slow, that does not mean it is boring. The information is essential to the ending as should every movies material. Even if this review is not enough to persuade you over the countless 1,2 and 3 star reviews, I strongly suggest that you watch it. If your patience is short and you crave action every second of the movie like in Jason Statham movies, you will not enjoy this movie. And even if you do not like it, I can't see why people don't appreciate the cinematography and Tarantino's ability to direct such a complex story. You will not regret watching Hateful Eight."

","I don't want to go into detail, because this movie isn't worth it. The storyline I pull out of my back in a half day, if I want.

First, I thought he does it because of political correctness, but the more I see of his movies I believe he's on a retaliation journey. Maybe he got bullied by whites, or better, he got refused by his beloved Cheerleader in high school? A black hero in Django, running around with guns at these times, now a black Officer from the northern Army, my ass, whats next Quentin, a black Viking running on a rape tour across Europe?"

","First off, i'm not a Tarantino's fan, this is the first of his movies that i watch, so i've not liked this movie just for ""tradition"", let's say. I've only watched the trailer, without reading anything about it, so i haven't any prejudice about it.<br/><br/>I'll start from disagreeing with other reviews. Many says that ""this is not a western/historical movie"", but sincerely, who cares? Movie genres aren't rules. <br/><br/>Also, everyone criticizes the writing, saying it is lame and that many things are unnecessary, but i think that this is exactly the point.<br/><br/>This is a movie has nonsensical plot, uninteresting characters and slow pace. It is made to demonstrate that you don't really need good writing, clever dialogues or mind-blowing twists to make a entertaining movie. It lasts three freaking hours, despite that, it isn't boring. I watched movies that make you wonder ""when this is going to end"" after just an hour, because there are other things that matter too:<br/><br/><ul><li>Scenography: the 70mm format is amazing, you wonder why other director's don't use it. Outdoor scenes are awesome and indoor the larger field of view gives a more immersive experience, you can focus on the main scene while also noticing what happens at the borders.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Acting: the actors are good. Nothing more to say.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Score: it is superb, it gives the movie a thrilling, tense and grotesque feeling.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sounds: everything is so cured, you can hear unnaturally amplified sounds, like the pipe bumping the teeth or someone pouring a liquid on the other side of the room.</li></ul><br/><br/>Honestly, do you really think that a movie like this deserves less than five stars? It is made to show how much you can accomplish with a bad plot, to ridiculise all those boring, unoriginal movies that can't be entertaining despite having a fast paced and thrilling writing.<br/><br/>If a movie with lame plot can be so entertaining, imagine a movie of this caliber (in terms of cinematography) with interesting plot and characters."
"royalewcheese11","9","1","6","18 February 2016"," A great semi-departure for Tarantino.
","The Hateful Eight is a considerable step down from Quentin Tarantino's last two epics, both in scope and overall quality. In fact, it may belong in the bottom tier of the filmmaker's oeuvre. With a couple of jarring directorial touches, some material that treads old ground and a lack of performances or sequences that would join the likes of other memorable stamps in his filmography, the eighth feature film of the mainstream auteur comes short of the masterpiece territory that some of his other works have reached.<br/><br/>But it's still my favorite film of 2015. That is partly due to the weakness of the year, but mainly because, as the hard-core QT fanatic that I am, there is simply too much Tarantino glory to relish in that I cannot do anything but love the film. From his signature deliciously rhythmic dialogue to the legendary Ennio Morricone's score to Robert Richardson's expertly orchestrated shots, there is a heck of a lot to enjoy here despite none of these aspects being at the very top of their game. They still manage to come together to create a cold atmosphere that serves as an ominously claustrophobic backdrop, building tensions between each of the titular characters – who very much live up to that title.<br/><br/>This atmosphere is an unexpected though certainly welcome departure from the spaghetti western tone carried by Tarantino's previous efforts. Instead of the whistles of Alessandro Alessandroni infusing a classically cinematic musical accompaniment unto the proceedings, we are given the whistles of a constant blizzard providing no escape from the uncomfortable cabin setting in which most of the film takes place. And instead of one or two vengeful protagonists for the audience to root for, we are given eight equally vile characters who are armed, dangerous and – you guessed it – hateful towards at least someone here in Minnie's Haberdashery who they are stuck with for as long as this dreadful storm holds out. Racial tensions, suspicious behaviors and potential ulterior motives lead to paranoia and impatience which are sure to explode into a blaze of gunfire. There won't be many coming home.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson's commanding presence and perfected line deliveries often tower over the whole ensemble as his character acts as a sort of detective in the mystery, while Kurt Russell leaves his mark as the meanest persona in the room who may also be the most sensitive. Jennifer Jason Leigh on the other hand is far from soft as an unpredictable prisoner who is both hilarious and haunting. She may be the best in show even though she spends much time in the background, using a wide range of expressions to inspire sympathy, fear and uncertainty as to what is going on in her mind. Walton Goggins is thoroughly enjoyable as a man claiming to be of higher authority, boasting childlike confidence at times while undergoing moral dilemmas and racial perspectives. Demian Bichir shines as perhaps the funniest character in the film, whose unique mannerisms and speech patterns are outrageously amusing, while often unnerving due to the mystery of his true intentions. Tim Roth oozes charisma as a prim and proper Englishman who is irresistibly charming, and those charms ultimately turn to menace in a greatly satisfying development. Even more mysterious is Michael Madsen as the quiet cowboy in the corner, whose mere presence is subtly captivating to watch thanks to his grungy voice and worn-down posture conveying a lifetime of experience. Bruce Dern does the same, and is able to leave a small impact in the short screen time he is given as a racist veteran whose battle has yet to end. Each of the supporting characters are impressive in their own right, namely James Parks and a surprise hateful ninth played by Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>Tarantino gives us a whole lot to chew on as we investigate each of the characters and become increasingly indecisive as to whom we shall root for. Some of them may not be who they say they are. Perhaps none of them are. This setup allows for a more subdued stylistic approach that gives the spotlight to the character conflicts at hand, which could satisfy those wanting more maturity from the director. Amidst the delightfully dialogue-heavy scenes are moments of no words spoken at all – or words sung, in one fantastic instance – which add dimensions to the characters while underlining the looming suspense in the air. The soundtrack utilization is wonderful as per usual, meshing the old and the new effortlessly to evoke whatever emotion necessary. The chaptered structure that does not always stick to chronology is a pleasant returning trademark, acting as an unconventional storytelling device that is just one of the many elements that separates Quentin from the rest. He lets us know that he is the composer controlling the way the story is told, even making a voice appearance as the narrator on two sudden occasions. These choices may feel messy or uneven if made by another filmmaker – and even in this case to some – along with a flashback wherein the real perpetrators are unmasked and revealed to the audience. However, the self-aware quality presented in these inclusions not only adds to the Agatha Christie whodunit narrative but also gives the film a playful quality that is contagious to the viewer. Fred Raskin has done a fine job of editing the piece, although it is admittedly impossible not to wonder how Sally Menke may have handled the material differently.<br/><br/>As The Hateful Eight ends on a stark note calling us back to the long-sustained crucifixion image in the opening credits and perhaps hinting at an underlying message about race in America, we are left without the sense of satisfaction we are used to feeling after a Quentin Tarantino extravaganza. However, we are left with more to ponder. Ultimately, this is another great entry to a list of remarkable contributions the writer/director has made to modern cinema."

","Went to see the 70mm extended cut in Leicester Square and very glad we did. Whilst this was never going to trouble his very finest movies, it is a pretty good piece of cowboy shogun all-in-the-room feature. Samuel L Jackson wears the character like a suit, he's as smooth as. Supporting cast are superb all round and the vista and the tension are equally tickled across the pass.<br/><br/>A gentle first half, that draws you into the makings of a H8T-ful 8 are quite intriguing generally.

","First, I don't get all the drama surrounding this movie, or the boycotts for that matter. It's a movie and found it harmless fun at the most. I didn't see any dark political undertones or narrative that would have people questioning the foundations of society,make police look bad or the use of the ""N"" word too provocative.<br/><br/>Second, this is simply not a great film. Django Unlimitted was a great film, Kill Bill 1 & 2 were great films, Pulp Fiction, etc. this, while beautifully shot was an average film. I felt they could have told the 5 chapters of the story in 1.5 hours. The dialog was not that interesting, the pace too slow to come and the suspense built to not so grand a conclusion. I didn't think the story was all that strong, thought maybe I expected too much and walked away a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Third, go see the film and decide for yourself. For me, it's a dud, and missed opportunity on Tarantino's 8th. You may feel the same or not, but this effort was lost on me."
"olgeorge","7","1","6","26 January 2016"," An incredible two hours of cinema, stretched into a mediocre three
","***Contains minor spoilers only***<br/><br/>As a white man in my twenties, I love Tarantino films. They are cool and stylish, with over the top characters in ridiculous situations used to tell compelling stories. His newest film, The Hateful Eight, was an incredible two hours of cinema, stretched into a mediocre three. All of the typical Tarantino elements were there, but they weren't used in new interesting ways, and the film was trying so hard to be clever that a lot of the time it forgot to entertain.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's 8th film, but only if you use a complex counting system that merges the two Kill Bill films, and ignores or combines various other projects. I'm not convinced that Tarantino can count to eight, seeing as there were nine characters on screen for most of the second act, instead of the eight foul fellows promised. An argument could be made that not everyone in the cohort was cruel, and one of them could have been a softhearted soul, stuck with the malevolent multitude. However you choose to count it, this is definitely not Tarantino's best film, but I can confidently say it's in his top 10. That said, Tarantino's worst film is still better than most.<br/><br/>There were some incredible scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but there were also long stretches that ended up being quite dull (not a word I'd normally associate with Tarantino). The characters were great, the premise was promising, and it was shot with style, but somehow the film still managed to disappoint and I spent the final hour just waiting for it to end. I definitely enjoyed it more than girlfriend though, who had to hide behind her coat during any gore, and towards the end gave up trying to watch completely, literally turning away from the screen.<br/><br/>Avoiding any spoilers, Channing Tatum did not suit his role. I am a fan of Mr. Tatum, but he didn't fit well with the rest of the cast, and his chiseled good looks were very out of place in the gritty Tarantino universe. He did a fine job, but his appearance on screen was rather jarring and took me out of the film. The character was far less developed than the other main cast and instead of being an addition to the film , detracted from the story.<br/><br/>Despite that, the acting was generally terrific with Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh all giving stellar performances. Without those three the film could easily have come across as silly, but instead the tone was appropriately tense at times, whilst also containing light moments in the midst of dark situations, like a fart at a funeral. Tarantino has always been the master of this (finding humour in horror, not funeral flatulence), whether it's a lighthearted shot to the head in Pulp Fiction or inept racists in Django Unchained, and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>My personal favourite character was Oswaldo Mobray, played by Tim Roth. Despite having a name fitting of an Edwardian rapist, Oswaldo was oddly charming. His voice was a caricature of the English accent, in the typical American style of imitation, which was remarkable when you consider that Roth himself is English. The accent was perfect for this eccentric character though, and even managed to tie in with the plot of the film. <br/><br/>Everything considered I give this film 7/10. I couldn't quite bring myself to rate it higher due to it's needless and excessive run time, but the acting and style of the film were definitely deserving of more than 5. Any fan of Tarantino should (and will anyway) watch this film, and it did tick almost all the boxes, just with some plot and pacing issues."
"BeneCumb","8","1","6","26 January 2016"," A rather static ""sitdram"" elevated by strong performances and peculiar solutions
","A new Tarantino's movie is always an event to be waited for or feared by millions, as his approaches, choice of actors and selected topic set a certain example. Many regard Tarantino as a lover of exaggerated violence and rough communication, but it is often forgotten that he can be ""mild"" rather than ""wild"" - in Jackie Brown. <br/><br/>Here, in The Hateful Eight, the volume with shootings or blood is quite limited as well, the main focus is on characters, dialogs and some beautiful winter landscapes - particularly familiar now when there is snow in many countries in the Northern hemisphere... True, the first half or so could have been abridged (as well as the total length) and not all characters are evenly elaborated (Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins spend most time on screen and have more versatile characters to play), but still - the result is distinct, with references to more distant U.S. history and mishmash of time-frame typical to Tarantino.<br/><br/>This movie has definitely its style, although it might attract less audience than many other Tarantino's creations - for Tarantino fans, it is tardy and pensive with dialogs causing no giggling, for non-fans it is too violent and twisted anyway. But SLJ and JJL provide distinctive performances, the latter was nominated for Golden Globe for her role."
"mrblacktip","8","2","19","29 December 2015"," A reinvention of earlier films
","To begin, this film (I saw the Road Show edition) was such a unique film in a general sense I first had trouble finding a rhythm or pacing to it. As it progressed I begin to draw parallels in this film to other Tarantino films, especially Reservoir Dogs. <br/><br/>Going in I was expecting something along the lines of Django again with Tarantino's typical fancy for grandiose fight sequences (post Jackie Brown) which can also be found in Kill Bill sword fighting scenes, Inglorious Basterds' movie theater massacre, and Django's shootout. In a manner of speaking he kind of spoiled us with over the top action balanced with a good plot and impeccable dialogue. This was not the case for Hateful 8 however; a gun isn't even shot until about 1.5 hours in and even then, there is no ""big shootout"" which is a typical trademark of traditional westerns. <br/><br/>This made it difficult for me to watch for a while into it because I couldn't understand the pacing or where it was going-which some may argue is a good thing. The opening act is pretty much only dialogue. It was typical Tarantino banter and wittyness except I found that it seemed more forced than normal and drawn out, even for Tarantino. The dialogue just kept going on and on with extensive relational development between the characters. Once I discovered that I was going to have to sit tight for a while before I could understand the scope of the film I was hooked.<br/><br/>Hateful 8 has a tension build similar to the bar scene from Inglorious Basterds and the entirety of Reservoir Dogs. It is excruciatingly slow and detailed making you hang on the edge of your seat for 20 minutes at a time before anything is resolved. With this in mind, that is how I see it as a reinvention of earlier films: it seems as if he wanted to redo Reservoir Dogs. The majority of the film takes place inside one room and centers around character interaction of finding out who the ""bad guy"" is. In both cases it's Roth. Some of the characters even stay in the same place for long periods of time such as the General in his chair, Daisy on the ground chained to the Hangman's corpse, and the Joe Gaige at the table. I've also read that it is similar to ""The Thing"" which I have not seen yet. <br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Hateful 8 there are notable flaws, in my opinion, of the film. One of the biggest is I feel that Oswaldo and Major Warren (Roth and Jackson respectively) are rehashes of Dr. Schulz (Django) and Jules (Pulp Fiction). Even though the dentist and Oswaldo are played by two different actors with different nationalities, they were so similar in the overall effect they have on the film, mannerisms, and style of humor. <br/><br/>A second is Tarantino's love for over the top gore. The vomiting blood sequence was too much in my opinion. I could have done without that and without watching Tatum's brains get splattered on Leigh. <br/><br/>All in all, I found it a very unique and interesting film definitely worth a watch."
"cubsckc","7","2","19","26 December 2015"," Creative but Limited Plot
","The plot is well outlined if you have seen the trailers for the movie. A blizzard keeps 8 dangerous characters in a cabin together during a Blizzard. All the characters have something in common which is their interest in a prisoner. The way it is filmed was quite remarkable. The scenery along with the props was well shot out.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino really shows his skills at making a story in which every character has a purpose and every cause and effect makes sense. Just watch for the little things in the movie that the camera focuses on. Its one of those movies where every color and shot has a purpose. <br/><br/>I guess the only issue I had with the film was that it was a three hour movie in a cabin with a very limited plot. There's only so many places that the plot could eventually turn. I'm not going to lie, though I had many interesting facial expressions while watching the movie, I was not impressed at the ending. My wife did not like the movie, and she gave me a dirty look every time there was a racial slur or guts getting blown apart everywhere. Though there may have been a lot of it, it didn't deter me from the artistic values of the film. Trust me, there is lot more violence and swearing in this film than any other film he has directed."

The acting throughout is fine as is Tarantino's direction. It's the story that is improbable with a so what, what happens next ending.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight may be the director's longest film, beautifully shot as his homage to westerns, but it isn't one of his best."

"Cocytus","10","2","19","25 December 2015"," A light among the darkness in contemporary film.
","The Hateful Eight: 10/10 That's right, a perfect score. One thing you gotta understand about film now-a-days is that 90% of the movies that come out now are plop, cow dung, worthless except for to entertain children. This film alone bucks that awful trend and stands out as a high-caliber, good ol' fashion, contemporary western movie. Unlike the epic scope of last year's other great western from Tarantino, Django, The Hateful Eight is very much closed-in for a setting, a boarding stop in the middle of a desolate place in Wyoming, 1865 (JUST newly post-civil war). A handful of almost- newly met travelers make their way to a small town. A blizzard is upon them, forcing them to stay in the well-accommodated shelter for pretty much the entire movie. This is always a bold move for a story, a screenplay where there is just one setting. It makes the story, the characters stand out, which is perfect for this film. What's also pleasantly surprising is how the story evolves from a period piece into a fascinating who-done-it type mystery, with a strangers locked-in-place style. Suits this movie perfectly. Every scene, moment, turn, revelation, and ultimately the end result is thoroughly thrilling to watch for the entire movie. And this isn't even really a heavy-thinker movie for the audience either, as a lot of Tarantino films are. Just about everyone of decent age may sit for this movie and never look at the clock. For a film set in such a desperate place, this film is so refreshing and so enjoyable. Go see it."

","This is film set soon after the civil war. It starts a snowy day in Wyoming in a stage coach where John Ruth played by Kurt Russell is taking a woman to hang in Red Rock. They come across a man called Major Marcus Warren played by Samuel L Jackson and bring along the incoming sheriff of Red Rock. Then conversations begin to flow in the stagecoach. This is where Tarantino shines his dialogue is so interesting and fun to listen to. We travel with these characters to Minnie's Habadashary which is a pit stop onto Red Rock. We then meet other characters like Oswaldo Mobray and Joe Gage. What then ensues is what essentially is a play in one room. Someone has spiked the coffee and they try and figure out who it is. There is a lot mystery in this film and great dialogue. The score is fantastic and cinematography is amazing. All the characters have an agenda and none of them have really any redeeming qualities. Tarantino's plays this out for all us to see and I think he has gone back to the great film making of years past that made him famous. Sam Jackson spits out his dialogue like poetry. Its also great to see Tim Roth back in a Tarantino film. As I said there is great suspense and mystery going on this. Amazing witty and fun dialogue to listen to. If your a Tarantino fan you will love this movie. I highly recommend it."
"poe-48833","8","2","20","4 January 2016"," Sam gr8ful to get 8...
","The trailer sold me on this one and I went in expecting exactly what I got, so no complaints on that score (which I've scored an 8, ironically). With THE H8FUL EIGHT, the '70s-centric Tarantino penetrates still deeper into the Man on Man Love that characterized both PULP FICTION and DJANGO UNCHAINED- this time around, Sam Jackson getting his dirty dingus 8 on The Down Low (and appearing most gr8ful, too). The similarities to John Carpenter's version of THE THING, from the stringing of a line to the outdoor outhouse to Morricone's reprisal of the theme therefrom itself, are nice touches (Tarantino once cited Carpenter's classic ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 as his favorite film, and it's nice to see he still pays homage to his heroes). Going in, I expected this one to more closely resemble THE BLACK TAVERN (a Martial Arts Masterpiece from The Golden Age of Martial Arts Movies, the 1970s), which tells the tale of a group of cutthroats who gather at a snow-bound tavern to intercept an official said to be lugging around a fortune in bribes only to discover that THEY are the targets of a young woman (the beautiful Shih Szu), who has spread the misinformation to sucker them all to the tavern where she can kill them. (Another thing that prompts this observation: the scene involving ""fresh stew"" and the disappearance of a number of bodies... In THE BLACK TAVERN, we actually SEE the cook butchering bodies in a back room while preparing meals...) THE H8FUL EIGHT lags a bit (with a running time of nearly 3 hours, it could've been trimmed by at least 60 minutes with none the wiser), but one can attribute that to the built-in ponderousness of the Indie Movement from which Tarantino and Company sprang (they may not have a LOT to say, but they're going to say it at Great Length, regardless), keeping in mind, too, that Tarantino is a product of '70s cinema-going and seems to delight in remaking at greater VOLUME what has gone before.

","Review: The Hateful Eight Film Viewed Date: 12.28.15 Review Date: 12.29.15<br/><br/>Yesterday the family and I traveled 110 miles to the AMC Loews Theater in Boston to see The Hateful Eight in ""glorious 70mm"". To be honest, we all made many a joke over the 70mm reference as none of us really knew what that meant. Standing in line for tickets we met a group of people who traveled an hour and a half from New Hampshire to have the 70mm experience. It's funny, they didn't really know what the 70mm difference was either other than ""it has something to do with aspect ratio"". Be that as it may, there was a giddy, carnival-like atmosphere in the air, and we all knew at a visceral level that we were in for something special on this crisp December morning.<br/><br/>The experience was unique from the get go when we were handed a beautiful glossy program for the movie. Not since Gone with the Wind, have I seen an Overture and an intermission in a movie. Tarantino's nod to the the big movie event days of the past was a welcome departure from the stamped out experience we have when going to the movies these days. A movie should be an event, and folks should be loathe to watch something on On Demand or Netflix as they will have missed the event, the spectacle, and the excitement of seeing it in a theater. This has been an extraordinary December for event based films with both Star Wars and now The Hateful Eight reminding us all that going to the movies is an experience which is far greater than the sum of it's parts.<br/><br/>As for The Hateful Eight, the movie is an instant classic and will sit proudly with Tarantino's other films. The dialog was witty and crisp, the acting superb, and the story was tightly written and compelling. In addition, the cinematography of the blizzard and the snow capped vistas actually made you feel a chill in the air. It's always a treat to see actors and director performing at the height of their powers, and this is what one will witness upon viewing this film. This was experiencing a movie at it's absolute best and I thank Quentin Tarantino for using his celebrity to push the 70mm experience to remind us all what it truly means to go to the movies!"
"emanuelfs4","8","2","20","27 December 2015"," Superb
","It is just impressive how he can manage to make a 3 hours long film in a room without letting it be boring. The film is full of action, mind games, surprise and humour. Based on the title of the film I watched it with much more attention to the dialogs, interaction and actions scenes trying to figure it out everything first, but as said, the film is a surprise itself... I just like how messy(gore) he is, all the blood, brutality, as always are not modest yet, it is quite realistic. it makes it much more funny imo. The snowy environment and the sound of the wind match perfect with the actions<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins are just outstanding in the final moments of the film.<br/><br/>This is superb, however, Pulp Fiction is still his masterpiece and beyond this world."

","Take one Mason jar. Add two bounty hunters, some frozen corpses, a woman on her way to a noose, and two stagecoaches and various passengers. Sprinkle in some suspicious minds, duplicitous characters, time jumping, and don't forget to throw in some racial tension and bigotry. Chill for approximately 24 hours (in a blizzard). Shake vigorously. Throw at nearest wall (I mean really wind up and pitch) and thoroughly enjoy watching the violent explosion of glass shards and gore a la Quentin Tarantino. <br/><br/>This one is everything we've come to know and love from the writer/director. I've never actually read one of his scripts before and loved being able to make connections between his writing style and everything I've seen on screen. The man is funny. I wanted to status update practically the entire script. There were so many choice quotes, most of which were just part of the screenplay and not even spoken by the characters. <br/><br/>This time Tarantino takes us to the post civil war West. If you're familiar with his work, you'll know to expect colorful and period appropriate speak and mannerisms which add depth to the most simplistic of occurrences. It is both brash and nuanced and completely entertaining. This is a leaked version of the script and supposedly changes will be made to the final product. A twofer! I can't wait to see the finished product on screen."
"nashid","9","2","21","5 January 2016"," Again amazing story telling, a must see Tarantino movie.
","The first one hour of the movie is character building and plot developing. Later, one hour and forty seven minutes will blow your mind. I think most of the haters seen first one hour of the movie, but if you want to enjoy a Tarantino movie properly, you must have to finish it up. He is not your conventional story teller.<br/><br/>All movie lovers ignore the haters and go for it please. It is one of the best Tarantino film. To me, the movie is entertainment. It might be an art, but it is that art, which entertains. No one can entertain you, like Tarantino. Nonlinear story telling, colorful character, it has everything that a great Tarantino film can offer to a movie lover."
"sendshaw","5","1","7","3 February 2016"," Underwhelming and not of Taratino's usual quality
","First things first, I am usually a fan of QT.<br/><br/>I would have loved to have said how this was on par with Django Unchained but it falls well short of the mark.<br/><br/>It is at least 40 minutes longer than it needs to be. The padding at the start of the movie is mind numbing in the extreme. You could shed the entire first 25 minutes, miss out another half hour in the middle and you'd still end up in a position where you could watch the last half an hour without wondering what was happening.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh is excellent. Walton Goggins is an actor of remarkable skill given the right role and I think he had that in this film. But that's it.<br/><br/>The endless drivel, the attempts at humour, the predictability of some of the deaths and the oh-so obvious nature in which the film is going to end (think boring, you'll have nailed it) is such a disappointment.<br/><br/>You'll watch a lot worse films in 2015/16. But I don't think there'll be many that you expected more from and left so bereft of any emotion other than ""was that it?"".<br/><br/>As for Kurt Russell, well between The Bone Tomahawk and TH8, I'm beginning to wonder if he is specialising in over-acting characters nowadays. Samuel L. Jackson does his duty admirably, but the character is shallow and lost of any real appeal.<br/><br/>Tatum may as well have not shown up. Madsen is Madsen (I'm not a fan but he acted well).<br/><br/>I need to reserve my biggest criticism for the torrid use of Tim Roth though. How on earth can you script a man so stereotypically and then lose everything that makes him so brilliant, so easily? I won't be the first to say it and I certainly won't be the last, it is indeed The Hateful Waste of Acting.<br/><br/>I've given it a 5 because there are parts that made me laugh and that is no mean feat these days. If it hadn't been for that, I'm not even sure I'd have wasted my energy writing this."
"ingmarbeldman-753-927212","7","1","7","31 January 2016"," Super talent's next hate-struggle.
","Tarantino is for so many reasons an interesting filmmaker. But for me his most appreciated characteristic is his constant struggle with form.<br/><br/>'The 8th' is divided in two, like Death Proof. An unusual choice in storytelling. It works for me in Death Proof. The car chase is so much different then the dialogue sequences before, plus, the set-ups in the first part work up to the pay-off in the second part. In The 8 there are set-ups too and they, for sure are payed off in the second part. But The 8 has more to tell then just revenge. It has a statement to be payed off. And there, Tarantino leaves us empty handed.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is a grim tale. It's the absolute anti-Epic Story. It's not a Schindler's List, with beautiful photography, epic hero's and well-handled photo-shopping. It's not a Coulor Purple, with dramatic despair, revelations, friendships and enemies. Both movies - randomly picked - are strong and ever-lasting in its kind. 'The first half of 'The 8' is epic too but slightly different. In this sinister story we shift from epic movie-stars to Tarantino's 'gang', his actor-friends, whose careers, btw, show more talent for acting then picking the right production, until, of course, they appear in a Tarantino flick again and blossom under his hands. We also shift from captivating, epic music to the uneasy score of Morricone, flirting with the underlying expectations of horror. We shift from great visuals to the harsh and unavoidable reality of Tarantino's characters who talk a lot, but always meaningful, humorous and painful. and we shift from the epic scenery of sunlit plantations in the Color Purple or huge concentration camps in Schindler's List to....nothing more then a small hangout hut in the middle of a snow-storm. In this small, claustrophobic hut, with the snow-storm as a metaphor for inevitability, nevertheless, starts a series of discussions of epic proportions, discussions on the most essential problem America faces these days, the quintesse of Americanism: racial inequality. No terrorists from the middle east, no enemy from Russia or China, no danger from outside. The very danger within, naturally entangled with the American experiment on which this nation was founded; global multi- cultural-ism; the great experiment of the people's of the world becoming one. But..this is Tarantino...No friends here, no moving words of freedom and forgiveness. No escape. Here, in this aggressive, almost sacred cooking pot, a bunch of people have to survive....each other.<br/><br/>Tarantino makes two rather entangled statements. First of all, America's biggest challenge is not outside but inside it's borders. Defining an enemy outside helps defining awareness for togetherness. But that is not enough. That, we see in the hut. And the second statement of course is that America is far from racially equal. A statement that the director not just ventilates artistically but also as a private person in interviews. The conflict in the hut over this issue finds its climax, at the end of part one, in a reversal of the most shameful, ridiculous, cruel-some example of racial dominations. But this time it's not the black man on it's knees but the white man. And the black man opens it's zipper. His gruesome laughter fills the hut....<br/><br/>So, what do you do, as a filmmaker, when you are halfway your movie and you reached this sadistic peak of narrative ? How to continue if your hateful, powerful, cynical statement is made? The best way is to switch gears and go to a completely different set of emotions. Shock your audience with an unexpected revelation that deepens the experience before. The worse, though, is to continue the hate into the realm of unavoidable blood-splashing horror. The worse? Yes, what you constructed as a perfect building, in which form and content complement and strengthen each other will be destroyed by the power of exaggeration. The building pushes open it's doors, the blood streams out and what is left, is an empty building.<br/><br/>The 8 ends sadly as an empty house. <br/><br/>But, then again, i wanna say this. i love Tarantino for his daring approach, never compromising, always searching and struggling. Therefore I prefer this troubled feature over a safe tale dealing with safe issues. <br/><br/>But for next time, mister Trantino.... Why not dare forgiveness?"
"Rickting","6","1","7","30 January 2016"," One of Tarantino's better movies
","I'm not a Quentin Tarantino fan. His movies are self indulgent, appallingly overlong and despite the fact that they're what everyone complains about- style over substance- everyone seems to love them. Reservoir Dogs is a great film, but Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained, while good films in many ways, were bloated, overdone epics of nothingness. The Hateful Eight, which is a stage play style murder mystery set in a cabin in America shortly after the Civil War. 8 unlikable characters, including a bounty hunter and his prisoner, are there and soon things get tense and the blood starts flowing. This seems to be dividing audiences quite a bit. For me, this is actually better than Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. With the amazing 70mm cinematography is amazing, and Tarantino shows he's a very good director as well as a good writer. This is a pretty dark movie, and it has various thought provoking themes which work well. The claustrophobic setting and tense murder mystery narrative make this feel more focused and suspenseful, unlike some of his other films which just rambled on all over the place.<br/><br/>Acting is typically excellent, especially from Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and since this felt thematically deeper and far more tense than some of Tarantino's other films, I enjoyed this more. It was actually about something for once. I was interested in The Hateful Eight since it was mostly in one location and had a budget of $44 million. It looked more like Reservoir Dogs, so I thought I'd get on better with this one. I did, but I also thought Tarantino might restrain himself a bit here. Not so. This movie is nearly 3 hours long and before they get to the cabin, it's pretty desperate. It's as bloated and self indulgent as ever, although it uses its non linear storytelling well. At times ugly and often featuring rambling dialogue sequences which could be done in a few lines but instead go on and on, this struggles to maintain the energy of its best sequences. As for the violence? A bit exhausting and superfluous, but Tarantino knows how to do a shootout. A decent movie; outrageously overlong but it shows Tarantino being more arty and mature as a filmmaker and writer, so it should be relatively satisfying for most.<br/><br/>7/10"
"tvrdjava","7","1","7","26 January 2016"," Tarantino failed
","First, disclaimer. I am a huge Tarantino fan. OK.<br/><br/>What was the point of this movie? Not in a sense what was Tarantino trying to say, but in a sense, really WHAT'S THE POINT! Just pure fun? oh lord was this movie messy.<br/><br/>You have great characters, great cast, and this idea of stage type movie where everything is happening in one room. Tarantino is doing the movie, what could possibly go wrong? Well nothing really went wrong, but it also wasn't right either. <br/><br/>When you are doing a movie that is happening in one room, everything is more ''naked''. Jennifer Jason Leigh should've had more screen time. Kurt also. Samuel was great as always. The idea whodunit also didn't work because we found out way too soon. He didn't play with the story enough, dialogue could have been better.<br/><br/>Now, movie is not bad. I would recommend it. But for Tarantino standards it was messy. It's his fault, he spoiled us."
"nebukanezer","6","1","7","25 January 2016"," Not the same caliber as Django
","Tarantino renewed himself with Django Unchained, which all-in-all was an amazing movie, and all the main protagonists were highly interesting and amusing characters. With The Hateful Eight, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Roth, and Michael Madsen are basically remakes of characters from old Tarantino movies - now with cowboy outfits. If you close your eyes and listen to Jackson you would be inclined to think you were listening to Jules from Pulp Fiction... and Michael Madsen's cowboy is right outta Reservoir Dogs (his raised eyebrows, cool-look, was used up fifteen years ago). For me this pretty much ruined the movie - it seems as if Tarantino is just recycling old characters. Disappointing.<br/><br/>The other main disappointment was the extremely slow progress. Close to three hours, primarily filled with too lengthy dialogue and too many filler shots - with occasional blasts of gore. The story is simply too boring and lacks enough ""story"" to engage for such a long flick.<br/><br/>I get that Tarantino fans are all over this one with currently very generous review scores (probably ecstatic to see Jules again...) - but this one, unfortunately, is significantly weaker than greats such as Pulp Fiction and Django Unchanined. I guess we'll see average score come down to around a 7 in a while as the initial hysteria dies down. For me a 6/10."
"pepe4u22","7","1","7","20 January 2016"," not Tarantino's best but still better than rest
","wish I could give a 6.5 but a seven will do..the dialogue was terrific as per usual in a Tarantino movie and the performance of kurt Russell and jemmifer Jason leigh were the best parts of the movie followed by the performance of Micheal madsen. I also like the way this movie was shot the 70mm format is wonderful and expansive but unlike pulp fiction or djanjo unchained this movie falls short of their excellence and part of that was due to some minor things and one big thing. the one big thing was the phone in performance of Samuel L. Jackson who has been playing his pulp fiction character for way too long for and that costs 2 points automatically for me and it was just too long . the violence was raw and believable and the Agatha Christie twist of a mystery was terrific but this movie is still a quality to watch."
"one9eighty","7","1","7","19 January 2016"," Not the best Western or Tarantino film
","What do you get if you cross a Tarantino script, a western theme, and a cast of top actors? The answer is the hateful eight. I've seen a lot of 1 star reviews and some 10 star reviews but I'm afraid I sit somewhere in the middle. Before delving into my review I'll get a few points across: (1) this is not your typical western film - this is not akin to a Sergio Leone classics you may have seen. Don't expect roving shots of stark but beautiful scenery, don't expect massive gun fights or duels at noon. It's western in style, appearance and story but not much else beyond that, it'd be more likely to be seen as a stage based murder mystery transformed into a film. (2) this is not an action film, there is action but not what you would expect from a western film; in fact you'd have to wait about an hour and half for the first bit of gunfire. (3) the plot isn't complex - you could edit this down to about half an hour and make a good film but instead this film is closer to 3 hours with long drawn out lead ups. Granted the actions within the film are representative of metaphors for the American civil war and it's futility, but unless you are interested in that branch of history they'll be lost and frankly I didn't care and probably missed loads. (4) the script isn't exciting; the characters take an eternity to develop and there isn't really a likable character throughout, in a way all the characters are bad guys - but maybe sympathising with a bad guy is what Tarantino wanted. <br/><br/>This is by no stretch of the imagination the best Western film you will ever see, but it's Tarantino's take on the genre, which will be more suited to modern audiences who like bloodshed and bad language rather than the generation brought up on westerns. There was an element of racism in the film which made me feel slightly uncomfortable. I realise it was intended to be more authentic of the age but how many times can the characters say the N word in a film? Tarantino's previous film Django Unchained seemed to overuse it too but that could be forgiven as the underlying theme of the film dealt with slavery so it didn't feel as offensive, this film on the other hand didn't seem to give a damn and was happy to overuse words to hammer home offence. The pointless interracial homosexual oral rape scene was less offensive than some of the derogatory language used just because it could. <br/><br/>Like other Tarantino films this film is split into chapters - each which help the audience focus on key events which ultimately contribute towards the final climax of the movie. I understand that the chapters help control the narrative drive and timing of the film but it feels a little bit overdone now, how dumb must an audience be if they don't know how to interpret time and causality in the film? <br/><br/>In the film 4 people with different motivation find themselves on a stagecoach heading for Minnie's haberdashery, which is serving as a stop off to escape a blizzard on the way to Red Rock. Waiting for them at the haberdashery are 5 more people all with their own reasons for being there. It's important not to believe anything you don't see or hear yourself, it's more of a murder mystery remember. The real mystery begins the moment the doors are closed, where is Minnie and what connects all 9 strangers?! Yes, there are 9 people so why the title suggests a hateful eight isn't clear until later in the film. <br/><br/>Not fun, not his best film, almost like it was made because it could be made rather than to deliver a message or suspend audiences disbelief. 7 out of 10 stars."
"tiailds","6","1","7","18 January 2016"," In need of a good re-edit
","Reservoir Dogs in the west, and half again as long, which means it's too long.<br/><br/>""Was it entertaining?"" Yeah, but again, long. Easily 40 minutes could be cut from the middle and would not hurt anything. 2 out of 3.<br/><br/>""Was it interesting?"" It tried to be a smart and complex story, but came off as only slightly cleaver, and trying too hard at that. The long, unique, ""Tarantino"" dialogs scattered here and there help some scenes but drag out others. 1.5 out of 3.<br/><br/>""Was it memorable?"" The punches and slaps were believable and visceral; the gun violence and gore was cartoon-like and unnecessary. This is also a movie that while it seems complex while watching, after thinking about it afterward seems to be a adequate story that was display along a convoluted path. Unique storytelling can only improve a script somewhat. 1.5 out of 3.<br/><br/>Starting with 1 (because), 1+2+1.5+1.5=6 A decent re-edit with help this movie, but I still don't expect any miracles. Adequate for a Tarantino movie, but far from his best."
"DoctorJackal","7","1","7","18 January 2016"," It's a Tarantino Western... Hooray!
","I'm a fairly big fan of Tarantino. I think the guy has a real knack for making good movies and writing GREAT scripts. None of his movies really push creative boundaries in plot or execution, but he's a wonderful craftsman who knows how to tell fantastic, often nonlinear stories. I like some of his movies more than others but he's never done anything I didn't enjoy. I'm pleased to say he continues this trend.<br/><br/>This picture is full of smart and engaging dialogue, memorable performances, and interesting characters. There's plenty of room for imagination and it works to keep the audience immersed in the movie. Plus, considering it's three hours long, good writing is vital.<br/><br/>This is likely Tarantino's most ambitious film. It has elements that are similar to his previous work such as Kill Bill or Pulp Fiction, but he takes a risk in having 95% of the movie take place in a single room. That being said, the tedious scenery works perfectly. It adds a feeling of claustrophobia and forces the diversified characters, all acted extremely well, to interact with one another in fascinating ways. There are also moments of touching acceptance and camaraderie between two conflicting parties which adds a nice dash of humanity.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie is how self-indulgent it felt. It was as if the director didn't even have to make a concerted effort to produce a solid film and everything fell into place. This is fine, and frequently less can be more, but I can't help but feel this movie falls into the shadow of Django Unchained. The final act is really macabre and excessive, but it's a fun venture in filmmaking even if it has considerably less substance than any other Tarantino material. The characters are good, as expected, but the plot isn't very strong and the motivations seem relatively weak. Quentin clearly has the ability to make compelling movies with somewhat predictable plot lines, but he didn't quite go as far as he could have with moving things forward or surprising the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, this is Tarantino doing what he loves: making very effective movies. There's a lot of the tension and it never gets boring. Kurt Russell did a great job and I thoroughly enjoyed seeing him on the big screen again. If you enjoy Quentin's work and what he tends to do, then you'll have a real good time with this one! However, for the love of God, keep the younger kids at home. The first act might lead you to believe this movie is far more subdued than it actually is."
"Solnichka","6","1","7","17 January 2016"," Eh ... Tarantino's been much better before this slop
","I didn't care much for Django, and this is another entry in Tarantino's catalogue that will not be in my favorites. First, it's too long; I fell asleep at some point in Chapter Two, I think. A lot of talk, minus the witty banter found in Pulp Fiction and other films by Q. Second, there's little point to the plot in the end, in truth. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I want didactic messaging from Tarantino (like in Kill Bills or Basterds). There's none to be found here. Third, there's little investment in these characters, because generally, they're not charismatic, really. That hurts viewership in a nearly three-hour movie. Audiences want to invest if they're spending that much time. None of this is to say the movie doesn't have its moments, however: It does. But there too few and too far in between the rest of the slop. And what was with the narration? Does Q think we're getting dumber and dumberer? I don't quite want the three hours of my life back, but I almost do."
"cornerstorebitch","6","1","7","15 January 2016"," Exactly What I Was Expecting
","I went into this moving expecting a very average movie and got pretty much exactly that- definitely not Tarantino's best. Like, I am a huge Tarantino fan; I love Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds and the gratuitous violence and the monologues I love it. But this just wasn't that great of a movie.<br/><br/>There were definitely good things about it (I'm about to spoil the sh!t out of some parts so stop reading now if you haven't seen it): The scenes in the snow were visually the high point in the movie and specifically, the part where Samuel L. Jackson is dragging the general's son naked through the snow is really, really cool looking and almost looks like an art house film even.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was extremely enjoyable throughout the movie and always added to the scenes. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a song on guitar that is super cool and adds some much needed suspense to a scene that had been leeched of it due to poor writing and editing choices.<br/><br/>Speaking of Jennifer Jason Leigh, her performance was extremely good as were most of the performances in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson was the only person that felt kind of underwhelming acting-wise. During his big monologue I felt like I was watching a high school student give a monologue for his theater class, honestly.<br/><br/>For every really good thing about this movie, there were some notably bad things though.<br/><br/>The pacing was terrible. Terrible enough to completely take me out of the movie at points in the second act because it was so awkwardly spaced. The beginning was dragged out way longer than it should have, and the second act was shockingly short (the locked room murder mystery lasts a total of 15 minutes, I would guess). By the end of the movie, I had whiplash. And not in a good way.<br/><br/>There were some editing choices that frankly made me cringe. Specifically: the voice over parts, the weird slow motion talking that Samuel L. Jackson does, a couple of weirdly uh, jagged (I guess that's the word) cuts, and one shot that should have been cut way earlier than it was.<br/><br/>I guess ultimately, I was left with the feeling of ""What was the point?"". Also: ""I wish I was watching Django right now."" Not a terrible movie, but definitely not a great one. I expect more of Tarantino."
"scottmontreal","6","1","7","15 January 2016"," Misanthropic, as usual for Tarantino
","Pros: Great cinematography. Taratino is an auteur. Technically, the filming, direction, acting and editing were perfect. <br/><br/>Cons: Ironically, Taratino's politics are reactionary, despite his hip style. <br/><br/>He is a misanthropist. <br/><br/>White writers and directors should not use the ""N"" word liberally, if at all. It is not our place in the racist USA. (I applaud Tarantino for standing up publicly for Black Lives Matter, although Tarantino has no trouble killing his black characters in his films in the most entertaining ways possible).<br/><br/>Murder, cruelty and shooting should not be sexy and entertaining - Tarantino's specialty. We have too much of it in real life as our cynical leaders crash the planet, and we need to stop accepting or even lovin' it. I know, take that out, and American cinema might collapse.<br/><br/>Splatter fest. To those reviewers who want to shame people like me who are upset by the ""blood and guts"", that we should watch Disney!, your analogy is self-serving. (FYI, I am a health care worker in trauma units so I experience a lot of the REAL thing, and it doesn't gross me out at all). What upsets me, is as I wrote above, the high entertainment quotient of the blood & guts and cruelty.<br/><br/>That is why Tarantino is reactionary."

","Dear Quentin Tarantino, I watched a preview pirated rip of The Hateful Eight. Don't worry, I will watch the censored pussy Indian version on January 15th next year. You are the last person I would want to steal from.<br/><br/>I'm not that big a fan of your last four films (including The Hateful Eight). They all had their moments. But they pale in comparison to your first three masterpieces.<br/><br/>I think both The Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight would work brilliantly as novels. Have you thought about novelizing them? I mean, both these films have so many elements that would work perfectly in a novel. Some of the machinations and interactions between the characters would have worked better in a novel. You could have captured the nuances a lot better if you wrote The Hateful Eight in a novel format. Some of the dialogs were very good. But I was thinking all along that I would rather read this stuff than watch it. Maybe it had something to do with the setting. You failed to capture the spirit of that era. Maybe Westerns should not be too talky. And there was absolutely no need for so many characters. It could well have been The Hateful Five or something.<br/><br/>While making Inglorious Basterds you said something about not doing actual war scenes because none of the actors were real men who fought in the war. The same was the case with some of the actors in this film. They did their best. But Kurt Russel's character was a total failure. I found it hard to believe a lot of the other characters. When Travolta was shot dead in Pulp Fiction, you felt for the guy. I felt nothing for Kurt Russel's character when he died in this film. I found it hard to believe a lot of the other characters.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The Hateful Eight was interesting in places. Morricone's score was awesome. But you did not use it to its full effect. The two sad songs were completely out of place. It was not a sad film in any way.<br/><br/>And could you please stop playing the social crusader/commentator? You have absolutely nothing new or interesting to say about race relations in the USA. So all the white people hate the black people. And the black people hate the Mexicans. Nothing new there.<br/><br/>I still respect your balls and your your audacity to make a film like this. And I rated The Hateful Eight an (8/10) and a (10/10) using my two Id's. It really deserves a (6/10).<br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin."

","Quentin Tarantino's latest project is as overdrawn as it is paper thin. Across his eclectic and at times hit or miss career he has stayed consistent with memorable dialogue, except of course for the abysmal Deathproof, yet here it seems aimless, unsure of where it's going and repetitive. How many times can one bare hearing a discussion around bad coffee or a broken door. This is the third installment of Tarantino's pseudo-historical film trilogy, and it hits a new low.<br/><br/>The narrative circulates around a series of misfit, detestable characters all hold up in a cabin during a blizzard. Over the course of their time there we slowly learn more about them and see their distrust for each other grow as the violence escalates. Anyone familiar with Tarantino's work will see the similarity between this and his original film Reservoir Dogs, showing how far he has come on a technical level of filmmaking. Shot in 70mm, this is perhaps his most gorgeous film to date, the sparse landscape shots make use of the 70mm in a way that begs you to see more and escape the three hour confinement of the cabin. One can only hope Tarantino utilises 70mm again before his non-retirement in a narrative that better suits it, with a script that is more worthy of it. <br/><br/>One of the highlights is the original score by Ennio Morricone, taking inspiration from his earlier work on 1982's The Thing (for obvious reasons that don't just include both films featuring Kurt Russell) this is some of his best work in years. Tarantino has often said how he and Morricone have wanted to collaborate; the results elevate the film, amplify the tension and setting to enhance the film as a whole. While it never reaches the highs of what inspired it, this is a score worthy of listening outside of the film itself, and that in many ways is the highest success a film score can achieve. <br/><br/>A main and perhaps the most subjective criticism on the film is just how particularly repulsive the characters of this film are. While it is to be expected considering the amply named title, there is zero relatability because of it. From the very beginning you are hoping these character will just off themselves and be done with it, not just to wrap up the outrageously long runtime, but also for the good of humanity. While Tarantino's characters have never been praised for their good-naturedness, they are often multi-layered enough to engage with and relate too. The characters of Reservoir Dogs are a prime example of how Tarantino can write bad characters while they remain people we can understand. Here however we are left with a cold feeling of neutrality over the fate of these men, while performances are across the board great and committed, they are never likable. Not only are they unmemorable but you'll actively want to forget them.<br/><br/>If Deathproof is Tarantino's worst, then this comes somewhere in the middle of his filmography. This isn't an actively bad film, Deathproof was utterly vacuous and without merit which would make this simply forgettable and derivative of his work. Tarantino is at risk of becoming a parody of himself; prepare to roll your eyes during the opening credits when 'The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino' comes into frame. The level of pretension and self-congratulation there alone is palpable. This isn't even taking into account a quick search through his career will reveal that this is far from an accurate statement. We paid twice for Kill Bill, its two films. <br/><br/>This is disappointing, I wanted so much to enjoy this; I wanted to be able to defend it and say 'hey, it's great, it's like The Thing in Western times', but I can't. As a Quentin Tarantino film this doesn't completely fail, hard-core fans will enjoy this but many will see it as the tedious moral torpor it is. Regardless of how you may view Tarantino and this films questionable race and gender politics, this is a film I won't be returning to anytime soon."

","Okay fellas, just for your Info... I've just been drawn once again to telling the whole world my opinion on an awesome masterpiece of such nature. I wonder if the other ""spoiler"" reviewers seem to have gotten the hang of cinematography. I'm pretty sure whoever reviews such an awesome flick below number 8 further endorses the fact that he/she has a rather curtailing taste for movies. Suspense, thriller and a touch of goriness keeps this movie ahead of time. The best Samuel Jackson movie ever.Take it or leave it! Not forgetting the outstanding performances by Jennifer Jason Leigh,Michael Madsen & Kurt Russell(John Ruth) This indeed is a 2020 movie! How I wish others in the industry could emulate...THIS TRULY IS A MUST SEE!"
"andrievsky","7","1","8","17 January 2016"," It's more like a play.
","The genre of this movie is a mystery/thriller. It reveals itself at the end - like all mysteries and Thrillers tends to do, I suppose :) The ""Quentin Tarantino's dialog"" is definitely there...so,if you don't like it, I give you an advise...Don't go to see it. <br/><br/>What I mean by this is that if you have felt until this day that there is too much dialog in Quentin's movies, oh boy, oh boy, this time ain't going to be a different kind of experience for you, cowboys and girls! On the contrary your going to HEAR a lot of it...but...the movie is a quite action-packed towards the end, because it has build up it's tension like a GOOD WESTERN usually does (e.g. Once Upon a Time in the West, Unforgiven)<br/><br/>..And this movie takes a really long time to build up so you really have to enjoy watching this kind of movies - it isn't your regular average ""give-me-15 minutes-and- then-we-go"" -type of movie. Not a bit. Period. And it's violent. No question about it. And if you don't got the guts for violent, again, don't go to see it. <br/><br/>Myself being a fan of Tarantino, I can easily see that this movie isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. If you compare it to the other movies by Q.T, I think it's the least mainstream movie of all Tarantino's movies until this day. <br/><br/>I personally felt that the movie was good. Not great. I feel that Tarantino has done better movies (e.g. Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, even Django) but is it a bad movie ? No. It's just a little bit different kind of Tarantino movie and a very ambitious one if you think about the usual FORM of a story telling in a movie. It really is more like a play on screen - I personally felt that when judging the movie, I would give it a 3 and a half out of 5 stars, so to speak. The movie has a great feeling and it really does build up it's tension, which I personally loved, but surely, not every average-Joe will. But if you like Quentin's movies, why are you still here? Go see it, Charlie!"
"ralph_2ndedition","5","1","8","17 January 2016"," Tarantino does Hitchcock...
","The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino's 8th film – and no there is no room for argument regarding Kill Bill 1 & 2 counting as one singular film, especially as the words ""The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino"" is seen during the opening credits.<br/><br/>His seven previous films all tries out (or tributes) different genres, he takes a stab at everything from gangster dramas to blaxploitation, via kung fu and western and many other styles, always twisting them to his own quite unique style. The Hateful Eight is no exception. It has a go at Sergio Leones love for long, slow shots, especially during opening scenes – and The Hateful Eight does just that, starts off with an incredibly long shot, going from extreme closeup (Leone again) to a wide landscape shot of a stage coach approaching through the blistering snow. All set to a totally AWESOME ""impending doom""-score by master craftsman Ennio Morricone. That score though, hints at the other genre-of-sorts Tarantino takes a stab at with this movie. The Hitchcockian genre – if that could be called a genre. Because as soon as the stage coach reaches it's goal (a restaurant/bar/thingy in the middle of nowhere called Minny's Haberdashery) it turns into a mystery-thriller, where you are not sure of who is the bad guy and who is the good guy (or if indeed there are any good guys at all).<br/><br/>Set design, lighting and the overall gritty look of the film is stunning. Tarantino is perhaps known as a film maker, but he is in equal amount a stylist. He knows what he wants to see, and makes it so. And that is good, because The Hateful Eight combines the long slow takes of Sergio Leone with an Hitchcockian attention to minute details. It is quite interesting to behold<br/><br/>And therein lies the only real problem I have with this film, that you're not really watching it – you're beholding it. This time around it doesn't feel like Quentin Tarantino made a film for an audience, he just made it for himself. His films are expected to have a few key ingredients; an obscene amount of usage of the ""n-word"", drawn out monologues (preferably spoken by Samuel L Jackson) and violence. Brutal, unflinching, over- the-top violence, including blood and brains splattered everywhere. Everyone is just sitting there kind of waiting for these things to happenand Tarantino just can't help himself. It doesn't matter that the scenes doesn't really require all that blood, or – for that matter – that they are not even improved by it (rather the opposite), he puts it there anyway.<br/><br/>I'm not squeamish in any way, and the violence doesn't make me look away – or even flinch, but I do tend to find it boring if it has no purpose. Same thing with the long, slow – albeit artistically marvelous – shots. If they serve no purpose, they are simply something long and slow and pretty to look at.<br/><br/>In Pulp Fiction there is a long take where Jules (Sam Jackson) and Vinnie (John Travolta) is walking through the corridors of an apartment complex, talking about foot massages and weather or not they mean something more than just the massaging of feet. The shot is long – impressively long – as it follows the two hit men along these corridors. The winding camera and the fact that they are on the move almost the whole shot distracts from the fact that the conversation they are having is mostly pure nonsense. Funny every now and again, perhaps. But ultimately it is just two guys letting their mouths run wild, nonsense. The Hateful Eight has quite a few of these long monologues/dialogues, but it is combined with a long, borderline stationary camera, that does very little to distract you from any eventual pointlessness. It is pretty to look at, though.<br/><br/>In Django Unchained there is this long, drawn out scene of just total mayhem, right after Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz) gets himself killed and Django (Jamie Fox) starts shootingwell, everybody. There's blood EVERYWHERE and people coming in the door getting shot and landing in a big pile on top of each other. One guy not dying from his first shot, or his second, or third or fourth and just continues getting shot – by Django and his own peers alike. There's so much blood the whole room changes colour! But it works, because it has a purpose! The purpose here – as in most Quenting Tarantino movies – is to entertain. There is nothing resembling tension here. Django is the superhero of the movie, and by that time you are no longer fearing for his life. He'll make it, because he's supposed to! The Hateful Eight saves up, building tension, and then lets the violence rip Or rather let the blood flow. In spades! But the vast amount of blood isn't necessary. It doesn't entertain, or to put it another way, if you find it funny and laugh (and I did, at times) it means the tension is gone. Everything built up during the past two hours is now gone, and you are left with a final 45 minutes of pointless violence. You no longer care about the characters, and thus no longer care about the story.<br/><br/>Quenting Tarantino sells movie tickets on his name alone – and that is a HUGE responsibility. Granted, his worst movies are not at all bad, and neither is this one. It is, after all, beautifully shot, it has some really cool dialogue/monologue and a handful of really good actors doing a really good job. It CANNOT be bad! But it certainly doesn't rank anywhere near his best"
"doalvarez2002","7","1","8","16 January 2016"," Perhaps a bit long, but worth watching...
","To my liking the film became hugely enjoyable after the poison scene when Major Marquis Warren smelt a rat casting the partners-in-crime suspicion on the other members of the gang. Up until then some scenes could have been easily dispensed with and perhaps some dialogues shortened as they rather induced to some uninvited drowsiness before I actually submerged into the film. This might as well been applied to some subsequent scenes and the film would probably have gathered a more brisker and livelier pace because the chapter-by-chapter storyline looked seemingly unending. Despite some gratuitously and explicitly violent scenes in the style that Tarantino has got us used to, together with some others sprinkled here and there that exhibit deeply chauvinistic or should I say misogynistic behaviours, the gripping plot nonetheless does its trick keeping you in suspense and with your eyes peeled until the very end."

","This film tells the story of two bounty hunters, a sheriff and a wanted woman who seek refuge from a harsh snowy winter in a haberdashery. They soon find out that their new companions are not to be trusted, and soon violence ensues.<br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" is a mystery set in a Western setting, and has a plot that is complicated but still can be followed. The pace is slow at times, but it helps to deliver the various twists and turns of the plot clearly. I also liked the fact that characters think aloud at times to explain the plot. As usual, the violence and gore is very graphic, to the point that it is over the top funny. Though ""The Hateful Eight"" did not keep me on edge or made me hold my breath, I did not feel that it was three hours long."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","7","1","8","10 January 2016"," Could have been better but overall okay.
","The characters in this film are grand. The setting in the film is grand. The plot in this film is grand. With all the grandness and masterful set pieces to work with, the film suffers from generic dialog and no memorable moments. Some people are in love with this film, and I can understand why; because this is the first time some people are seeing this kind of film. But for movie buffs like myself, we've seen spaghetti westerns before, so the harsh setting and brutal characters are nothing new. The story is well told and the plot is interesting enough but this film is a Tarantino film... so where is the sharp dialog? Where are the memorable and quotable moments? The answer is there are none. And that is why I'm giving this film a seven out of ten. Tarantino just didn't give the film the little extra push needed to make it a memorable Tarantino film. I wonder if the flat dialog had anything to do with the script of the film being leaked early on? Did Tarantino change some of the dialog as a way of making the movie a little different? Who knows, who cares. The film is still enjoyable but it isn't a Tarantino film you will be watching over and over again."
"celkins-42919","6","1","9","18 January 2016"," Agree with OP Review
","I was totally looking forward to this movie - being that it is a Tarantino movie. I was hanging out for it. What a disappointment it was. It was incredibly slow moving and 'it insisted upon itself' in lasting over 3 hours!<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for it to end. It was the biggest disappointment in a long time! Is Tarantino resting on his laurels and thinking that if he just throws in some gratuitous violence and sexual references, that that will be enough to engage fans? It seems the emphasis in this movie was on shock value, rather than content. Though I have always enjoyed Tarantino's 'left of centre' directing style, this movie lacked any authenticity, due to the forced shock factors. I was also claustrophobic being stuck in that cabin for most of the movie."
"dusansinka","6","1","9","18 January 2016"," Rip-Off
","This is just a rip-off of dark comedy movie Točkovi (Wheels) from 1998. In Točkovi group of weird and dangerous individuals trapped in a motel because of a rain storm and everybody end up these in Haberdashery. Look it up if you really want to see what's it about.<br/><br/>Although story line isn't much, acting is excellent and so is the production. And I have to admit everything didn't turned out as I predicted while watching and I like that in a movie. I also liked the after Civil war setting and conversations. I don't mind the racism, after all it's set just after the Civil War. But all the Horse Sh*t!s and God Damn!s are a bit annoying. And in the end I really don't see the necessity of the oral rape scene."
"mgumsley","6","1","9","16 January 2016"," Over long, plodding Tarantino
","Tarantino has been Hollywood's golden boy with the macabre touch for a long time. He is so well trusted that he is able to put out a below par western like this, and attract some of Hollywood's hottest stars, without having to try very hard.<br/><br/>Not that it isn't well acted. It is, particularly by Samuel Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh, but it is dull, preachy and punctuated by Tarantino's predictable violence, cranked up as far as he thinks we can bear it.<br/><br/>The section where Jackson taunts an old Southern civil war general about the death of his son (guess what, it turns out that He, Jackson, was responsible for said death). Well did you ever, there is no accounting what happens in the Wyoming wilderness, so unlikely, so obvious and so boring.<br/><br/>The muted light in the hut only serves to highlight the extreme violence of this highly over rated movie. I know other people have said it, but I agree that this is a rehash of Django Unchained in some ways, although that movie was considerably better.<br/><br/>I think Mr Tarantino can safely assume he has little more to add to the western genre.<br/><br/>Mary Gumsley"
"fission-05823","5","1","9","16 January 2016"," It seemed like two different films to me
","I'm a big Tarantino fan and have more or less enjoyed all of his movies. After seeing the The Hateful 8 in cinema though, I left quite disappointed, angered even. The film runs at almost three hours long, which for me means that it must be really, really good to keep me interested. Then again, this is Tarantino, who I love most for his ability to write strangely funny, unorthodox dialogue, dynamic storyline and utilizes innovative cinematography, so if anyone deserves a fair chance for making movies this long it's him. What I saw were pretty much two films in one.<br/><br/>1. The first half(film) I loved. It had all the elements of a great Western, with wonderful panoramic shots, diverse characters, Tarantino trademark dialogue, the plot complicating and suspense increasing at a rather slow pace, which some may find boring, but which I really enjoyed as I found it to be perfectly suitable with the setting of the film (aren't we all already tired of all the fast-paced senseless ridiculous action movies?). I thought to myself, this is going to be another great one. But there was also the second film.<br/><br/>2. Now I can't go into any details because I wouldn't want to spoil the film and reveal plot details, but it was downhill from here on for me. with Tarantino kicking in with his excessive exaggerated violence, which I found quite pointless, adding nothing to the plot. Now I know it's Tarantino, he likes to use over-the-top violence, but in his other films it was at least somewhat understandable, maybe still exaggerated but within the context of the film. Here I failed to see the purpose of it. It seemed like he just ran out of ideas so he overextended the movie with pointless, gory, disgusting violence, which was completely irrelevant to the previously established setting, and not funny at all. He uses over-the-top violence for comedic effect in other movies, but in my opinion it failed here, if that was his purpose. It was just bad and distasteful.<br/><br/>Yes, maybe his point was to criticize today's American society, obsessed with guns, violence and money. Rightly he does so, but I believe the method he used is all wrong. There was no need for that kind of nonsensical brutality to convey a message in a Western. When people go see a Western they still want to simply enjoy the movie, not watching brutal, absurd massacre, thinking of becoming a vegetarian. This was Tarantino's first movie, where I was actually glad and happy it was over. For me his worst film.<br/><br/>To end on a good note, the cast was very good, I would especially applaud Kurt Russel's performance, probably his finest so far."
"bryanprzy","7","1","9","12 January 2016"," Blood & Snow
","The newest installment in Tarantino's quick-witted and extremely bloody cinematic universe takes place just after the Civil War has ended during an exceptionally deadly blizzard. Bounty hunter 'Hangman' John Ruth (Russell) is transporting the deadly outlaw Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh) to be hanged for her crimes. When the approaching storm forces them to take cover at Minnie's Haberdashery a slew of colorful characters are introduced that may threaten Ruth's mission.<br/><br/>Tarantino is no stranger to outrageous violence and all three hours and seven minutes of The Hateful Eight are full of it. Gun battles, poisonings and a few good old fashion punches to the nose are had by just about every ill-begotten character holed up at Minnie's. Not a single character can escape Tarantino's twisted view on reality, which makes for an extremely entertaining and fast paced three hour film.<br/><br/>The outstanding cast includes Tarantino regulars such as Jackson, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen along with Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir and Oscar nominee Bruce Dern. Even with all this acting firepower on screen at the same time, the standout is Jason Leigh as the insanely sadistic, yet likable Domergue who is the only woman with a major role throughout the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino created added interest in this film by also filming it in 70mm Panavision film stock and releasing two versions to cinemas. The Hateful Eight became the first movie to be fully filmed in Super Panavision 70 since the 1970's and joined a list which includes classics such as Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br/><br/>The violence is outrageous yet stylistic, nothing that viewers have not become accustomed to from a filmmaker that has spilled blood across the silver screen since Reservoir Dogs debuted over twenty years ago. Fans have also become accustomed to the faced-paced, expletive laden dialogue spouted by Tarantino's beloved characters. The Hateful Eight is an entertaining film for anyone who is not bothered by the content, but is even more so for anyone who is a fan of film history as Tarantino himself is."
"miguelramosl","7","1","9","11 January 2016"," Good, but not great
","Acting was great, especially the three main characters Samuel Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins. I do wonder if Goggins is acting or he's like that. This character was very similar to his role in The Shield. The direction was good but often too slow and the movie was waaaay to long. This would have been a better movie if writer and director had not been the same person. That way the director would have been more critical of exceedingly long scenes and takes. Tarantino makes a big deal of the 70mm format. Really? Who cares today about that? How many people watch a movie in a non-digital theater (or a theater at all)? Gore and non-PC language are par and made sense for the type of movie. Nitpick 1: I doubt white people (or anyone) used ""Motherfucker"" when the movie was set. Nitpick 2: Tim Roth's character expounds on the difference between Frontier Justice and the job of the Hangman. Would he have done that?"
"fredrikthor","10","1","9","10 January 2016"," New Western by Tarantino :o
","Yeah, after Tarantinos last movie Django that i liked really good, I've waited for this movie a while now, and i cant say that it disappointed. <br/><br/>After i saw the movie was 2 hours and 47 minutes long i thought that it either was a really long action packed movie, with a lot of blood and kills, or that it was a decent paced movie with good dialog and a lot of action. Instead we got a slow paced movie, with a lot of talking and not really that much action.<br/><br/>This Western, Mystery, Thriller movie is not like other western movies, its a mix between mystery and western, god dammit thats good. I actually came in the theater and didn't knew it was a mystery kind of movie, i only thought it was a regular western/Tarantino kind of movie. It really surprised me how well made it actually is.<br/><br/>From the moment John Ruth came into the ""motel"", that it was something fishy going on there. Later when the movie excavated, the plot became better and better, when i saw somebody added poison to the coffee i became more exited than before, it became one of those thriller mystery movies, where you have to figure out who is the killer, or what is going on.<br/><br/>I kinda liked the ""Chapter one, etc."" in the movie, and the narrator, it was fun but not really necessary, until the 2 last chapters, 4-5 in total. The plot twist was really nice, and was not expected(i thought she got helped by maybe two off the people, i actually thought the Sheriff was going to help her, but when the Major said that Millie didn't like Mexicans at all and it was even a sign that said ""no dogs or Mexicans"", so i figured out he had to killed them, and probably helped Domergue with her escape, then shot went down. everyone started shooting and apparently everone was helping her instead of the Major, Sheriff, John and O.B. i was a bit confused, but a good twist at the end.<br/><br/>The movie was well made, with the cutbacks and everything, nothing really bad with the movie, and the actors did a really good job, not quite sure about Channing Tatum in it, but good enough.<br/><br/>Im sorry for my bad English(not my native language) and i i feel like i rushed everything and it maybe not make any sense(its 5am here now and I'm pretty tired, but i wanted to make a review)<br/><br/>Best movie I've seen in the theaters this year, the first one, but still."
"Taylor_Gillen","7","1","9","10 January 2016"," Good but Not Outstanding
","Right, I understand: a filmmaker cannot be expected to make a masterpiece every time he or she makes another movie. Though some have come close, it's basically impossible. It's unfair to hold those expectations for writers and directors.<br/><br/>However, I can't help but feel that Tarantino has allowed himself to stay close to home. He doesn't roam free, trying new things, attempting a new style or genre. Sure, there is a new set of characters, a new setting, a new plot. But there numerous instances in the film that could be predicted because, well, it's Tarantino's style. He even uses most of the same actors he has used before. That can be fine, but now that this is his 8th film, I wished he deviated more from the style of his other films.<br/><br/>That isn't to say it isn't good. It definitely is good. Many viewers remain interested in the story, and that is impressive considering the three-hour run-time. The acting is great, the cinematography is beautiful, there is suspense and mystery, and there are a lot of laughs. I was actually impressed with the number of laughs I had.<br/><br/>Here's the plot: a bounty hunter is transporting a criminal to a small town. He meets another bounty hunter along the way, along with the sheriff of the town he's traveling to. They get caught in a storm and have to stay at a haberdashery. They planned to make a quick stop, but now they have to wait for the storm to pass. They meet a number of other travelers there, but soon everyone realizes they have a connection with each other. And their interests get in the way of each other's survival.<br/><br/>It's been described as a violent Western version of Clue. I would say that is accurate. There a a bunch of ""a-ha"" moments for the characters, along with long sequences of explanations and discussions. This works sometimes, and other times it drags on.<br/><br/>I read an article that stated Tarantino wants to make a horror film. A real horror film, one that intends to scare you. I would love to see this.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that this film closely parallels the other films that Tarantino has made. If you like that, you'll love this film. If you are looking for something fresh, this won't deliver. I like Tarantino and enjoyed the film, but the issue I mentioned is the reason this movie is 7/10 instead of 10/10."
"jawydan89","9","1","10","13 January 2016"," You can't go wrong with Tarantino
","This is my first review on IMDb, I felt the need to honour this beautiful cinematic experience after reading all the bad reviews.<br/><br/>Tarantino is one of the finest writers of our time and this movie proves this one more time. Each and every character in the movie has so much depth that the audience is glued to the screen to find out more about these unique characters none of which can be viewed as the lead, the villain, the good guy or falls under any other categorisation. I felt so sad when the movie ended as I wanted to watch more of Daisy Domergue, Warren, The Hangman and all the others. It felt like each of them jumped out from a Western movie of themselves and were trapped together in this movie.<br/><br/>The dialogue is crafted so masterfully that information is revealed just at the right pace to keep you on edge even though you are watching the characters trapped indoors doing nothing but conversing for almost 2 hours. <br/><br/>It also needs to be mentioned that the cinematographic quality was second to none. The amount of detail every scene contained was just amazing and I cannot understand people complaining about Tarantino wasting his 70mm shooting indoors. <br/><br/>And of course, there were the usual Tarantino signatures: the twisty climax and lots of blood. Thank you Tarantino for showing us once more that creativity is what makes cinema an art and for sticking to your own style (not being bothered with stupid product placements, shallow humour and the like for the sake of pleasing teenagers)- please keep on making movies!"

","After viewing the trailers, hearing about the 70MM format, the roadshow version, the overture, the police boycott, and whatever other irritating marketing gimmicks were thrown around for the last few months, I finally was able to sit down with my coke and popcorn to watch THE HATEFUL EIGHT . . . and boy oh boy, what a disappointment it was. Nothing spectacular, but not nearly as terrible as QT's worst outing to date, DEATH PROOF, a film that I found to be borderline unwatchable, to say the least. However, I did enjoy this movie a bit more than I did DJANGO UNCHAINED, another QT flick that I think to be vastly overrated and self indulgent, so I guess that's not much of a compliment really. Oh well.<br/><br/>Now to sum up its plot (or lack thereof), THE HATEFUL EIGHT is about a group of strangers who get stuck in a cabin in the middle of nowhere during a ferocious blizzard. The tension (or lack thereof) builds up before a brutal showdown (or lack thereof) takes place.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know, sounds a lot like Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>What makes this film uninspired, in my opinion, is the fact that it's really just a regurgitation of everything QT has done in the past, except here it's not nearly as fun or exciting. He's been recycling the same themes, plot points, smartass characters, exaggerated dialogue, OTT gore, and basic story premises for the last fifteen years now. Note to Tarantino: please come up with something new. You have enough money to take the next few years off so you can just sit back and think of something fresh and riveting to offer us the next time around. I highly recommend you do just that.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I'll now proceed with the pros and cons of THE HATEFUL EIGHT.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD. READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION.<br/><br/>First, the pros . . . Ennio Morricone's score is quite possibly the best thing about this movie. The cinematography is also well done (for the record, this film being shot on 70MM was pointless and added nothing to the movie). The opening sequence sets the mood quite well, what with the dark, ominous music assisting a pull-back shot of Jesus Christ up on a Cross in the middle of the vast Wyoming wilderness. The acting is pretty good overall, although there was some obvious overacting from Kurt Russell and Tim Roth, in particular.<br/><br/>. . . . and that's it for the pros.<br/><br/>Now for the cons . . . the film is too long. Waaaay toooo looooong. Like other reviewers have already said, the story presented here could've been told better and more effectively in under two hours. Instead, Tarantino treats us to nearly an hour and a half of useless dialog before we even get to the damn cabin, that while is supposed to build the characters and create tension, really just drags and has no purpose whatsoever. Moreover, much of the dialog repeated itself far too often. For instance, whenever ANYONE mentions ""the Lincoln letter"". We get it, a black guy has a letter from Abraham Lincoln. Can we move on now? This also applies to some of the actions that take place. We get treated to about five different scenes of characters opening and closing a door, nailing one piece of wood into the door, no, two pieces of wood into the door . . . you get the point.<br/><br/>In addition to its unnecessarily long running time and annoying dialog, we get a storyline and group of characters that are too basic and underdeveloped to even care about. We never really learn much about ANY OF THEM, other than they fought for either the North or the South. Samuel L. Jackson has a monologue about raping and killing the Confederate General's son that is both tasteless and boring (and rather contrived as it comes out of NOWHERE), the astronomical levels of gore in the final act was predictable and amateurish, and in the end, NOTHING was resolved. But then again, not much really happened to begin with. Oh, and the political ""subtext"" in this movie was just downright insulting. PLEASE stay out of politics, Tarantino.<br/><br/>I give this movie five stars for the score, cinematography, and the acting. The script and direction leaves much to be desired. Please get a grip, QT. Before it's too late."
"svorva","7","1","10","6 January 2016"," Frustrating, but Still Excellent
","Quentin Tarantino occupies a hollowed position in the current film world. The most obvious embodiment of auteur theory, his style is apparent to all and he is a conversation starter for cinephiles and pedestrians alike. Thus I think it fair that Tarantino is subjected to elevated standards. A three hour western-mystery with an intermission and defiling tastes might normally score points for audaciousness. But for the master, these are old tricks, and anything less would be simply disappointing. The Hateful 8 is a standard Tarantino affair, with insufficient execution in the face of overwhelming ambition. Calling a film ""well made"" is an overly broad catchall, but The Hateful 8 is well made. The snow and wind is simply beautiful to behold. Faces are iconic when framed against this backdrop. Virtually every player is a recognizable actor bringing a dash of familiarity to these characters. Their dialogue is not just snappy, but engaging and personality forming. All the pieces are there. Weakness begin emerging when everything comes together.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. A stagecoach carrying a criminal and three other passengers are snowbound at a rest stop. There are already a few tenants and suspicious circumstances. Figure it out. At least that's what Tarantino wants us to do. I would argue this task is impossible, ergo I was extremely frustrated. Maybe others were more astute than I. This aggravation is multiplied by the extremely slow pacing. My plot summary was obviously vague, but its lack of detail notes that no new characters or locations are introduced after act uno. So get comfortable, because you're stuck. This is a deliberate decision. Slow pacing could provide time to build suspense and enjoy characters. Not here unfortunately. Suspense requires information and Hateful is obstinately refuses to provide any. The roles might be well acted, but are also lacking compared to past Tarantino films. Bob the Mexican is not making anyone's list of favorite supporting characters. Instead, the burden of carrying this film primarily falls on Samuel L. Jackson. Some might find this a plus. This is Jackson's largest role in recent history. It is not the type of performance the Oscars like to reward, but it is certainly deserved. I laud his individual effort, but this type of plot cannot be carried by a lone champion no matter how strong. Additionally, the film sabotages his efforts when, 90 minutes in, Jackson provides much needed energy with a fearsome (and funny) soliloquy that is immediately dispersed with an intermission. Tarantino thought he created a piece of punctuation to conclude a long crescendo. I thought the doctor abandoned the patient after getting one good pulse.<br/><br/>For the three of you who got this far, you might be questioning how the rating matches the review. The truth is despite my frustrations I greatly enjoyed The Hateful 8. Honestly, I doubt this one film is going to change any opinion of the director for anyone. There will be walkouts for those offended by gore or naughty words. There will be those who cannot stop laughing as a women is mercilessly beaten. Love or hate, Tarantino elicits reaction. The Hateful 8 is no different, but does not reach the high bar set by its predecessors."
"LloydBayer","9","1","11","12 January 2016"," Hateful Eight is Tarantino going back to his roots – Verbose, violent, and thoroughly unpredictable.
","Molasses is a word used more than once in The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino's cleverly titled eighth film. When you first hear the word spoken you don't think much of it. It's when you hear it again that you start to draw on its literal and figurative meaning. Chronologically, this is his ninth film (Tarantino considers Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 as one film) but the one common aspect in all his films is the known fact that as the writer and director, Tarantino is in no rush to tell his story. Just as viscid as molasses is the narrative, but also as concentrated, making this one of his most verbose, bloody and thoroughly unpredictable films. And binding everything together is an even more concentrated dose of tongue-in-cheek humour that is an absolute treat for every Tarantino fan. <br/><br/>It takes ""patience"" to get there though, another word used overtly to tell the audience that the wait is worth the reward. Told as a post- Civil War era western in whiteout Wyoming, The Hateful Eight is essentially a tightly wound potboiler seamlessly knitted into a whodunit murder mystery. And although the story seems like a Tarantino original, the plot summary appears to have germinated from the same nucleus that made And Then There Were None Agatha Christie's magnum opus. The similarities are there, yet somehow Tarantino's masterstrokes feel intimately traditional, like a nuanced director returning to his roots. <br/><br/>That tradition is felt almost entirely through the film, beginning with his signature approach to compartmentalising the narrative into chapters. Crossing over one-third the length of the film, Chapters one, two and three serve as the introduction to eight characters so eclectic that the film could have also been titled 'The Fateful Eight'. Leading the pack are bounty hunters Major Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Union army soldier, and John Ruth (Kurt Russell) on the way to the town of Red Rock to hang his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) for a bounty of $10,000. After picking up a fourth passenger, Red Rock's newly appointed Sheriff Mannix (Walton Goggins), their stagecoach stops for the night at a desolate cabin called Minnie's Haberdashery. Here's where they (and we) meet the remaining four – Red Rock's Hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), retired Confederate army General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a cowboy working on his autobiography, and Bob the Mexican, the cabin's caretaker. Trapped by a terrible blizzard on the outside and confined to suspicious strangers on the inside, tensions rise when most are not who they claim to be. Thus begins Chapters four, five and six, and traditionally where Tarantino lets the proverbial 'shit hit the fan'.<br/><br/>Before that happens, suspense driven buildup takes precedence by way of character driven performances and spitfire dialogue from everyone including whimsy cameo appearances. With Jackson in the lead and at his profane best, the remaining ensemble offer concrete support, each equipped with electrifying delivery and nestled surprises. But none more than the film's most concealed character - with a constant smirk on her face, Leigh's Daisy is perhaps Tarantino's biggest Easter egg with an unpredictable outcome. Equally delectable is the heavy dosage of dark humour, both witty and outrageous, and at an all-time high for a Tarantino film. So is the racial slur, which peaks in the form of an epic sex gag between Warren and the N-bombing Smithers. <br/><br/>While Django Unchained proved to be homage to the 60s era of Sergio Leone westerns, The Hateful Eight feels more like Tarantino's first real thriller. Shot in 70mm Panavision with the legendary Ennio Morricone (who invented the Spaghetti Western genre with Leone) providing a tense and menacing soundtrack, this could not only prove to revive the western but also Tarantino outdoing his own brand of wickedly entertaining audacity. And lauded more for his screen writing than his diabolical exploitation, this is probably his fastest film to get through even though it's over three hours long with a plot that thickens with each passing minute. Perhaps even thicker than molasses."

","The funny thing about QT's second back-to-back western is that I've been avoiding it because A: I'm not a western fan and B: I really wanted Quentin to go back to his roots in modern day. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight might as well be a reshoot of his first big breakthrough: Reservoir Dogs, albeit with a new/old setting. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the Dogs movie initially – I wrote a scathing 1/5 star review for my college newspaper back in 1992 about it, and then changed my mind years later after getting accustomed to Quentin's style. It still wasn't my favorite and nowhere near the top, but I really appreciated it more with my second viewing. This, my friends, takes that concept and improves upon ittremendously. Even with it being a western.<br/><br/>Adding to what I said above about my hesitation of yet another QT western, I wasn't looking forward to the three hour time frame, either. Nevertheless, I went to go see it and liked it up front. The dialogue was very good as were the characters I found intriguing. Still, I was wondering how much they could stretch out for 180 minutes or so. Luckily, this story, the twists and unfolding scenes kept me glued and it only continuously got better.<br/><br/>On a side note: as much as I liked it as it progressed, I kept saying to myself ""Eh, it's good, but I never wanna see it again."" I really need to stop talking to myself, because with less than an hour to the finish line, I made it my mission to see it again. And maybe, again. I really loved it that much once it concluded.<br/><br/>I digress. The movie begins with a post-Civil War Boba Fett picking up two hitchhikers and landing at a little rest-stop bar/sanctuary where they meet more of the title characters to wait out the concurrent blizzard. Who's who, what do they want and how they all relate to each other commands our attention for the next 2½ hours. <br/><br/>I really dumbed down the entire synopsis there, and believe me: you'd want me to be as vague as possible when it comes to what you're in store to explore and learn on your own. Despite 80% of the movie taking place in one room (SEE: the Reservoir Dogs reference,) it's just so damn interesting to hear everyone's story, words, backgrounds and motives. Well done, Quentin. You really nailed this out of the park and gave us your best since Kill Bill Vol. 2. <br/><br/>I wish I had seen this before posting my top 10 of the year. Granted it wouldn't be number 1or #2but it would've made a solid third place finish for the best of 2015. That's not to downplay this FANTASTIC film – I just happened to see two better. And despite that, you NEED TO SEE: The Hateful Eight. Right now. Drop everything and see it."
"erica-bick","6","1","11","9 January 2016"," Good film ruined by poor writing
","This film has all the makings of an Oscar winning picture and would be brilliant if it weren't for the terrible script. The acting is of a very high caliber and Samuel L Jackson is brilliant, as per usual. The cinematography is breathtaking, as is the set and costume design. Furthermore, it is accompanied by a beautiful score. However, the script is a huge let down. In true Tarantino fashion, the script is very odd and over the top. The viewer is never sure whether the mood is intended to be serious or laughable. Most of the film is boring aside for a few highly graphic scenes. Much like Django Unchained, the film presents a deep and weighty subject matter illustrated through a lot of violence but is dealt with in a very laissez-faire attitude from the director. There are very few plot twists and most of them are pretty predictable. If it wasn't for everything that was right with this film, the writing and directing would have landed it a solid 1 or 2 rating from me. If you can appreciate films from an artistic perspective, this may be worth a watch, otherwise you'll be wasting your time."
"xristospas1995","7","1","11","8 January 2016"," good if you can wait
","First thing first, the cast is excellent, And I know that a lot of people will think that Channing Tattum has no place there but I did not recall him as bad and he has a too small role to make any difference in the movie. Now when it comes to Tarantino I think that the fact that he manages to shoot the majority of the film in a single room, without making you feel cramped, is quite exceptional and I love the way our characters presented the script. This acting makes you a lot of times to think you are watching a theater play. But after you admire these you start to see the big problem of the movie. The first three chapters are just boring. We spend our time watch them do nothing with only one good dialog, that makes our actors build their character, in each chapter. So in conclusion if you do not mind wait, or you even like this unique technique of slowly build the intense of the film then is great. I am not that patient and i find it too much."
"gargamel-8","6","1","11","8 January 2016"," Decent but ultimately disappointing movie
","The movie starts out great with the classic Sergio Leone opening shot and the music from Ennio Morricone. Unfortunately the rest of the movie doesn't live up to the first 5 minutes, particularly not from the point where the movie takes place inside a haberdashery. The story feels like a mix of Reservoir dogs and a classic Sergio Leone western, but i'd rather watch Reservoir dogs or a Sergio Leone movie for the 20'th time than see this movie again.<br/><br/>Most of the characters feel unnecessary and the normally good actors are given very little to work with. The most interesting characters are played by Kurt Russel and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Both give good performances but its not enough to carry the movie. Samuel Jackson plays the same character he always plays, and while he does a good job with it, i'm kinda tired of that character. The other supporting actors are given very little to work with and give mediocre performances for normally great actors. Tim Roth in particular overplays his character and you get the feeling the character was written for Christoph Waltz. <br/><br/>Tarantino is known for his unique use of dialogue. However in this movie the dialogue is nothing special, and consists mostly of repeating the n-word until you get tired of listening to it.<br/><br/>The story is OK, but offers no surprises.<br/><br/>All in all its a decent movie, but quickly forgotten."
"paulmcuomo","7","1","11","8 January 2016"," Not the best Tarantino, but certainly good Tarantino
","Having literally seen this movie today, and to come out only an hour ago, I have the great chance to write a review with fresh thoughts on the movie. Given all the background info on this movie regarding the leaked script, QT's reluctance to actually make the movie after said leak, the format on which the movie would be shown - 70mm - I do have a lot of things to talk about a film by a filmmaker as individual and unique as Mr Tarantino himself.<br/><br/>When you talk about ANY Tarantino movie, there are always three things to discuss; the script, the music and the actors. The script in this film features all the Tarantino hallmarks, namely his ability to give all of the characters cool lines and individual traits to make them easily identifiable, and that's no difference here. There's a non-linear narrative that was cool, and got to use Channing Tatum's short but important role in the film as the leader of Daisy's gang, and in which his performance is strong. There's also a lot of violence that does serve a purpose but does feel slightly unsatisfactory due to the fact that all of the characters are hateful people, and there isn't a Django shooting Billy Crash in the nuts type set-up - there is a nut shooting scene, but its played out more for laughs than actually something more important. One thing that does hold the movie back, however, is that the story doesn't have the dynamic range that Django Unchained, Pulp Fiction or the Tarantino penned True Romance; in a way, he was ambitious to attempt a film as limited in scope and location and make it work like a play, but it doesn't work quite as well as he thought it would - just my opinion there, but it is still as good as anything he's previously written.<br/><br/>The actors are standout, and given the lack of overly big names outside of Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell and Channing Tatum, it is very good to say that this movie works amazingly well as an ensemble. Main standouts of the film are Jackson, Tatum, Russell, Damien Bichir as Bob the Mexican who was unexpectedly funny and a nice bit of casting, Walton Goggins who is - really - the only character with a story arc revolving his racist views completely by the end. Jennifer Jason Leigh, as the only woman on the main bill, is astonishingly good. Daisy Domergue is a feral, vicious, violent woman who despite going through injury after injury keeps on that path in a way that is spine-chillingly scary, but Leigh gives her moments of pity (not sympathy - NEVER sympathy) and humour, as well as cunning. Sadly though, due to the reasons regarding violence I previously discussed, her death felt very empty, kind of like Hans Landa's punishment, which was a disappointing way to end the movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, I need to close off by praising the soundtrack and the cinematography in buckets of it; the score of the movie is hauntingly good and perfectly captures the Western influences of the movie, as well as the claustrophobic sense of paranoia and distrust going on in the subtext of the story. The 70mm thing is wonderful too - how the camera just disappears into right into the thing in the foreground and perfectly captures the scope of the environment; this gives it not just a sense of epic design to it, but also makes it feel like a movie from the Ben-Hur period.<br/><br/>A couple of criticisms; the violence (which is to be expected) just felt hollow, but NOT unnecessary - one instance is particularly important - the story doesn't feel dynamic enough to make it truly great, but the big one is how dated this feels. And I know it's the intention ala Death Proof, where a movie is made in a certain fashion as homage to another tradition, but it was obscenely overdone. It just kept holding the movie back for me, but it didn't make me regret seeing it, as there were so many good points that it really made me glad I saw it."
"scottmcgrathpimp","8","1","11","8 January 2016"," Fun, violent, and different ... albeit a little long
","It makes me happy to see Tarantino is growing and exploring as a filmmaker. I can't think of many other filmmakers who could have raised the money to shoot a film like this -- so, I commend Tarantino on that front. He's still taking chances and creating interesting and entertaining material. <br/><br/>The Hateful 8 feels more like an adapted stage play than a feature film -- and this isn't a knock -- it's just that there's only 2 real locations and it's completely dialogue driven. But, it's Tarantino, so don't be expecting 12 Angry Men here. There's blood and shock and ""sex"" (kind of). There are twists and turns and lots of unexpected moments -- so the less you know going into the film, the better.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Lee's performance is disturbing -- especially in the final act. She commits 100% and what she does in this film is pretty amazing. <br/><br/>Overall, a solid outing by Tarantino. The story felt a little long for my taste -- especially Chapter 2. Any movie pushing 3 hours better be EPIC ... and while The Hateful 8 is good and fun, it isn't epic, and would have benefited if it had been a few minutes shorter."
"diomavro","8","1","11","7 January 2016"," The alternative reservoir dogs!
","This movie feels quite similar to reservoir dogs but is just different enough not to feel like recycled material. While the focus of Reservoir dogs was more character centered, the hateful 8 is more culturally focused. The characters are a product of their time instead of just simply badasses and the plot seems to have literary value. <br/><br/>edit: some clarification why it is like reservoir dogs. It is a finite set of characters locked in a setting with some of them trying to kill others. In reservoir dogs the cop was the prisoner and the snitch was trying to save him. In the hateful 8 the woman is the prisoner and the gang was undercover to save her. Difference is that in reservoir dogs the picking of the snitch was done by gut instinct and character while here it was done by induction(which is less interesting).<br/><br/>If there's nothing reminiscent about a southerner and a northerner uniting up against foreigners, a fake farmer and some rednecks then somebody hasn't brushed up on their American history. I especially liked the fake Abe Lincoln letter, something Samuel's character, Marquis claims he needs to get respect, and at the end, the southerner crumples it as a symbol that Marquis doesn't need it anymore. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie with solid camera work, a fun script, and doesn't hold back on gore so I highly recommend it. This is probably the best movie Tarantino has released since Kill Bill. I don't quite love it as much as reservoir dogs but it comes down to personal taste."
"benisof","6","1","12","8 January 2016"," Carefully made but slow and pointless
","The movie is well and carefully made. It's the script and the story that bothers me. It is all crafted so that they could kill each other in the end.<br/><br/>The idea is that a bounty hunter takes one precious prisoner to get his reward. In the blizzard he is forced to stop at an inn in the middle of nowhere. Having 10000 dollars to cash on the prisoner he is too careless and behaves just like having a gun in his hand the whole time can save him from every trouble. He drinks coffee without worry, he stops for a few days in the middle of nowhere in an unknown house, whose owner is nowhere to be seen, he brags with his prisoner, etc. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the black major smells that something is off, but does not do anything, and starts by killing the only harmless man in the plot... <br/><br/>The story could have ended in the moment the bounty hunter and the female prisoner entered the caban: shoot him on the spot and leave the others outside in the cold... That's what feels off, the fact that the story is told so that it lasts longer. <br/><br/>As for the whole minutes spent showing scenery, or the two men planting poles to reach the toilet, it's just a waste of time.<br/><br/>Conclusion: overly violent movie (predictable), with questionable plot, lengthened just for the sake of telling a longer story."

The script is well-written, the film is well-directed, and while it is certainly not is weakest effort, it is also far from Tarantino's best. He is a master of these kinds of bloody scenes and if you are not a fan of his films, then probably you gonna hate and this one. The first half is nearly perfect, and the second half gets a little repetitive, but still far from being boring.

If you think you are watching a fairy tail or happy movie this is not it! this is for me what more movies should look like!

There isn't as much blood nor is there a who did it but more of a what might Bret be planning; regardless, I believe you will find the older story more entertaining. You still get killings and a psychotic killer played by none other the Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes before his fame on 77 Sunset Strip; but you don't get Kurt Russel and that fabulous mustache.

"mortensn","8","1","13","7 January 2016"," Intelligent but a bit too long
","The Hateful Eight is a good movie but probably a love-it-or-hate-it kind of deal. Personally I liked it a lot, but my better half found it awful and had to endure. Below is a brief summary of three main strengths and weaknesses without any plot spoilers.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Intricate dialogues throughout. Tarantino doesn't disappoint here and fans will appreciate the mix of intelligence, humour and provocative themes that are constantly present in the interaction between characters.<br/><br/>Tons of throwbacks. Tarantino pays homage to old westerns, and each character is almost a stereotype from different types of westerns. You have references to spaghetti westerns, wild west westerns, colonial westerns, etc. His inner movie geek is on display in full force.<br/><br/>Intimate atmosphere. 95% of the movie takes place at a single location. Many classic movies have done so with great success: 12 Angry Men, Rearview Mirror and Cube just to name a few. It is a very powerful setting if done right, and the raw quality of the acting makes sure it is done right here.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Its too long. This is my biggest complaint by far. Quality acting, great directing and intricate dialogues can only keep you captured that long, and at almost 3 hours it pushes the limit. For me it went over by about half an hour.<br/><br/>The plot isn't spectacular. To avoid spoilers I won't provide any details, but lets just say its not the complexity of the plot that drives this movie home. The plot is sufficient to justify the setting, the dialogues and the character development... but nothing more. Don't come into this expecting a western version of Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>The references to contemporary issues are a complete miss. I feel Tarantino tries to force a connection to modern day racial and gender issues in his own quirky way. There's nothing wrong with the attempt I guess, but it doesn't work at all for me. Like most of the things that are wrong with The Hateful Eight it seems to stem from a need to stuff 3 hours in a single setting with enough filler content. Neither the filler content or the length of the movie is justified by this and both end up becoming annoying. Luckily it doesn't detract much from the overall qualities of the movie.<br/><br/>If like me you value the intimacy of Tarantino's previous movies you will likely also appreciate them here and look beyond the flaws."
"drummerguy-02424","5","1","14","2 January 2016"," Exhaustingly, depressively rage-inducing.
","This is unlike any movie that Tarantino has done before. It does have hints of the style expressed in Django, and it of course still stays true to his very unique touch. But the difference here is that none of his characters in the Hateful 8 are interesting, in the traditional sense of the word. They don't develop constructive bonds. Every single lead character in this movie is despicable, and it is hard to take a look at their souls, which in a positive movie would have been welcomed and uplifting.<br/><br/>Imagine the single person you hate most, the embodiment of your Achilles' Heel of your faith in humanity, multiply that amount of despisal – of hate – by 8, and let them all mingle with each other. Also allow them all to have a common goal – money. Now imagine they are all in each others' way.<br/><br/>That is exactly what this movie is. That rage you feel when you clench your fist is how you will feel about each character. There are no words for just how low these people will make you feel, how mad you will be at their very existence. It was the most stressful movie I have ever sat through.<br/><br/>My emotions are very mixed. On one hand, I may not ever see this movie again, due solely to how angry it made me feel. On the other hand... that is exactly the goal of this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is incredible. You forget that you are looking at huge stars who have stayed at the top of Hollywood for most of their careers. These are completely different people. The setting probably helped with that; the tiny merchandise store in the middle of nowhere is a strong crucible for these characters to portray themselves and to mold the scene. However this isolation may have been a little too effective, for there were no outside resources with which we could take a brief step back from this oddly mesmerizing theatrical performance.<br/><br/>Originally, you come to understand that these men – and this woman – are probably not all that bad, and that their misdeeds and morale are simply irritable. Oh, how wrong you will be. The story which unfolds from Warren's (Jackson) mouth regarding the death of a significant son... this is probably the real turning point here. From there there is projected onto you some of the foulest events that you will ever witness in a single sitting. Though the gore was actually quite mild for Tarantino, its impact was fourfold in this movie, due to its restraint and also to the caustic atmosphere present throughout.<br/><br/>It is difficult to allow joyous bonds between characters to flourish in cinema, but with hateful characters, the train could easily spiral out of control, and I feel that this movie did just that. I'm not sure if over-the-top anguish was Tarantino's goal, but that is what he achieved. Bravo. I have never felt more upset at a movie than I did this one, not for some strange moral standard that I expect in any given movie, but just because that is how the characters made me feel. Tarantino's directing and writing expressed the same abysmal, cold-hearted morale as his lead stars. There is some subtle hint at modern societal tension at play here, but honestly you will not care. You will be too preoccupied with the abhorrence unfolding before your eyes.<br/><br/>There are two definite points that stood out to me which took away from the experience. First was the dead giveaway of a certain conspiracy which would have added to the mystery if it had been concealed, and second was a flashback that was unavoidable but did shake the flow of the movie up. Besides this I see little that could have gone wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is an anti-movie. There are no bonds between these men save psychopathy. You feel no remorse for any of these characters as they are offed one by one, and you will probably feel relieved after the movie is over.<br/><br/>I do think it should be experienced though, just for the pure cinematic experience of its glory. I think in time I will come to love it. For now, though, I need to lie down."
"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","15","4 January 2016"," Violence with a Point
","Much more of cinema has been formed and informed through the context of war than we would like to admit. Especially in American cinema, many of our uniformly appreciated classics are bookmarked by events such as WWII (Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List), Vietnam (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Taxi Driver) and even the Civil War (The General, Gone with the Wind, Birth of a Nation). We as the audience (and creators) often brush over these events, excusing them as background and fodder. And why not? There's built-in conflict, villains, maybe even a battle or two; it all leads to high octane excitement sure to inspire so long as you don't think about it for too long. Quentin Tarantino however does not want his audience to ignore context to fit his narrative. He wants it upfront; in your face and made personal.<br/><br/>Marquis Warren (Jackson) definitely takes it personally when he's confronted by demons from his past; namely General Sandy Smithers (Dern) and Chris Mannix (Goggins) both of whom served the Confederacy with pride. Warren makes his living as a bounty hunter along with John ""Hangman"" Ruth (Russell) who just so happens to stop his stagecoach and pick the stranded compatriot up. Meanwhile Ruth is carrying Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh), a villain on the way to the hangman's noose until a blizzard holds up everyone at Minnie's Haberdashery.<br/><br/>Despite what the title suggests there are originally nine indwellers at the stagecoach depot, most of whom are not telling the whole truth about themselves and what brought them there. Despite this, the Civil War hangs over the single roomed hobble like the chilly air of a deadly winter tempest. Those who participated find themselves at odds right quick and antagonize each other to the point of eruption. In the middle of it all is the devious Daisy who squeals with glee after every confrontation. As the story progresses and alliances are made and broken in Lord of the Flies-like procession, what's made clear is there were good and bad people fighting on both sides of the Mason-Dixie divide.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has gotten a lot more political with age and maturity. While always fond of controversy, and speaking with a unique cinematic voice, those not inducted into the cult of Tarantino have dismissed him as kitsch. He has always been more concerned with film as a form than how that form can be utilized. Yet with Django Unchained (2012) and to a lesser extent Inglourious Basterds (2009), that kitschy, idiosyncratic voice suddenly had a little more to say than wax poetically about the cinematic art.<br/><br/>Though Hateful Eight isn't without it's Tarantino-esque excesses, not the least of which is his film 65mm to 70mm Ultra-Panavision transfer, his roadshow and his 3+ hour screen time (including an overture and an intermission). His fetish for a bygone cinematic era he himself never lived through, would carry more weight if he knew how to utilize such throwback technology. It is said he came up with the idea to shoot with the Panavision 65mm Hand-held and Studio cameras after watching Ben-Hur (1959) a movie that spanned decades, filmed on multiple sets and captured a world of color and magic not seen on the big screen until Lawrence of Arabia (1962). Hateful Eight features the haberdashery, the stagecoach and a few wintry landscape shots of Telluride and surrounding area. The results are serviceable but nowhere near the grandeur of Doctor Zhivago (1965) as was Tarantino's intention. That said those who appreciate his style yet have no idea where it comes from may be blown away while I just found it adequate.<br/><br/>The political issues brought up in Hateful Eight are surprisingly contemporary given the fact that all characters talk about the Civil War as if it just happened. This was done on purpose by the filmmakers and Tarantino himself who has been under fire for speaking out against police brutality. Before Tarantino was using his style for style's sake, now he's using it as a weapon. A weapon that demands we wake up to the forming fault-lines of our own society before we make the same mistakes as our forefathers. A weapon that implores us to take notice to war within the context of the story on full display. A weapon that tells onlookers to focus on the war within ourselves or else."
"retroandrew","8","1","15","5 January 2016"," Solid film through and through
","In all honesty, I wasn't expecting too much from this new Tarantino film. I was kind of expecting a sort of continuation in the same style and flavors that the film Django Unchained had offered. With Tarantino, I like to be surprised in the direction and tones he brings to each and every one of his films, so I thought that this one I might not be different or unique enough to stand with the rest of his films. Needless to say, I was very wrong. The Hateful Eight is one of the gruesome and most screwed up films Tarantino has made to date. The violence is over the top and, like Django, doesn't hold back. But like other Tarantino films, the violence is still warranted and needed for the core of the plot. It's never really thrown in there for effect. The performances were fantastic. Everyone did a really great job at portraying their character. The only gripe I have is that some of the characters felt more like caricatures and less like realistic characters. However, that's just me being overly critical. Another criticism I have for the film is that it's strangely similar to Tarantino's first film, Reservoir Dogs. I won't go into that detail, but both the plot and setting for Hateful Eight seems to borrow heavily from that film. Music was also fantastic. It seems Tarantino decided to break away from original songs and decided to have a score be created for the film itself, which went over really well. Tarantino once again did it. He once again created a film that's ultra violent, funny, well-casted, and meticulously directed. It's a film that I truly cannot wait to see again."
"braindy5","9","1","16","5 January 2016"," Excellent movie that is well worth your time
","I saw the 70mm Roadshow in Irvine. All in all it was a fantastic experience. The movie was excellent and the 3 hours playtime went by without us feeling bored once.<br/><br/>The cinematography is really impressive. To the point that the images, soundtrack and noise make you shiver in cold with the protagonists. The story is intensive, brutal at times but always captivating. Some scenes are very slow, but they work nonetheless flawlessly in the very tense atmosphere that this movie creates.<br/><br/>This movie deviates in several ways from the ""typical"" Tarantino movie. It has an excellent soundtrack, but it is mostly instrumental and does not have catchy tunes. The sound rather intimidates the audience and adds exquisitely to the dark atmosphere of the whole movie.<br/><br/>But the most important difference to previous movies is, that this movie is not funny. It is a hard, brutal and very intense thriller, that excels at exactly being this. The few funny scenes or dialogs (and to a certain extent even and oddly enough some very violent scenes by releasing some tension) make this tour de force thriller more enjoyable, but they are definitely not the main hook driving the movie.<br/><br/>And I assume this is also the problem with many bad reviews this movie has gotten. If you expect a witty, funny and sometimes over-the-top violent spectacle (like e.g. Django) this movie is definitely going to disappoint you. If you are prepared for a hard, brutal, and very dense thriller, this is the movie for you. And boy, does it deliver! Go see it in a movie theater. The fantastic cinematography and soundtrack will work best only on a big screen. We enjoyed it tremendously!"
"lajos-szel","9","1","16","5 January 2016"," Forget Tarantino and watch it again. Then raise your hats.
","I do fear that due to my limited English skills my words will not come through. Anyway, I think this movie is brilliant. Many of us, fans of Tarantino, might fall into the trap of waiting for the ""Tarantino moment"" - on a certain level so did I but like many other important things in life (e.g. a spicy sausage) it takes a while to realize the true effects on us. In my opinion Tarantino took a step further by making this film. No it's not completely different, we get his ""brand"", classic pieces of his trademark, however we might feel a bit empty - but it's only due to our limitations. This movie not only a masterpiece in terms of cinematography, acting, etc but makes us really think about what we are. And this is not even new when it comes to a Tarantino movie but this one just nailed it. The only reason for 9 is that I cannot yet figured out why they wanted to make me feel like Roth was mimicking Waltz. He is way better than that."
"e_z_e-47370","6","1","16","5 January 2016"," Not ""Hate""ful 8, more like ""OK""ful 8
","While this isn't a terrible movie, it is honestly the first time I've walked out of a Quentin Tarantino movie saying ""......eh"". After Django, you can't blame Quentin for wanting another western (I believe he's been wanting to make this movie for years now), but because of the new elements and success Django brought, Hateful 8 feels like it's too little too late. Again, this isn't a bad outcome. It's just not what you'd expect from Tarantino. I'll start with the good. The one thing all of Quentin's movies is dead on with is the dialogue. This script is awesome. The fact that you can put few actors in one or two settings and have them go back and forth for 2 ½ hours takes amounts of talent that people underestimate these days. That being said, that can't be the only aspect of your movie. The casting choice is questionable. The thing that made Django so great was that you were seeing great actors who had never had roles anything close to the ones in Django. In Hateful 8, you have a lot of the Tarantino alumni. None of these actors are awful in their role, but with as much dialogue as this movie has, you can't help but wonder who else could have been cast and really given the movie a new identity. Apart from Jenifer Jason Leigh (who is well deserving of her Golden Globe nomination) there's really no stand out characters. Now as I said before, the script is fantastic. However, dialogue can't be the only focus of a movie, especially these days. One thing Tarantino has molded himself into is directing violent and bloody action. We only receive a small taste of that in Hateful 8. Throughout the movie, you find yourself waiting for that sequence where all hell breaks loose, but it never comes. A one-time view of this movie is great. The humor is there. There's a few ""what the f***"" scenes that are very entertaining. The score sets the perfect tone (also very deserving of its nomination). But I have a hard time believing this will be a movie that I will ever take the time to watch again."
"Muffinator80","8","1","16","3 January 2016"," Classic Western Feel, with Tarantino's signature
","The hateful eight does not have the same type of broad market appeal as many other Tarantino films. The film has a distinct minimalist feel (indicative of Reservoir Dogs). For those who go into the film expecting a quick paced movie, with blazing guns, action, and a complex contrived plot will more than likely walk away disappointed. The movie is almost 3 hours long and is quite dialogue heavy, which at times can drag on, but for the most part keeps moving. The pacing of the movie makes it feel like an older film (such as classic John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns). <br/><br/>This movie is definitely has Quentin Tarantino's style to it, but as modern audiences are used to quick paced films that take you on a ride, a quite ride through the country will often be over looked. For those fans of classic westerns and hardcore Tarantino fans, it's a must see. For those who prefer modern action films, you'd probably want to steer clear."
"Matt-144-792009","7","1","16","3 January 2016"," A Stick of Dynamite with a long fuse.
","The Hateful Eight stars a brilliantly selected cast of character directed by the incomparable Quentin Tarantino. Kurt Russell plays John Ruth, a bounty hunter transporting Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to hang, traveling via stagecoach thru the frozen tundra of frontier Wyoming. Along the way he encounters Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) another bounty hunter and Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). With a blizzard looming the stagecoach full holds up at a little country store with four other nefarious characters played by Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir. As the storm rages outside the remote cabin, inside we learn that everyone is not exactly who they claim to be as a last man standing show down plays out.<br/><br/>There are very few directors these days whose new work excites as much as Quentin Tarantino. Since I first rented Pulp Fiction (1994), I have rushed out to see every new creative project. Produced, written by, directed by, I am strongly devoted to all things under the Tarantino Hollywood brand. So adjust your expectations of this review given the biased of the writer. All that being said, this film is very different than his last two films, Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012). Those films are similar in that they creatively play with history in period pieces using the violent art form that is Tarantino's style. Hateful 8, is more of a slow burn. The violence is still there, there are some gun shot wounds in this film that makes the violence in Pulp Fiction look like a paper cuts. But more time is taken, almost more than necessary to develop the characters. And at 3 hours and 7 minutes, I'm sure there is even more character exposition that landed on the cutting room floor to keep the film under 4 hours. There is a major sub plot that didn't settle well with me personally. In where the demise of a character's son is explained. And given the white dominated cast, the rampant use of the ""N word"" felt overused for shock value, more so than it did in all of Django.<br/><br/>In a recent interview on the Howard Stern Show, Tarantino revealed the inspiration behind the Hateful Eight. Growing up he enjoyed most the western television shows and movies where a stranger comes into town. Little is know of the character but the plot unfolds as more is uncovered about the past of the outsider. His vision is, what if you had a movie made up of entirely of those types of characters. What I think he needed, all be it not necessarily his style, is to turn this into an HBO mini series. That would have given him time to fully stretch the legs of his creation. Instead we are left with a film that drags in places and rushes in others, requiring heavy-handed narration by Tarantino himself. Imagine if Vince Gilligan had tried to imagine Breaking Bad as a 3-hour film as apposed to a 62 episode series. As a die-hard fan I will say this film ranks slightly above Kill Bill 2 and Death Proof in the Tarantino catalogue. Not in the same league as Pulp Fiction, yet not his worst effort. Great effort was made to shoot the film in Panavision 70 Processing, creating beautiful epically framed shots. I appreciate his passion for the look of film over digital, but for what really? The shots early on of the stagecoach navigating the snowy terrain in the establishing shots look amazing. But most of the action of Hateful 8 feels like it could be adapted from a stage play. The cabin and the outside blizzard are brilliantly composed; you really feel the bone chilling cold winter. There is a deliberate mood and tone created here that few can create like Tarantino. Little is spared in attention to detail of the set design. Tarantino has just the right amount of fan boy friendly hidden treasures along the way. I will not spoil, but I look forward to re-watch the movie to catch them all. Tarantino has mentioned in interviews that he plans on taking his final directing curtain call before his audience demands for it. 10 films are all he currently plans on making. By his math, Hateful is appropriately the 8th. I assume he does not count directing collaborations like Four Rooms (1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996) and the Grindhouse (2007) double feature. I can go so far as to highly recommend Hateful 8 to devoted fans of Tarantino, but why preach to the choir. If you're a fan you've already laid speed tracks to the nearest theater to see it. For those not drinking the blood red Tarantino punch this film may not be for you. The pacing, language and violence may lose most mainstream audiences. So as much as Tarantino fought Disney for burying his film release under thousands more Star Wars showings. Star Wars will ultimately remain the more enjoyable film for most this holiday season."

But then, you will be expecting a little of speaking followed by action, but don't think that this will happen soon, it will be almost two hours of speaking and little details that will be shown later. Don't mind the monotony of the chapter that they speak about stories lived by they and little intrigues, it will look like Tarantino failed the movie (except for the nice costumes and perfect ambiance) but then the plot starts making sense and the acting of all characters get even intenser.

DON'T expect a ton of action though as if this is kill Bill or Django, but go into the theater expecting a gritty realistic cinematic experience that at times reminds you of Pulp Ficton, Reservoir Dogs, and Inglorious Basterds.<br/><br/>Back when I saw the first trailer for this I was thinking the Hateful Eight was going to be a lot like Django, but during the entire 3 hours I was in the theater I never once thought of it, but some lines from Jackson immediately made me remember Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>I will admit it took me probably an hour to start really enjoying this movie, which is usually the case for me when I first watch a Tarantino film, but when I did start to enjoy it, I never looked back and highly enjoyed the feeling of the isolation and the cold and hard winter the characters had to endure, with an extreme amount of suspense with ONE of the BEST soundtracks Tarantino has ever placed into one of his movies.<br/><br/>I can't wait to watch this again in theaters, and I understand if a casual movie goer doesn't enjoy it, but that's why star wars exists just for you guys.

I mean it is a story about betrayal and deception just like Reseevoir dogs.( only reason why I have this marked as a spoiler is to mention that).

"mike3386","8","1","16","2 January 2016"," Murder on the Stagecoach Line
","For a die hard Western devotee it is difficult to find fault with any movie keeping the genre alive, if even on the periphery . . . and this movie is unusual, Tarantino virtually guarantees an off-center approach, not bad per se for a Western, but certainly different. In some ways this presentation had the feel of ""Murder on the Orient Express"", ""Stagecoach"", and a (frigid) ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".<br/><br/>If you like lengthy dialogue, this movie will thrill you, e.g., it exceeds 3 hours, with 95% of it set in a one-room stagecoach layover. I haven't heard so many BS stories since high school pool hall trips in the 1960s. There are glimpses of the beautiful Colorado-meant-to-be-Wyoming snow-covered mountains, but only to ensure that the viewer knows the location is completely isolated. Albeit worse than ruggedly nasty, the warm interior with glowing fireplace and meandering conversations made me sleepy, and I literally dozed off for who knows how long . . . embarrassing for a movie fan to even admit.<br/><br/>So? What's wrong with this Western touting some comedy with its gore? It is virtually impossible for the viewer to transport himself/herself into the movie, something Westerns have always been able to do. Whether as the hero, villain, or innocent subject, Westerns tug at us, beckon us. Not this time. With the possible exception of wanting to wear Samuel L. Jackson's hat, the characters are repulsive, even the handsome Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>So? After all the talking, and the posturing, and the mystery, was it worth the wait? Not really, a pure Tarantino finish. So just enjoy the ""ride"" . . . uh, saunter, and wait for the remastered version of Roy Orbison's beautiful 1967 song, ""There Won't Be Many Coming Home"" to play as the closing credits roll."

","I'm a HUGE fan of Tarantino, from Reservoir Dogs to Pulp Fiction, to even his newer stuff like Inglorious Basterds & Django: Unchained. After Django, for obvious reasons I was excited for this as it was hyped as a 'Western' styled movie much like Django and it was kept under wraps for quite a while. The Big names are a plenty, however even all the star power can't save this flick from how hard it is to follow. I found that it took way too long for anything exciting to happen. The character development was not as strong as some of his earlier films so for that reason, you really didn't feel like you cared all that much when they started killing off characters. I felt it took way too long to get to the point which ultimately left you wondering 'is this it'? Obviously there is a climax and action in the movie, but because it took so long to get us there as viewers, much of the anticipation was gone by the time the fun started. If you can handle sitting through an hour and a half of 'slow burn' before anything that resembles real action takes place, then by all means check it out. I give it 7/10 stars, it is definitely not his best work."

","Loved the movie! It offers many of traditional Hollywood Western movies' best attributes, together with gritty realism and a great ""who done it"" plot! <br/><br/>One historical quibble: reference is made to a Confederate Civil War POW camp in West Virginia. WV became a state separate from Virginia in 1863, at the height of the Civil War, precisely because western Virginians largely disagreed with secession and war. WV residents generally were quite poor, and owned few slaves, so they largely sided with the Union and, throughout the war, the state was a bastion of Lincoln's Armies, and, as such, never hosted a rebel-run POW camp.<br/><br/>Otherwise, though, ""The Hateful Eight"" is a clever, thrilling and surprising ride. The characters, scenery and costumes are impressively accurate and surely conjure up a genuine ""Wild West"" feel. Led by Kurt Russell's toughest-of-the-tough bounty hunting gunslinger role, the cast is strong, convincing and entertaining.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot is excellent, as it constantly shifts to new nuances, moving toward a wholly unknowable conclusion, with lots of great twists, turns and surprises along the way!"

Though the mendacious and ruinously harmful GONE WITH THE WIND (inspirer of countless Real Life lynchings in the decades following its release) hosed THE WIZARD OF OZ for the Best Picture Oscar in the Year of Hitler ('39), Mr. Tarantino also goes a long way toward avenging American cinema for the racist travesty GWTW was with one of the longest passages of reverse racism ever to play on the screens of U.S. Multiplexes. John Wayne movies always promoted violence by reducing death-by-gunfire to a spot of ketchup on a victim's shirt.

He allows society to be completely desensitized by his love of gore and fervent violence because he is able to have his comedic dialogue overshadow this. <br/><br/>I loved that he originally had written this as a play because once it was brought to the screen, it added that theatrical element that Tarantino knows so well.

He has written a six chapter, three hour dialogue driven film which never once falters. <br/><br/>The first thing one will be drawn to when watching this movie for the first time is the fantastic score by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography by Robert Richardson. Both of these aspects translate amazingly into setting the over all tone of this ""Clue-like"" story. Using claustrophobic camera angles (only helped by the touted 70mm film) and the wonderfully implemented score puts the viewer right into setting with wonderful immersion.<br/><br/>The acting in this picture is exactly to be expected based on the names on the poster, Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell and Tim Roth, among several others, encapsulate their characters roles and give everyone of the main cast a distinct and necessary piece to the story. Channing Tatum's role in the film is a crucial piece of the plot, and despite my initial reservations I eventually grew to enjoy his character and I agree that he was the right choice for that role.<br/><br/>The six chapter plot and intermission helps with the integration of the movie. My only issue with the movie comes in its run time. If the exposition delivered in the first three chapters could have been done 20 minutes faster then I believe that would have been for the better good. That being said, however, the dialogue driven exposition is always captivating and never uninteresting, just a little long winded at times.<br/><br/>In the end Tarantino has once again made a fantastic film and proved the merits of captivating dialogue.

","'THE HATEFUL EIGHT': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Writer/director Quentin Tarantino's gruesome western epic; about nine vile strangers, that hold up together in a stagecoach stopover, during a deadly blizzard (in Wyoming), sometime after the American Civil War. The movie stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demian Bichir, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, James Parks and Channing Tatum. The film was released in two versions; a standard 167 minute theatrical cut, and a special 70mm Roadshow version (that's 20 minutes longer). I saw the Roadshow presentation, and it was well worth it. The film is a classic; Tarantino at his best!<br/><br/>The story takes place in the Wyoming winter, sometime after the Civil War. It revolves around a bounty hunter, named John Ruth (Russell), and his prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Leigh). They're headed to the town of Red Rock; where Daisy will hang, for her notorious crimes. Along the way they meet up with another bounty hunter, named Major Marquis Warren (Jackson), and a man who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock, named Chris Mannix (Goggins). When the group becomes stuck, in the middle of a horrendous blizzard, they head to a well known haberdashery; to wait it out in. Once there, they meet four more strangers; and none of them appears to be very trustworthy. <br/><br/>The film is classic Tarantino; if you like his stuff, you should love it. It's filled with grotesque violence, foul language and disgusting debauchery; but it's also a fascinating character study, with a strong message about race relations. The movie plays out in two distinct acts; the first being filled with lots of character development, excessive dialogue, and plot buildup. The second act is almost all violent, bloody, payoff (it's like two different movies almost). I love the way it was structured, and I was intrigued by nearly all of the film's despicable characters. I also really enjoyed seeing the movie in it's glorious 70mm presentation (it's well worth the extra ticket price, in my opinion). The pacing, in the first act, will test some viewer's patience (as all Tarantino films do); and so will the violence, and offensive imagery. I think it's all worth it, in my opinion, though. The film is a masterpiece; and seeing the Roadshow presentation of it, was one of the greatest filmgoing experiences I've ever had!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM"
"fustbariclation","7","1","18","21 December 2015"," There won't be many coming home...
","Naming a film, 'The Hateful Eight', in order to remind anybody watching that this is your eight film, isn't the act of a modest man, but, if anybody were concerned that Mr Tarantino had been replaced by a doppelganger, this, along with the extreme, and, somewhat, gratuitous violence in the film, ought to put his mind at rest.<br/><br/>Though Mr Tarantino doesn't credit Laurence Sterne for the smashing of the fourth wall as an art form, he does do it as well as Mr Sterne does in 'Tristam Shandy'. I think he'd call it 'post modern', as, too, no doubt, he'd also label the other devices found in 'Tristam Shandy', like telling the story in a peculiar order, and adding lots of clever self-reference. Odd, really, that such, albeit unconscious, homage should be given to a book published in 1759, by a chap so keen to be hip and 21st Century as Mr. Tarantino, but there it is.<br/><br/>It is a sound point that the animosities of wars, particularly of civil wars, continue for a considerable time after the mass killing has been stopped. He might be right, but I'm not sure if the possible implication this film intends is really accurate. Do so many current American problems really have their Ã¦tiology in the Civil War? He certainly does make a good stab, if you excuse the term in this context, at making that point.<br/><br/>The ghastly characters in the film are nicely drawn, and the dialogue between them is often funny. Their perspectives are sharply drawn, and it's interesting to see what things they appear to hold in common. As far as I can see they hold these views in common:<br/><br/><ul><li>Guns are a really good thing - The Civil War was a really bad thing, but certainly the other side's fault - Lying is a bad thing, particularly when practiced by somebody else - Lying is, however, not only inevitable, but ubiquitous, so only actions can be believed - The pecking order is: White male -&gt; White female -&gt; Black Male -&gt; Black Female -&gt; dog -&gt; Mexican - Capital punishment, in particular, public execution by hanging, is a good thing. Not for everybody, but essential for some. - Might is right</li></ul><br/><br/>The film is evidently, at least at some level, intended to be satirical, so, clearly Mr Tarantino believes some, probably most, of these are not only wrong, but currently ubiquitous enough to require satirical treatment.<br/><br/>The well worn device of having the unlikely collection of characters isolated, in this case by a blizzard, works well. I'm not sure that the indulgence of such a long running time is justified. Certain aspects of the plot, signalled with crystal clarity in the first quarter of the film, are only revealed, as if an amazing surprise, a couple of hours later. I think the film could be much improved by reducing it to normal length.<br/><br/>Roy Orbison's song seems apt as a description of the Civil War, Tarantino films generally, and the problems that he highlights, quite well, all in all:<br/><br/>Now the old folks will remember On that dark and dismal day How their hearts were choked with pride As their children marched away Now the glory is all gone<br/><br/>They are left alone And there won't be many coming home No, there won't be many coming home oh, there won't be many Maybe five out of twenty but there won't be many coming home<br/><br/>x"

","I LOVE Tarantino's work, he is a genius in filmmaking. However, The Hateful Eight was a little too slow, very talky compared to his others, maybe more than Death Proof, and did not deserve the almost 3 hour length. the score is also really good and fits the movie's theme. In terms of the plot, I like the idea, being stuck at a cabin during a blizzard, classic idea, but you gotta have something going on to make it interesting, rather than just them chit-chatting, but when the movie does get into more entertaining/actiony parts, it gets WEIRD, like the vomiting blood scene. I also had no clue what the point of the movie was until almost the end, and even then, I had to also look it up online. Compared to his other films though, this is nowhere near as good as his others, it would definitely benefit being cut down and maybe restructured."
"cherold","7","0","1","17 June 2020"," A Western-Mystery through Tarantino's unique sensibility
","That Hateful Eight strikes me as fundamentally a gritty, '60s-style western with mystery elements, a lot of conversation, and a fair amount of nastiness.<br/><br/>For maybe the first two-thirds, H8 is a talky Western populated by intriguing but unlikable people. There is clearly something going on beneath the service, but it's unclear what, or which characters might not be what they seem. Some here call this a murder mystery, which is wrong, or at least only right to the extent that you could describe this as a ""period drama."" You could call it that, and I could see why you would, but it's still ultimately wrong.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, particularly Samuel L. Jackson as a tough bounty hunter and Jennifer Jason Leigh (giving her best performance in years) as a decidedly ornery criminal.<br/><br/>There is a lot of talking in this movie, and while it's generally interesting there's probably too much of it. Still, while the movie's pace is a bit slow, it never flags.<br/><br/>The last part contains the brutality Tarantino is so enamored of. It's both gory and emotionally disturbing, which I guess is what people want from his films, or, at least, what he wants to give them, most of the time.<br/><br/>I've never cared for hyper violence, I'm not generally into Westerns, and Tarantino is a director I sometimes like but have yet to love. With all that said, the movie of the first two-thirds I would probably give an 8 but the increasing unpleasantness often felt both a bit gratuitous and, more importantly, not entirely in keeping with most of the movie. It's as thought Tarantino was torn between wanting to create a character study and wanting to create a Tarantino gore fest and finally decided to just go ahead and do them both.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend this if you can deal with the gore and unpleasantness, because it is well written, directed, and acted."
"jethrotroll-30807","7","0","1","28 May 2020"," Enjoyable, except for one glaring plot hole
","I genuinely enjoyed this Tarantino movie, as I have for all that I've seen of his. As usual, the cast was great. Samuel L Jackson and Kurt Russell were exceptional, and you have the solid performances from Tarantino mainstays such as Walton Goggins, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen. Let me give a quick shout out to Jennifer Jason Leigh as well for her performance of the despicable fugitive, Daisy Domergue. This movie has all the trademarks of Tarantino film as well: overly wordy, drawn out, slow build up, plot twists and provocative use of the ""n"" word. It checks all the boxes. But, this one has one big problem.<br/><br/>I loved the first 2 hours of the film, as I'm kind of a sucker for a well done 'who dunnit'. I enjoyed the characters, the dialogue, and the build up. The problem is the last 40 minutes or so, starting with the moment the coffee is poisoned. After O.B. and John Ruth died from the poisoning, there were just 2 guys left from that group, Major Maruquis Warren and Chris Mannix. There was still all of the original party there that were there to free Domergue, plus the guy in the crawl space. Now, when Major Warren lined up the other three along the wall to figure out what happened, why didn't the guy in the crawl space just shoot Major Warren right then, instead of letting him arm Mannix, and then ultimately kill 'Bob'? Think about it. It would have been now 4 against 1, and Mannix was unarmed. The other 3 had weapons stashed around the haberdashery, so they definitely had the advantage.<br/><br/>Even without this obvious plot hole, the last 40 minutes just don't measure up to the first 2 hours. I get the feeling that Tarantino never fully developed the right way to finish the story. Now, I also understand that killing Major Warren right away would basically end the movie, but I can argue that the movie was already 2 hours in, and maybe the right ending would be having the bad guys win. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if that was the way it went, but alas, it didn't.<br/><br/>One other issue I have with this movie is that it seems like everybody somehow knows each other. John 'the Hangman' Ruth recognizes Major Warren in the middle of nowhere. Then shortly later, he recognizes Chris Mannix. Then Mannix recognizes Warren. Keep in mind, this is all happening on a Wyoming trail, during a blizzard in a country and time that was much bigger than it is today. Then, at the haberdashery, Mannix recognizes General Smithers. Shortly later, Major Warren recognizes the General as well. It just came across as way too much of a coincidence that people from faraway somehow all know each other. It might make for some interesting dialogue, but it's a flaw with this film.<br/><br/>All in all, I did enjoy it. I just think there was a much better conclusion available than the one we got."

","I waited very long to see Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"". It's the kind of movie that makes you fall asleep if you're not completely willing to wait for it and sit it through: still it's no tormenting procedure of nothingness like the one we saw in Akerman's ""Jeanne Dielman"" (1975); something does happen here, only issue is that it goes so incredibly slowly... yet not as slowly as Andy Warhol's""Empire"" (1964). For the reward is there if you have enough patience: the cinematography, the acting, the dialogues, the music. All is perfect in Quentin's movies and so it was here: there were even enough plot twists that got me jumping, or at least moving around on my seat a bit more. Yup, a big 9/19 for a movie I assumed worthy of 4/10 before I saw it completely. Bravo, mister director sir!!!"

","QT's second pure western is based in the 1870s, during a deathly cold winter in Wyoming. A bounty hunter (Kurt Russell), his captive (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two other strangers (Samuel L. Jackson and Walton Goggins) seek refuge in Minnie's haberdashery, a quaint cabin in the middle of nowhere. There they are joined by four other strangers seeking refuge and then begins a tense game of survival until the blizzard outside stops. As suggested by the title, the film is full of not very nice characters and Tarantino proves yet again he is the master of twisted enjoyment when it comes to their punishments, particularly Jason Leigh who goes through the wringer a lot! The clever thing about it all is that there's a massive enjoyment to be had in the company of these wicked people, all thanks to a stunning ensemble cast and a spectacular script. As well as being an engaging western thriller, a genuinely great comedy too with incredible dark humour throughout; everyone concocts a deliciously evil potion to quench your comic thirst! 'Christmas with mother.... is a wonderful thing.' A great line delivered with brooding intensity by Michael Madsen's Joe Gage! Samuel L Jackson's performance is just amazing; of course a legendary actor getting to work his dramatic and comic talent to its full here. The whole sequence of him taunting Bruce Dern's General Smithers is really something to behold. The music which showcases a gorgeous original score by Western legend Ennio Morricone is wonderful. Overall, I believe it's a divisive one in Quentins catalogue as it is his longest running and slowest to date, having no fear in taking its time on the small details.

","A movie full of men, but the biggest attraction is feminism
Quentin once said that at least three Western films have to be made before he can barely be regarded as a Western director. The Eight Wicks movie is the second western film he directed. Audiences familiar with Quentin will know that he has always been obsessed with filming films, from the debut film Falling Dogs to the recent Hollywood past.<br/><br/>But what is different from Quentin's other works is that the Eight Evils used 70mm film for extravagant shooting, which made the movie's aspect ratio reach an astonishing 2.76: 1. Such large frames are often used to shoot large scenes in epic films, such as film star Nolan's interstellar crossing and Dunkirk after that.<br/><br/>Using 70mm film to shoot a movie that is indoors 80% of the time is undoubtedly an arrogant act. In this regard, Quentin's explanation is that only viewers using 70mm film technology can experience the charming snow scene of Wyoming.<br/><br/>In fact, I understand here, why the eight wicked people will start with a four-minute fixed lens, of course, to see the snow scene. The story of the Eight Evils occurred after the American Civil War, when the social order was on the verge of collapse, and the government needed to rely on the bounty hunter 's gun to maintain social stability<br/><br/>Ruth is a bounty hunter. He encountered a blizzard on the way back to the city in exchange for a bounty, so he could only avoid it in the middle, which is the men's clothing store in Minnesota. Outside the house is a borderless white desert and ultra-low temperature, and the passengers in the house are forced to live together in a room, and the contradictions are triggered in the narrow small space.<br/><br/>Speaking of the 77mm film camera, although it is too small to use for indoor shooting, the effect of smashing the money can still be seen. The entire picture is larger and the scenes of the characters that can be installed are more. The suspense contained The details are of course more abundant.<br/><br/>I have to say that it 's good to have money<br/><br/>In addition, the film The Eight Evils is a very expressive film, which is full of dialogues (broken mouths) and speech-style tables. Eighty percent of them are indoor dramas, which is obvious It's a very boring movie, but in Quentin's hands, it was tricked.<br/><br/>Wars, laws, racial discrimination, and women 's rights are all included in the movie. Quentin in the play, like the legal war, has actually spoken through the character's mouth. So today we mainly talk about racial discrimination and feminism. As far as racial discrimination is concerned, the movie actually makes it very clear. After all, the background time was after the Civil War. Although the new American society had already emerged at that time, the old ideas were far from melting, and discrimination against black people was still everywhere.<br/><br/>Maguire was a black federal soldier during the Civil War. He survived the Civil War, and he has the ability and wisdom beyond ordinary people. This is shown in the film, and I will not spoil it here, but even such a powerful black warrior, in order to reduce the vigilance of the white man against himself, actually forged a Lincoln letter. It can be seen how serious the problem of racial discrimination was.<br/><br/>When it comes to feminism, I have seen similar reviews on the Internet. The view of that article is that this movie is not related to feminism. It is said that feminism is over-interpreted. I don't agree with this view, because in my opinion, the feminist taste of this movie is actually very heavy. As far as the characters are concerned, the female prisoner Daisy is actually a very powerful gangster. But in the whole film, it is the most vulnerable character. Whether it was suppressed by Rus before, or after being suppressed by Maguire and Chris, she did not really have the opportunity to show her ability. She was either handcuffed or pointed by a gun. Whenever she wanted to ""bloom"", she would be suppressed by men.<br/><br/>Whether it is Ruth 's violence against her or the woman 's innocence after Chris, they are actually reflecting the true attitude of these men towards women, even before them is a gang leader with a government reward of $ 10,000. The only time Daisy bloomed with herself was the part where she played the guitar, and it was also the most tense part of the movie. From the perspective of the audience, Daisy is an indiscriminate criminal, and Ruth is undoubtedly a spokesperson for justice or government.<br/><br/>On the guitar and singing, the audience was nervous as they watched the cup of poisonous coffee in Ruth's hands. The easiest time for Daisy was the time when Russ was going to die. The poison coffee had been brewed and he was waiting to drink it.<br/><br/>In the melodious guitar song, Daisy's small eyes kept peeking, which made the audience's hearts catch up. This is my favorite part of the whole film, but the fact is not what Daisy imagined. Although Russ died, Maguire pressed it up, even though Maguire 's gun was gone without a bullet. Chris fainted , Daisy desperately wanted to get the pistol, but was stopped by Chris at the last minute.<br/><br/>Although Daisy should have strong strength, as can be seen from the government's 10,000 bounty, a powerful woman is suppressed by men again and again. If it is not mapping feminism, what is it expressing?<br/><br/>When it comes to the guitar section, I have to talk about the guitar itself. The broken guitar in the play is actually a cultural relic. This guitar has a history of 150 years. The museum lent it to Kun to support the film business. Ting. The actor who dropped the guitar, Kurt Russell, was not informed in advance that it was a cultural relic, but Jennifer Jason Lee, who is good at playing the guitar, knew the true identity of the guitar.<br/><br/>A female prisoner who didn't blink, but yelled at the moment when the guitar was dropped. In fact, this performance does not match the role. This guitar is more like a redundant sacrifice. Many fans justify it<br/><br/>This is the ruffian Quentin himself<br/><br/>Quentin is to inspire the actors to perform better<br/><br/>Quentin is also for the audience<br/><br/>But fellow, he knew it was a cultural relic, and the museum did not authorize him to fall<br/><br/>But he fell and did not tell the actor the truth in advance<br/><br/>This is not washable anyway<br/><br/>Although in the end Quentin also paid for his actions, the reason why cultural relics are not sold in the window like commodities is because their meaning is far more than their value, such behavior is bad in any case. of.<br/><br/>But one yard to one yard, the movies he made are indeed quite good, worthy of his name as a ghost.<br/><br/>This movie recommends everyone to watch it, it is a very good western film. Whether it's the scene or the character's clothing, you can feel that turbulent cowboy era, and in all the western films, this eight villains can definitely be called a big coffee gathering, and can even be compared with the Avengers series of Marvel Universe. Comparable, it is simply a competition of the acting school.<br/><br/>The only bad thing is the length of its movie. The eight villains are divided into four parts. The total length of the movie reaches 183 minutes. Coupled with the Quentin-style broken mouth dialogue, people who are impatient may not wait for the movie to climax Quickly exit. So I suggest that you make preparations for watching movies in advance, this is definitely a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>So in the end, who poisoned the coffee?"

","As it might be surprising I've just watched the movie, and did it twice.<br/><br/>At first I was captured by actors play, views, and scenes, so I decided to watch it again... and may be that was a mistake, which lead to writing this review. The thing I never done before, but sometimes one just can't help.<br/><br/>This highly priced bandits on the second thought (watch) turned out to be a group which has difficulties with putting their act together.<br/><br/>They had so many chances to kill John Ruth, starting with him entering inside and trying to fix the door. He was standing with his back to them with a hammer in his hand. What a better moment you need to shoot him? OK. There are two more guys out there but odds are on their side. So why these killers hesitated? Apparently they like to pretend being somebody else, and not finish the story too quick...<br/><br/>All right. They didn't use the first chance, and were disarmed by Ruth and Major Warren. But they had plenty of guns hidden out so why not to get them and shoot both while they don't expect it? Again they probably don't want the story to be too simple. Or they just plain stupid.<br/><br/>And just to confirm their stupidity they decided to poison the coffee. OK. Ruth made it, so what? Is there any guarantee that he will drink it and die first? What if somebody else goes before him? Wouldn't it be a bit suspicious for his already suspicious mind? And they knew that he is suspicious, also they knew that Major Warren is on his side. Even if Ruth was poisoned Major would not just sit and continue to drink his brandy. Obviously he would do something about it. As just happened in the movie... But again why not get yourself armed, at least as a precaution?<br/><br/>Next, I might be completely wrong here but just expressing a doubt. I'm not sure that two bullets at that time could blow up the head as it happened with misfortunate senior Bob. Maybe they could... But before he was shot twice in the chest from the same two guns, and from that I assume with the bullets of the same power. In that case his chest should become one big hole, but it didn't. And this is kind of sort of strange...<br/><br/>And at last... Jody's sitting in the basement. He's got his moment, he wounded Major. So why on earth he stopped shooting? Did he believe it was enough? Then why he kept on sitting in that basement? What a best moment to come out. Major is laying crying, Mannix is busy with other guys. Most likely they didn't pay attention where the basement hatch is. So if Jody jumped out quickly, he would have at least a second or more than his enemies and he knew where they are. Since no man in this movie ever missed (not even touch that!), it would be enough for him to kill both of them. I think if he's such a thug as we are made to believe ($25k for his head), and eager to kill whoever is crossing his sister way to the freedom, he would do that... Instead he's just decided to peacefully stay in his comfort zone, I mean, basement, gave up his guns upon request, came out with his hands held high, and allowed his head to be blown up. All that to let us see, how two dying men are hanging Daisy, all covered in blood. It was certainly worth blowing up Jody's head for that.<br/><br/>Thanks anyone who managed to read this through."

All the actors are well on point and i didn't find it boring at all. It's like if a ""normal"" tarantino movie is a bit more extended on a whodunnit basis, but prety redeeming at the end. I also loved how he wanted to tell this story, and you have to wach it think also about a theatrical play. This is the most theatrical tarantino film, it could easily be a play.<br/><br/>But what i indeed liked the most was the different characters the movie had. One general, one black guy - both fought on different sides of the war, one hispanic, someone from england that tried to pacify everything, even though all of them aren't exactly what they seem to be. but at the end of the day it's america that finds and condemns the guilty, sacrificing itself for the sake of justice. i think there's somehow hope on all the cultural clashes this film shows. Tarantino wanted to film america and i think he did it. Plus is pretty entertaining even if the scenery is pretty much the same. And it's pure tarantinesque, no one could have made this like tarantino did. If inglorious basterds was tarantino's version of hitler's death, django his version of slavery, this is his version of america, and who lives and lived there.<br/><br/>I believe a lot of people won't enjoy it if they're expecting a more fast paced film with bloody moments. this isn't fast paced but for me it even make it more enjoyable when the blood finally arrived. Because on a sudden you weren't expecting it. It's like the first scene of inglorious basterds takes way longer than 15 minutes. It's hans landa talking for hours until he realizes what's going on inside that house - but in this case we're talking about america united aginst the bad guys.<br/><br/>i really thought it's one of tarantino's best. along kill bill and pulp fiction in my opinion."

"jaredpahl","10","0","2","23 February 2020"," In a Hateful World, Tarantino's Intimate Western Epic Shows the Unifying Power of Violence.
","For a filmmaker known for homage, Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight functions less like a love letter to a forgotten Hollywood genre than a sincere example of one. It doesn't imitate the classic westerns, it is one. Shot on honest to goodness 70mm film and scored by Ennio Morricone himself, The Hateful Eight plays like a relic unearthed from Hollywood's now ancient past. Its sumptuous technical quality, paired with another sizzling Tarantino script, makes The Hateful Eight a shining beacon in a movie landscape starving for quality, grown up entertainment. It's a big bad mother******, and it's one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Most of The Hateful Eight takes place in a single cabin. That intimate plot is one of the things that keeps The Hateful Eight feeling distinct from its inspirations. Tarantino turns the film into an Agatha Christie style chamber piece, set against a massive blizzard, where eight mysterious figures work out secrets, lies, and personal vendettas. You can't very well describe The Hateful Eight as a spaghetti western or even a tribute to the spaghetti western because its structure is completely new. Tarantino's script indulges his best impulses. The movie is almost entirely dialogue punctuated by extreme violence. The tense conversations wherein characters play subtle power games with one another in order to uncover secret motives is a staple of the best of Tarantino's writing, and he lets that urge run wild here. The movie is long, nearly three hours, but Tarantino never reaches a creative plateau. The story twists into pretzels, constantly surprising and delighting with new wrinkles. It only gets more complicated, more suspenseful, and more thrilling as it moves towards its resolution.<br/><br/>All eight of the principle actors are in fine form, so much so that I have trouble singling any one of them out of the bunch. Samuel L. Jackson is as charismatic as he's been in years, Kurt Russell and Walton Goggins exude real joy in their roles, and others like Tim Roth, Bruce Dern, Michael Madsen, and Demian Bichir are textured and complicated. But if I had to pick a standout performance, it would be from Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue, the most vile, nasty woman in film history. It's some kind of brilliant performance, a snarling, sarcastic psychopath who takes repeated punishment only to return the favor in increasingly evil ways. She is the lightning rod to the entire film, the only character that is pure, blood-spitting bad. The story hinges on Kurt Russell's character bringing her to justice and hanging her by the neck until dead.<br/><br/>And it is in that story thread that The Hateful Eight becomes truly special. Tarantino and Leigh punish you with Daisy's wretchedness over and over again until you start to believe that total evil will win the day. That is until two characters who began as principle opposites learn to come together for a common goal. The climax of The Hateful Eight is at once both gutturally horrifying and profoundly hopeful. A hanging by an olive branch. In the most Tarantino fashion, he creates a statement about American tensions more moving than a dozen entire movies on the subject. It's about justice, human decency and male camaraderie, and it is satisfying on a spiritual level.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is Quentin Tarantino let loose. It comes from a writer who feels completely free. Tarantino is doing what he loves, and doing it with an earnest passion. He's making his own legend to stand alongside Leone and Eastwood. It just so happens that when Quentin Tarantino simply messes around and has some fun writing interesting characters, it can be more substantial as a visual and intellectual piece of art than almost anything else.<br/><br/>96/100"

","I have no idea why it has taken me so long to watch this film. A friend went to the cinema to see it and said it was really boring, but that wouldn't have put me off. Anyway that aside I loved it. A claustrophobic thriller with great characters and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing till the end. I could almost see it as a play, which maybe down to the limited scope of the environment. Two or three characters would be engaged in a scene and in the background you can make out the other characters sat, and it looks like they are waiting for their scene. Another great Tarantino film. I think Hollywood will feel slightly emptier when he's finished his 10th and final film."

","The Hateful Eight is the eighth film directed by Quentin Tarantino. A director that has thus far delivered a filmography of fairly graphic violent, dialogue heavy productions that draw comparisons to other genres.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight obviously draws parallels to the spaghetti western films that become popular in the late 1960s and featured heavily violent scenes in a Western environment and made mainly by Italian/Spanish filmmakers.<br/><br/>The film was notable on release in 2015 for being filmed in a 70mm film format rather than the standard 35mm that most films are made in. 70mm allows for a wider screen, more detailed shots apparently. I don't see the significance with this film. Aside from the first few minutes that show the breathtaking scenery of a snowbound, stormy Wyoming, U.S. location.<br/><br/>The story features some excellent casting choices most notably Samuel L. Jackson in a quite customary role. He plays a bounty hunter that reminded me more of his role in Die Hard: With A Vengeance with his seemed hatred of whites and use of the N word. Kurt Russell plays another bounty hunter, John Ruth who is transporting his captive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock.<br/><br/>As the weather worsens outside into a stormy blizzard Ruth in his stagecoach takes shelter at a seemed bed and breakfast like location that the rest of the 'long' film is set in, Minnie's Haberdashery. The Haberdashery is the location as a group of highly dangerous, suspicious looking individuals take shelter. Each one armed, ready to kill each other. However where is the film going. It certainly takes a couple of hours for the impasse at the Haberdashery to take place at which I was left asking that very question to myself. It is only in the final act that the plot thickens. A good plot but difficult to maintain concentration for such a long time.<br/><br/>The film is as standard with Tarantino films dialogue heavy and consistent with his films in having memorable set pieces. The violence can be quite graphic and is not for the squeamish viewer. I am certainly glad I viewed the film although I would struggle to do so in a single sitting. An intermission is needed and was provided on its cinema release. In my case the intermission was overnight."

","""A bunch of travelers inhibited by a blizzard, seek refuge at a lone cabin - 'Minnie's Haberdashery'.
Little did they know how everyone there has a motive to fulfill.""<br/><br/>The synopsis of this movie on paper does come across as a cinematic adaptation of any classic Agatha Christie novel, and is indeed intended to execute by Tarantino the way one would expect him to. It is a follow up of 'Django Unchained', set few years after the Civil War. The spoilsport is the editing, that perpetually gets the narrative freezing like the temperature outside the cabin, wasting a lot of time and the acting capabilities of its charismatic cast.<br/><br/>Relying heavily on a one man show by Tarantino's favorite Samuel L. Jackson, who delivers his best act post Pulp Fiction, this 'Who did it?' thriller spends little time in developing the characters to get me guessing the wrong doer. It rather gets repetitive and too indulgent perpetually to serve no purpose. The redeemer is its third act, delivering the signature neat Tarantino violence, but waiting a long 150 minutes for it to happen becomes boring, especially while revisiting the movie. It sometimes gets me wondering that the movie and its action could have ended straight, if the initial conversion were :<br/><br/>Major Marquis Warren - ""Got room for one more?""

"BandSAboutMovies","7","0","2","27 July 2019"," Another bloody Tarantino western
","Originally conceived it as a novel and sequel to Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight marks both a major change in Tarantino's career - it's the last he'd make for The Weinstein Company, as he ended his relationship with them following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein - while yearning back for the days of 70 mm films, as this was released as a limited edition roadshow in theaters that could still show it before it made its way to modern theaters. It's also the first of his films to be re-edited as a longer miniseries for Netflix.<br/><br/>Tarantino was inspired by the TV Westerns that he had grown up watching, particularly episodes where bad guys would come to town and take the heroes hostage, saying ""What if I did a movie starring nothing but those characters? No heroes, no Michael Landons. Just a bunch of nefarious guys in a room, all telling backstories that may or may not be true. Trap those guys together in a room with a blizzard outside, give them guns, and see what happens.""<br/><br/>Bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren (Samuel Jackson) is on his way to Red Rock with three dead men when he hitches a ride from a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson (James Parks). Inside is John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his captive, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who he is also taking to Red Rock for hanging. The two men know one another, as they bonded over Warren's personal letter from President Abraham Lincoln. Another man, militiaman Chris Mannix (Walter Goggins), joins them as he's also traveling to Red Rock to become the town's new sheriff.<br/><br/>However, the trip runs into a massive snowstorm, so they decide to visit Minnie's Haberdashery, where they learn that Minnie (Dana Gourrier, Cora from Django Unchained) has gone to visit her mother. The stagecoach lodge is filled with all manner of scum and villainy - Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), who claims to be traveling home to visit his mother; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), a British hangman who ends up being English Pete Hicox, making him Archie Hicox's - from Inglorious Basterds - great-great grandfather; and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern), who is on his way to bury his son.<br/><br/>Ruth doesn't trust anyone, so he takes everyone's guns but Warren. The group all has stew together, with Mannix realizing that Warren's letter from Lincoln is fake, which angers Ruth. He feels lied to while Warren explains that it allows him to move amongst white people more easily. Then, he gives Smithers a gun, hoping he reaches for it after he explains how he tortured, assaulted and killed the man's son in revenge for Smithers' executions of black soldiers at the Battle of Baton Rouge.<br/><br/>While Warren shoots Smithers, everyone misses the coffee being poisoned. Jackson and Ruth both drank it and start throwing up huge amounts of blood before Daisy kills her captor with his own gun. There's a flashback where she sings the traditional Australian folk ballad ""Jim Jones at Botany Bay"" on a vintage Martin guitar that had been loaned to the production by the Martin Guitar Museum. Somehow, no one told Kurt Russell that the guitar needed to be switched out before he was to destroy it, so the entire set was freaked out that an irreplaceable guitar was destroyed. Needless to say, the museum no longer loans out its guitars.<br/><br/>Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to the dead body of Ruth, while holding everyone but Mannix at gunpoint. He quickly deduces what's happening - Minnie hates Mexicans and would never hire one, much less leave them in charge. Bob has to have killed her, so he kills the man, When he moves to kill Daisy, Gage admits that he was the one who poisoned the coffee. Then, someone in the cellar shoots Warren directly between the legs and all hell breaks loose. Mobray pulls a gun and shoots Mannix, who fires back on him.<br/><br/>That's when we learn that Mobray Bob, Mobray, Gage and Daisy's brother Jody (Channing Tatum) had come to the lodge in disguise and killed everyone but Smithers, telling him that they would spare him if he stays quiet (Zoe Bell and Lee Horsely make appearances here). Mannix and Warren may be wounded, but they still have the advantage. Luring Jody out of hiding by threatening Daisy, he comes up from the cellar only to be shot and killed.<br/><br/>What follows is a long Mexican standoff between Warren and Mannix with the dying Mobray, Gage and Daisy, who continually attempts to manipulate Mannix into taking the money and killing Warren.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is at once a return to the Western film while also a look back to Reservoir Dogs, in that no one is innocent and everyone pays for it with their lives. While so many of Tarantino's films afterward had promises of somewhat happy endings, none of that is in store for anyone in this movie.<br/><br/>Accompanying all of the bloodshed is a new score by Ennio Morricone, the first Western that the Italian composer had scored in 34 years. Tarantino had previously used Morricone's music in Kill Bill, Death Proof, Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds. There are also three unused songs from Morricone's score for John Carpenter's The Thing and ""Regan's Theme"" from Exorcist II: The Heretic.<br/><br/>Despite saying that he would never work with Tarantino after his displeasure with how his music was used in Django Unchained, Morricone came around and worked with him. Perhaps that's because he liked the script, but Morricone was also given complete freedom to score the film, which he saw as an adventure instead of a Western. After a little over a month, Morricone gave Tarantino five pieces of music, which he could use in the movie however he wanted.<br/><br/>In addition to fifty minutes of Morricone's music, the film also features the songs ""Apple Blossom"" by The White Stripes, ""Now You're All Alone"" by David Hess from The Last House on the Left and ""There Won't Be Many Coming Home"" by Roy Orbison from The Fastest Guitar Alive.<br/><br/>At once a rumination of both The Thing and Reservoir Dogs, The Hateful Eight may not be my favorite Tarantino film, but it's hard to deny that it's a great film, filled with ambiguity and bereft of morals."
"ksmart73","6","0","1","20 July 2019"," Gave the Extended Version a shot...with regret
","I love Quentin Tarantino films. Name any or all--I've seen them and can comment on all of them positively.<br/><br/>With one exception.<br/><br/>Let's start with what's great about this feature:
70mm film looks beautiful, cinematography and lighting is gorgeous! Imagining a whole film crew going out in the middle of nowhere to shoot scenes for big film while it is actually snowing out boggles the mind. This really shows the ambition and hunger for overcoming a challenge the crew had. The continuity throughout is impeccable; I really believe they shot this in one night, and have to remind myself: this was shot over weeks and months! Crazy. The acting is quite good, as to be expected.<br/><br/>Let's slow things down. Let's slow things waaaay down:
What I dislike about this movie most is the plot itself. It's a film marketed as a mystery/thriller, yet ""the big reveal,"" is cheap. The twist and turn at the end just left me thinking, ""Why did I sit through this if the conclusion is just that everyone dies?"" It worked in Reservoir Dogs, so why doesn't it work here? Is it because the good guy doesn't actually win, or that there aren't really any good guys anyway? No--it's not that. It's that fact that this story is entirely from the imagination of someone I am a huge fan of, who takes us on this journey for 4.5 hours...but the drop off doesn't land at all. There's a ton of tension and build, and (being this is actually my 2nd viewing) there are so many hints and lack of hints at the beginning that could build to great climax.
For me, it all falls apart when Samuel L Jackson has his monologue at the Confederate general; the dialogue feels so sophomoric, modern, and silly that it stands out. Anyone could see in plain sight that Samuel L Jackson's character is totally making up the story to get a rise out of the general, as he presents no concrete evidence he's ever met the general's son, but the general--either with old age, alcohol, or both--is just too emotional to contain himself.
From this point on, it just all goes off the rails and suffers under its own ambition: the audience member is thinking, ""there's no this is going to end is a fun, new, exciting, and satisfying way,"" and it doesn't.<br/><br/>I just wish this was a lot more. There is a way to do films in the same room the whole time in a satisfying way, but this missed every mark. There wasn't enough there to make this, even remotely, meet that standard Tarantino has set for himself. I wish we could have seen more flashbacks to Jackson's character's war, or what Legih's character did, or who Kurt Russel's character was, etc. etc. etc. The fact that one of the main marketing points for this feature was the use of 70mm, and we end up in the same room for three hours is such a cop out for as established of a director as Tarantino. The story is the tension in the room? Well if that's the case, make the people in the room more interesting."

See no point for Major Marquis Warren to live Daisy and the rest of the gang alive after John Ruth was dead. Warren sure sensed danger. Instead of damage control, Warren kept on deducting and talking until he was shot, and when the bad guys got the upper hand, the story didn't end there. The story dragged on for another 40 mins.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","25 May 2019"," Tarantino does mystery with western trappings
","Following 2012's ""Django Unchained"", Quentin Tarantino once again returned to the American west for his next feature, ""The Hateful Eight"". With a title reminiscent of ""The Magnificent Seven"", you might expect a rip-roaring yarn chock full of action. However, the movie actually owes much more to mystery novels by the likes of Agatha Christie than it does to traditional Hollywood westerns. The narrative even follows a literary structure which includes some narration from Tarantino himself.<br/><br/>The titular eight are a group of nefarious individuals brought together in a cabin by a snowstorm. Two of the most prominent of these are a bounty hunter and his notorious prisoner who carries a price of $10,000 on her head. It isn't long before suspicions arise that one or more of the others might have a stake in seeing that this prisoner doesn't get brought to justice. There are shades of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in this setup, which probably isn't just a coincidence.<br/><br/>Despite being more of a mystery than a western, ""The Hateful Eight"" is nevertheless a more traditional Hollywood depiction of the west than ""Django Unchained"". That being said, the snowbound setting and the strong mystery angle give the movie a unique flavour. I can't really think of any other western quite like this. Tarantino's script has his trademark mix of violence and impeccable dialogue which in this case is in service of a well constructed mystery plot. The movie is dialogue heavy due to the confined setting limiting the amount of action taking place but it does move along fairly briskly. Still, the extended length (nearly three hours) will likely try the patience of some viewers.<br/><br/>As always, the casting is excellent. Several vets from past Tarantino movies returned here including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Walton Goggins and Bruce Dern. That's a great starting point and then you throw in Jennifer Jason Leigh, who ended up getting an Oscar nomination for what is arguably the movie's most memorable performance. To me, the movie harks back to ""Reservoir Dogs"" by having a relatively small cast strutting their stuff in a confined setting.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction is flawless, as usual. That being said, he somewhat confusingly decided to go through the considerable effort of using 70mm photography for this picture, which was mostly wasted on an interior set. That approach would have been better suited to ""Django Unchained"", which had more varied environments. Be that as it may, the visuals are consistently attractive. However, they're overshadowed by Ennio Morricone's moody score, which is one of the movie's strongest points (and also the winner of an Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA).<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Hateful Eight"" doesn't quite stack up to Tarantino's best efforts but it's still a good movie. It contains some interesting commentary on race relations along with a subversion of typical feminist tropes whereby in this case we're treated to a strong female villain instead of a hero. I'm not sure how well it stands up to repeated viewings because of the whole mystery angle but it's intricate enough that you probably won't remember all the twists and turns of the plot."

Most of the first half of the film is filled with well-written dialogue that provides excellent character and plot development. And while the twists were probably obvious and somewhat unoriginal, they were definitely interesting given the context.<br/><br/>All that being said, Tarantino's 8th film felt like a ""clip show"" of bits from all his other films. The black bounty hunter from ""Django,"" the desire to kill only one particular set of people from ""Basterds,"" semi-non-linear storytelling from ""Pulp Fiction,"" a group of people who don't trust each other from ""Reservoir Dogs,"" etc etc etc. Next time, I hope there's something new."

Many of the lengthy scenes traveling through snow, planting spikes in snow, tracking blood in snow, etc. would have been removed or reduced to transitions... The dialog would have been cut down for 'lesser characters' (of coarse, the young writer/director would have needed to decide which characters to cut down, which Tarantino would never do)... There would have been less gore, blood, vomit, etc... And, these changes would have made a better movie.<br/><br/>There were many great performances in this film, but they all get watered down in the 'grandeur' that is Tarantino's version of an epic western.

I do enjoy long films (such as Wolf of Wall Street) if the pace has a good balance of having interesting events and keeping the interest; while there are some fantastic scenes at the beginning middle and end everything in between feels longer than it should.

","I like Tarrantino's movies. Pulp Fiction is my all time favourite.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight, in my view, is Tarrantino's weakest movie. It's all rather pointless, as far as the story goes. The acting is great, it looks amazing, but the story just isn't there.<br/><br/>It's meandering along, decently enough, but then randomly, three quarters of the way through, out of nowhere, Tarrantino starts narrating. Took me out of the movie, it was quite jarring. It was as if he didn't know what to do next so he literally explained the next couple of hours of the story away, just to skip some time.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson's monologue (you'll know which bit I mean if and when you watch it) is awful. I understood the point of it, to provoke someone else, but it just seemed unnecessary.<br/><br/>I'm ok with pretty much anything in films, if it's a decent film, and has a real point. Violence, sex/nudity, language, but that story from Jackson was just a waste of time.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a fan, give it a go, you might love it. If you e never watched a Tarrantino film before, perhaps try Inglorious Basterds or Pulp Fiction (Jackie Brown is excellent and underrated), as they're far superior."

","Quentin Tarantino's new movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is coming out this summer. I'm super stoked for it and I want to watch all of the movies he has written/directed and one of them is The Hateful Eight, the movie I am reviewing today.<br/><br/>I absolutely love Tarantino's style of filmmaking. The dialogue is fluid and very catchy. Even in his not so great films, his dialogue is still so damn good. Although, some of his movies have dialogue that doesn't propel the story along, and sometimes feels like a waste of time. I believe Pulp Fiction and The Hateful Eight suffers from that. The dialogue is still good, but it feels like it's just there just to be funny, with no other purpose. This is my biggest issue with The Hateful Eight. The second act has the most pointless but good dialogue.<br/><br/>Like all Tarantino films, there is exquisite acting in this movie. Samuel L. Jackson has a top notch performance in this film, it could be his second best performance in a Tarantino film, behind Pulp Fiction. Kurt Russell has such a great performance in this movie, he's so good. Everyone else in this movie is also stupendous, especially Channing Tatum. When I saw his name in the opening credits, I was like ""wow, really, Channing Tatum, c'mon Tarantino you can do better than that."" And when Channing Tatum came onto the screen, I was really shook that his acting is as good as everyone else's performance in this movie. I did not expect him to be this good in this movie, and I was proven wrong. I didn't take Channing Tatum seriously as an actor until I watched him in this movie. Bravo, Channing Tatum.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with this movie is the second act. The first act was decent, the third act was amazing, and the second act just wasn't that good. The second act is filled with pointless dialogue with nothing propelling the story. It was sort of boring for most of the second act. It was just characters sitting in one space doing almost nothing. If the whole movie was as good as the third act, this film would've been a masterpiece. The third act was intriguing, fast paced (in a good way) and with lots of twists and turns. The first act was the introductory act where all the characters get to know each other, and that was fun to see. This movie was a bit long, but if the second act kept up with the other acts, it would've been great. 8/10"

","This movie was good overall despite the 3 plus hour run time with spectacular cinematography and great performances by the cast plus the script was well written. The only issues I had with this movie was the very graphic violence and sexual dialogue."
"raymondyin-12314","6","0","1","12 March 2019"," Great acting and build up, disappointing ending
","WIth such a long duration, the film had great opportunity to make a clean and exceptional ending, but instead it builds up to a messy bloodbath, ruining a potentially good movie and making The Hateful Eight a huge disappointment. Most of the movie is set in a single room, and for the most part it's just dialogue - Almost like a play.
The acting is superb, and while each of the characters has a villainous side, you'll end up rooting for all of them at the same time. And even though it's mainly just people talking, the suspense weaved into each line helps keep any viewer closely engaged.
Despite the good acting, the storyline itself is relatively straightforward, and many events that were probably meant to be ""plot twists"" were very predictable. Still, there were a few interesting scenes, and the explanation given near the end of the film helps satisfy many questions, at least until everyone starts shooting, and the plot crashes down. On top of the spontaneous violence, many of the film's breaks and narrations seem to be lazily done, separated by chapters and randomly introducing a narrator to help fill in some holes.
However, to be able to create an engaging film that takes place all in a single room with essentially no action for the first two hours is definitely a great achievement. The suspense and buildup was amazing, however, the execution really let the film down as far as films go."

","I think I would have enjoyed The Hateful Eight more if Quentin Tarantino would have stopped taking victory laps throughout the movie. I liked the story, but I felt like the film is trying to show off how artistic and shocking it could be at every turn, and constantly patting itself on the back. It's a bit gruesome for my tastes, but I did appreciate the acting, the score and the cinematography."
"charliejsch","10","0","3","14 January 2019"," First time I saw it I fell asleep.
","Had this movie for a while and decided to put it on. I didn't know who directed, wrote it or produced it. I fell asleep and turned it off after 15 minutes. I tried again sometime in the future and was utterly shocked by how good it was. I was like,""is this a Tarantino movie?""<br/><br/>The dialogue is humerous, witty and just plain brilliant. The character feel unqiue and there are tons of easter eggs hidden around. This is clearly a good vs bad guy type of movie, but what makes it so capitivating is all the grey inbetween. One of the characters may explain a horrific deed they performed, but under the circumstances they justify it. Among all the wit, there is an underlining moral and philosophical debate However, Tarantino makes these issues humorours with over the top violence, fantastic protagonists and treating real human inqualities satirically. It is an incredibly smart and fun movie.<br/><br/>I've seen it a few times now and get captivated everytime. You have to enjoy this as a story of wit and just plain coolness."

"aspero-12928","8","0","2","28 December 2018"," Western in Tarantino style but with some imprecisions
","The film is clearly divided in two parts. The first one is a bit boring (that's why many people under-rated the movie) because of the long dialogues about the historical contest in which the facts occur. So the first part is centered on the presentations of the various characters who introduce themselves by explaining their political positions (and, indirectly, their role in the storyline). In the second part, ""The showdown"", these characters are put in action and we finally understand who they really are. Blood, twists, subterfuge and unlikely cooperation: that's what we expect from a Tarantino movie. But we don't expect a mistake in the editing (if you see it you'll understand, I hate spoilering). But the production of this movie has been very controversial so this is forgivable."

The plot is overall well written but there's a few parts in it that really are just poorly written. Obviously being a Tarantino film, all the dialogue is great.

The Verdict: Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" is One Of His Best Finest Films Of All Time Not Since His Other Movie ""Jackie Brown"" Witch Was Not Brutal Violent At All, Actually ""Jackie Brown"" is The Only One Film Of His Where is Not Very Bloody, Just a Little Bit Of it But Not So Much Unlike His Other Films Like ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Death Proof"" And Kill Bill Vol. 1 And Vol. 2 Were All Very Graphic And Gruesome Films With The Over The Top Violent Killing Scenes in Them...Anyways So What Was i, Oh Yeah! Back To ""The Hateful Eight"" i Have To Say i Love These Kind Of Movies Where You Have Say Like Four, Five Or 10 Mysterious Strangers Holding Up And Taking Shelter At a House Or a Wearhouse Hide Out. Bit Here in This Movie You Have 8 Mysterious Strangers That Are Forced To Stay Under in The Same Roof At a Place Called Minney's Haberdashery And These Hateful Characters is a Bounty Hunter Named ""John Ruth"" Played By Kurt Russell Who is Transporting a Wanted Fugitive Killer Woman Named ""Daisy Domergue"" Played By Jennifer Jason Leigh in a Oscar Worthy Nomination For Best Surporting Actress, Are Heading Towards a Town Called ""Red Rock"" in a Stagecoach That is Driving By a Man Named ""O.B."" Played By James Parks, And Along The Way They Stop For Two More People That They Encounter One is a Black Former Union Soldier That Turned An Infamous Bounty Hunter Named ""Major Marquis Warren"" Played By The Bad Ass Star Samuel L. Jackson And Chris Mannix a Southern Renegade Who is To Be The New Shreiff Of ""Red Rock"" Played By Walton Goggins ,Suddenly We Have John Ruth, Daisy Domergue, Major Marquis Warren And Chris Mannix Are All Going To ""Red Rock"" But Because There is a Very Bad Blizzard Coming Hard So They All Diedcide To Go To Minnie's Haberdashery Until The Snow Blizzard Pass By Them And Once John Ruth, Daisy Domergue, Chris Mannix, Major Marquis Warren And OB. Step inside Of Minnie's Haberdashery All Five Encounter Another Group Of People That Got There First Before They Did We Have ""Bob"" Who's Actually Name is ""Marco The Mexican"" Played By Demian Bichir From ""Machete Kills"", Next Up is ""Oswaldo Mobray"" Who's Actually Name is ""English Pete Hicox"" Played By Tim Roth From ""Rob Roy"", ""Joe Cage"" Who's Actually Name is ""Grouch Douglas"" And The Great Legend Movie Star Bruce Dern From Alfred Hitchcock's ""Family Plot"" And John Frankenheimer's ""Black Sunday"" Who Plays a Confederate General Stanford Smithers, But Sooner Or Later Things Starts To Get Out Of Hand Epespecially When Major Marquis Warren Who is Are Main Character Of The Entire Movie Notices Something Very Strange And Odd When He Kicks a Red Jelly Bean into The Small Creek Hole in The Floor of Minnie's Haberdashery, As Looks Up And Sees a Jar Of Red Jelly Beans Missing From On Top Of The Cabinet And That's When Later On During The Third Act After ""John Ruth"" And ""O.B."" Drinked Poisoned Coffee That Somebody Put Poison into The Coffee Pot And That Killed Them Both, That's When Major Marquis Warren Starts To invisgate The Entire Solution Of What Really Happened Here in Minney's Haberdashery And Where is Minnie Herself And When Major Marquis Warren Pulls Off The Blankets And Covers From The Chair That Belonged To Minnie's Husband Sweet Dave Where He Always Used To Sit in As He Sees a Spot Of Blood On The Back Of Sweet Dave's Chair Where Sweet Dave Leans His Back On This Sent Major Marquis Warren Off As He Grows More Mad As He Knows That Minnie And Sweet Dave Have Bern Murdered So He Blames There Murder To Bob Who's Actually Name is ""Marco The Mexican"" And Marquis Warren Shoots And Kills Marco The Mexican Then Out Of Nowhere Major Marquis Warren Gets Shot Right in His Crotch Area By Another Person That is Actually is Daisy Domergue's Bother ""Jody Domergue"" Played By Channing Tatum Who Has Come To Rescue And Save Daisy From Being Hanged, But Ultimately He Fails As The Enjured Major Marquis Warren Shoots Him in The Back Of The Head And His Blood Splashs On Daisy Domergue's Face And Eventually All Of The Characters All Die in The End Of This Movie Just Like The Main Characters Died At The End Of Reservoir Dogs Well Expect Mr. Pink Who Survives The Shootout Between The Other Characters And Walked Away. Again i Thought ""The Hateful Eight"" Was One Of The Greatest Tarantino Films Of All Time. The Cast Were Brilliant Terrific Even Kurt Russell Was Good Til His Character's Death Happens As ""John Ruth"", So Was Demian Bichir's Part Was Good Til He Gets Shot By Samuel l. Jackson's Character, Then We Two Of Quentin Tarantino's Best Actors Tim Roth And Michael Madsen That Them Two Started Together in Tarantino's First Film ""Reservoir Dogs"", Jennifer Jason Leigh From ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" Who i Thought Was Great For Being An Quentin Tarantino Movie For The First Time, Finally Tarantino Put An 80s Actress in His Own Film And Bruce Dern Which Was Brilliant To See And Watch Him Play Another Character, But The Two Main Stars in This Film Are Samuel l. Jackson Who Delivers An Electrifying Performance And Possibly One Of The Greatest Roles Of His Career As ""Major Marquis Warren"", And Walton Goggins Who Also Delivers An Standout Performance As ""Chris Mannix"" Epespecially Since Samuel l. Jackson And Walton Goggins Are Last Reminding Two Characters As The Both Of Them Hanging Daisy Domergue To Her Death. Also The Score Of This Movie Goes Out To Ennio Morricone The Legendary italian Mastero Who Did The Man With No Name Film Franchises And John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" Another Thing To About The Hateful Eight is That The Movie Won For Ennio Morricone's Score For The First Time Ever Which I'm So Proud Of That Morricone Won For This Film. The Hateful Eight is One Of My Second Favorite Movie Of Quentin Tarantino And The Other Film Of His is Jackie Brown Which is My Favorite Too."

"hollandmctyeire","9","0","1","29 August 2018"," Tarantino Continues His Streak
","With Tarantino's ninth film, he returns to the Western genre and brings his signature wit, tension, and violence in a film that ranks as one of his best. While it does not have the sympathetic characters that some of his previous films have, it is an undeniably fun film.<br/><br/>Essentially a remake of The Thing, The Hateful Eight takes place during a terrible blizzard where a group of sleazy characters have all been forced to hide out in a small inn. One of the individuals is on the way to be hanged but it quickly becomes apparent that someone is not who they claim to be and the picture turns into a classic mystery.<br/><br/>The first thing that is noticeable about The Hateful Eight is the direction and the atmosphere. It's rare to see a western film in the snow-capped mountains and Hateful Eight uses this to gorgeous effect. The tone of the film is set almost immediately with a beautiful, haunting score by Ennio Morricone over a stark, snowy landscape. The film goes for a tone and it nails it from the first frame all the way to the last.<br/><br/>As is typical with Tarantino films, the acting is perfect across the board. Each actor has been carefully selected for their roles and it shows. Dramatic tension is undercut with comedy at the drop of a hat and it never feels out of place, thanks to the performances. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, is at the top of his game, showing that even after 150 films, he is just as good as the script he has. Walton Goggins proves to be the highlight of the film and our perceptions of him constantly change throughout the film.<br/><br/>Where the film truly shines is the dialogue, characters, and the tension that builds from both. Tarantino proves that age hasn't slowed him down one bit, in fact showing that he has become a master of his craft. In a lot of films, dialogue is meant to get us from one place to other, but in Tarantino's films, the dialogue is the highlight. They develop the characters and give us a plethora of quotable lines. We understand the characters which in turn makes the climax more interesting, because we are invested in what happens.<br/><br/>Hitchcock said that the most exciting part of an action scene is not the gunshot, but what leads up to the gunshot. Hateful Eight is the perfect example of this and is the definition of a slow build. Since this is a Tarantino film, we know that something bad is going happen, we just don't know when, where, or why. As the film progressed, I was on the edge of my seat from one scene to the next. <br/><br/>In rare form for Tarantino, the film has a deep political message that is incredibly topical today. The post-Civil War setting enhances the racial tensions and there is more than one scene addressing race in America that is still relevant today. While it is not a focal point of the film, it adds another layer to a movie that is full of them,<br/><br/>While the length may be an issue for some, I didn't even notice it. I was engaged from beginning to end with The Hateful Eight and the three-hour runtime felt like two.<br/><br/>Hateful Eight is required viewing for fans of the crime and western genre. If you have even a remote interest in Tarantino films, then you've probably already seen Hateful Eight. If not, then take a few hours out of your day to watch a future classic."

","Now, I'm not writing this review to be ""helpful"". I'm just voicing my opinion on it as a whole. I stumbled upon this title on Netflix with hardly any knowledge of it, the actors involved, or even its plot. <br/><br/>The beginning was somewhat strange, but the setting was somewhat immersive to me, so I stuck with watching it. As the plot thickened and the characters became more involved with each other, I found it kind of hard to get out of my seat for the nearly 3 hours that the movie was on.<br/><br/>The suspenseful events that unfold during the movie (especially when it came down to the mystery aspect) really kept my mind focused, and got me involved with the character portrayal and each of their roles in this tiny cabin that most of it takes part in. The gruesome and ""expected-but-unexpected"" things that happen during this film didn't distract me from the rest of the plot, and kept engaged and focusing on what would happen next. <br/><br/>I will say that if you're just looking for a shoot-em-up western that involves a team of heroes, this is not a movie meant for you. If you can grasp hold of what's going on in the film and take the tiny details into consideration given the fact that it's a mystery that revolves heavily around the characters, I think you'll like the movie."

"benkitching13","8","0","1","18 July 2018"," Tarantino's delightfully twisted western tale.
","8.5 out of 10 for clarification. <br/><br/>The Hateful Eight continues Quentin Tarantino's trend of historical films by immersing the viewer in post civil war Wyoming to weave the bloody tale of strangers meeting up in a remote cabin during a blizzard. Tarantino's signature use of varied and extravagant characters is present here, and on the whole the excellent performances match these abstract personalities. Similarly, his use of extensively bloody, stylised violence is just as effective and compelling as in Pulp Fiction and the film retains his distinctive non linear plot structure. Also, the score is considered but not as compelling as the excellent soundtracks featured in in his previous films. The film gains momentum and peaks during the spectacular final act. However, the lack of his trademark sharp and quotable dialogue is a distressing omission that threatens to jeopardize his 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Overall, The Hateful eight marks a slight decline in quality from Tarantino's most impressive efforts (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), but is still an accomplished film"

This is a fantastic film, it does everything right. The storytelling and the acting is what really stands out here. This film is told in chapters, and each chapter is essential to the overall story. Samuel L. Jackson gives an incredible performance here, ofcourse he never phones it in, but this performance is especially strong. The other one that really shines here is Jennifer Jason Leigh, she really shows her great acting abilities here as Daisy. Very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. The other cast members do great too, very focused and committed. The film is a claustrophobic western mystery film. I love that the film is vague and doesn't give you much to go off of.

"vovaparkour","10","0","1","3 July 2018"," Fantastic Characters and Writing, NOT an Action Flick
","Ok real talk, anybody giving this movie anything under a 5 is absolutely tripping balls, the kind of person who only watches Fast and Furious and Triple X, and thinks that movies like The Purge and 50 Shades of Grey are classics and standards for storytelling. How can this movie be under average, even when judged purely by ""was I entertained or not?"" Movies like The Room are rated 3-4, and yet this high quality film is getting 1-3 stars. WTF.<br/><br/>As for my 10/10, I understand that raises skepticism, but what it comes down to for me, like all of you, is whether I was highly entertained or not, and for me to be entertained I need great dialogue and great characters. And this movie has fantastic characters and fantastic dialogues. And every moment throughout this movie I was captivated and wanted to know what was going to happen next. AND, it is NOT predictable. This movie navigates the complex space of 8+ characters whose fates have overlapped in a small outpost during a blizzard, and as the story unfolds so do, in parallel, the complex personalities and relationships these characters have with each other. For some pasts are intertwined, for others the future, and for everyone the present. Not one of these characters is good or bad, they are just people with their own motives, life experiences and understandings. <br/><br/>I think that those people saying that there are strong political undertones in this movie, they are just projecting and it's something they've carried with themselves into this viewing experience. I did not even think there was anything like that until I read some reviews on here. All I saw a story told in a snapshot of time.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this movie -- reserve an evening, put your phones and distractions away, turn the lights and noises off, and hit the play button."

","In the wild west shortly after the U.S. Civil War, an oddball gang of characters end up sharing space in a stagecoach lodge during a wicked Wyoming blizzard. They include bounty hunters, a wanted murderer, an alleged sheriff, an alleged hangman, a former Confederate general, and other mysterious guests who arise suspicion. The movie is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>In regard to movie storytelling and execution, I have little doubt that Tarantino is a genius. I also have little doubt that he is a sadist.<br/><br/>His films can end up with different results depending on how much the mean-spirited violence overwhelms his brilliance. When the violence was minimal (that is, in Tarantino terms), the brilliance clearly won out with the creation of such great films as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Inglorious Basterds"", and ""Django Unchained"".<br/><br/>Then, there were the two movies in the ""Kill Bill"" series where the violence was often sickening and overwhelming. This situation recurs in ""The Hateful Eight"".<br/><br/>Firstly, the pluses of which there are many:<br/><br/>With the aid of music by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by Robert Richardson, Tarantino succeeds in evoking a hell-on-earth created by its inhabitants.<br/><br/>Storywise, there are many moments of mystery, plot twists, suspense, and extended moments of tense dialogue. While Tarantino's stories are always filled with violence, they are always engaging. And most of all, compared to many other screenwriters, his stories are always understandable. They can be complex without being confusing.<br/><br/>There are two frequents sources of criticism about this movie but I will actually come to the movie's defense. One is that the movie is too long especially in the middle. I agree that it could have been shortened but the tension was always present in the middle scene leading the viewer to believe (rightly so) that this was only a build-up.<br/><br/>The other criticism was against the inclusion of a scene that is a flashback. I felt this scene added to the film's impact. It helped solve the mystery of the backgrounds of some of the characters. It also allowed us to see other characters who had previously been spoken of only in reference. The best part of the scene is that it provided us with kind and friendly characters who interacted well with others. This was a welcome respite from the uniformly vile characters that infested the movie's first half.<br/><br/>And the acting is great. Standout performances come from Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Bruce Dern.<br/><br/>It's in the end when things get overly brutal and mean-spirited especially the fate of one character who had already been subject to an excess of degradation. The act itself and the image of its aftermath were hard to get out of my mind well after the movie's end. I guess it's now time for a schlocky rom-com to rebalance my senses."

","The Hateful Eight (2015) 
Ty Barron<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is a western cinematographic masterpiece not for the faint of heart. Quentin Tarantino has been a polarizing presence in the film industry since hitting the scene with his first big movie, Reservoir Dogs, in 1992. Since then, he has solo directed and released nine movies each as polarizing as the next, and along the way has carved his own style into the world of film. Tarantino's most recent release, The Hateful Eight, is two hours and forty-seven minutes full of intricate interwoven plots with many moving pieces, a good deal of humor, and of course in classic Tarantino fashion, an abundance of violence. <br/><br/>The film's cast stars familiar faces with pieces of Tarantino's trademark ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern. It also includes marvelous performances from younger actress Jennifer Jason Leigh and actor Channing Tatum who play sister and brother. The entirety of the movie takes place during a blizzard in Wyoming a few years after the Civil War, mainly in a haberdashery where eight strangers stay the night waiting for the storm to pass. Kurt Russell plays John The Hangman Ruth, a bounty hunter taking the prized murderer, Daisy Domergue played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, to Red Rock Wyoming on the other side of the mountain during the blizzard when they come across Samuel L. Jackson's character, Major Marquis Warren, coincidentally another bounty hunter, stranded in the storm. A little ways later the group comes across the self proclaimed new sheriff of Red Rock Chris Mannix, played by Walton Goggins, stuck in the storm as well. Including the stagecoach driver, the four seek shelter in the haberdashery where four other men already reside. Each character has a mysterious story and they soon learn that things may not be quite as they appear.<br/><br/>Many people will criticize the movie for having only one true female character. The treatment of the character Daisy Domergue in the movie does not help as she is constantly bloodied and literally chained to Kurt Russell's wrist, perhaps Tarantino is hinting at something larger here with the handcuffs as well. However, she is the true fire of the plot as everything that happens in the film revolves around her. Tarantino has received backlash in the past for sexist characters however in movies such as Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and now The Hateful Eight, he has shown that female characters are the equivalent to the male characters in his movies as their roles are important lead ones that could really be played by a man or a woman and there would be no difference in the overall movie. Additionally, the gender of Daisy is never even explicitly brought up or explored as her role in the grand scheme of things is so much larger. <br/><br/>The writing of the film is exquisite as Samuel L. Jackson's Major Marquis Warren bares strikingly similar personality traits to his character Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction. It is almost as if Jules Winnfield hopped in a time machine and was transported to the years following the civil war with the identity of Major Warren. Just like in Pulp Fiction, Jackson's character is quick-witted, cunning, and a definite sharp shooter. Those who are fans of Tarantino's work in Pulp Fiction will most certainly find themselves quickly in love with the character of Major Marquis Warren. Furthermore there were rumors that Tarantino originally wanted The Hateful Eight to be a sequel to Django Unchained which certainly would have been intriguing, however he realized that it would not work. This may have been for the better though because if that was the case then the entire audience would have been missing Samuel L. Jackson's magnificent performance which is the pure magic of the movie and it is as if he was born to play this role. <br/><br/>What really makes the movie is the location and setting. The constant blizzard and the warm haberdashery in the middle of nowhere provides a highly unique cozy, yet mysterious feel. The true genius of the film is the fact that it takes place all in one room, with primarily only eight characters. With flashbacks, there is a total count of sixteen character appearances in the film but mostly, as the title implies, there are only eight real characters. The single location and few characters make the movie feel more like a magnificent stage play in all the right ways. The isolation allows the audience to become lost in the film and get sucked into feeling that they are right there in the haberdashery themselves. The elongated dialogue between characters helps to facilitate this feeling as each word is skillfully written to each character and captivates the audience dying to hear what is coming next. <br/><br/>At the end of the day this is still a Tarantino movie, and a phenomenal one at that. The pure visual aspect of the film is unparalleled and out of this world. From the majestic horses in the thick, bright, white snow storm to the blood splattered lodge, everything is done in artistic perfection. The opening scene is a beautiful wide angle pan shot of the vast mountainous area of Wyoming and then transitions to a close up shot that zooms out on a statue of Jesus Christ on the Cross, covered in snow in the middle of the frozen tundra. The juxtaposition of the gorgeous landscape with the statue of a frozen Christ is an excellent demonstration of Tarantino's unique approach to film as he constantly places something stunning and divine next to something more ominous and darker, allowing the later to be projected in a light equal to the beauty of its counterpart. While at times it can be a bloody mess, it is a beautiful mess. The inordinance of violence and blood is expected when walking into a Quentin Tarantino directed movie. The borderline gore adds to the masterful cinematographic work of the film and makes it an art piece all on its own. <br/><br/>The plot is sophisticated, the violence is over the top, and the characters are wicked. The movie is everything an audience member wants. So far from reality, yet so dangerously close at the same time. Full of bounty hunters, hangmen, cowboys, union and confederate soldiers, gang members the film has everything that excites and sends shocking chills up the spine while keeping the viewer on their toes for its entirety.<br/><br/>Rating: 9"

","Typical Tarantino movie, divided into different chapters, flashback and a climax.
With all that avoidable gore in second half, something tells me this guy is a big fan of Horror genre. Only he doesn't make much Horror movies but adds some horror spice with all that gore.
A bullet shot to head with some distance, will kill you, but not blow away your skull like a pumpkin, splattering all insides out. <br/><br/>Except for a few flaws the movie is good and enjoyable. 
Like John Ruth, when he first vomited blood and Daisy was thumping her arms on desk like she knew something was going to happen, he should have shot her there itself. That was no time to play an idealistic hangman. Instead he got shot by Daisy. <br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson's character, Warren, was the smartest of all. Also he was very well acquainted with Minnie's place. So he should have known that there is a basement there. He and John Ruth, when they were disarming everyone, he should have told him about basement and they should have checked it out. <br/><br/>Also, he was suspicious of Bob the Mexican right from first. Perhaps he knew that something happened to Minnie and others there. Still he didn't checked out the basement. 
And he should have shot all three Bob, Joe and Oswaldo at the same time. After seeing what happened to John Ruth and OB, there was no question that it is a set up. Sheriff was a sheriff in waiting and himself came close to drinking that coffee. 
Warren should have used Daisy as a hostage to lure out her brother or any other accomplices.<br/><br/>End, when they hang Daisy, Warren got his balls shot and could barely move or walk and Mannix also was shot in leg and could barely walk. Yet they were able to hang her or wanted to hang her. A bullet to head would have been more practical and also feasible. <br/><br/>Movie is enjoyable, but should have been a bit shorter. If you you want to watch it again, obviously its length would be a deterrent."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","0","1","14 May 2018"," An ominous and pervasively tense chamber piece; Tarantino's best work in years.
","'The Hateful Eight (2016)' is Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction by far, an ominous chamber piece that's slow-paced yet utterly captivating. Even its loose, strange and ultimately wholly unnecessary first carriage-confined hour is an entertaining experience, though it pales in comparison to what happens when we arrive at the cabin. There are no traditional heroes, no-one's intention's are clear and their morals are dubious at best. A pervasive tension builds throughout, ultimately keeping you on the edge-of-your-seat until it reaches its explosively violent, cruel and oddly inevitable climax. Its only real flaw is the way it conforms to the director's odd need to use a partially non-linear narrative, even when it really doesn't add anything to the plot and actually slows it down significantly. 8/10"
"kaustubh-rajnish","8","0","1","10 May 2018"," What makes Tarantino great
","Tarantino is perhaps the most important director of our generation. And when he makes a film you have to go see it. <br/><br/>Most QT fans including me have been often at a loss of words to explain that what is so great about his movies. His films are about shallow people doing shallow things, highly stylized and lack any real social/political messages or even insights into human behavior. They are well....pulp fiction. <br/><br/>Much in the same vein is his eighth film - The Hateful Eight(THE). It has all the elements of vintage Tarantino - stylized violence, bad language, Excessive use of the n word, expressive dialogues, Mexican stand offs, 'cue cool music', red apple cigarettes (this time tobacco) and yes...Samuel L Jackson. <br/><br/>While watching THE I finally realized what is it that makes QT great or the legend that he is. Let me explain with a scene. Sam Jackson's character hands a letter from Abe Lincoln to Kurt Russell. As Kurt reads from the letter the glow from the letter lights up his face. This is not actual glow but the sheer yellow tinge that the letter throws up on his face. This is old school film making done exceptionally well. <br/><br/>It's as if someone saw all possible forms of cinema ever shot in this world and decided to take the best parts and then make their movie. The result has to be gold. <br/><br/>And The Hateful Eight very much is.<br/><br/>The plot is simple - a bounty hunter called as the Hangman is taking a notorious gangster (Jennifer Jason Leigh in an Oscar worthy performance) to hang in the town of Red Rock. On his way he meets another familiar bounty hunter who is stranded and a mysterious guy who claims to be the next sheriff of Red Rock. The 4 of them then head to a haberdashery only to meet 4 other strangers who all don't seem to be who they claim to be.
So the eight + the stagecoach driver are now stuck together in this house while a blizzard unleashes outside. One by one as expected things begin to go wrong. <br/><br/>The film has not much of a political message as some critics have enthused it to have. Nor does it have any social messages. It is plain old pulp fiction told so entertainingly that you will not realise it has a 3 hour + running time. <br/><br/>QT fans dont miss it. QT haters never too late to convert. <br/><br/>Catch it on the big screen in 70 MM Panavision :)"

","Eight characters are holed up in a shack together in a blizzard. Not all of them are who they profess to be. Even as a premise, this strikes one more as a stage play than as a film. And the confined spaces and dialogue-reliant plot only further detract from any cinematic experience. A stagecoach stops to pick up a potential passenger. A long dialogue exchange ensues. Then there is another passenger, and another long exchange. Then the four passengers in the stagecoach have a long conversation. They finally arrive at the layover station, where four more travellers await them, and lots and lots of long conversations. This endless jabbering is bad enough, except it is not very funny or dramatic. It's all a bit bland. Samuel L. Jackson going on tediously about stew, long past the mark where everyone got the point, is one egregious example. It is also symptomatic of how the audience is either way ahead and waiting for the film to catch up, or 'surprised' by some revelation that we don't really care about. In sum, this is one of the worst scripts to make it to film in decades."

","The story takes place outside of Red Rock Wyoming, post Civil War. During a blizzard 9 people are held up at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stage coach stop. The people there are in natural conflict with each other as they fought on both sides of the Civil War.<br/><br/>Without ruining the plot, the 9 characters are:<br/><br/>1) Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) is a bounty hunter. He was three dead people with him. He fought in the Civil War and has a reputation among southerners who placed a bounty on him. He carries with him a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Everyone distrusts him because he is black...or that other word they use.
2) John ""the hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is another bounty hunter. He has with him a live $10,000 bounty and is paranoid about people wanting to take her.
3) Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is the bounty. She is very unlady like and frequently gets punched in the mouth.
4) Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) is the son of a southern raider. He claims he is on his way to Red Rock to be its new sheriff. No one believes him either.
5) Bob (Demian Bichir) is a Mexican who cares for Minnie's Haberdashery while Minnie is away visiting her mom. Warren distrusts him from the start.
6) Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is a nice cultured Brit on his way to Red Rock to be the hangman.
7) Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowpoke trying to get back home. Pretty much keeps to himself.
8) General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a confederate general known to Major Warren. He tries to be quiet. He is in Wyoming to create a grave marker for his missing son, presumed dead.
9) OB Jackson (James Parks) is the stage coach driver and most likely is not part of the titled 8, but he is there anyway.<br/><br/>This is typical Quentin Tarantino. The film is filled with blood, killing, twists, flashback, dark humor, and even a mystery with clues. Agatha Christie lives on and is rolling over in her grave.<br/><br/>Guide- F-bomb, N-word.

","WARNING SPOILERS!
The Hateful Eight uses everything I love in a film, all in one, from the realism in dialogue, to the gore and blood, there is nothing quite like a Tarantino (Director/Writer) film! From the beginning we are introduced uniquely to characters through John Ruth's (Kurt Russel) carriage journey through a snowy wasteland, taking Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to hang at Blackrock for her crimes. As soon as Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) encounters John Ruth, we can immediately identify it is a Tarantino movie, through the use of heavy, intense and realistic dialogue. Although profane words are used throughout the film, with majority having a racist context, it shows us as an audience the lifestyle as an African American and a Caucasian American after the American Civil War. Throughout the movie there is so much tension that exists in that small compact bar, with events such as the poisoning of the tea to who killed Dave, which all leads up to the bloodbath we witness towards the end of the film, which was exhilarating! Along with the twists and mystery to what is occurring throughout the film, it kept me as an audience and as an aspiring filmmaker entertained for 3 hours, which is hard to do with modern films. The only downside to Hateful Eight was there wasn't as much action and gore as Tarantino's other films like Django Unchained, so due to this, I give it a 9/10! Worth the watch!"

","The movie ""The Hateful Eight"" is set in a time period shortly after the civil war. A small group of travelers with a bounty hunter Kurt Russell (John Ruth), his driver James Parks (O.B.), with his prisoner Jennifer Leigh (Daisy Domergue) is out on the countryside of Wyoming and is trying to get to shelter before a great blizzard leaves them for dead in the freezing cold. Shortly after the start they run across a stranded bounty hunter on the run Samuel L Jackson (Major Marquis Warren) and the New Sheriff of Red Rock Walton Goggins (Sheriff Chris Mannix). They are all trying to get to a small cabin Minnie's Haberdashery, which is like a small bed and bath which is conveniently the last stop before getting to the main town of Red Rock, WY. 
As the come to the bed and bath where they are going to be in for a couple of days, things seemed to nice and quaint or are they? After being shacked up there in Minnie's Haberdashery for a couple of days some things become unraveled inside that shack especially after the owner is inconspicuously absent. Some of the other patrons that was part of the haberdashery had some of their true colors come out though out the movie. The major theme of this movie is that everything my not be what they seemed. So be careful viewer for what you may seemed to be the truth may not be. There are lies, untruths and deceit in this great action film. 
The Domergue gang is trying to link back up with Daisy, sister of Channing Tatum (Jody Domergue). The rest of the characters in the haberdashery are a long haired cowboy Michael Madsen (Joe Gage), a smooth talking British Tim Roth (Oswaldo Mobray), a Mexican helper Demian Bichir (Bob), and an old confederate general Bruce Dern (General Sandy Smithers). These characters are intertwined in an interesting story of some bounty hunters, town folk, and a treacherous gang almost as close to the same theme as ""Who kill Mr. Clue?""
Quentin Tarantino does a great job of telling his story by using flashbacks and character development in this movie. The use of flashback helps you get the back story in this movie. About halfway during the movie the viewer fully understands the story and how some of the characters may or may not show their hands to each other before we get into the gory action-packed movie Tarantino is known for. Tarantino also use of character development give you more clues about the intent or each character all the way through out movie especially when you finally find out the truth about the Abraham Lincoln Letters. This movie will keep you interested all the way to the end with its plot twist and deceit in this action pack instant classic. Sit back, relax but don't pass judgement to quickly you may or may not be wrong."

Samuel L Jackson is phenomenal in his role once again, but nearly everybody is great in TH8, even presenting a guest appearance by Channing Tatum. 
The plot is again perfectly mixed in this asymmetrical way that the story is presented, everything makes sense and every detail comes into play.

","When the director makes a masterpiece full of beauty and transcends the boundaries to be a mixture of violence and bold words and racist tyranny is undoubtedly a way out to carry out his imagination, a scourge of critics and Oscars.
Tarantino is looking beyond the crown and it is inconceivable that Tarantino is looking for the Oscars. The academic prize may be of specific standards and adherence to it will help win the nomination and win. This is not a match for Tarantino. He defies the standards of his unbridled imagination and makes him in a traditional boxed frame. Tarantino is his talent.<br/><br/>Genius Scenario ..
The clever scenario in The Hateful Eight takes the viewer on a thrilling three-hour trip reminiscent of the films produced in the mid-1960s by the Western Spring director Sergio Leone.
Dialogue here can never be predicted. Tarantino's clever, intelligent dialogue makes the viewer puzzled and inquired and then smoothly and pleasantly brings together the parties to the dialogue to come as viewers to the heart of the story without any sense of amazement in the story. It is difficult to find dialogue in the film going in one direction is a dialogue full of side texts outside the main story, which is no less in the beauty of the original text.<br/><br/>Acting is one of the reasons for the film's success ..
In each scene, there is mutual creativity, especially actor Tim Roth, who mentioned us in this film in the manner and performance of actor Christopher Waltz, and as a friend told me that the role was originally for actor Waltz before that Now assigns to Tim Roth. Samuel Jackson's outstanding performance, especially in Tarantino's films, was also known as violence does not care for anyone who talks continuously without interrupting dialogues and if anger uses his weapon without hesitation.
Let's not forget the ideal choice of actor Kurt Russell as the prize hunter because the actor's character and his image are terribly suited to Western fashion and here lies the beauty of his choice of role.
Finally, actress Jennifer Jason, who was able to perform a performance that impressed many critics, represented a difficult role to play, a role full of brutality, indifference and even insult, yet she took this role assigned to her Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Enio Morikoni and the Sondtrak.
Since the film begins, you will be back in time for five decades, as if you were watching a sixties movie, and do not forget that he was the same person who made that music at that time.<br/><br/>Moriconi takes you with the capsule of time to the past. Classic music at a quiet pace was only a prelude to an epic of musical interludes. The musical interludes are reminiscent of the grand piano. During the long conversation between Major Marquez and General Smithers, Daisy ""after the"" poison ""scene.
And most important of all is that wonderful music on the horse scene is dragging the cart, the lens of the output that focuses on the legs of the horses and then move beautifully to the faces of horses and behind the snow covered trees interspersed with sunlight .. At the beginning of this scene precisely and smoothly blends beautiful music with songs The sound of women has long been one of the foundations of the genius Inino Moriconi in his works, to become a scene that is not more than a few seconds one of the most beautiful cinematic scenes that I have seen in the cinema, and everyone who saw the film will undoubtedly admire this wonderful scene mixed between the creative cinematography and Saundtrak.<br/><br/>
A musician who began to write music for the cinema since the end of the fifties and until now after the passage of nearly 60 years and the same tender with the same creativity deserves all respect.<br/><br/>The unknown soldier !?
Have you considered those beautiful scenes in the film? How beautiful it was in terms of camera distance and angles.
All this is left behind by an unknown soldier who has always made many of these beautiful scenes in his constant cooperation with Tarantino, but he does not know much, and this is often due to the habit of many film lovers to focus on the director, actors and sometimes writers.
One of the most intriguing scenes in the film was nominated for nine Oscars and three of them, the cinematographer Robert Richardson.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>Scenes of violence !!
Many of the many violent scenes in the film are the only negative point in the film in general. But the truth is that Tarantino is no longer just a shot of death, but a negation of the reality of the killing scene.
Who knows Tarantino well not surprised by the amount of violence repeated in the film because the history of the director has always seen his preference for violence as in the film Pulp Fiction and even inglourious bastards and finally Django.<br/><br/>finally
The film is a masterpiece that has emerged in a time when films are no longer as they were before, the collection of successful film elements from many aspects, and make sure that The Hateful Eight will be one of the beautiful films that we are going back to watching as we do now with old movies.
Tarantino, through his works, assures us once again that he does not enjoy receiving an Oscar or other prize, as he enjoys seeing his imagination embodied on the ground through a film."
"carsonhuelle","8","0","1","17 January 2018"," Tarantino Strikes Again
","Quentin Tarantino, the man that has yet to make a bad film strikes yet again. The Hateful Eight is arguably up there with some of his best work. The reasoning that this film is up with his best is because he finally used an original score. The problem I have had with some of Tarantino's previous films is the soundtrack that is provided has acted as a, ""Best Hits"" put on shuffle. But no, this time around Tarantino hits on all categories. The performances that he gets out of his actors, especially Samuel L. Jackson reminds us what cinema is all about. Getting lost in the world that is provided. For not one second did I think to myself, ""Man, Kurt Russell is killing it!"". This never appeared in my mind because the costume design, makeup and script gave all these actors a new identity. Because of this, I was lost for the entirety of the 3 hour film. Not to mention, shooting this on 70mm was a nice touch and gave the film some beautiful wide shots. The issues that I have with this film are little but bother me because if you erase them, you could have a potential masterpiece. For one, a song that is not apart of the original score is played towards the beginning of the film and because of how 21st century it felt I was taken out of the setting. Along with that, towards the end of the movie where Samuel L. Jackson gets shot I was a little disturbed. Not by the blood, but by the heavy usage of slow motion. He used the same slow motion in Django Unchained and it bothered me there too. If he changed these details I would have been even happier leaving this film.<br/><br/>Besides the little knit-picks, Tarantino shocked me yet again with another brilliant film. I would recommend this film to only few people because of the long run time and ""R"" rating that it is. Sit back and enjoy yourself if you are a movie geek like me."

The set up is slow and deliberate but superbly done."
"nicmadsuperbad","8","0","1","2 January 2018"," The Hateful Great
","*zero spoilers*<br/><br/>The beauty of Tarantino films has always been in their writing. The master class filmmaker has a unique way of turning even the most bland events into thought-provoking moments filled with everyday dialogue viewers can identify with. It is this craft for scripting that Tarantino films take hold, without the need for fancy set pieces, or blockbuster effects. The singular stories and events told within each film are just as entertaining as the ultimate whole they come together to create. It is through this facet that Tarantino succeeds again with his eighth feature film, appropriately titled, The Hateful Eight.<br/><br/>The film follows several characters (more than eight, but not all primary) as they ultimately converge together one snowy night in Western Wyoming, each with different motivations. Accusations and bullets soon fly in a who-done-it caper that, while not the biggest twist ending, finalizes itself in a climactic stand-off of Tarantino proportions.<br/><br/>This film embodies what we've expected of Tarantino films over the past two decades: interesting characters on relatively simple paths interacting with one another through non-linear story lines in a fantastically imagined alternate reality. As always, expect values to be tested in forms of racism, sexism, vulgarity, and morality, but of course his inclusion of these topics is always meant to draw emotion from the characters and audience. Although some instances within The Hateful Eight are hit or miss depending on your ideas surrounding social constructs, it's all done with good intentions, and not meant to offense. Then again, if you're a viewer that finds themselves often offended at film subjects, for any reason, Tarantino films are clearly not for you. <br/><br/>While not as conspiracy inspiring as Pulp Fiction, or Western driven as Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight still stands on its own as another success in the Tarantino library. Those that enjoy their clever conversation with a side of gratuitous violence will find this more than appealing.<br/><br/>-W"
"gavinp9","7","0","1","2 January 2018"," A little long and overwrought, but still a good Western/'whodunit'
","Much like 'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will be linked, 'The Hateful Eight' and 'The Revenant' will be linked in my mind, due to the fact that they're both set in 19th century wintry American Northwest (this time Wyoming), both nominated for Oscars (although 3 vs 12, with the only overlap being cinematography - probably have to go to 'The Revenant' instead) and both released in January. And while they're similar - and both pretty good - neither is definitely better than the other, and neither is quite as great as it could have been.<br/><br/>This is, obviously, Tarantino's 8th film, but it annoyed me that for the majority of the film, there's nine people trapped in the cabin, even though the posters and title refer to the eight of them! O.B. (Parks - 4th Tarantino film), the stagecoach driver, doesn't rate a mention? He has some of the funniest moments in the film! Only Tarantino can have a film starring 'eight' characters and end up with 14 bodies, with some characters still alive at the end! The eight main characters are:
 - Marquis Warren (Jackson - 6th Tarantino film), former Yankee Major, now bounty hunter;
 - John Ruth (Russell - 2nd Tarantino film), a bounty hunter with a great moustache;
 - Daisy Domergue (Jason Leigh - 1st Tarantino film), Ruth's bounty he's taking to hang;
 - Chris Mannix (Goggins - 2nd Tarantino film), the new Sheriff of Red Rock;
 - Oswaldo Mobray (Roth - 3rd Tarantino film), a British hangman;
 - Senor Bob (Bichir - 1st Tarantino film), the Mexican innkeeper;
 - Joe Gage (Madsen - 3rd Tarantino film), a raspy-voiced loner cowboy; and
 - Sandy Smithers (Dern - 2nd Tarantino film), former Confederate General.<br/><br/>Feels a little like Tarantino started with a joke: ""a black war hero, a Mexican, an Englishman, a Kiwi and a racist walk into a bar..."" and went from there! Once all eight are trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery due to the blizzard, the mystery of who's who - and where Minnie is - is slowly uncovered, with trust in short supply. Starts very slow - particularly the titles, with Tarantino using his classic colouring and sound to show everyone involved in the film before it can properly start. It's long (2 hours 45min), but not ridiculously so - however, you could probably take out 30min from the start/middle and have a better-paced film. Morricone's score is good, and the cinematography looks great when they're out in the mountains and snow, but over 75% of the film is shot inside the cabin, where it's dark!<br/><br/>Takes a while to really get going, but once it does, there's plenty of blood (hence the R-rating), as the truth is uncovered. Jackson is great and the main star, while Russell does a fantastic John Wayne impersonation - his voice cadence and over-bearing attitude are spot on - and Jason Leigh is fun to watch as the vile and racist criminal. The real stand-out, though, is Goggins as the seemingly inept Sheriff - he plays his part with clear relish and gets a few laughs and gets to show some heart underneath his racist exterior. While 'The Hateful Eight' is very enjoyable in parts, I didn't enjoy it anywhere as much as 'Django Unchained' or 'Inglorious Basterds'."

","After rescuing two strange characters from the bitter cold, a bounty hunter and his slave seek shelter from the upcoming blizzard in a remote cabin, where he meets a bunch of other weird people, each with a secret of his own. In order to collect the bounty for his slave, he'll have to take some extra security measures which might help him overcome the dangers to come, while the other characters will be full of surprises for him to uncover.<br/><br/>It's a very atmospheric movie, set in a wild and freezing mountain environment, full of unexpected events and complex characters which keeps you eager to discover the next move, never letting you get bored, although it is not as action filled as I was expecting. It manages to maintain a sober atmosphere despite its amusing dark comedy moments, slowly uncovering its mysteries for your pleasure and amazement. I really enjoyed it despite its duration (~3 hours), and although it could have contained a bit more action and not focus so much on lengthy dialogues which tend to feel like fillers, it proved to be a very good watch. Its actors really contribute to this achievement through their wonderful and convincing performance, making this one yet another great from Quentin Tarantino."

"avamayrooney","8","0","1","16 December 2017"," A Better Kind of Different
","I was pleasantly surprised with this film. I hadn't heard much about it and watched it only knowing Tarantino was the director - which is maybe why I liked it more than the other reviews, I had lower expectations. I also watched it from the comfort of my sofa which is also probably why the film's length didn't bother me as much.<br/><br/>Pros: Good (albeit a lot of) dialogue, good cinematography and good acting. I liked the ""who dunnit"" element, the chapters and watching the characters think. I like the character development and backstories. I liked that there didn't need to be too much theatrics or action because the storyline itself was good enough. It wasn't over the top like I find some of QT's films, the characters did all the work. I found it engaging, maybe the production resembles too much of Reservior Dogs, but maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. <br/><br/>Cons: A QT film, so there's a lot of blood, violence and gore, as to now be expected (although still not everyones cup of tea.) Another QT trademark as other reviews have mentioned is the excessive use of the 'n word'. A lot is left massively unaswered and some just plain baffling such as the random narrator."
"lmgaland","5","0","1","14 December 2017"," Subpar
","This movie is trash compared to what the cast and production cast is capable of. Everyone needs to get off terentino's dick and watch the film for what it is.

"gwen-27","1","0","2","10 December 2017"," Long boring film wastes good actors
","Having finally watched the film, I am reminded that Quentin Tarantino lacks the directorial excellence of John Ford and Sam Peckinpah or the writing ability of Agatha Christie, making the film an unsuccessful mishmash of Stagecoach, Straw Dogs and Ten Little N*****s (the book was subsequently entitled 'And then there were none'). At least in 1939, Agatha Christie's readers would not have been as offended by the constant use of the word, as it came from a UK nursery rhyme; with Stagecoach, 1939 cinema audiences were treated to superb acting including an Oscar win and the 70s saw a streak of highly violent films, which were groundbreaking then. This film has none of these attributes – it is long, boring, farcical and wastes good actors and superb scenery in buckets of fake blood and repetitive swearing."
"StarWarsMoviesSuck","8","0","1","8 December 2017"," I liked it
","H8 is a strange movie. It doesn't have anything that I would consider plot twists; it takes place in chapters and has more of a 'and now for the rest of the story' type of attitude. <br/><br/>The movie can basically be summed up as a remake of The Thing, but instead of the drama occurring between trustworthy men of average to high character, H8 takes place between men (and a woman) of exceedingly low character. It's also darkly humorous in contrast to the seriousness of J.Carpenter's masterpiece.<br/><br/>I think what makes the movie for me is the ending. *SPOILER* The finale shows the two most diametrically opposed characters, mortally wounded, putting aside their hatred, forging a common bond as they mete out a final 'frontier' form of justice before their final breaths are taken. <br/><br/>Although it's bleak and bloody, H8 gave me a sense of hope at the end, a feeling that camaraderie, nobility and honor can discovered and upheld by even immoral men in the most immoral times."
"tyson-hunsaker","7","0","1","27 November 2017"," Tarantino's murder mystery-like western epic.
","""The Hateful Eight"" is Quentin Tarantino's western epic of several strangers together stranded in a cold cabin in the middle of Wyoming. As the tale gradually unfolds, each character reveals their past and anterior motives while the audiences continues guessing who's who.<br/><br/>The film understandably takes its time in establishing each character's personality and flavor to the mix. This makes practically every character feel essential to the story while still maintaining the pacing of the engrossing plot of delivering a prisoner to a nearby town to be hung. While the film may feel strangely different than what most are expecting due to its unlikely story structure and unusually long first act. The payoff at the end is well worth the wait. <br/><br/>Tarantino's decision to film on location and film on actual film stock created a beautiful, almost classic looking western feel to the movie. The visual landscape is breathtaking and combined with gorgeous cinematography, this may be one of the most beautiful looking films in the year of 2015. <br/><br/>With the exception of one or two scenes, the film is paced brilliantly. Making the three hour runtime feel like a breeze. The mood and tension and sense of paranoia feels reminiscent of John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film does get bogged down near the end with a lot of unnecessary graphic violence and gore which adds a shock value that sometimes takes away from certain plot elements. Normally this isn't a problem but it was slightly overdone in this picture. <br/><br/>At the end of the day though, this is a highly recommended Tarantino picture and one to genuinely study for quite some time. It's ambitious and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish."
"diogomanuel","8","0","1","27 November 2017"," One of the most realistic westerns I've ever seen!
","A great story that will surprise you till the very end despite being unfolded right before your very eyes. <br/><br/>Is it violent? Yes. Is the violence graphic? Yes. Is it unnecessary violent at times? Oh yes. Nevertheless, it can be enjoyable to watch as the violence is an integral part of the Wild West, and why this movie is only suited for a more mature audience.<br/><br/>Tarantino enjoys taking us to the middle of the action, and we feel part of the movie. We follow and understand the main characters, and we feel sometimes touched by their life's story. But life in the Wild West is harsh (and if we don't know this, we will figure it out pretty quickly).<br/><br/>It definitely is a movie worth watching and you won't even feel the time passing by."
"lucaspd-99044","9","0","1","24 November 2017"," Tarantino genius!
","Tarantino affirms a genius in this film with all his tastes. I found this mystery worthy of a story of Agatha Christie with Tarantinesque treatment. sensational. Technically the film is perfect, the photograph is beautiful, the use of the 70 mm is incredible, and some effects of makeup are simply incredible. The script of the film is very well developed, we have excellent dialogues, very characteristic of the Tarantino, the story is told with great calm, the slower pace helps the public to digest the story and try to solve the mystery. The film is really quite slow, in the first half of the film practically no action occurs, we are presented to the characters, all very well written and acted, the mystery letters are thrown at the table, we still take several discussions on different points of view on the Civil War (1861-1865). Even though the film is very slow in this first half, it is impossible to take the eye off the screen, as we see several discussions and a tension grow between the characters. Here we come to the second half of the film, where there is an abrupt change of tone. We had a slower first part where tension between the characters was developed but in the second part the movie explodes in a whirlwind utraviolent, where the characters enter a brutal confrontation in several scenes that shock even the strongest of the viewer.Even the focus of the film in this part is to show the violence, the mystery is not abandoned and remains the central factor of the plot. But this second part falls in quality compared to the first, especially when the film stops to explain what happened in the cabinet before the protagonists arrive. The scenes are good, but it takes the impact of the end of the film, which, while excellent, does not have the impact it should have. As already mentioned, the cast of the film is incredible, there is not a weak actor in the film, but Walton Goggins and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Oscar nominee for best supporting actress for that role), these two are the highlight of the film. Another thing that is praiseworthy is the Ennio Morricone (which won the Oscar for this film), which gives the whole tone of the film. I recommend that you watch this movie on the largest possible screen, to enjoy the beautiful photograph."

","Guys.. those of you who are specifically offended by the scene w/ the cowboy and the major's ""Johnson"" in the snow... are you sure you watched the whole movie? Everything about the Major's persona was 100% made up. He literally did not have a letter from Lincoln (hello, last line of the movie?). The old racist man was traveling to try to honor the memory of his dead son and find closure, so of course the number one way to bait him into pulling his firearm was to make up some horrible, twisted story about his death. C'mon people!<br/><br/>This movie had a ton of great one-liners, it really read as a play to me. I had this feeling I was watching some alternate reality version of Clue with the whole ""who done it"" angle, which by the way, the plot twist got me. <br/><br/>I thought it was in line with most Tarantino films - ya know, a ton of awful, sometimes evil people who are clever enough to be likable or at least hold your attention for almost THREE HOURS.

A usage to the point I became very bothered. <br/><br/>Look, I'm not so naive as to think that the N word wasn't used excessively and exclusively at the time period represented in this movie, but it is a movie. The writer, director or some other exec does have a say. I don't think it would be considered historically inaccurate to not use the N word; shoot, there were probably a dozen inaccuracies as it was. <br/><br/>Then again Quentin Tarantino seems to have an infatuation with the N word. From his superfluous usage in Pulp Fiction to Django Unchained it is unsettling. <br/><br/>Barring that entire discourse, the movie was decent."

","It's a flat stories, with no surprises, except a ""ahah you didn't expect this"" moment[1], because indeed we had no clue to expect it. But this surprise doesn't play more roles[2]. Nearly all the characters are secondary. They barely take actions[3]. I find the scenario poor also because the main character who does a detective job does it with clues that didn't occur in front of us. So it's cool, but with no real effect to us because we can only accept them. The movie isn't playing with the spectator here.

"jason_serrano-67702","7","0","1","21 August 2017"," Not Tarantino's best movie but a good ambiance.
","I found the dialogue wasn't as cool and stylized as previous Tarantino films so I've only given it a 07-10. But the atmosphere was great that cabin out in the snow. The movie has some great epic western score. The scene where Warren and Bob are setting up a rope line to the outside toilet reminded me a lot of a scene from The Thing 1982, even the music sounded a lot like John Carpenter's score for that movie (not a coincidence as Morricone and Russell both worked on that movie). In fact, there is a scene in H.E. where the music is, in fact, an exact copy of Morricone's score for The Thing. Tarantino must be a fan of that movie. H.E. has some of the same feel as The Thing, a bunch of people (mostly men) locked together in the snow and one or more are not who they appear to be. I thought Bob's Mexican accent was REALLY over the top and wondered why they couldn't get somebody to do a better accent turns out that the actor is actually Mexican! Warren's gloves are bad a#s. I always loved those big ol' white leather cavalry gloves when I was a kid. There are some fantastic tiny moments between Ruth and Domergue they are like an old married couple, manacled together, I thought that was really interesting (and even touching) he even cleans a little bit of stew off her cheek. The scene where they serve and eat the stew was probably my favourite. I love a good movie scene where people are sat around eating. I have got to get myself one of those big old wooden bowls and a wooden spoon for my cocido and fabada. That stew looked really tasty. Is the movie based on some real historical events and characters? I got the feeling that Tarantino was trying to create characters around actual events of the time. Lost a lot of respect for Michael Madsen (since his character in Reservoir Dogs) with his new haircut and the extra weight he just looked like a big ol' fat drag queen and not a tough guy. I thought the Tarantino narration halfway through was very forced, just didn't fit into the movie for me. Maybe that was typical in old western T.V. shows? Smithers was cool. If you haven't seen the movie Silent Running I recommend you watch that – It's a Sci Fi classic, with Bruce Dern a the main character. Definitely, a film that I am going to have to watch a few more times especially in the winter. It's quite possible that the score may go up on watching it again."

Even Tim Roth and Bruce Dern (both who I was looking forward to watching) are not enough to save this film. This is not at all like Django or Inglorious Basterds - both get a 10 from me.

The acting is wonderful, each actor, and i i mean every actor chews the scenery. I absolutely love this film. <br/><br/>The film stars Kurt Russell (Big Trouble in Little China) as John Ruth, a bounty hunter nicknamed ""THE HANGMAN"". Samuel L.Jackson (Pulp Fiction) plays the ex-slave turned bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren. Walton Goggins (Fandango Unchained) as Chris Manixx, a superbly racist supposed sheriff.

Micheal Madsen (Reservoir Dogs) plays Joe Gage, a mysterious ranch hand who is going home to see his mamma for Christmas, supposedly. Reverent actor Bruce Dern (Hang 'em' High) plays the amazingly racist ex-confederate general Sanford ""Don't Give a Damn"" Smithers, who has quite a rabid hatred with Marquis. Next we have Demián Bichir (Machete Kills) plays Bob The Mexican, a mild mannered supposed employee of the Local Haberdashery. Then there is Tim Roth (Pulp Fiction) as Oswaldo Mobray, a meek, sharply dressed British man who claims to be the local hangmen of the local town, Red Rock. And yes, quite a surprise, Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street) as Jody Domergue, the brother of Daisy. The actors in the film are wonderful. Kurt Russel and Samuel L. Jackson both kick ass in every scene they're in. Bruce Dern is great, i love seeing an actor of such a higher caliber sill acting. Walton Goggins performance is amazing, he is so believable and hilarious as Manixx.<br/><br/>The film is shot beautifully, the shots are so well composed and pretty. Thats one i love about all Quentin Tarantino films of the modern age. They are all so well beautifully crafted from a imagery and especially a story point. The film is full of twists and turns. The film is also very gory. it surely not as gory as the now classic spaghetti western Django Unchained. <br/><br/>The film has a visceral nature that i love. The violence, the acting, the photo-play, everything is great in the film. The film is beautiful, especially from a film making stand point is amazing.

I would point to plagiarism on someone's part however the close proximity to which both were released make it more like a wild coincidence. Then again Partridge Brady. Munsters Adams. These things do happen fast. Rather than put you through the drudgery of reading my lengthy treatise, I will put down my thoughts in note form. Bokeem Woodbine's character is very much like Samuel L. Jackson's character in his preference for the full hairdo and the quoting of brainy ideas..usually right before an execution. I know Hateful 8 and Fargo season 2, so allow me to get back on track. Both Fargo Season 2 and Hateful 8 have colorful villains who are both comic book like and terrifying. Both shows culminate in a bloodbath. Both have murders that take place, but then the scene cuts to the beginning where an unassuming, non-threatening voiced narrator attempts to give clarity or the mystery. The colored, ur... ah, African American gentleman in both features is an anti-hero who has definitive quirks that have allowed him to succeed despite being outnumbered and trifled with at every other turn for being a Colored, Ur..a...

","Am I the only one to state that the Emperor has no clothes? Why do people rave about Quentin's movies, when a good western remake like True Grit is lightyears better, and enjoyable to watch?<br/><br/>Quentin CANNOT make Westerns. This is evidenced first by his disastrous train wreck of Django. Now we have another western, again, teeming with black people and other bizarre out of place characters (a strange British fop) and out of place music.<br/><br/>This is a CLUE board game movie set in a cowboy snowbound cabin setting.<br/><br/>NOTHING about this movie makes any sense. The cabin itself is full of holes! The people inside have plenty of nails and lumber, as is evidenced by their insanely stupid 'door lock system' of hammering boards over the door every time someone comes in, yet they put zero effort into chocking up the many cracks and holes in the place.<br/><br/>The huge cast of black people, in a Wyoming set Western, makes absolutely no sense whatso-ever. Can someone tell me when it was finally legal for a black person to travel by stage coach? I'm guessing the 1930's? And only then with all-black stagecoaches and drivers?<br/><br/>So OK, this is a classic CLUE who-dunnit movie, set in a Western, with lots of quirky characters like Colonel Neo-nazi Mustard, Professor Hangman Plum, etc.. <br/><br/>And as that, it is very poorly done. We have very few clues to work with, no meat at all except wild speculation leading to executions in some parts. We have glaring stupidity in others, like a shady Mexican who would call himself 'Bob' to avoid suspicion?<br/><br/>The central focus of the violence and mayhem in this movie is an EXTREMELY UNCONVINCING Jen J. Leigh as a high level gang leader who is facing the noose if her bounty hunter owner can get her to the city. She does NOT carry this role at all, and comes across as a WITCH, especially when she is literally covered in blood-vomit and has her teeth smashed in to resemble a vampire, a get-up she wears for half the movie. She cackles a lot too. So clearly, Jen was channeling CARRIE. The movie also takes a completely unnecessary side duck into softcore domination porn, something Quentin relishes in, witness the end of Pulp Fiction, that should have earned this movie an NC-17 rating, but if it's QT, they write it up to 'art' and move on. It's not art, it's disgusting soft core domination porn, and completely unnecessary for the script and the movie.<br/><br/>The movie ends with some gratuitous death-porn as we watch the witch slowly get hoised up to the rafters with a noose, slowly choking to death as the 'heroes' laugh and joke about her.<br/><br/>In between we are treated to endless hours of plodding dialogue, punctuated by the odd gunshot. After Django I swore I'd never watch another Tarantino Western again, and thank god I saw this on TV."

","Great director. Excellent ensemble cast. Such a unique plot! Not to mention the 70 mm Panavision experience (in selected theaters).<br/><br/>With all this going for it, ""The Hateful Eight"" had all the elements to become one of those movies that excels in so many areas. On paper, by design, this movie had it all. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, everything the movie had going for it was squandered by the gratuitous violence embedded across multiple scenes.

","Blizzard weather conditions lead to eight strangers sharing the warmth of an outskirts cabin, including a bounty hunter suspicious that someone is planning to free his prisoner in this mystery thriller from Quentin Tarantino. It is highly atmospheric stuff thanks a mix of moody music from Ennio Morricone and mobile cinematography from Robert Richardson with shots that slow creep up and down the characters. The film is divided into six chapters. The first three vary in excitement as they merely set up the tension and animosity in the air; the final three chapters though are powerhouse stuff with unexpected bursts of graphic violence, an intriguing murder mystery and the shadiness of everyone's background story (are any of them telling the whole truth?). This is, however, also one of those movies where it is nearly impossible to find a single character to care about or like, due in part to how little insight we get into anyone's actual background. And yet, this is perhaps the very purpose of 'The Hateful Eight': to create an emotional distance between the viewer and the flawed characters in order that we are forced to witness the power of hate, greed and revenge tear the characters apart without necessarily rooting for anyone to succeed. However one cuts it, this is a surefire interesting experience as long as one stays patient during the slower-moving first three chapters."

","""The Hateful Eight"", the eight film by Tarantino, offers what it says in the director's name: violence, familiar faces, lots (but lots) of dialogue, nice camera work and a great use of narrative techniques. However, where, for example, ""Pulp Fiction"" excelled, ""The Hateful Eight"" falls into repetition, gloats too much on its weaknesses and it feels as a piece of narcissistic artistry. It is a movie that loves itself way too much.<br/><br/>Growling John Ruth is bringing bad woman Daisy Domergue to justice. On their way to Red Rock, under a blizzard, their stagecoach starts picking up random people. And seeing that the blizzard is not stopping, they take refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, where they meet a whole lot of unfamiliar faces, the owner and regular costumers of the place nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>Cue more than two hours and a half of suspicion, bullets flying, way too long dialogues and many many scenes that could have been cut out. Tarantino is enjoying his writing skills too much and forgets that he is telling a story through the medium of cinema. Many parts of the story feel irrelevant, and, on top of that, there are more than one or two incongruities, the characters taking decisions that make little sense.<br/><br/>The strengths of the movie, though, almost carry the story. The acting, the direction and some scenes are really good, almost outstanding. But it all ends up an exercise of self-service."

","Tarantino's latest grisly opus, The Hateful Eight, is a tightly written and beautifully realized Western with an excellent ensemble cast. Typical of Tarantino, the film is extremely violent, crude and coarse, but at the same time so over-the-top that most (but not all by any means) people will be enjoying themselves too much to be offended. Overall: although not to everyone's taste, The Hateful Eight an outstanding movie from a great director.

","Quentin Tarantino should really remake The Thing. In fact, he easily could remake it with the cast and setting of this very film. Heck, he already has an incredible Oscar-winning Ennio Morricone who unironically utilizes unpublished excerpts from his The Thing soundtrack. He has The Thing star, Kurt Russell. He has an isolated cabin in a blizzard. Had the cabin has some dogs outside that started barking when Samuel L Jackson came near this would have been a better movie for it. (And it would have let Morricone reuse some his soundtrack from that Kristy McNichol vehicle White Dog that he penned the same year as his Thing soundtrack.)<br/><br/>That the idea above is an overly film geeky and a silly genre switcheroo is what one used to hope for from a Tarantino film. This film, however, plays out much more straight and really doesn't hold it's most interesting gambits that it does keep. <br/><br/>Kurt Russell has a prisoner played by Jennifer Jason Leigh that he is stubbornly bringing in alive. He is convinced (correctly) that one or more people trapped in this cabin with him are working against him to free his charge. The movie threatens to break into a surprisingly engaging Agatha Christie-style mystery. Unfortunately, Tarantino switches gears about the time it starts to get interesting. <br/><br/>This being a Tarantino movie we are awash in an excess of blood and cruelty and racial epithets. Alas, the film simply doesn't earn them as well as say Reservoir Dogs did. There are some great set pieces that I will not spoil but they are surrounded by a lot of slow. Tarantino might argue (correctly) that he with his score, 70mm filming, and pacing is aping the style of the old three-hours western such as Once upon a Time in the West, or the Dollars trilogy. But seriously have you sat through one of those in one films in one sitting in the last twenty years? It can be a slog. This film can be a slog.<br/><br/>All the actors (sans Madsen) do a great job. The soundtrack is wonderful. Parts of the movie such as the Agatha Christie bits mentioned above really work well. Alas, there are some things that simply do not work. There is an overlong flashback that basically takes all the mystery out of the last act. Tarantino's narration is jarring, poorly done and unnecessary. The first hour of the movie takes that hour to tell twenty minutes of setup. <br/><br/>Overall worth a watch for Tarantino fans and for Jennifer Jason Leigh's fantastic performance. But like those three-hour westerns of old, I don't see myself watching it again."

"bowmanblue","8","0","4","8 March 2017"," Almost more of a film of 'two halves' than Kill Bill
","Film-lore goes that Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' was running so long that the studio took it upon itself to split it in two, hence giving us parts 1 and 2. That was probably true, but I get the feeling that the same could have been applied to Tarantino's latest offering The Hateful Eight.' However, perhaps one reason this never happened was because no one ever bother watching the first half! As much as I do love Tarantino's work, I do sometimes think that portions of his various epics can be a little 'overblown' and wordy for the sake of it. I know that good dialogue establishes character motivation and development. But then if it's done too much then I start fiddling with my phone until it's over. I felt that this was the case for the first half. We're treated to one long dialogue-heavy scene after the next. Yes, they're well-acted and everything, but I have to confess that my attention started to wander. We're introduced to the eight (all-star!) cast members who are all assorted Wild West types destined to get trapped together in an out-of-the-way wooden house by a blizzard. And, once they're stuck with each other's company, they don't just rely on their sharp tongues to spar with each other – they have guns, too.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson's (arguably) breakout role came in Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' and, although he's never had a quiet day since, he has occasionally struggled to be quite as formidable his former hit-man. Not here. The coolest dude in Hollywood is back with a vengeance. Despite great performances from Tarantino 'stalwarts' Michael Madson, Kurt Russel, Janet Jason Leigh, the wonderful Tim Roth (and even Channing Tatum!), it's Jackson who steals every scene. Although Walton Goggins does deserve a mention – I just can't remember him in anything else.<br/><br/>I did enjoy The Hateful Eight, just more the second half. It's where everything comes together. I won't go into the hows and whys of everything and who's going to double-cross who as that will run into 'spoiler territory' but when the bullets do start flying it is a welcome relief from the constant dialogue.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd describe The Hateful Eight as a longer version of Reservoir Dogs set in the Wild West. It's basically a violent, claustrophobic little number with much dialogue and plenty of characters stabbing each other (or rather shooting to be precise) in the back for reasons that only eventually become apparent. Just don't zone out too much in the first half – the second act more than makes up for the talking (although Reservoir Dogs did have a better soundtrack in my opinion!). Just get ready for yet more bad language and blood splattering across your screen!"

","I don't understand why this movie was given such high ratings. There was a great cast of actors however the violence towards the female character was excessive and unnecessary. I realize she was a murderer and was to be hung, but the violence perpetrated towards and against her was over the top. Since when has it ever been okay for a man to PUNCH a woman in the face????? She antagonized the characters in her role in the movie....that should not be an excuse for her character to be brutalized. Violence against woman in the movies has become the norm, so it is accepted and even welcomed in most entertainment today. Pretty sad. Had I known it was a Quentin Tarantino movie, I would have immediately stopped watching knowing what the movie would contain. Tarantino is depraved. He seems to love movies with a lot of excessive and unnecessary violence. What a disappointment. Glad I didn't pay to see this!"

I think that's why when so many people watch this film they say their is way to much talking because they don't realize what this movie is trying to do. This movie deserved to get a best screenplay nod for its amazing dialogue between the remarkable characters, Tarantino created. This movie has 8 hateful people in 1 tiny cabin(The Bounty Hunter,The Hangman,The Prisoner,The Sheriff,The Mexican,The Little Man,The Cow Puncher, and The Confederate) as the all get cozy and warm somebody puts poison in the tea, and like the game clue, they have to turn there backs on each other to find who the killer is."

","Now, yours truly is and probably forever will remain a devoted Quentin Tarantino fan-boy. I'm a huge admirer of everything this man has done so far and I also honestly think that he's one of the very few filmmakers out there who has developed his very own, unique and inimitable style. Even if it wouldn't be hyped and anticipated months from beforehand all over the internet, you'd still be able to recognize QT's newest movie straight away. Why? Because there simply isn't another director who writes dialogues like he does. There isn't a single other director who provides a soundtrack so suitable for his/her films. There aren't any other directors that find the exact right balance between visual style, atmosphere, dialogues, humor and excessive violence. There are very few directors that somehow bring out the best possible performances from their entire ensemble casts, etc.<br/><br/>Still, it sometimes seems as if Tarantino's formerly worshiped trademarks are now turning against him. I have the impression that I read more and more hate-reviews every time he releases a new film, and all things that people used to love unanimously – like the dialogues – now seem to upset and irritate them. It's not because I'm a big QT fan that I'm not skeptical and, yes, admittedly even I would have preferred that ""The Hateful Eight"" was less talkative and at least 30-45 minutes shorter in running time. The film is great in terms of atmosphere, setting, character development and camera-work, but nearly two and a half hour of (primarily irrelevant) drivel and balderdash before anything exciting happens is a little bit too exaggerated; even for a master like Tarantino. And another point of criticism, personally I really missed the all-overpowering ""WOW""-sentiment, and that actually already was the case in ""Django Unchained"" as well. All of Tarantino's older movies, up until ""Inglorious Bastards"", were also astounding in terms of originality and imaginative plotting. ""The Hateful Eight"" is basically a very simplistic tale, a sort of whodunit in a stone-cold and unpleasant western environment. In spite of all of Sam Jackson's long monologues and Tim Roth's brilliant Hangman speech, the essence of the plot lies within the question ""who poisoned the coffee?"" <br/><br/>""The Hateful Eight"" contains almost too many highlights to list, and that's the most important conclusion of my viewing. The long and moody opening sequence, slowly turning around the deformed Christ statue, is pure art! In fact, the cinematography throughout the entire film is brilliant and chock-full of ingenious angles; outside in the excruciatingly cold Wyoming winter as well inside in the haberdashery. I think I covered the greatness of the dialogues already, and the violence featuring in the last half hour is also stupendous, with heads getting blown clean off and scumbags puking out all the blood in their bodies. In another interview I read that Tarantino listed two movies as his main inspiration, namely his own ""Reservoir Dogs"" and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". Those two are indeed well represented, but I would definitely add one other title, and I'm sure QT knows I'm right, and that's the obscure but raw and excessively violent Spanish/Italian western ""Cut-Throats Nine"". The original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone sent cold shivers down my spine, but there's another song on the soundtrack that even made me happier. All my life I've been a fan of Roy Orbison, but thanks to Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" I discovered a magnificent song of his that I never heard before. ""I won't be many coming home"" is a fantastic song and ideally fits the tone and content of the film."

One of the biggest problems with the movie was it is too long and that was because there were scenes in which the dialogue just carried on way too long and it wasn't really funny or added too much to the story.

","Just saw Tarantino's Hateful Eight. I'd say it's already a definite Christmas B-side classic: with a 60$ million budget, a wee bit much for a single set movie, if you ask me, although the 70 mm is quite expensive, the film is probably the best tragedy of the year – and Quentin's greatest, I would add.<br/><br/>A 3 hour long cynical tragedy, building up tension with each new chapter (yes, the chapters again), only to finally leave it all hanging in the air (you'll get the pun after viewing). His most Pulp Fiction-Esq movie till this day. Trapped in a room, Samuel L. Jackson brilliantly delivers once again, his voice authentically ringing through in a Do you read the Bible kind of way. <br/><br/>It's like watching 12 angry men with a Civil War backdrop and a Western twist. It's a bounty hunter story about lying, cheating, and stealing – myth-making essentially, as much as it is a mystery tale about greed ($$) and other mortal sins dividing human beings into black(s) and white(s), where every decision is a gun to your head decisions about who's right and who's wrong, what's good and what's bad. And the ugly – that's the only part you can be sure of since Channing Tatum is seen french flirting with a fat ass African-American female – if you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Or is it about American history?"

Think a lot of people will find it helpful.<br/><br/>when watching a movie my intention is to see a story that somebody created.

That to me is a wrong approach to watching movies, because it is never your film and it can never perfectly match your personal preference.<br/><br/>My approach is ""I take the story as it is"" and I wait to see if it captures my attention. Does the movie take you on an experience that flows from one scene to the next building a coherent and congruent story. Like a book you choose to keep reading. Is there anticipation what would happen next?<br/><br/>I rarely like films because I can clearly perceive the ""patches"" - the moments where the story is not credible, it ""breaks"" or becomes plain boring, or somehow it is not coherent and does not make sense in its own way, or is too naive and predictable-a ""popcorn movie"".<br/><br/>Why did I give it a 10? <br/><br/>It matched all my criteria above. <br/><br/>Two particular aspects need to be shared:<br/><br/>1) the film takes you on a unique emotionally engaging experience. It's perfect the way it is - the way Tarantino chose to tell the story. The characters, the pace, it all made perfect sense to me and it was all congruent.<br/><br/>2) given there are NO special effects in the sense of no car chases, explosions, robots, aliens, etc I found it fascinating how Tarantino managed to make a long film that easily kept my attention for its full duration.

","As I sat in front of the screen watching The Hateful Eight, it proudly proclaimed 'The eighth film by Quentin Tarantino(QT)' I will say that i was excited to watch it. I have watched all his earlier classics like 'Pulp Fiction' , 'Kill Bill' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. In each movie I stated above there was a particular quality which was mastered.<br/><br/>In The Hateful Eight, QT masters his storytelling power and he sets his best piece of Drama. His earlier movies were not exactly drama, but the Hateful 8 is an excellently made and suspense filled story which will keep you on the edge of seat throughout the movie with terrifying bass of Ennio Morricone (the master does it again at the age of 90s) strumming behind. The Hateful eight has the most simple story among QT's previous works, the story involves a bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) who is traveling in a stage coach with a criminal lady who has a bounty of 10,000 on her head named Daisy Domergue(Jennifer Jason Leigh), with a blizzard following them behind they are trying to get to Red Rock, so that The Hangman can get Daisy hanged. They encounter Major Marquis Warren(Samuel L. Jackson), a black man with a Lincoln letter, on their path who is also taking his bounty to Red Rock, only difference being his are three dead men worth 9,000. As they move ahead with gritty well crafted sometimes overly long dialogues, they encounter another man in the snowy blizzard, he is fount to be as the new Sheriff of Red Rock(well he proclaims to be), So Chris Mannix () also enters their coach and they stops at Minnie's Habidasharie for two nights and meet four other men and thus our stage is set with 7 Men and one women in a Habidasharie stuck for two to three days because of a Blizzard, will go back alive.<br/><br/>While the movie is slow to start, minutes before interval, things hit fan as a gruesome monologue from Samuel L. Jackson about General Samuel Smithers's (Bruce Dern) son death begins which is followed by quite explicit flashback. Its dirty, disgusting and just like QT's style. The Movie then progresses like a stage play of a murder mystery with next chapters crafted brilliantly and written with Agatha Christie's panache.<br/><br/>The twist comes as a prequel type of chapter, chapter 5, the Four Passangers, where the violence turns up and then the blood spurting and head blowing never stops throughout the movie. The movie is not for everyone as is takes a powerful stomach and a strong heart to take it all in, but if you can, you will get a great movie watching experience.<br/><br/>The use of widescreen 70 mm Panavision is visible in the scenes involved outside, but more than that it helps the cottage transform into a stage, giving the characters a wider place to act and director more angles. Its awfully difficult to direct a movie based in a single room, it do not take a lot of time for the camera tricks to be exhausted, but Quentin Tarantino does it perfectly in the movie. Acting from Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifor Leigh is over the top and perfect while the others also have acted well. The title itself states that you cannot love these characters, they are the hateful eight. You will be afraid of Daisy's maniacal qualities and Major's gruesome dialogues, and will hate them, but i hate to love them, if you know what i mean.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight with all its writing flaws, cleverly written twists, racial spurs spewn as if saying Hello, all its gruesome blood spurting, nuts exploding, head booming and excessive use of N bomb has its moment but is not for everyone, it gets an 8/10.<br/><br/>For more Reviews Check out : www.filmicsite.com"
"MrGKB","7","0","3","30 July 2016"," Grand Guignol comedy at its stickiest...
","...and faithfully presented in the guise of a panoramic (literally) Western mashed into an Agatha Christie closed-room whodunit, along with various prior Tarantino tropes (not the least of which being the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson), ""Hateful Eight"" remains unlikely to place terribly high in the pantheon of cinema, let alone in the rankings of Tarantino offerings. Expansive 70mm presentation to the side (a choice brutally defanged by non-theatrical viewing), the plot leans heavily on coincidences that beggar the meaning of serendipity and trademark Tarantino verbal excursions of rhetorical diarrhea that tend to tax one's patience. While I'll admit I enjoy such excesses at times, Tarantino pushes them just a little too hard here, with Samuel L.'s taunting monologue directed at Bruce ""Need you ask?"" Dern's Confederate general being a prime example. There are times when Tarantino can't restrain himself; you'd think after so many years he'd have matured a bit more. ""Hateful Eight"" isn't a film that demands repeat viewing. It'll make its way into my video library eventually, but I'll be in no hurry about it; a return to his early work remains much more appealing."

There is also a dialogue scene with Kurt Russel and Simor Bechir, where Kurt forces him to plug the chicken. A man, who knows, that the person who started to plug the chicken was killed has not to be reminded to finish the job,at least when he claims running the stage station, especially not from Kurt Russel.

I think Tarantino wanted this movie to be raw and edgy like Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" but can't hold a candle to that classic despite a few good camera shots and decent editing. I'll just go over the positives and negatives and you can be the judge. First I'll hit the positives. If you are sensitive to violence, the n-word and harsh realities, well then why are you watching a Tarantino movie to begin with? So those who for those who like their movies raw...applaud. I felt the flick had a good amount of twist and turns and certainly kept my interest much of the time. I enjoyed some of the camera angles, for example the one with an inside the barn view to out to the storm. The acting, as you would expect from the cast, was great. I'm always happy to see Jackson, Kurt Russel and Michael Madsen in any production. I wasn't familiar with Walton Goggins, but thought he did well. The production values and sound effects were spot on. The Negatives of the Hateful 8 were as stated by many, was that it was a bit slow for today""s movies, especially when 90% of the movie was filmed in a stark cabin. I appreciated the few scenes with the cold landscape which set the scene and made the viewer realize why no one was getting the heck out of there. Another minus was the lack of historic detail (in the story not the costumes). As far as I know, the historic references to the civil war were not accurate. There were some useful examples in the Civil War like the Saltville Massacre. The dialogue is particularly 2015 and not latter nineteenth century. To me the race angle and the the black dun-gas bit was way over done not well done, and yes any director even Tarantino can be overly excessive in certain movie elements, but that's me. Art can be excessive, but is also restraint. The main problem was that the movie was dull in certain places, particularly during the first half. Maybe the flashback scene could have been cut or reduced as much of it should have been deduced by most viewers. I know it's Tarantino and we sometimes get events out of sequence. In the end, I just personally didn't think the writing and plot line lent itself to a great movie. So maybe we should just celebrate Single or Double and keep our home run expectations more realistic for Quentin?"

","When all is said and done, this is really a murder mystery. A stagecoach, in a snowstorm, approaches a wayside inn where it is obvious that people stop and have coffee. It is called Minnie's Haberdashery. Except, Minnie isn't there. Also, the cargo includes a couple bounty hunters and a woman who is being taken to be hanged. There are four other characters who get into the act as well. Soon there is a lot of deep intellectual talk about justice and law and order from people who know violence as a constant companion. Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself as the principal figure (a black man who fought for the North in the Civil War). He says he has a valid letter from President Lincoln, complementing his service. The woman is a piece of work to say the least. She is vulgar and crude and gets her bell rung on more than one occasion by her captor (played by Kurt Russell, who does quite good John Wayne vocal impression). The acting is good and we are led all over the landscape, trying to figure where this is going to go. Before we are through, we can figure on a couple of revelations."
"danielharden","7","0","1","11 June 2016"," The Good, The Bad and The H8ful
","The aptly names The Hateful Eight marks the 8th film of director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino is one of few directors who can be seen to do no wrong, but with this comes a very very high standard to which people expect of the auteur. The Hateful Eight is a good film but to me was rather disappointing when compared to the standards expected due to Tarantion's past works.<br/><br/>The aim to create an old western aesthetic is perfectly constructed, from the aspect ratio to the score composed by the great Ennio Morricone, Tarantio goes all out and succeeds in his efforts to set this scene. Minne's Haberdashery is the setting to which the bulk of this film takes place, almost like a play.To me personally this film reminds me of Of Mice and Men and thus has succeeded in its old western style setting.<br/><br/>Tarantino is also renowned for his characters and rather conversational dialogue. With the majority of this film being set in Minnie's Haberdashery the conversational dialogue and monologues are very much present in this feature. However the characters are a bit too underdeveloped for my liking. As i've said Taranito is known for his compelling and memorable characters, so I was disappointed to find that over the course of the films 161 minute run time, that we still knew very little bout many of the characters. Instead of character development the film opts to address the issue of racism in the old west as well as a who-dun-it? mystery plot point. These are handled by Tarintio as expected and make for an engaging film, but the lack of insight into the characters feels like the missing piece to this cinematic puzzle.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is great and under Quentin's script and direction make this film as good as it is. Samuel L. Jackson reminds us that he is one of the best actors around yet to have an Oscar, and can play more than just a supporting role as he has become known for. Jennifer Jason Leigh actually received award nominations for her role but ultimately wasn't given much to show off why she was nominated and feels underused. But overall as a collective unit the cast does a fantastic job.<br/><br/>The second half of this film is far better than the first. The film starts off slow, introducing characters and the plot. This isn't a particularly bad thing aside from the fact it takes the better part of 90 minutes to do so. The second half however is when the film becomes a Tarantino movie. The monologues, the over the top violence, the shocking sudden deaths of key characters etc. All the Tarintino conventions come out in the films second half. The film is one that builds and you just have to sit tight until the sh*t hits the fan.<br/><br/>Overall the Hateful Eight is a good film, but is fairly disappointing by Quentin Tarrintios standards. The acting, dialogue and authentic are all great but the extremely slow pace of the start and the lack of depth and development of many of the characters leave me unsatisfied, like missing pieces of a puzzle. The picture may look great but there are still something stopping me from achieving satisfaction from this film. Hopefully Tarantio's 9th film will restore the balance."

","There has been some discussion as to who the hateful eight really are. There is more or less a general consensus narrowing it down to nine, with either the carriage driver O.B. (James Parks) or the watering hole Mexican hand Bob (Demian Bichir) dropped from the ""hateful"" list. But then, there is also a mysterious character Jody (Channing Tatum) who appears only at the two-third point of the movie. Does it mean therefore that both O.B. and Bob are out? But enough of this inconsequential obsession with numbers.<br/><br/>Much more important, as highlighted in the opening credit, is that Tarantino has to-date made eight feature films, ""THE"" being the eighth. The message, while not shouted out aloud, is quite clear: ""I, Tarantino, do not load my work with mediocre stuff"". This immediately brings to mind the auteur in the opposite end of the spectrum, one-movie-a-year Woody Allen. Personally, I find nothing wrong with either.<br/><br/>Like many other Tarantino work, THE is divided into chapters, six, to be specific. The first three are establishing narrations, with the first death occurring at the end of Chapter Three. All hell breaks loose in Chapter Four which is generally peppered with the trademark Tarantino surprises and gore, in equal measures. Chapter Five is a flashback to half a day before, explaining the twists. Chapter Six is a neatly drawn conclusion, with perfect closure. At the end of the day, you realize that the plot is actually quite simple, a rescue story. Totally in form and in control, Tarantino takes the audience through a maze of character-driven possibilities, with tension continuously mounting and red herrings aplenty.<br/><br/>Skipping any specific reference to Tarantino's spellbinding (to audience with acquired tastes for his work), inimitable style the story set shortly after the Civil War (the real one, not Captain America's) unfolds with two bounty hunters in a stage coach to a desolate border town Red Rock to deliver goods with price tags of $8,000 and $10,000 respectively following each one's own preference within the ""dead or alive"" options. In the former, ex-Union Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) has loaded on top of the carriage two dead bodies adding up to the aforementioned sum. John Ruth (Kurt Russell), on the other hand, has steadfastly handcuffed to himself one Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leith), worth $10,000 when delivered to the hangman. While her dead body will fetch the same bounty, Ruth is a man of principles, one of which is try not to deprive professional hangmen their livelihood. A hitchhiker picked up, making the fourth in the carriage, is Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who is going to Red Rock to take up his appointment as sheriff. The fifth in this group is the aforementioned driver O.B. who in all likelihood is not one of the titular characters. But who knows? In the midst of typical Tarantino verbiage and slapstick violence (with Domergue as the punching bag, quite literally), this group struggles to outrun a menacing blizzard that will likely have them stranded for a couple of days in a usually frequented watering hole Minnie's Haberdashery operated by Minnie and her husband Sweet Dave.<br/><br/>When they arrive, the owner couple is nowhere to be seen. The first of the four people greeting them is aforementioned Mexican Bob who informs them that the owner couple is away, with him filling in for the time being. Inside, the remainder of the quartet is revealed as Oswald Mobray the hangman (Tim Roth), retired general Confederate general Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and moody Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) who explains that he is on his way to spend time with his beloved mother, having made a small fortune.<br/><br/>What we have here is something like Agatha Christie's ""Ten little n-word"" (a politically incorrect title that has longed been replaced by ""And then there were none"", although the n-word is actually used quite freely in the Tarantino movie) where a group of people is stranded in a confined location with mounting tension towards the first death, then more deaths. The tension here comes from several sources. First of all, Ruth the dominating character, in his dubious temporary alliance with Warren, is suspicious of everybody around him (including Warren). Then, as the blizzard grows more formidable every minute, various chores will still need to be done outside and someone has to do them. The acutest tension, understandably, is between Major Warren and General Smithers, from opposite sides of the recent Civil War, as mentioned above. Such raw material in the hands of Tarantino makes for top notch entertainment to those enlightened to the auteur's movie universe. I am tempted to say a lot more but if you have read carefully, you would realize that I have already said too much."

"Benkenobi510","9","0","1","19 May 2016"," The Hateful Eight
","I have to admit it, I have been a Tarantino sceptic in recent years. His bombastic style in the style of the exploitation cinema he obviously adores, is something I find irritating, especially when his more recent scripts contain hallmarks of his earlier screenplays, such as the opening to inglorious *ahem*. It gives me great pleasure to say that his latest offering is his best yet. <br/><br/>Tarantino is much more restrained here, giving us much more subtle dialogue and storytelling abilities. All of the characters from Kurt Russell's denim faced John Ruth to six horse Judy and every one In between, Tarantino has written every character as a fully formed human, for a change. <br/><br/>My reservations are few. Firstly, I thought there were some moments which went slightly overboard such as Kurt Russell vomiting everywhere and Jackson's diatribe to Smithers. I know the latter is supposed to be exaggerated in order to enrage the General and whether that event actually happened or not, but I thought It was slightly too gratuitous. Also, Channing Tatums cameo was a little confused. If he was down below the whole time, why didn't he act sooner when tensions were high? These are ultimately nitpicks because the tone of The Hateful Eight is spot on.<br/><br/>But most of all, I think this is a return to form for Tarantino. Kill Bill through to Django had characters being killed off, left right and centre and I didn't care for their demise, which isn't good. But in this, Literally every character's death made me either sad or uncomfortable in some way. In particular, the 'Charlie' character. He hides in the back when the others get killed by the gang. When Madsen's character (Joe Gage) finds him, his desperate pleas are strangely touching. The music and editing of that scene in particular are very well done.<br/><br/>A part of me thinks the improvement in quality is because of the infamous script leak. I've read that particular draft and it wasn't as good as the finished product. If it hadn't been leaked, would that have been the film that got made? Did the leak force Quentin to get more creative? It certainly makes me wonder. It makes me wonder 'I wish they leaked Kill Bill'."

","A blizzard in Wyoming. Quite a few survivors of the Civil War after the Civil War who are just moving west to make a fortune. Four of them in a first stage coach are a band of thieves and murderers plundering the area. One girl of the gang has been captured by a bounty hunter and is to be hanged in the next city. The gang is there to catch the second group and liberate the girl. A second group of four in another stage coach with that girl, the bounty hunter, a Black officer of the cavalry who was in Baton Rouge and a last one coming to the next town to become the new sheriff. <br/><br/>The meeting in Minnie's haberdashery is a real massacre. The massacre of all the women taking care of the place by the gangsters before the arrival of the second stage coach since the plan is that the brother in the gang is going to free the sister who is going to be hanged. Then the arrival of the second stage coach with four people instead of two, as they expected, makes things more complex.<br/><br/>The whole trick and interest is the great inventiveness of Quentin Tarantino's imagination as for how to have them all kill one another till the last pair who will die alone from bleeding and cold since there will be no one coming for days because of the blizzard.<br/><br/>This film made a scandal in some circles. If it had been for the N*** word, that could be understood, though after the Civil War the escaping southerners as well as the escaping northerners used the N*** word more often than God and Satan. But it made a scandal because what it says about justice and police work on the frontier somewhere around 1866 or some months later is not very brilliant about the state of police work and justice in the USA at the time. Unluckily, knowing Tarantino, we can imagine that was a parable or a metaphor to speak of the present that is not at all brilliant in that field. So what! Let the police trade unions protest: that's the best thing they know how to do, apart from shooting at anything moving before verifying what or who it is.<br/><br/>Apart from that the film has little interest and it does not want to be anything but entertainment. It is dense enough in twists and warps for the audience to enjoy it though it will gross out many sensitive souls and stomachs.

","Finally, as should have been too easily predicted, Tarantino's inflated ego fails. First, the familiarity of most actors, meaning they are so recognizable from previous Tarantino movies as to be relegated thereby to ""same person, different Tarantino flick"" status. Jackson and Leigh from as long ago as Jackie Brown. Then there's the script. Tarantino's usual spot-on, adroitly superb dialogue here becomes often hackneyed and too frequently period inaccurate. Example: ""I'll cut you some slack"" was likely not a phrase used, as it is so commonly today, in the old west (nor, for that matter was ""my johnson"" used as a term for male sexual anatomy). The script completely fails with the notion that there would be a true ""haberdashery"" in the middle of nowhere serving as a stagecoach stop. Not to mention that an outhouse would not be 50 to 100 yards away from an inhabited dwelling for private citizens, let alone for stagecoach passengers. Then, after some truly prolonged and boring build-up, the plot flops onto itself as nothing more than an Agatha Christie whodunit, or ""Clue"" game, albeit with the usual Tarantino flair for gratuitous violence. Speaking of which, since when can two bullets to a person's head explode the head off of a torso like a watermelon blowing up? Good grief, as Snoopy would say. Should it even be questioned here as to why, a truly brutal and ruthless bounty hunter would uncuff his prisoner to allow some freedom of movement to eat a meal, but then after the meal is finished allow that same prisoner to remain unshackled and free? The plot fails are far too many to forgive, especially with the expertise and brilliance we have come to expect from Tarantino! And let it be known that the acting is not up to par in this movie -- Kurt Russell walks through his lines like an amateur; aside from special make-up, Jackson uses his same-old everyday, every movie voice; Walton Goggins cannot even deliver a southern accent as convincingly as he did in Justified; Michael Madsen is wooden; Bruce Dern is so underutilized as to be a true black mark on Tarantino. The movie is uneven at best, with the singular exception of the cinematography. Tarantino still has a fine eye for the cinematic experience, thank goodness, because in his grandeur he has lost what made him pay attention to greater detail to writing smart dialogue and directing actors."

This film has an interesting premise, a unique story and great characters, but at times it's so over-done you may get bored by the excess.<br/><br/>It's also way too long. It clocks in at around three hours on most versions of the film. That's way too long for this story. This is not Gandhi, this is a Western drama. Tarantino has been given too much freedom to run this long without a good reason. In fact, the film would likely be a full star better if they cut 30-40 minutes from it. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the characters are often brilliant and the acting is top notch. But the story is so over-the-top and excessive that we found ourselves rolling our eyes and losing interest too much for a film like this. <br/><br/>Some moments of the film are a 9, others a 5, so the average score of a 7 fits for now.

","I hate Q. Tarantino films, they represent teenage level of maturity and are openly stupid.To be honest some thing he had going for him: his films are entertaining, they have good soundtracks and very good casting. On the other hand: they are embodiment of poor taste and are a product of an evil and sick mind. Well the mind did not get any healthier but the rest got much better. Strong plot, good characters, strong dialog, very engaging, nice camera. First 2|3 of this film are so good, they could have been made by the best in business, I could not tell. Last 1|3 is classic Tarantino: hardly believable trigger happy brains all over the walls trash. This is the first Tarantino that I would actually recommend someone. 10 more years and maybe he would actually grow into a mature director worthy of an Oscar or something."

","I'm sure that I cannot be the only person that thought the recent Star Wars movie was very similar to the original Star Wars movie. This thought crossed my mind again when watching ""The Hateful Eight"". It reminded me a lot of Reservoir Dogs. Quite possibly my favourite Tarantino scene ever was the opening of Reservoir Dogs in the cafe. There are a few scenes in Hateful Eight which are somewhat similar to that scene in terms of dialogue and style. Obviously that can only be a good thing.<br/><br/>Anyway although the Tarantino stories are very diverse you are more or less guaranteed a great script. The Hateful Eight is set in Winter and follows a bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russel) as he takes his captor Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) for reward. The cast are excellent and the movie is gripping throughout. Incidentally some people may think it's a bit short of action, but the action is in the words rather than the deeds."
"eryui","10","0","4","13 February 2016"," Shocking, unpredictable and outrageously hilarious
","Certainly (of course I would say) there is a lot of gratuitous blood and violence but if you know Tarantino then you should expect it. The bad guys are nasty, the movie is deliberately overly violent. If you watch this film as your first Tarantino's movies, or almost, then you will probably find it outrageous and boring. <br/><br/>It all rests on these caricatured characters that are never boring and the plot that slowly shape. A very gripping theatrical tale, a dialog driven western with a touch of thriller/mystery inside. I found it to be a more mature Tarantino's release.<br/><br/>I suggest to watch it, comfortably on your couch and with a good, widescreen TV.<br/><br/>To me its three hours length has flown away fast as I found it gripping, shocking, unpredictable and hilarious.

"DanielRobertRoss","9","0","4","11 February 2016"," Didn't love it...didn't hate it..
","I love Tarantino's films, and this looked like it was everything I wanted and more! The razor sharp dialogue, brilliant characters and Ennio Morricone score, this looked like the most Tarantino Tarantino has ever been. And there were parts that were very good. The dialogue is brilliant, the score is fantastic, Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing and Jennifer Jason Leigh deserves the Oscar for Daisy Domergue. And the thing I like about every one of Tarantino's films, is that you pay attention, his films really suck you in to the world, it's a 3 hour film that flew by, and every one of his films feels like an event, you don't just munch popcorn and check text messages while like you would if you were watching Michael Bay's next steaming turd. Tarantino always demands attention. Love him or hate him, his films are worth the price of admission. However there's a sense of deja vu with Michael Madsen and Tim Roth as ex-Reservoir Dogs, whether that's good or bad, I leave that up to the viewer, as for me, I enjoyed seeing veterans showing up. And this is something weird to complain about, but I don't think African Americans talked like 70s gangsters back in the 1800s. Jackson's dialogue feels like it's been taken straight out of a blacksploitation film, hardly suitable for a western. The ending of course is as blood soaked and nasty as you would expect. Maybe next time we could get a film that has an uncharacteristically different ending. Enjoyable, but next time how about a Woody Allen style comedy? Now that would be fun."

I walked out at the intermission so I can only review the first part of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is really a play... and I could be fine with that, but it's a very long, very slow play. Sure the cinematography is great, the acting is great, the dialogues are good. Sure I can enjoy the tensions of suspense building up when nothing happens... but nothing happens for hours, and it becomes intensely, profoundly boring. <br/><br/>I don't need a movie to be action packed to be interested in it. 12 angry men was an awesome movie, and it kept you on the edge of your seat.

","I think Tarantino made the best from the script he could. Great characters and great cinematography, though I would have liked Moricone to write more music. The decision to add additional songs wasn't that god. The pace is a bit uneven, as in Deathproof. The first half has a great build up. Sure its just talking, maybe a bit too long, but its a really nice introduction of the characters. Second part is like a bloody remake of reservoir dogs. Everyone shoots everyone and then all are creeping in their blood. Whats missing is this typical Tarantino twist. Sure we have the felatio and the surprise from beneath, but thats not enough for a 3 hours movie. It could have been better and Tarantino showed in his other movies that he can be more creative. This is a homage film. Off tarantinos 8 movies I would count this on place 6, just behind Jackie Brown and in front of reservoir dogs. Fans will like it and shall watch it on the big screen in cinema. Those who aren't into Tarantino might find it a bit boring."
"Hawkensian","7","0","6","3 February 2016"," The Hateful Eight suffers from an overly long running time, comparably forgettable characters and the weight of expectation, but it eventually comes to life,
","It's easy to determine the worst film of Tarantino's career, it's Death Proof. That one's firmly at the bottom of the totem pole. Some way up to around the middle of the pole are both volumes of Kill Bill, which had fun action but were utterly lightweight. Deciding which film occupies the top of the monument is quite difficult, as I like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained for a variety of different reasons. These four films are a showcase of the wit, cine-literacy, explosive conflict and idiosyncrasies that have made Tarantino perhaps the most popular director of the past twenty years.<br/><br/>On the surface, The Hateful Eight has the earmarks of a Tarantino film. It has dialogue in abundance, squibby gunfights, incessant use of the word n*gger and a hollering Samuel L. Jackson, but Quentin Tarantino's eighth film is a decidedly mediocre entry into his much loved oeuvres.<br/><br/>The immediate problem is pacing. Unlike some, I seldom found the pacing of Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained to be a problem, but The Hateful Eight, which has been politely labelled a slow burner by some critics, burns too slowly. It takes a whole half hour of gruff, uneventful drawl before we reach Minnie's Haberdashery, in which the remainder of the film's 187 minutes takes place.<br/><br/>Once we're in the cabin, the aggressively cautious John Ruth (Kurt Russell) demands the identity of everyone. There's Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson), a bounty hunter who is fine but doesn't depart from familiar Sam Jackson territory; Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), the goofy, ebullient Sheriff of nearby Redrock; Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Ruth's foul-mouthed bounty who's on the receiving end of multiple elbows and fists; Oswaldo Mobrey (Tim Roth), a stereotypical Victorian gentleman and hangman; Bob (Demian Bichir), a mumbling Mexican; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a cantankerous bastard who fought in the Civil War and Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a completely disposable stock character.<br/><br/>It is unlikely that any of these characters will leave much of an impression on the viewer, they are Tarantino's most unremarkable and thinly drawn in quite some time. You will not find another Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield or Colonel Hans Landa here. One would think that a film with this title would have eight very unpleasant characters, and I suppose it does, but I didn't hate them because I didn't care. There is a flashback scene in which they are genuinely hateful, but its placement towards the end of the three hour running time blunted its power, all of the narrative baggage that preceded it was distracting and dispiriting.<br/><br/>Like he did in Kill Bill vol. 1, Tarantino could've made up for the weak characters with some great set pieces. His career has been punctuated with long scenes of iconic humour and dialogue as well as biting tension, suspense and unpredictability. These elements are sometimes present within the cramped four walls of Minnie's Haberdashery, especially when the mystery begins to unravel. Compare this to Inglourious Basterds, however, and you'll be swiftly reminded that The Hateful Eight lacks the energy, excitement and intrigue that we expect. There's nothing that matches the opening interrogation between Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) and the French farmer or Michael Fassbender's excruciating altercation in the basement bar.<br/><br/>Perhaps most damaging of all is that the dialogue and humour also suffers by comparison. There's no golden watch sequence, no 'I just shot Marvin in the face' moment. There's nothing that approaches the loquacious flair of Reservoir Dogs and particularly Pulp Fiction. The Hateful Eight's most memorable set piece is an ill-judged exchange between Samuel Jackson and Bruce Dern, in which there is a cutaway scene featuring fellatio. It's crude, unimaginative and below the standard of a two- time Oscar winner for best original screenplay.<br/><br/>All of this would have been avoided if Tarantino had just given the screenplay to Tracy Letts, who wrote the wonderfully twisted Killer Joe. Letts is a Pulizer prize-winning playwright who knows how to ignite all manner of drama within a cramped domestic setting; he also knows how to write an outrageous scene of fellatio. Letts would have stripped it down and added a bit of spice, or probably a whole ghost chili, knowing him.<br/><br/>The tone of this review has been largely negative, but I didn't hate or even dislike the film. The Hateful Eight is just something of a misfire, a weak ending to Quentin's so- called historical trilogy. It suffers from a slow start, but the crescendo that builds following the interval reaches a climax that lifts the film up, albeit not to the height of his previous efforts.<br/><br/>73%"
"Hereticked","6","0","6","1 February 2016"," Self-Indulgent But Fun
","Hateful Eight is an enjoyable film on several levels, but like Death Proof and Inglorious Basterds it's also very self-indulgent on Tarentino's part. It's not QUITE as self-indulgent as those movies, but it definitely tried my patience a couple times. When Tarentino made Django Unchained either he (or the people around him) were able to reign in his more ridiculous impulses which enabled him to craft a movie that told a story brilliantly and was still a lot of fun. That was a return to form and I was hoping Hateful Eight would be more like Django Unchained and less like Inglorious Basterds. In the end, it split the difference.<br/><br/>Kurt Russel and Samuel L Jackson deliver amazing performances and are equal parts menacing and hilarious. Much like his first film, Reservoir Dogs, the story of Hateful Eight is a crime caper with one primary set; only this one takes place in the late 1800s. It's ironic that Tarentino tries to fill his movies with interesting / quirky characters and often focuses on them and their dialogue to a fault, when the best characters in this movie were the set (the ""Habberdashery"") and the blizzard raging outside. His non-human characters help set the mood perfectly and lend the film a feeling of authenticity while the human characters, however funny and impressive in their own right, often make the film feel ridiculous.<br/><br/>The movie simmers for an hour and change before any real action takes place. I consider myself a pretty patient guy but the older I get and the more great works of film I'm exposed to, the more tired I grow of films that are needlessly wordy. The Hateful Eight contains too much exposition and you could easily cut a half hour from its running time and lose none of its impact. This is the ""self indulgence"" of Tarentino I mentioned earlier and it was so prominent in Inglorious Basterds that it literally put me to sleep the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>The film is scored by the legendary Ennio Morricone and Tarentino tries to emulate the audio cues of old spaghetti westerns with various degrees of success. He also inserts a narrator a few times which was a bad decision that feels jarring and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, the film is a visual feast and I'm glad I saw it on the big screen. It's a movie with a straight forward plot and obvious themes that doesn't necessitate repeated viewings, so I doubt I'll watch it again unless I want to get another look at those beautiful landscapes and that amazing set. Good, but far from his best.<br/><br/>6/10"

","So this movie starts out great like a lot of Tarantino films, and unfortunately, turns out the same as all Tarantino movies. With the exception of ""True Romance"" which Tarantino did not direct, and in which Scott had to beg him to change the end, all Tarantino movies seem to be excuses to make actors say the word ""nigger"" and have a bloodbath. I'm going to focus on the first half of the movie, because that is where all the good is. Good casting, great acting, and good location and cinematography. This dialogue felt kind of period-authentic, but accents could have been better. The period after the US civil war must have been one of turbulence and conflict. Tarantino uses this well. Its a fascinating time in history and a good script about what that time may have been like. I found Samuel Jackson's 1/2 way point monologue personally disgusting and had to debate whether or not I would keep watching. I did for better or worse and did get rewarded with a resolution to a well thought out mystery for the characters and audience alike, but it came with a price. As I first stated, this movie devolves into the typical Tarantino bloodbath. Just once I wish the guy could piece together an original ending to one of his otherwise brilliant scripts."

","This film has the usual Tarantino ingredients. Same old ensemble cast, lots of needless violence, buckets of blood and gore. Dialogue that reaches the odd humorous level but really is trite for most of the film. Excellent cinematography of the Wyoming winter. Clever camera work and faultless direction. Much has been said about the language and a number of gratuitous scenes. All valid arguments but that is Tarantino I guess. I think comedians who resort to obscene language and jokes are talentless and earning their money on the cheap. Ditto film directors. The film is so long! There is an interval (If you were paying homage to the history of cinema Mr T I would have called it an intermission? But there you go.) In the second half we have a narrator and that trick of many a poor TV script the flashback! I think the film could have been reduced by an hour easily. But as the credits rolled and Roy Orbison sang his song I thought, 'And the story was about...what?' Disappointing."

","There is so much I like about this latest Tarantino movie and yet it left me uncomfortable and dissatisfied . While others here criticized the slow build up and the lengthy dialogue, I enjoyed this part of the movie the most. I got caught up in trying to figure out who the characters really were at Minnie's Haberdashery. I loved the stage coach scenes , the snow and the horses. I didn't feel this section of the movie dragged at all and was necessary for the set up. I question though the need of the 70 mm film as a lot of the picture occurs indoors in the claustrophobic cabin. It seemed extreme lengths to go to and was either a clever marketing ploy to present this movie as something special or just pandering to a director's ego. Many reviewers here claim to be fans of Tarantino's previous movies but (spoiler) are outraged by the rape story ( did he rape him or did he invent this to anger the father?) yet are quick to forget that the Bride is raped by hospital orderlies in Kill Bill 1 and a black man is raped by white men in Pulp Fiction(and quite graphically ). Why is it a deal breaker for you in The Hateful 8? Is it confronting because it is a black man raping and humiliating a white man? I do question the need to show the chapter where (spoiler) we see what happened to Minnie and the staff and stage coach driver. That was already pretty obvious. What made me uncomfortable is how far the violence was pushed this time. I understand he makes genre movies an exploitation movies. The difference here is that it didn't have the choreography of Kill Bill or the cartoonishness of Pulp Fiction, nor was it justified like with the history in Django. The contrast from the talking scenes to the violence was huge. And the pleasure somehow this was meant to give viewers, I found disturbing.At the end of the day it is a lot of $$$ to put in to what is an Exploitation Movie, despite the good actors."

","I am a fan of Tarantino's work, though I am willing to admit that on occasion he falls short of expectations. This is one of those times for me.<br/><br/>This film shows what a great script writer he is, but, also shows that he cannot direct a film of this style. I would expect a film like this from Clint Eastwood, had he been at the helm I think this film would be up there as one of the great westerns, but, sadly Tarantino falls back on what he often does, profanity and racism to sell his films, often to the point where it masks the story line and this is the case here.<br/><br/>That said there is some great acting:<br/><br/>Samual Jackson is his usual self very polished.<br/><br/>Jennifer Jason Leigh for me is the real star of this film, I've never seen her act so brilliantly as she does in this film, I didn't even recognise it was her!!<br/><br/>Bruce Dern will for me, always be one of Hollywood greats, who has never quite made it to the level his skill deserves."

","The eighth film that has been written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, this film is okay. But that is all, this is not a great film like his other pieces of work but it is acceptable. The positive aspects of this film are very strong and that means that this brings the film up. Firstly the film is okay in it's direction, the dialogue sequences are used to drive the seen forward and this film has perfect pacing because of this. The second thing which is good about this film, there are some great performances from great actors in this film. However I do think that the death of Kurt Russell's character is a little bit melodramatic. Besides the film being well directed, written, shot and acted that is all that I can think that I like about this film. The negatives about this film on the other hand are quiet long. My first bad point is that Tarantino uses Narration in one of the chapters. It is the director's voice, anyone who has done film studies knows that this is lazy film making. However Tarantino has copied this from another director from the 1960's called Jean Luc-Godard, and this means that the idea is not original and this is the one thing this film lacks. There is little originality in this film because there are eight main characters that all hate one another and this reminds me of Reservoir Dogs which takes that from a 1950's called Double Identity. The final item that annoys me the most about this film is that like Inglourious Basterds it breaks the film into chapters but clearly tells you when it does, again this is really lazy film making because the director clearly can't link the two sequences together. Overall this film is okay, but I did expect more and didn't get what I wanted, I hope that the next project is better."

","When we first see Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds, the lengthy Alpine scene is a joy - but also reminds you how little real adult cinema there is. And without Tarantino, the Disneyfication of mainstream film would not stop.<br/><br/>This time, he takes his usual patience to build up the Western but it is immediately apparent that film is also puzzle, maybe whodunnit. So from the outset we are expecting the plot to resolve surprisingly, and it does. <br/><br/>If you are familiar with Tarantino, then this film delivers in spades, but it has surprisingly even less concessions to a modern cinema audience than his previous two films.<br/><br/>The film is both slow and yet Beat Takeshi like in its outbursts of violence. The film is long, and does not truly kick in for an hour. The use of the N-word is excessive and purely for texture which is what gets Tarantino into so much hot water.<br/><br/>But Tarantino has a discipline that keeps the film incredibly tight, which keeps you fully emerged in his world, reminding you that good filmmakers use the time they have effectively."

I wonder if the leaked script had something to do with this mediocre writing effort. And when I say mediocre, I mean mediocre when compared to Quentin's other films.<br/><br/>The violence felt gratuitous and so totally unnecessary. None of the characters were really on screen long enough to like or hate for that matter...and so don't expect to root for or against anyone in this film. <br/><br/>On the bright side, I thought this film was excellently directed. The old Tarantino formula returns here, and I always enjoyed his stage play style of film-directing. <br/><br/>Overall a 6/10. I liked it, but I don't think I'll be watching this one again.

","*Very Minor Spoilers (like not even really, but if you want to go in totally blind...) ahead.<br/><br/>I was expecting something like a cross between Django and Reservoir Dogs. That is not what this movie is. I can't really say that this is a good movie, and I certainly wouldn't recommend you go see it. As far as even heavy movies go, this is about as heavy as you can get with absolutely no redeeming qualities.Even The Departed is more feel- good than this. But it made me think about my general experience with Tarantino films, and that's something.<br/><br/>This movie really has no good guys. All the characters are racist, criminal, violent, and jaded, so their actions complement and justify one another's. The violence is insanely over the top, and honestly hard to watch. I could not find one character to relate to because as soon as I found a way to relate to one, they would do something that would destroy that. At the end, you honestly feel bad about what happened to everyone, but also feel like they deserved it. <br/><br/>That's when I figured out the point that at least I saw in this movie. We have cheered along to Tarantino's mad cap revenge fantasies for so long, and never questioned it as we watched families gunned down,people burned alive, and threatened with torture. We always accepted it because it felt somehow justified. There were identifiable bad guys and good guys. But still it was an insane amount of often unwarranted violence. In this movie, we were divorced of that justification. Even Jackson's loose Django analog came off as despicable and violent. Even the most justified characters introduce themselves by committing a massacre. And that was when I realized that one potential message of this movie is to see how far we are willing to be pushed before we say enough. It really goes far enough to force us to question human suffering displayed as entertainment. There is no redemption to the violence, it just makes us realize how terrible thing it is to hate and kill. <br/><br/>Is Tarantino actually that self-aware? I don't know, and I think that might be giving him too much credit. All I know is that I walked away from ""The Land of Blood and Honey"" feeling better than when I walked away from this movie. To make that much of an impact is at least something. It taught that lesson at least, but I think it's a lesson that can be less painfully learned, so I think it's fair to say your safe missing it in the theaters. I don't entirely regret seeing it, but I cannot recommend it to the average person. It's one of those films that will haunt me. It's good, but don't watch it if you want entertainment, because what it is, is art by provocation."
"riteshshergill","6","0","8","17 January 2016"," Yet another overrated Tarantino movie
","I liked what Tarantino had for us up until the sequel to Kill Bill came out. His movies were edgy, gory, unpredictable and designed for shock value, drawing inspiration from old western movies. Then he overdid it. Nowadays there is a lot of talking in his movies, the main protagonists come across as bad asses and end up as half asses. Lets take the Inglourius Basterds as an example. The plan to assassinate Hitler starts to go horribly wrong until a stroke of luck helps them to bring the plan back on track. It wasn't a great movie, it was all right. Then we had Django Unchained and the only part I liked about the movie was when Leonardo DiCaprio came on screen and the game of cat and mouse began. Now we have the hateful eight in which the first half of the movie is about the hateful eight being the boring eight, talking and talking till I almost dozed off. There are a lot of scenes that are unnecessary, the plot to free Daisy is unnecessarily complicated, of course they tried to justify this in the FAQ section but I still feel that the narrative could have been tighter and this didn't have to be such a long movie. The Domergue gang gets their comeuppance in the end but being such a notorious gang, I was surprised that Joe Gage and Jody Gage literally made no impact (other than shooting Marquis Warren in the crotch which was hilarious but had no effect on the story thereafter). Its a good movie but not an excellent movie and definitely not deserving 8 stars. I mean just compare it to Reservoir Dogs, one of Tarantino's best movies. Would you say it matches that level of storytelling and screenplay? I think not."
"markteahan12","6","0","8","17 January 2016"," Not terrible but in my opinion Tarantino's worst movie out of his 8.
","Well,Where to begin. Don't believe all the negative reviews of this movie. You either love or you hate Tarantino and I for one am a huge Tarantino fan. I've seen his previous 7 movies and absolutely loved them, but I think he he missed something with this movie.I believe that it was a well written script but the movie would've been fantastic if it was shorten down. <br/><br/>He fantastically builds tension throughout the movie from start to finish especially conveyed through Samuel L.Jackson. The good parts of this film are classic Tarantino but the bad parts are awful in my opinion. There are horrible drawn out dialogues and moments of silence. At one stage there is a character hammering nails into a door for roughly 1 and a half minutes. It took 1hr and 38min for the first shot to be fired. The ending is very good though it must be said. For the characters I believe that Jenifer Jason Leigh was fantastic, Walton Goggins was very likable and funny and Samuel L. Jackson was at his usual best. But on the other hand, Michael Madsen was poor, it seemed like he just didn't want to be there, and Demián Bichir was a fairly annoying Mexican as you could not understand half the words he was saying.<br/><br/>Other negatives include the over the top use of the ''N-Word'' and the torture scene seemed very very gratuitous as it was almost uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>To conclude, i just think that this is worth the money to see. It is classic Tarantino with Over-the-top almost comedic violence. But certainly don't believe the reviews that say ''Worst movie ever'' but also don't believe the ones that say ''Tarantino's best yet, His absolute masterpiece''."

","Bob and Warren wear almost EXACTLY the same scarf: same pattern, same style, same gauge; just the yarn is slightly different. Lazy costuming.<br/><br/>Too bad every review MUST have ten lines, but that's the rule. SO, I'll add that we enjoyed the movie, given that we knew there would be lots of blood and gratuitous violence. I did enjoy Tarentino's use of anachronistic dialogue, with humorous effect. Realism is definitely overrated in Tarentino's plan. <br/><br/>Lots of twists and turns. SPOILER ALERT: I really thought that the bedstead on which Warrens and Chris tied Daisy's hanging rope would come loose (it buckles precariously), and she would come tumbling to the floor to give the two of them what-for, but no such luck. <br/><br/>My spoiler is: the movie ends with all the characters DEAD or DYING.

","Let me start with a statement: I'm not a Tarantino movies fan and in my opinion he is overrated. Some of them are quite entertaining (Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterdz) and some quite good (Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained), some are boring as hell (Kill Bill, Jackie Brown) and some total waste of time (Death Proof). All of them are missing something or are overloaded. He usually has good or excellent cast giving excellent performances but what I don't like is his direction where he tends to cite (copy?) anyone and everyone. Until this one. This is a good movie but unfortunately misses an ending. It just does not last enough long (despite two and a half hours) to round or conclude the story. Maybe he is planning a sequel, but I'm reviewing this one as a ""whole"". Anyway, cast is excellent as usual and performances very good, with Ms. Jason Leigh and Mr. Goggins standing out. The story is also very good - a western crime. All very promising and enjoyable until the movie abruptly ends without conclusion. His friend, Mr. Rodriguez, is much better as a director in such ""exploitation"" sub-genres (especially when Mr. Tarantino writes the story). So, watch it, enjoy and wait for the sequel (if any) to see what happened to all the characters."

","It's hard not to be excited when Tarantino puts something new out but with the additional hype surrounding The Hateful Eight, it became one of the must see movies of the winter. If you're a fan of his classic works all the ingredients are here: exploitation level violence, appearances by Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson and a group of some real nasty people cursing, hitting and murdering each other.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a couple of very long shots of the landscape a coach rides up to a man with several bodies stacked behind him. After asking the driver if he can hitch a ride, that man is told that he has to talk to the passenger. After being disarmed, we get the official introduction to our 3 main characters. Our hitchhiker Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), our passenger is John ""The Hangman"" Ruth(Kurt Russell) and his associate is Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Marquis and John are bounty hunters who have met previously and Daisy is a fugitive being escorted to her demise by John for a lot of money. He's suspicious of Marquis trying to steal his payday but they finally reach an arrangement and the Major comes aboard.<br/><br/>As they travel to Red Rock they reminisce a bit and Daisy gets hit by John a few times for having a truly foul mouth. They talk about John's nickname and his tendency to bring in his bounties alive to hang. After an unexpected stop caused by Daisy trashing a prized possession, they pick up another passenger named Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). He's a son of a famous rebel leader who doesn't take kindly to Mannix or any northern sympathizers but is nonetheless grateful for the ride and he informs them that he is the new sheriff of the city Red Rock and he will be sworn in as they arrive. Unfortunately with a storm raging behind them, they stop at a popular way station, Minnie's Haberdashery to wait it out.<br/><br/>I think the most definitive thing I can say about this feature is that it's pure unfiltered Tarantino and that works both to the movie's credit and it's one of its chief drawbacks. The movie is very dialogue driven, especially at the beginning and like any other Tarantino movie it works well. You also have pretty good characterization for such a large ensemble, which is rare and another hallmark of the director. The characters that populate the film are very much similar to Inglorious Basterds or Reservoir Dogs, they are tough, nasty and they all have very cool back stories. They walk the line of being nasty but not too nasty that you can't watch them.<br/><br/>Now on the flip side, the movie feels very self-indulgent or at least to me it did. The great dialogue is there but there are many times where scenes just drag on because there has to be one more witty retort or one more monologue and there were times I just wished the movie would get on with it. The fact that most of the film is a bottle film doesn't help that, you don't get a change of scenery or too many new characters introduced to freshen things up. This movie really needed a tighter cut, I understand it had an engrossing story to tell but you could probably shave at least 15 minutes off this film, maybe even up to 30 min. But I think that the long run time is partly due to the fact it's Tarantino's project and there's the line of thinking that he shouldn't have to cut anything because he's Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting, you've got a big cast so while the performances are all good I can only comment on so many. Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell function as dual leads and they both are throwing their all into it. Russell is boisterous and vicious as John Ruth and Jackson is his normal charming/wise-cracking self as the Major but his character has more to him than meets the eye and Samuel's performance evolves as the movie advances. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't have much to do at the start except get beat up and get showered by bodily fluids but as you close in on the halfway point, she gets her time to shine and you realize her character, man or woman, deserves what's coming to her. Surprisingly, Walton Goggins was the acting standout for me. I liked him in Django but he's got a deeper character to work with and I was surprised at how good his work was in The Hateful Eight. There wasn't a weak link in the chain and it's not a surprise considering the big names you see in the cast.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I think the level of enjoyment you will personally get from the Hateful Eight is how much you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's filmography. The Hateful Eight is an interesting and enveloping mystery with a good cast and an expert at the helm. I just wish it didn't take so long to get where it was going and that it more evenly spaced out the action to avoid the peaks and valleys it ventures into. That being said the ending is pretty good and the twists are surprising. I saw very little of it coming and after having been fidgeting in my seat for an hour and a half, when the other foot hits the ground, boy does it take off. Yet, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained or Jackie Brown I would actually give it a 7.5/10 but if I had to go one way or another I enjoyed it more than I didn't so I'll give it an 8/10."
"Rebriwien","6","0","8","12 January 2016"," The Waiting Game
","How much enjoyment you get out of this movie pretty much depends on how much you like Samuel L. Jackson. If you're a fan, you can sit through the first two thirds of the movie just feeling for him and his character and not be too bothered about the slow pace of the plot. It's hard to call it world-building, because lots of the stuff that is shown in the beginning will be torn down once the movie gets to Tarantino's famous blood and guts type of scenes. If Samuel L. Jackson and/or Negro rights post-civil war don't do it for you, you'll probably just be bored by it. Or maybe you'll hate all the characters so much you'll watch it just to see them suffer and/or die.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Tarantino's previous work, you'll probably find the splatter part entertaining. If not, don't go see it. It's another movie about violence with no deeper meaning.<br/><br/>There is also a whodunit aspect to it, but it can't be called a proper mystery. The plot moves as it wills, and the watcher is not encouraged to gather clues or make guesses. You simply sit and wait until everything is revealed. This probably won't be the movie you'll watch over and over again - once you know who's plotting with whom against whom, there's little left to be excited about."

"kjarvis1212","7","0","8","10 January 2016"," A Slow Burn That Almost Pays Off
","I've always been a big Tarantino fan. Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill Vol. I & II, Inglorious Basterds, and Django Unchained are some of my favorite films of all-time. So needless to say, I was pretty excited for his latest effort, The Hateful Eight. And ... it was pretty good. Not great, but definitely good. The problem with any great film director such as Tarantino is expectations. Coming off of Django which, at least in my opinion is one of the single greatest westerns ever made, hardcore QT fans have been frothing at the mouth with anticipation of another great western. So, to say it's not as good as Django isn't exactly a criticism, but that also doesn't mean it's not a disappointment. TH8 opens with a stage coach approaching a man standing in its path as the sky rains an icy white hell upon them. The man is Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), and there's a pile of three bodies behind him. The man in the stage coach is John Ruth, a.k.a. the Hangman (Kurt Russell). Both men are bounty hunters. Warren prefers the tried and true method of opting to bring his bounties in deceased. Ruth, as we later learn, brings his bounties in alive because ""hangmen gotta earn a living too."" Ruth is headed to Red Rock, Wyoming to unload his bounty, an odd woman wanted for murder (played to perfection by Jennifer Jason Leigh). The Major lost his horse and needs a ride, and Ruth reluctantly agrees. They decide to wait out the storm at an almost mystically convenient haven along the way, Minnie's Haberdashery. Turns out another stage rolled in ahead of them, and this is where we meet the rest of the Hateful. The second act is the slow burn portion of the film I referred to in my headline. We meet five new men, whose names at this point are inconsequential. What is consequential is who they are played by: Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir. Bichir's character is a Mexican supposedly looking after the place for Minnie while she and her partner are up north. Dern's a cranky, racist retired general who spends his screen time planted in an armchair by the fireplace. Roth is the hangman, also on his way to Red Rock. Goggins is the incoming Sheriff of Red Rock, waylaid with the rest of our subjects. Madsen is perfectly cast as the quiet, loner cowboy who keeps to himself in the corner. From the start, Ruth and Warren are suspicious of the others. Ruth is convinced that one or all of them are out to rescue or perhaps just steal his bounty. Meanwhile Warren, long acquainted with Minnie's, is picking up signs that something ain't right about the men or their stories. What ensues is a very Tarantino-like bloodbath, with amusing and relatively entertaining results. But that's about it. My own sense of ""disappointment"" in this movie is that the script lacks the usual sizzle of a QT film. His finest qualities as a writer are ironically what end up diminishing TH8. He's always had a way with words, a way of explaining things so literally that perhaps we see it in a way we haven't before. But here, there are moments where it seems repetitive (for example, the ongoing bit about keeping the cabin's door closed). For all his explanatory exploits, TH8 often feels like it's over-explaining things to us. The film also has a small handful of the ever-rare Tarantino examples of me as the viewer saying to myself, ""I'm not sure that's what that character would say there, or how they would say it."" There's also a sense of nihilism here. I did not get a strong sense that the events unfolding before me on the screen really mattered. This is a far cry from the very clear sense of good and evil and purpose that QT delivered in Django Unchained. TH8 essentially plops eight ruffians into a cabin in the middle of a blizzard and says have at it. We think we're supposed to root for Ruth and Warren, but we're not sure. So when the payoff happens, it's less satisfying absent the necessary buildup we need to develop an attachment to these characters. That said, the film is gorgeously shot (in ""glorious 70mm"" as the trailer brags). The vast setting of the Wyoming mountains in the middle of a blizzard, and the cramped cabin in the middle of it combine for a strange but effective mix of isolation and claustrophobia. The score is once again produced by legend Ennio Morricone (of the infamous Eastwood/Leone spaghetti western trilogy), who previously collaborated with Tarantino on Inglorious Basterds. The results are fantastic. The acting is very good, especially by Goggins and JJL. For actors like Russell, Madsen, and Jackson, these are just more tough guy roles they're spent virtually their entire careers playing. But somebody had to play them, and they did a pretty good job doing it, especially Jackson. I should warn that once the violence starts, it never really stops, but it's nothing Tarantino fans haven't seen before. I actually expected it to be more violent than it was based on reviews I'd read. But make no mistake; it's violent. If you haven't liked other QT films, you probably won't like this one either. But, if you're a fan, I absolutely recommend that you see it. Just try to temper your expectations."

","A winter storm sweeps through the mountainous Wyoming valley as eight individuals shelter in a log cabin. Each person seems upfront and friendly, but not all of them are who they claim to be. The characters include John Ruth (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter bringing in Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a crazy little minx, to hang; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter collecting some reward money, a town sheriff (Walter Goggins), the town's hangman (Tim Roth), a former colonel (Bruce Dern), and the cabin's caretaker (Damien Bicher). In a ""who done it"" storytelling fashion, the characters figures out the hidden truths and turn on another one.<br/><br/>Writer and director Quentin Tarantino approaches his eighth film like a play. He takes his time unraveling the story as the characters engage in idle conversations through the blustery storm. QT is a master of witty dialog and has a talent where he can have his characters talk endlessly about irrelevant matters to the movie's plot, yet remain entertaining and enthralling. While this worked flawlessly in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained,"" in ""The Hateful Eight"" it drags the story out longer than necessary. After awhile, the dialog feels very long-winded. If Tarantino wanted to emphasize the boredom of being secluded in a cabin during a storm, he certainly achieves that. There are still some very well written scenes though, such as a reoccurring gag where each character asks John Ruth why he is bringing Daisy in alive when it is just simpler to shoot her in the back. The punch line, ""It's too much work to bring 'em in alive"" will go down as a classic Tarantino movie line.<br/><br/>Without giving too much more away, the ""surprise"" twist is very predictable. In Tarantino style, people die gruesomely. Shot, stabbed, hanged, poisoned, bled to death, take your pick. Unlike other QT movies where the violence seems justified, ""The Hateful Eight"" depicts violence just for the sake of it. The last on-camera death specifically displays a disturbing act of pure sadism. I never really felt uncomfortable watching a Tarantino movie. This one actually bothered me a little.<br/><br/>There are some more worthwhile factors that ""The Hateful Eight"" offers. Shot in 70mm film, the landscape shots pay homage to the old Westerns. Cinematographer Robert Richardson has once again shown his talent as one of Hollywood's greatest DPs. Ennio Morricone's score is haunting to say the least, but also has the soul he created from the Spaghetti Westerns. Both are probably in luck for some Oscar nominations this year.<br/><br/>To sum up, ""The Hateful Eight"" is merely decent. The acting is good. The technical skills are phenomenal. But the story is weak, but fortunately has some of the flare QT that audiences have seen before, just not enough to make another masterpiece."

","(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: The West remains wild in Quentin Tarantino's bloody whodunit.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>Filmmaker auteur Quentin Tarantino mashes up the (very) bloody spaghetti Western with the stagy whodunit to make his eighth film, The Hateful Eight, with decidedly mixed results. Again, he is all hell and brimstone spreading a vitriolic attack on the senses peppered with N-words and profanity, this time from the Book of Christie, as in Agatha, as his plot device spins its wheels to tell its gruesome detective story.<br/><br/>￼More content on shock value, both in his stilted dialog and graphic violence. the writer/director uses the mystery genre rather cleverly. Eight supposed strangers descend upon a cabin in the woods during a fierce snowstorm. Two are bounty hunters who meet along the way, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and John Ruth (Kurt Russell). Ruth is delivering his prized prisoner, a ruthless killer named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) when they become stranded there with five other odd bedfellows: Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a racist (what else?) Confederate general named Sandy Smithers, and Bob the Mexican (Demian Bichir, overdoing a thick accent that would make Speedy Gonzales blush). One of them is not who he claims to be, rather an ally to Daisy, whose sole purpose is to free her at any cost. All are thoroughly unlikable characters caught in a Ten Little Indians set-up (minus the Indians), as one by one they bite the dust while we moviegoers try to find the culprit at large.<br/><br/>￼The director has assembled many actors from his past films who know his quick rhythms and pacing technique while adding new members to his repertoire company and the end result is a nice invigorating ensemble. The acting is consistently strong with fine work by Mr. Jackson, Mr. Russell, and a memorable star turn by Ms. Leigh who makes the most of her showy role. However, Tarantino directs his actors as if it were in a theatrical set piece. As these snowbound travelers remain cabin-bound, the story become earthbound with its very stagy direction. One wishes for more wintry vistas rather than the majority of the film's small confines of the log house to hold our interest. One also wishes that the director would have hired another actor rather than use his own nasal reading to do the voice-over work.<br/><br/>But the film's running length is even more of the problem, as it becomes tiresome and incongruous with much of what is said and done needing more concise direction. We all know Mr, Tarantino goes off on tangents, with a sharp emphasis on his second syllable of his last name. This time, the dialog lacks any clever invention and the conversations between the strangers is more strange than compelling. His attempts to connect our present world to the Wild West of yore is less successful, including the use of anachronistic phrases and songs. His lingering shots of sudden bloody mayhem undercuts the nicely built tension this time around and the film becomes derivative of his own stylish flair. One expects a bloodbath and one gets it by the finale. Less would have been more. (His previous film, Django Unchained, had the same problem with this reviewer.)<br/><br/>￼Still the technical aspects of the movie are spot-on with stunning cinematography by the talented Robert Richardson and the music score by the legendary composer Ennio Morricone setting off the perfect mood for this piece of epic filmmaking. Kudos to Fred Raskin's editing for making this claustrophobic world even more intimate.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is far from the director's best work, but it remains skillful filmmaking that shows enough vitality and edginess to overcome its flaws.<br/><br/>￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

Will all of his next movies incorporate their ordinality into their respective titles? One can imagine The Rootin' Tootin' Niners or the Bellicose Eleventies coming to a theater near you. Actually, the movie should have just been called Everyone Sucks and Everyone Dies.<br/><br/>The Hateful Eight is entertaining, but it's non-70mm running time of 167 minutes is excessive, and just as good of a movie could have been condensed into two hours. The characters are delineated with just enough backstory to give them color, but the movie's biggest fault is that none of them are worth rooting for, and we're ultimately relieved at the end that none of them will go on to ruin anyone else's lives.<br/><br/>There's dialogue galore for you dialogue hounds. Tarantino writes good dialogue, and he wants you to know it. It's much akin to listening to the logorrhea of a Conor Oberst tune. People talk and talk and talk about talking' about stuff, and then something happens, usually accompanied by a volcanic blood burst, and of course we get a non-linear timeline, something Tarantino seems to fetishize.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about how gory and violent it is, but The Hateful Eight is nothing compared to the unwatchable Django Unchained, or any of the horrible torture porn movies like Hostel or Saw. The violence here is much more cartoonish, eliciting laughs at times, and some ""no he didn'ts"" at others. And yes there are n-bombs throughout the movie, I mean, because it's realistic and all.<br/><br/>The legendary Ennio Morricone provides a minimal soundtrack, and Tarantino ruins it by throwing in a White Stripes tune at an inopportune time. Tarantino is trying to recall better movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but fails to achieve such greatness here. Nevertheless, it's nice to know Morricone is still alive and kicking.<br/><br/>Much ado has been made of the 70mm version, but the vast majority of the movie is shot in a one-room wooden haberdashery. One must ask, what's the point? This isn't Barry Lyndon.<br/><br/>Then again, it is somewhat hard to discern the whole point of the movie."

","The Hateful Eight is rightly classified as a comedy/drama/mystery and not a Western by the Internet Movie Database. Despite the promise of a title that suggests that the movie will be a Tranantino reworking of The Magnificent Seven and a much vaunted Enio Morriconi film score (that takes up no more than five minutes of otherwise music free film), The Hateful Eight is an Agatha Christie style, intermittently locked room murder mystery with Samuel L. Jackson as Hercule Poirot.<br/><br/>Of all the deadpan jokes in this movie, the ultra widescreen format is the biggest joke of all. If you are expecting Western genre defining landscapes then, for the most part, you can forget it as Tarantino confines the cast in a horse drawn carriage and a cabin in the woods. The content is talk. God how these characters like to talk. The hateful Eight is almost cinema for radio. They go on and on and on, dancing around their various inter- related identities, seemingly looking for the right reason to do what we already know Tarantino wants them to do: blow each other to bits.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised Tarantino went ballistic when an early script was leaked because the twisty turney plot twists are the main interest here. I'm not going to even entertain the idea there is something important being said about racial and gender identity here. Tarantino delivers his profane take on the world with hot blooded and bloody excess. The performances are as broad as The West is wide. You'll enjoy the film only as much as you can tolerate nearly three hours in the company of a misanthropic bunch of Basil Expositions.<br/><br/>In the end, only one question remained unanswered: why was this film ever made? If you are happy with the answer 'because Tarantino wanted to make it', then The Hateful Eight won't disappoint because, in the end, the director's output is a genre in itself."

","If there was one thing you should know about The Hateful Eight it is that the violence is tame, by modern standards, and Quentin Tarantino does not revel in it as Angelina Jolie seems to have reveled in the torture of the movie Unbroken. The violence is entirely driven by the plot and there is no more nor less than what the plot demands. That said, the plot and all of the plot twists clearly were written to maximize the blood. So, is the plot worth 168 minutes of your time? The plot? No. The acting, yes.<br/><br/>The plot suffers from being somewhat contrived. The dialogue is clearly anachronistic especially if you seen any accurate post-civil war movies. As examples the word ""blacks"" would not have been used then. Negros, in polite conversation, darkies, or ""Niggers"" as is sometimes used in the movie. The use, by one of the characters, of the word ""dispassionate"" to describe himself also seemed forced, and out of place. As others have pointed out, the portion which is narrated also detracts from your involvement in the action.<br/><br/>There are also some points no one has mentioned but might be noticed by one who is familiar with music: How does a piano stay in tune in a very cold cabin? It doesn't, or course. With all the things they had at their disposal why should they have been incapable of building a door latch with the wood they had? The pacing also suffers at points but the photography, the film score, and the acting are unimpeachable.

","I'm a big fan of Tarantino. I love most of his movies and I think he's a genius. I had big expectations for this movie, but I must say I was somewhat let down by it. Not that it's bad---on the contrary. The H8 (I'll call it that for brevity) is pure Tarantino: great dialogs, intense interactions, superb camera work, masterful acting, historical/social drama with lots of twists and turns, and the release of tension through violence.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks, in my opinion, is a thoroughly original setting and plot. Often, the H8 feels like a déjà vu and a ""compilation"" of sorts of previous Tarantino movies, especially Django unchained. It's inevitable for any artist to repeat themselves at some point in their creative career, but I sure hope a brilliant guy like Tarantino will once again come out with stories and movies we haven't seen before in any shape or form.<br/><br/>What I also didn't care for in H8 is the gratuitous male nudity in a scene that doesn't add anything interesting to the movie (unless you're gay and enjoy male nudity) and is just gross for straight guys like me. Tarantino is way too good for this crap. <br/><br/>If you're expecting another masterpiece such as ""Inglorious Basterds"", ""Pulp Fiction"", or ""Django Unchained"", you'll be very disappointed by the H8. If you just want good entertainment that bears the classic Tarantino signature, however, the H8 won't let you down. To summarize, while this is a decent movie that will provide some great entertainment, ultimately it's not Tarantino's best work."

","****May contain strong spoilers****<br/><br/>Have to be honest. The slow paced and detailed dialogue starts to take the toll on me. Have seen too much movies and communication acting to appreciate it to the fullest nowadays. I my perspective, Mr. Tarantino has to come up with something new and fresh.<br/><br/>As usual, the package of the story and the movie is very intelligent and intriguing. Nice production, innovative (or is it, nowadays??)and really good acting.<br/><br/>In my opinion, about 160 minutes is too long speaking of this kind of storyline.<br/><br/>Nice touch of blending a criminal act and detective story into this one...who did what to whom? Fresh moments there.<br/><br/>Very surprising seeing Channing Tatum in this kind of movie and with a production of Mr. Tarantino. All actors doing their part and nailing their parts. I LOVE Kurt Russell... he is just awesome and genuine. The question for me were if The Hateful Eight, The Revenant or Bone Tomahawk took the year of western in my opinion...here it comes...and I assume there will be a lot of question marks on this one; Bone Tomahawk took the prize. <br/><br/>By the way... wanna see a copy of Christoph Waltz, and his character in Inglorious Basterds? Then....watch Tim Roth in The Hateful Eight. Almost a clone. Funny... or sad?<br/><br/>7,8 out of 10"
