","This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun."
"belzebuebchen","10","214","283","6 December 2004"," A blockbuster how it was meant to be
","Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. <br/><br/>Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend. <br/><br/>It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?"
"r96sk","7","8","8","16 April 2020"," A good film, but nothing more
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.<br/><br/>The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.<br/><br/>It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better."
"Rich B","10","164","225","24 December 2004"," Excellent movie and brilliantly crafted entertainment with a superb casting
","I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.<br/><br/>I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.<br/><br/>It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.<br/><br/>The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.<br/><br/>There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."
"baumer","10","308","433","9 July 1999"," There will never be another film like Raiders
","It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!<br/><br/>Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.<br/><br/>Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""<br/><br/>Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""<br/><br/>Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.<br/><br/>TRUST ME"

","If you've seen this movie and heard the score, then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep, but rather the absolutely exhilarating ""Raider's March"" which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero, Indiana Jones. If not, see it now.<br/><br/>I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.<br/><br/>When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.<br/><br/>Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?<br/><br/>Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.<br/><br/>My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.<br/><br/>My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.<br/><br/>Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""<br/><br/>As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","9","117","176","26 September 2006"," Will stand the test of time forever.
","I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.<br/><br/>The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.<br/><br/>I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.<br/><br/>The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.<br/><br/>The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.<br/><br/>You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! <br/><br/>I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).<br/><br/>I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.<br/><br/>Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?"

","There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them.  This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever.  From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.  Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned."
"rmax304823","7","15","21","9 July 2011"," Conception of a Series.
","Original, exciting, and lots of fun. Spielberg directed it and Kasdan and Lucas wrote it. Without it, we wouldn't have had ""Romancing the Stone"", ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Empire"", and many others too numerous to list. They were all more or less rip offs of this one. Of course the original was highly successful. I dragged my lugubrious ex to the theater and even SHE enjoyed it. For a while there was an attempt to merchandise Indiana Jones' leather jackets, fedoras, and bull whips but they didn't get far.<br/><br/>The fact that this was such a commercial blockbuster raised the inevitable question, which may be roughly phrased as, ""What do I do NOW, Ma?"" What you do is produce sequels: ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" ""Indiana Jones and the Amazon Women of the Moon,"" and so on. Each imitation, each sequel, was less innovative and more desperate and sloppy, but that's in the nature of decadence.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford, whose career this put the stamp of approval on, is an archaeologist who is recruited to find the Ark of the Covenant hidden somewhere in the Middle East. It's 1936 and the Nazis are after it and who knows what havoc they might wreak with its powers? Jones drags along Karen Allen, a former lover and assistant, to provide a pulchritudinous sidekick with whom he can exchange insults. Anything resembling sex is out of the question, though, just as it would never have been considered in one of the 1930s Saturday afternoon theater serials on which this kind of story is based.<br/><br/>Here's the schematic diagram of the plot: Introduction, suspense, action, suspense, action, suspense . . . n. Then the climax -- a really BIG action scene.<br/><br/>But the thing that made it successful and keeps it so enjoyable after thirty years is that the action wasn't of the usual sort. Oh, sure, Jones and his girl friend are threatened with immanent death lots of times -- involved in comic fist fights, shot at with poisoned arrows. That's de rigeur. But how often does a hero find himself dashing through an underground tunnel downhill pursued by a three-ton rolling marble? Another element that contributed to its appeal was its reconstruction of the period, 1936. The exotic settings of 1936 aren't just rebuilt. They're lovingly reproduced. The ordinary set dressings are there to suggest the exotic -- always look for beaded curtains -- but the men don't waltz around in immaculate double-breasted white suits and pith helmets. The settings are overblown, to be sure. I strongly doubt that in all of Nepal there was a saloon with the size and atmosphere of Karen Allen's. I'm not at all sure there were ANY saloons in Nepal in 1936. But they're meant to suggest authenticity, not embody it, and they succeed in an creative way.<br/><br/>Finally, the characters are kind of enjoyable in themselves, from the often frightened and only barely willing Indiana Jones himself, through the cartoon Nazis with the monocles and Swastika armbands. Oh, boy, watch the ark of the covenant MELT them down to nothing while they are frozen in place and screaming! The force unleashed."
"kristoffe-brodeur","10","105","184","20 November 2004"," When you're hungry, everyone believes you
","There are only so many films in history that I can watch again and again, gaining new appreciation for, one of them is this film. I went from the movies to VHS, and finally to DVD. The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.<br/><br/>I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort, while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill, the film had a really strange documentary feeling, like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone, you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film, now that I edit and produce small independent films, and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in sci-fi/adventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick, and maybe the new Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but I'm not certain.<br/><br/>The amount of time and effort put into the comedy, adventure, and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing, almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark, as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion, and tighten it up, because I really think it wasn't coming together, however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective, but my point it that now in this modern filming era, the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.<br/><br/>I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards, skeletons in classrooms, proper patches on Nazi gear, gun accuracy. Research the film's era and background, and it only gets better. That's the ability that Spielberg and Lucas have, attention to detail and clever twists on most of their bodies of work.<br/><br/>Watch this film again, it's worth it, I promise you."
"Li-1","Null","109","197","16 July 2003"," A wonderful movie, but I still prefer The Last Crusade.
","Rating: **** out of ****<br/><br/>There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.<br/><br/>There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.<br/><br/>The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.<br/><br/>As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.<br/><br/>Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)<br/><br/>I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list."
"MMacKK","10","92","166","25 December 2004"," The Best Trilogy Made
","The Indiana Jones series was the best series ever made, in my opinion. It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).<br/><br/>Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck)."
"HelloTexas11","7","15","23","14 May 2008"," still a lot of fun, but...
","I understand that I may be forgiven for not thinking 'Citizen Kane' is so great, but the following is cinematic heresy- I've decided I'm not that crazy about the Indiana Jones series. They're fun films, no doubt, and there are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours. I watched 'The Last Crusade' again not long ago, and last night I watched the first one. At the risk of stating the obvious, what 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' really has going for it is Harrison Ford and a couple of slam-bang action/special effects sequences. Well, you say, for cryin' out loud, isn't that enough? And yeah, I suppose it is. I've just found I'm not nearly as enamored of the series as I once thought I was, and each of the films has flaws that perhaps only become apparent on repeated viewings. The aspect of 'Raiders' that grates particularly each time I see it is Karen Allen's performance. I'm sorry, I don't find her funny or attractive or even interesting. I understand that the idea is for her to be a feisty tomboy, someone who speaks her mind and is ""more than a match"" (as they say) for Ford's Indy. But does that mean Allen's Marion has to be so utterly unattractive, in every sense? At times, she seems more like a gangly, socially-challenged thirteen-year-old who hasn't learned basic table manners yet and who snorts when she laughs. I don't know what's more annoying, her behavior or the fact that every male in the film seems to think she's gorgeous. Granted, she doesn't have any competition... that must be it. So there's that. The film of course was a trendsetter in many ways, resurrecting almost single-handedly the grand old adventure flick. The durable plot elements and (other) characters were made to seem fresh again, from the resourceful adventurer venturing to exotic lands to those most reliably evil of slimy villains, the Nazis. And there is a toughness to the first Indiana Jones movie that seems somewhat lacking in the other two. Both Sallah and Marcus Brody are real characters here, alternately serious and amusing. By the time we get to 'Last Crusade,' the two men are strictly comic relief, and Marcus in particular becomes a scatterbrained buffoon. The climax of 'Raiders,' when it finally comes, was something of a revelation (so to speak) at the time. This was the big payoff, and it didn't disappoint, though it's actually pretty brief. The face-melting and vaporous spirits (to be used to a much greater extent later in Spielberg's 'Poltergeist') had audiences wide-eyed with amazement. And then a clever little epilogue left cinema-goers feeling satisfied, that they'd really gotten their money's worth. I shared all those feelings when I first saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark;' as I said, it's only been the last two or three times I've watched it that I haven't been as blown away."

With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.<br/><br/>The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.<br/><br/>Overall a good action film for older families.  With an old fashioned feel, a great sense of fun, plenty of laughs and fantastic action scenes this deserves all the good reviews it gets."
"jazzest","3","79","164","19 July 2004"," Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s
","This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action."

","Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.<br/><br/>It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.<br/><br/>I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.<br/><br/>The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.<br/><br/>Do people really need permission to regress this badly?"

","Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Harrisson Ford obviously should have worked his acting better, which he happily did since that movie. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces.

He isn't alone in trying to get the ark, however, because a group of Nazis are looking to obtain the ark to control God. The special effects are good for the time, however, to anyone watching this movie now would think they are cheesy and fake. The plot is very good and keeps you watching, but I feel that some of the escapes Indiana Jones makes isn't really realistic at all. All in all this movie is good, but you have to keep in mind that it was made many years ago."

","With all due respect for the fans of this movie or any other Indiana Jones movie, but this wasn't what I expected. I found this to be a rather weak adventure film (and I like adventure films) and I personally don't consider this a classic.<br/><br/>The reason why this film didn't live up to my expectations is because I was hoping this to be a movie with great adventures and lots of fun, amusement and classic humor - you know, something like ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"". Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing. There are some good action scenes, but other than that it's not much of a movie."

"patboldt","10","5","7","27 February 2018"," Spielberg's Ultimate Adventure Movie
","Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie. <br/><br/>Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too."

","There are so many ways in which this film is perfect, most notably is the brilliant re-packaging of old-school action and war films; away from the James-Bond style of the late 60s; away from the Cold-War suspense and intrigue. One of the most endearing features of the picture is that the movie opens with the main character,Indiana Jones' at the close of his current adventure. The technique generates an immediate sense of personal history and intimacy with the main character, and in effect, serves the audience dessert twice.The atmosphere of equal parts impending danger and chronic screw ups is set right from the start, with a lit-fuse pace throughout the movie. Every scene is tight. The sound, the lighting, the dialog,the music, the performances. Every character actor is well-chosen.

Those were the best bits. Because then you have the totally random ending that turns your laughter into a WTF expression.<br/><br/>The characters are paper-thin - not to mention Spielberg's obsession with the Germans (or anyone non-American or non-Jewish) who have to be depicted as either superevil or superstupid.<br/><br/>Unintentionally funny, totally predictable and a waste of money and film.

"s_daad","1","51","122","25 October 2010"," A hero for the New Agers
","I watched this film on the opening night, and I was extremely perplexed walking out. The first thing that puzzled me was how on earth the film got away with a PG rating. I figured it this way. It was trying to be a kids adventure film, but was so poor that it needed to compensate through over the top violence and horror. So my puzzlement was how on earth Lucas and Spielberg managed to bend the arms of the censors to get their PG rating, which allowed them to keep on marketing the film as children’s fare. And the other thing that puzzled me was that the movie was over before it had even started. I hadn’t noticed a story starting anywhere, so I was wondering how the movie could have finished. In other words, there was no film, just a blaze of action, and then suddenly the lights coming on. I heard someone comment on the way out, “I’ve never seen anything like that before.” I don’t know if she meant it in the same way as I did, but it was exactly my sentiment. I had never seen anything like that before! A film that’s not a film at all! Just an excuse to put one action sequence after another. In fact, the censors should have banned the film on account of its having no story. How could Lucas and Spielberg get away with this?! The overall impression I got was that there’s something very rotten going on in the film world now.<br/><br/>The above response was instantaneous, and it was before all the legend around this film had grown up. I didn’t think the film was going to be a hit. In fact, I thought it was going to fall flat on its face. But the film went on to break box-office records everywhere, and after the legend had cemented, I started to have different feelings. I reasoned that I may have missed something the first time, and after reading the umpteenth glowing review the film began to look better in my memory. However a recent viewing helped to dispel all these false notions. It must be stated out and out. This film is bad!!! There’s nothing more to be said about it, but there’s a lot to be said about the audience. I think it’s high time that we said a few things about the “movie brats” and the popular appeal that they court. The thing started proper with Star Wars in 1977, and this is where the Raiders phenomenon begins really. Star Wars is an equally bad movie, but it had a few things going for it. It was presented as a myth, or fairy tale, for the modern age, and it worked too. Three reasons for this. One, the groundbreaking special effects gave it an epic quality, exactly in keeping with the space mythology being presented. Two, the Hollywood narrative was totally disbanded, giving way for an episodic structure. This helped the myth-making, because without a narrative drive people could read whatever they liked into the movie. And three, the notion of an omnipotent “force”, with both a good and dark side, captured the imagination of a world moving towards “new ageism”. So, Star Wars started it all, and the “new age” of the Hollywood blockbuster had begun. These films don’t rely on the traditional virtues of film anymore. Their aim is no wow audiences with something else, more specifically, the expensive, special effects laden set piece. They cater to the New Age mindset of “me me me”. People don’t go to the watch the stories of other people anymore. They go to participate in the megalomania of the filmmakers who were making inflated films with inflated budgets and inflated subjects. It was the “me me me” for the filmmakers, and the vicarious “me me me” for the viewers. In short, the pornography of self worth. And Raiders is only another early landmark in this trend.<br/><br/>Lucas and Spielberg claim to be reviving the B movie adventure serials of the thirties, but there is something horribly ingenuous here. B movies are cheaply done, purely escapist, and never meant to draw attention to themselves. A film like Raiders does nothing but draw attention to itself. It’s only an excuse to use the episodic structure, so that one set-piece can be followed by another without worrying about character or plot. But all this doesn’t explain why Raiders became so popular. I guess the secret lies in the hero – Indiana Jones. When Star Wars kicked off the whole thing, there was an epic but no hero. Luke Skywalker is in no sense a hero. Only Hans Solo has a semblance of heroic about him, but was much too roguish. I guess the original idea was to get Harrison Ford a new vehicle so that he could be a braver and less cynical Hans Solo. So that’s my theory. Raiders is only a continuation of Star Wars, supplying the hero which the first film sorely lacked. So Indiana Jones comes along, and the definitive American hero for the “new age” is born. He is up to his neck in Hollywood excess and that’s all that matters.<br/><br/>So don’t be fooled by all these reviews here that praise this film to the skies, calling it escapist fun. There may have been some thrills for the audience back in 1981, but most of the excitement was from the audacity of breaking with tradition, ignoring story and engagement with the characters, concentrating on spectacle and excess, and participating in an experience of concerted megalomania. After Star Wars, this film really cemented the ground for Hollywood excess. Most of the people here are not judging the film itself. When people say that Star Wars is good, I think they are in their New Age pious mood. The same sort of thing when they say that Raiders is good."

","In 1936, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and adventurer, is hired by the US government to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, rumoured to be buried in a hidden vault somewhere in Egypt. His quest takes him first to Nepal to recover a key artefact, and then to Cairo in a desperate race against time to find the Ark before Nazi agents also hunting it.<br/><br/>For me, this is simply the best action film ever made. This film just roars along at an incredible speed, and it has everything in it - secret temples, tarantulas, Injuns, bar brawls, romance, Egyptology, Nazis, pompous Frenchmen, street fights, monkeys, buried treasure, snakes, car chases, pirates, submarines, the wrath of God and government coverups. I mean, what more could anybody honestly want ? The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, from an original (well, sort-of) idea by George Lucas, is just terrific but it's the sheer frenetic pace of the film that just sweeps you along - the story never stops for anything. It's a textbook model of how to cut all the flab out of a movie until there's just the good stuff left. The genius of the film is of course the genius of the great Steven Spielberg, with his unique combination of absolute technical mastery of the medium and his amazing capacity to entertain, but the sheer talent of the people behind him are what make this arguably his best film. John Williams' score is perhaps his best, with the most memorable of any of his great themes and entire sequences (the map room, the truck chase, the final ceremony) just awash in marvellously atmospheric music. The stuntwork (Glenn Randall, Peter Diamond, Terry Leonard, Vic Armstrong) is the best I've seen in any movie, and Deborah Nadoolman's wonderful costumes, Ben Burtt's sound effects and the special effects by Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson and Chris Walas are simply fabulous. You can't have a great movie without great performances, and the entire cast bring such a sense of fun and enthusiasm to their characters that they are impossible to resist. This is Ford's classic hero performance - he fits into Indiana Jones seamlessly and somehow manages to be lovable, heroic, scruffy and noble all at the same time. Allen punches and kicks her way through the film with terrific aplomb and still manages to also be a classical romantic heroine. Freeman, Davies and Elliott all devour their roles with gusto and Lacey is indisputably the best, and I mean the best, Sinister Nazi ever to grace the screen. Despite what any critics might say, movies always have and always will be about one main thing - telling a story in pictures. This movie is a deliriously brilliant piece of visual storytelling with an unbeatable capacity to entertain. Outstanding."

","Here it is, February of 2005 and I had yet to see Raiders Of The Lost Ark (or the other 2 in the trilogy for that matter). For some reason, it did not appeal to me. I did not get into movies until the early '90s and never got around to seeing it. However, upon urging of my friend I decided to rent it. I have to give credit where credit is due. Indiana Jones paves the way for the Tomb Raiders and other various movies of the same type.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a doctor in archeology who teaches at a college and in his spare time, finds rare artifacts and saves the world from Nazis. In this case, he is trying to find the Ark Of The Covenant, which at one time held the original Ten Commandments that Moses chiseled into the stone tablets. The Nazis, along with help from Jones' arch rival Rene Belloq, are trying to find the Ark for their own purposes. Along the way, Indiana meets up with a woman named Marion (Karen Allen), who he jilted in the past, which is not really explained in this movie but they end up helping each other in the search for the Ark.<br/><br/>The special effects and the action in Raiders Of The Lost Ark are exceptional, considering this was made in 1981. It set the bar reasonably high for action/adventure movies, even to this day as many movies are still compared to the Indiana Jones trilogy. It holds up well, considering most of the movies from the early 80's are very dated and hard to watch anymore. 8.5/10"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","8","14","2 June 2008"," First and still the best (spoilers)
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action masterpiece. There's not one bit of fat on its bones. There's not one wasted moment. It flows exactly like an adventure movie should  it continually moves forward, breathlessly driving you towards the conclusion; it's incredible fun.<br/><br/>The reason why the film works so well is because the script is so tight. The exposition is clear and well delivered, meaning that you know precisely what's at stake, small character details are set up early on and paid off later and the dialogue is incredibly pithy. It's a masterclass in film writing.<br/><br/>However, this would mean nothing if all the other elements didn't come together. Thankfully they do. Spielberg's direction is superb, Harrison Ford is perfect as the hero, Karen Allen is wonderful as the heroine and the music is out of this world. Plus the action is kick ass. <br/><br/>My favourite action scene is the fight with Pat Roach by the plane. Quite unusually for a film hero, Indy doesn't mind fighting dirty. He kicks Roach in the balls, he throws sand in his face and he even bites him. Indy doesn't have to win a fight fairly. And it's also unusual for a film hero to be so vulnerable. We rarely see anyone get a scratch or put in any real jeopardy. But here Indy gets his arse handed to him. The only reason he survives is because he's so wily  after getting beaten and bruised for a while he leads Roach into getting chopped up by the plane's rotor blades.<br/><br/>My second favourite action sequence is when Indy chases after the Ark and recovers it by hijacking a Nazi truck. After the CGI mess of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's great to see old-fashioned stunts. It's a much better way of letting you get absorbed by the action  even though you know it's a film, you know someone actually had to do this, making everything much more impressive to watch. The best stunt is when Indy is thrown through the front window and has to pull himself along the bottom of the truck. He manages to do this and then hooks his whip under the bottom so that he's dragged along the ground. He then manages to get back on the truck and back in the cabin. It's a joy to behold and allows you to immerse yourself in the action. <br/><br/>Another great thing about the sequence is that once again we're shown Indy's vulnerability. As he's driving he gets shot in the arm. And then later a guy punches him in his injured arm and throws him out of the truck. Therefore when Indy comes back and beats the crap out of this guy, it's doubly satisfying, because not only is the guy a damn Nazi, but he also had the audacity to try and injure our hero. And the blood and guts reminds me of how gritty the film is. Not only do we have Indy getting shot in the arm and then having the wound beaten, but earlier on a guy gets shot in the face  lots of blood pours down from the hole in his skull. Oh, and he's also on fire. Excellent. <br/><br/>But as well as this there's also stuff that is just plain over the top. The melting faces for instance and Belloq's head exploding. This scared the hell out of me as a kid and I'm still amazed that stuff like this was included in a 'kids' film.<br/><br/>However, the scene that terrified me the most as a kid was the scene where Marion gets mugged by skeletons and we then see a large snake oozing from a skull's mouth. I was so traumatised I refused to watch the film for years. But now the vague horror element is another reason I adore the movie. It sets it apart from almost every action/adventure film that came before it and nothing else has managed to better it, even subsequent Indiana Jones films. <br/><br/>But watching the film now it's quite unusual to note that Indy doesn't kill any of the three main villains. They're all killed by the Ark. Indy instead just closes his eyes and lets 'god' do the rest. It's a strange ending but one that works perfectly. Indy isn't a killing machine. He's someone trying to do the right thing. And at the end he's rewarded by, well, not having his face melted off.<br/><br/>Another reason why Raiders stands out is because of its heroine. She's one of the best in modern cinema  a tough woman who constantly shows her toughness without having to resort to ridiculous feats of physicality. We don't see her pummel men who are twice her size, but we do see her out smart them and drink them under the table. As well as this she has great chemistry with Indy. For instance, there's the marvellous scene where she tries to look after our injured hero and he cries like a girl every time she touches him. He then points out a few places where it doesn't hurt, which she kisses. It's a lovely scene. And I also like the bit of slapstick humour earlier where Indy gets a mirror smashed in his face when Marion turns it over. <br/><br/>This leads me to another reason why Raiders is brilliant. It's very funny. You have a monkey giving a Nazi salute, Indy nonchalantly shooting a swordsman, Sallah's cowardly reactions at the Well of Souls and the Gestapo man plunging his hand in the snow after he gets it burnt while trying to grab an extremely hot bronze medallion. The humour is great.<br/><br/>And on top of all of this cinematic goodness  the humour, the action, the adventure  you have one of the best opening sequences in film. It's a bravura piece of film-making  everything clicks perfectly."

","Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.<br/><br/>Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.<br/><br/>Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. René Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!!

","I'm not going to spend much time on this as I am obviously in a massive minority by not liking it. It's taken me 20 years to finally see this film through to the end.<br/><br/>It just bores me completely. It's a part James Bond film, which I've never had any time for. It doesn't seem any better than the 'Mummy' or 'Tomb Raider' type films (ZZZZZZ) where the dialogue is largely incidental & which you can watch with the volume turned down and still follow. They generally concern some pre-historic torch, urn, key, lump of dog turd, that has special powers, that the hero needs to get his hands on & that just doesn't make for an interesting film.<br/><br/>I just cannot get into films like this & never have any interests whether they achieve what they're after. In this there were a lot of scenes which seemed to be filling in time. First the Nazi's had the initiative, then Jones, then back to the Nazi's again and this went on & on & on, to the point that it wasn't dis-similar from a Steven Seagal or Van Damme film. Apart from the obvious superior quality of acting in this, the fighting scenes were sometimes laughable.<br/><br/>Karen Allen threw in some incredibly wooden acting in her cliched lines she was given. The ""I'm your partner"" was almost cringe making.<br/><br/>There seems an unwritten rule that you are not allowed to comment on Raiders of the Lost Ark without mentioning Star Wars for some reason. So I love Harrison Ford films, I like George Lucas & certainly don't dislike Spielberg. Thus, I have Star Wars as one of only a dozen films in my list at 10/10, it's almost perfect. I myself, wouldn't mention this in the same breath as Star Wars. You immediately feel a part of Star Wars & it's wonderful characters, neither of which apply here.<br/><br/>This film has never taken off in England to the extent it has done in the US.

"gab-14712","10","3","4","2 March 2019"," One of My All Time Favorites!
","Steven Spielberg is back, better than ever! After the dismal failure that was 1941, the acclaimed director teamed up with George Lucas, coming off his Star Wars fame to create one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie from 1981 and is in my top 20 films of all time. This movie gives everything you could ask for. Strong, memorable characters, witty dialogue, fantastic set pieces, exotic locations, great action, and a John Williams musical theme you could never forget. Indiana Jones is my favorite fictional hero and this movie is the example why I believe that.<br/><br/>This movie has fascinating origins. George Lucas was writing this movie the same time he came up with the idea for Star Wars. He decided to pursue his space adventure instead to great success. In 1978, while on vacation in Hawaii, he ran into Steven Spielberg, who was coming off Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg expressed his idea of creating a James Bond movie. Lucas showed him his character, which was named Indiana Smith at first, thus creating a collaboration which would lead to this movie and two sequels and a prequel. The film also takes influence from the works of Edgar Burroughs Rice, 1930's serials, and a 1950's comic about a globe-trotting duck named Scrooge McDuck.<br/><br/>This movie really has it all. With Spielberg and Lucas at the head, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan joined the project to help polish the script. Together they created memorable heroes in Indiana Jones, an archaeology professor who travels the world to protect or find ancient artifacts and his former girlfriend Marion who is strong female character who is able to protect herself. For villains, we have the horrible Nazis, drunken Sherpas, Frenchmen making alliances with the Nazis, and Jones's favorite animal, snakes! He hates snakes! For locations: we have the sands of Egypt, abandoned submarine bases, the jungles of Peru, the mountains of Tibet, and so forth. If you want a travelling experience from your own living room, look no further than this movie.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the plot. The plot is simple and really is a framework for all the impressive action scenes and stunts there are. But in the end, everything is coherent and makes plenty sense. It is the year 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) learns from his good friend, Brody (Denholm Elliot) that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, a golden casket that was used to house the Ten Commandments. It has also been known that this arc is able to give power to those who wield it. Jones's mission? To reach the Ark before the Nazis do. He goes to Tibet to pick up Marion (Karen Allen) who has a medallion that has a secret to the location of the Ark. Together, they head to that location where they will try to beat the Nazis-and scheming Frenchmen at their own game.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent. What is funny that when Spielberg/Lucas did the casting, Spielberg wanted Harrison Ford from the get-go, but Lucas was against his casting because he did not want Ford to be is ""Bobby De Niro"" which is in reference to Martin Scorsese always casting Robert De Niro in his films. In retrospect, I do not think anyone could have pulled this role off like Harrison Ford did. Ford was brilliant and created a memorable character with his iconic performance. He is kind and intelligent character, but he can be ruthless at times. However, he is charming. Charm may be the one word that can describe Indiana Jones. I really dug Karen Allen's performance. A strong-willed character with the ability to protect herself. I liked the villainous performances from the slimy Nazis. Paul Freeman as Dr. Rene Belloq as the scheming Frenchman who happens to be Jones's rival, and Ronald Lacey as the incredibly slimy Nazi, Toht.<br/><br/>Even in today's cinematic world, the visual effects and the action sequences stand out. I honestly cannot say what I liked the most since everything was so well-done! The opening sequence set forth what to expect in this movie. That boulder chasing Jones is an amazing sequence. That chase scene is great as well, and it makes good use of an old, classic joke! Another sequence that stood out to me is when Jones and Marion are holding on to dear life in the pit of snakes. That was a scene that let you feel real horror. And don't get me started on the face-melting sequences! I am still in awe what the special effects team did with this film.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that spawned a franchise that is still going strong today. Adventure stories with some history mixed in are my kind of stories. I like travelling to these exotic locations through these characters. This film has a unique balance of comedy, action, stunts, and adventure. When Nazis are your villains, this is how they should be used. As slimy creatures that can get their butts handed to them by Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"
"bigboybhatia","6","12","25","1 January 2004"," Extremely overrated movie
","I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, after having seen the last 2 parts of the trilogy some years ago.  I was quite disappointed overall.  The opening was entertaining and strong, but then the movie fell into a horribly boring sequence.  It picks up again during the truck chase sequence, before leaving us with a ridiculously supernatural ending.  That was a let-down for a movie where everything else was reasonably realistic.<br/><br/>Another point I wanted to mention is I can't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating.  The amount of gratuitous violence is almost overwhelming.  The body count racked up by the end of the movie is probably greater than all of the Friday the 13th movies put together.  Granted, the amount of violence is equal to many action movies out today, but they don't have PG-13 ratings. The camera lingers on mutilated faces, gallons of blood are thrown around, and countless numbers of faceless Arabs and Nazis are killed or injured. Not exactly family material.<br/><br/>The few exciting action sequences here save this movie from being a total wreck, but I can't seen any justification for this movie's current position in the top 20 movies of all time.  Maybe the sentimental factor is the reason."

","All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one was still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, famous scenes - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.<br/><br/>The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here. <br/><br/>This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.<br/><br/>Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.<br/><br/>After a long wait, this finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!"
"heynomiu","4","17","39","16 January 2008"," It's just an average movie.
","About a couple of years back I started renting movies from IMDb top 250 and ROLA certainly doesn't belong there. It's just an average movie with a thin plot and some comic element thrown here and there. I'm not a big James Bond fan, but this is still nowhere near James Bond movies. The hero practically does nothing in the movie except chasing around treasures and losing them to people. He started with the golden thing in the beginning and lost it to Belloq. He couldn't save the girl from the blast in the truck and yet she is falling for him. He discovered the ark but lost it to the Nazis, tried to gain it back in a lame chase sequence but all in vain because .... guess what ... he lost it to the Nazis again. The Germans after recapturing it, opened it up out of curiosity only to be killed by the powers within the ark. All this while our Mr. Indiana Jones and his girlfriend were tied to a pole avoiding ""looking"" at anything that happened.<br/><br/>Apart from finding the ark Mr. Jones had no major role to play in the entire movie other than the fact that it had to last for two hours. And being a prominent historian he was helped by some local guy to solve the mystery of the location of the ark by reading stuff off a medallion. Not to mention, he was about to eat a poisoned 'date' only to be saved by Sallah. So the only powers our great Mr. Jones had include - a sense of timing, dressing up in a rugged style (including a beard which he grew all of a sudden even though he landed in Nepal clean shaved) and a funny bone which popped up occasionally but far too spread out.<br/><br/>The only positive part of the movie was its opening which was strong but then they lost it.<br/><br/>Sure it paved ways for future adventure movies and it was one of its kind, but it was plain average."

I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.<br/><br/>With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies: <br/><br/><ul><li>the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber man </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the thin plot.

They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the movie </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles.

Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatings </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>all the sequels.

The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market.

Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the ironic ending</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema."

","There are critics who point fingers at Raiders - and Jaws, and Star Wars - because, regardless of their quality, these movies kickstarted the new wave of setpiece-focused blockbusters, with a detrimental effect on Hollywood. However, Raiders is no more responsible for The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor than J.R.R. Tolkien is to blame for The Sword of Truth, Bram Stoker for Twilight, or Isaac Asimov for Transformers. <br/><br/>There is a main factor which makes Raiders a timeless masterpiece and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a piece of garbage: RESTRAINT. <br/><br/>Consider the elegance of action scenes. Spielberg's setpieces here are stylish, kinetic, with attention to spatial relationships, cause and effect. Every action by the hero has a direct result on his surroundings, and vice versa (see the legendary prologue, the iconic truck scene). Practical effects and stunts allow for a realistic, gritty feel... which is lost when you indulge in absurd acrobatics and frames cluttered by CGI stuff (hello, Star Wars prequels!).<br/><br/>In Raiders, the protagonist gets dusty, bloody, beaten up: every battle takes a PHYSICAL TOLL on him, much like in the first Die Hard (while in the last ones John McClaneis essentially a superhero, which DEFIES THE WHOLE POINT of it). If action has visible consequences, it's compelling. On the other hand, show our hero slamming on a hard surface after a fifty feet fall and walking away without a bruise (hello, Hobbit trilogy!), and everything INSTANTLY becomes boring. <br/><br/>And then we have the ""Grandpa Syndrome"", which pushes aged directors to film movies their grandchildren ""can watch too"" - laudable for family comedies, often disastrous for other genres (hello, Greedo shooting first!).<br/><br/>The plot shows restraint as well. Everything is trimmed down, elegantly simple. A clear goal (find the Ark). High stakes (if the Nazis find it first, they will gain terrible powers). Non-stop tension: Indy and Marion are constantly chased, on the run, at disadvantage, out of time (much like Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back and unlike in the SW prequels). Every scene advances the plot, every dialogue defines characters; there is not a single wasted frame or line.<br/><br/>Of course, credits goes also to the fantastic script by Kasdan, with its quotable lines and the most wickedly ironic ending in action cinema; to Ford's effortlessly charismatic turn; to John Williams' soundtrack, which is the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>A classic all directors and scriptwriters should revisit before inflating their blockbusters with useless bloat. Raiders works as well now as it did thirty years ago... while Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Attack of the Clones, The Desolation of Smaug and A Good Day to Die Hard feel already stale.<br/><br/>10/10"

","There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.<br/><br/>Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical ""ark of the covenant."" Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.<br/><br/>For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.<br/><br/>Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest/ damsel in distress.<br/><br/>The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.<br/><br/>In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema."

Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.<br/><br/>In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.<br/><br/>Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.<br/><br/>Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy cliché is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill. <br/><br/>It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teeny–tiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to ""save me Indy"" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies. 10/10"
"bkoganbing","9","4","7","12 June 2008"," The Ark Should Have Come With A Warning Label
","Raiders of the Lost Ark marked the debut of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, two fisted archaeologist with a mean bull whip. The film also reawakened a longing in the American public for some good old fashioned pulp fiction adventure even if it is done tongue slightly in cheek.<br/><br/>Archeology certainly is a competitive business, but I think Indiana Jones takes it to an exponential level. He certainly has to when he's dealing with the up and coming German Reich. <br/><br/>What they and Jones are after is high stakes indeed. Both have a lead on where the Ark of the Covenant might be buried. It was spirited away after the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, whereabouts unknown until the 1930s. <br/><br/>As the Good Book tells us the Kingdom of Israel was undefeated as long as the Ark was ahead of them in battle. So even with the Nazis rather well known policy about Jews, they'd like to have this thing with whatever powers it has.<br/><br/>It's a pretty delicate matter. If you remember a soldier of King David was struck down for just touching the Ark as it was about to fall. You can catch that in the Gregory Peck-Susan Hayward film, David and Bathsheba. It should definitely come with a warning label. <br/><br/>Anyway, Ford ably assisted by Karen Allen, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies goes after it and has to battle the Nazis for possession. As for the Nazis, it's like that old adage of being careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated for several Oscars and came away with a few in the 1982 ceremony for 1981's films. After almost thirty years it's still rollicking good entertainment.<br/><br/>As for Karen Allen and Harrison Ford. Go see Indiana Jones chasing down that Crystal Skull in theaters now if you want to find out what happened with these two."

","Been meaning to see this film for about twenty years and finally made time for it. What a disappointment. Its just wilfully stupid all the way through, the ""plot"" was thought out in the length of the average bowel movement and makes absolutely no sense. Nazis are digging for an artefact, Indiana has to stop them finding it. In reality they were looking in the wrong place and he actually found it for them. But then he manages to steal it back. Then they manage to steal it back and it kills them all anyway, and somehow he is the celebated hero who somehow accomplished something? Take him out of the equation and either the Nazis would have never found the artefact or they would have found it and all died exactly as happened. Wtf who thinks that is a plot?! Every scene was absurd and not thought through. Ridiculous coincidences outside of the usual allowed formulaic action move tropes, like 1000s of people at the dig site and no one keeping watch at night, not one person is awake? Was that a submarine or wasn't it? If it was why didn't it go underwater while he was riding on the top on a long journey? And why was no one up there with him? And the ark melts everyone who looks at it but because he kept his eyes closed he was safe, but the rope binding them conveniently burnt off anyway? Also, this one is inconsequential but annoying, she beat the guy at the drinking game because he passed out on his last drink, but he was just a turn ahead and she never finished that round either so why did she win? The movie was just mind numbing and tedious and seemed to treat the viewer as having half a brain cell. Worse than the worst of Hollywood dreck, why does it have such a following?"

","As in ""Big Budget B"" Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse ""Casablanca"" interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of ""Lost Horizons"" (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even ""King Solomon's Mines"" is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners (""I'm making this up as I go along"") and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and ""Raiders"" is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or ""Lone Ranger"" or ""Perils of Pauline"" adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film. The success of the franchise assured, here are some ideas for sequels: ""Raiders of the Declaration of Independence,"" ""Indiana Jones & George Washington's False Teeth,"" and ""The Hunt for Lenin's Embalmed Remains."""
"johnterrell-67238","10","3","5","3 September 2019"," My Favorite Movie of All Time
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect movie in my eyes. Everything about it is timeless, from the amazing score, action, characters, dialogue, romance, writing, direction, comedy, and even a little horror, this movie excels at everything. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones. He embodies everything this classic character is and anyone else playing him would've likely looked silly. Karen Allen plays the role of a lifetime with Marion Craine, and so does Paul Freeman who played the unforgettable antagonist, Rene Belloq. The whole cast is flawless. This movie also have my favorite score of all time. John Williams sweeping theme song is the cherry on top to an already incredible movie. The script here is also amazing. Lawrence Kasdan took the already great story crafted by George Lucas and Phillip Kaufman and made it into something truly incredible. However most importantly, Steven Spielberg's directing. Every scene is this movie is memorable and I give most of the credit there to Spielberg himself. This is arguably the best directing he's ever done. If you couldn't tell I love Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is the movie that got me intrigued in the art of filmmaking and it inspires me to try to strive high. I recommend this movie to anybody because it is truly a lot of fun. This movie is great and it is my favorite film ever made."

"stormhawk2019","10","3","5","19 June 2017"," A great blockbuster
","In 1975, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman came up with the concept of a film that would pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 40's like ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" or ""Dick Tracy"" - you know, the one's were they'd always end in a cliffhanger? However, this idea was put on hold so that Lucas could concentrate on ""Star Wars"" in 1977. After the surprise success of that film, Lucas then embarked on the proposal and enlisted the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay and gave his friend Steven Spielberg the chance to direct and prove the studio bosses wrong after the star-studded, monumental failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", a couple of years previously. This meeting of minds resulted in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has since became one of cinema's most revered and iconic film's. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a renowned archaeologist who is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant - a chest the Hebrews carried around containing the Ten Commandments. Indy is not the only one after the Ark, though, as he soon crosses paths with Hitler's Nazi's, also intent in getting their hands on the artifact. Classic Adventure film of the very highest caliber. In fact, it's hard to argue that this isn't the one to beat in terms of sheer indulgence and escapist entertainment. I grew up with Indiana Jones and there are very few characters or films who have had such a direct or major influence on my love for the cinematic art-form. It's difficult to find the words for Raiders that haven't already been said. Quite simply, it's a true action spectacle that's unparalleled and stands as one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. He's a director that's, rightly, regarded as one of Hollywood finest filmmakers and you don't have to look much further than this film to see why. With one hair raising set-piece after another, Spielberg keeps the action relentless and fully realizes a romanticize pastiche of the aforementioned serials' clichÃ©d plot elements and devices. Of course, what aides immeasurably in bringing it all together, is a perfectly committed and physical performance from the leading man. Contrary to popular belief, Harrison Ford was the first choice for Indy. Well... it was in Spielberg's eyes, anyway. It was Lucas who wanted to cast someone else as he wanted to create a little distance from Ford having already worked with him on ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" and as common knowledge would have it, Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Unfortunately for him, though, he was already committed to the television series ""Magnum P.I."" which resulted in Ford securing, what would become, his signature role. I think it's fair to say that Ford has never exactly been praised for his acting range. Sure, he's certainly able to deliver some wonderful work; his powerful turn in ""The Mosquito Coast"" and his Oscar nominated performance in ""Witness"" are proof of this but his portrayal of Indiana Jones is absolutely spot on. He captures the requisite charm, wit and smarts to win you over. He exaggerates his facial expressions to the point of parody and completely sweeps the audience up in his heroic adventures. Even though he's the hero of the story, Ford never let's you think for a second that he's infallible or indestructible. Every scrape, punch or altercation still feels like it could be Indy's last and that's a fabulous achievement when you pretty much get the gist of the film's formula or structure. Considered one of the best films ever made and, to this day, remains one of the highest grossing. It went on to win four Academy Awards out of nine nominations and these accolades alone speak for themselves. I, for one, couldn't argue with any of them."

","A rip-roaring adventure with lots of hand-to-hand battles and plenty of guns means only one thing: entertainment for the whole family! There's not too much blood and gore, but it's still way up there in the body count department. Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and nasty villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound. Throughout the film, there is a parade of anti-Nazi symbolism and sly religious satire. Harrison Ford is the embodiment of Indiana Jones -- dry, fearless, and as indestructible as a cartoon coyote. The female lead in an Indiana Jones movie is sort of an honorary boy, no more sexual than the girls in boys' adventure magazines, although Marian can more than take care of herself and is not helpless in the face of danger. The special effects, astonishing at the time, are still amazing, and Lucas' experience of ""Star Wars"" is visible. The movie is just plain fun."

","I confess, in all the ruckus and commotion over Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull I lost sight of what really mattered and what really brought out my inner child. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the finest films ever made and do I dare say Spielberg's masterpiece? Yes I'm aware that Schindler's List is the better film but quality can be measured in so many different ways. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford first dons the fedora here and at first glance we can tell that this is his prized role and the one he will forever be loved for. Indiana Jones is a superhero but he is a superhero who can captures the movie goer's imaginations and hearts in a way that Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man could only do in his wildest dreams. The audience admires Indiana Jones because is brave, he's intelligent, he is the personification of the ideal romantic hero and most of all he is human in ways we can identify with. There's just something that all fits together about this picture. It is one of the few films that has truly grasped onto my inner child and imagination. Never has an adventure been as grand as it is Raiders. <br/><br/>Karen Allen is as important to this film's success as Ford's. She is the perfect love interest for Indiana Jones because she brings out the best qualities in him. She like Jones is spunky and full of the adventurous ambition. She isn't baggage and she quite often gives our hero a run for his money. She like Indy is also very human and likable. The romance here is real. It's hard to imagine real love and romance in an adventure film but it is real. We liked Marion Ravenwood as Indy's love interest because the scenes between her and Indiana Jones showed love in all the deepness and emotional conviction it has, and it didn't show us James Bond's make love and throw away love. The love in Raiders is as close to the real emotion as your going to get to in these types of films..<br/><br/>I really think the plot here is the best of the series of Jones films, all though it really isn't fair comparing the sequels to this simply because ""This IS history"". Hitler wanting the most sacred of Jewish artifacts to conquer the world is one of the most inspired premises of well, any film. We have the romantic hero in Indiana Jones but we also have evil in the form of the Nazis. The cult of personality surrounding Hitler stays with you. I consider myself to be smart and sensible and I don't get afraid much but the stock footage of Nazi rallies really scare the hell out of me. The Nazis were one of the must vile cults to ever exist and if any thing could embody modern day evil it would be them. Like Indy the villains are to be taken very seriously. By no means are the Nazis in Raiders cut out villains. Even our chief antagonist Rene Belloq is hesitant to ally himself to them, he says it is a necessary evil.<br/><br/>Execution is key to Raider's success. The script is intelligent but it also shows that it's roots where planted by the serials of the 30's. Spielberg and company take the material as serious as the grave. Nothing is played for laughs or shock value for the sake of laughs or shock value. In creating a homage to the classic serials, Spielberg actually outdid them and set a new unreachable high standard for the adventure/action flick.<br/><br/>I love the story of Indiana Jones' humble origins. Say what you will about George Lucas but steering Spielberg away from doing a James Bond film and pointing him toward this direction is one of the defining moments of cinematic history. Before you take the kids to see fun popcorn film Crystal Skull show them the cinematic master piece Raiders of the Lost Ark."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark stars Harrison Ford and is directed by Steven Spielberg. Raiders of the Lost Ark follows Indiana Jones as he races against the Nazis to obtain the Lost ark of the covenant. Fresh off of completing Star Wars George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came up with this idea as they were on vacation. And instead of forgetting about it the next day or creating a ""movie of the week"" that nobody would care about, they actually decided to let their imaginations run wild. Now I'm sure that before they created Raiders of the Lost Ark they saw a lot of movies involving treasure hunting and decided to give it a makeover. And from their they decided to turn something that sounds like it came out of a B movie and transformed it into an A++ movie after the project was finished. But Raiders of the Lost Ark is The Godfather of treasure hunting movies and all the treasure hunting movies are good, but they don't have that passion and majestic as Raiders of the Lost Ark offers. I should also add that it's also the inspiration for many movies and video games over the years and has been referenced in many pop cultures. You can not turn on the T.V. And having someone reference Indiana Jones or the scenes that gave birth to countless of directors and writers imitating those scenes. This movie and Star Wars were the first movies to open my eyes to many movies to come. And there are many movies out there that brilliantly fantastic, but Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were the first to do that. Besides Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and John Williams, I don't know if the other crew who were in Star Wars also were involved in making this. I would like to think so as they borrow elements from Star Wars such as music, special effects, costumes, to just about anything you can think of and then it into something simple and easy without anything being over dramatic. I also applaud Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for having the ability to create one movie that blew people's minds and creating another movie with an iconic character for many years that people wish they could be. Because in the end who doesn't want to be Indiana Jones? So in the end every thing about this move is pure cinematic perfection that is worth exploring again and again."

","I can certainly understand why this film has such a cult following. The direction by Spielberg is as good as you'd expect, with some particularly incredible stunt choreography. This is probably one of the cleanest looking films of the eighties, drenched in vivid colour and containing some dazzling special effects. And of course the John Williams score is iconic and perfectly fitted to the film. But it's Harrison Ford's performance that steals the show and is arguably the main reason for the popularity of the Indiana Jones series. He looks perfect for this role and delivers just the right balance of dryness and bravado, working well with a fairly unimpressive support cast.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I never found Raiders to be a particularly good story. It's all a bit excessive and farcical, and having a completely invulnerable lead character just devalues the action scenes.

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) is undoubtedly an iconic adventure classic. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrill ride, but some aspects leave a few things to be wanted. The editing during the movie's first half can be a bit choppy at times, and a few plot details throughout the film are somewhat illogical. The villains are quite one-dimensional, and a certain sequence has a very clear use of greenscreen as well. The more of a nitpicker one is, the more this will be bothering, but all aspects named can be overlooked with any major effort.<br/><br/>A warning should however be issued to those who are sensitive to blood and gruesome effects. The opening feature some stark images in this category, there is a shoot-out scene early on that doesn't shy away from this either, and the infamous ending is surprisingly brutal and gory when compared to the overall lighter mood of the movie. It has currently a PG rating, but a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate as the violence alone pushes the movie into R areas at said times.<br/><br/>Finally, the iconic status of Raiders of the Lost Ark derives mostly from its cult position as well as its 80's nostalgia. At the time, this was clearly groundbreaking in most of its areas, but today, its technical features are matched more and more often within the genre. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones' charisma still hits home, and ultimately, the portrayed adventures has maintained their excitements. Don't rush into to the following sequel at the cost of appreciating this one, as Temple of Doom fails drastically to deliver entertainment of the same level.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

Since there's nothing subtle about the story or the characters, and since the action plot zips along at the speed of light, viewers need not engage in any thinking.<br/><br/>With Jones as a surrogate for American virtuousness, ""foreigners"" in this film seem inept and villainous for the most part, a politically correct view for the era in which the film was made. American stereotypes aside, non-Americans are portrayed in the film mostly as clutter, film props for our hero to knock over.<br/><br/>It's all a bit much, a bit over-the-top. Not only is the story not believable, the story's theme is rather condescending. I despised the background music, annoyingly loud and manipulative. Acting is largely irrelevant, not surprising, given the film's genre.<br/><br/>In its defense, there are some good visual images. For example, I liked the scene of Jones, wearing his trademark hat, in silhouette, on a hill, back-lit by an orange sun. The film's color cinematography probably is its best element.<br/><br/>Otherwise, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is just one more in a long series of ""action"" movies for kids to drool over, a two hour cinematic ... cartoon. The script concept is silly; the characters are poorly defined; the plot is ridiculous; the score is annoying; and the American hero theme is very irritating."

","The adventure genre is born in this unforgettable, over-the-top classic from director Steven Spielberg. Set in 1936 comes this breathlessly action-packed story starring Harrison Ford as a brilliant and brash archaeologist recruited by the U.S. government to retrieve the sacred Ark of the Covenant, a mysterious religious artifact which may or may not be a source of unspeakable power. The result is the adventure of a lifetime as he confronts brutal Nazis, matches wits with an arch rival (Freeman), and tries to make amends with his lost love (Allen), all the while eluding venomous snakes, fierce booby traps, and every other death-defying stunt imaginable! Overflowing with notable fight scenes, memorable characters, spectacular visuals, and one fatal escape after another, this remarkable film single-handedly sets the standard for the adventure genre. Never a dull moment in this rousing extravaganza, a fun, creative film that you can enjoy again and again. ****"
"mentalcritic","Null","1","1","21 May 2001"," A classic adventure
","Maybe it's just me, but I always rooted for the bad guys in this classic adventure tale. Actually, I rooted for all the characters equally, but this is one of the few films where the bad guys are just as developed and three dimensional as the good guys. Even the sequences that didn't turn out exactly as intended (the death of the swordsman being the best example) are stellar moments in filmmaking.<br/><br/>Giving such a simple explanation of Adolf Hitler's fascination with religious relics was a bit of a cop-out (the man was actually raised in a Catholic family), but that was okay. This is a simple story and bogging it down in details would have been a mistake. This is why so many weapons, vehicles, and military divisions are shown in the film when they didn't exist for years after the film's date. All of these details are bent in order to serve the story, which is quite a compelling one at that. How could one not be fascinated by a race between good guys and bad guys to recover a relic that could save or destroy the world?<br/><br/>Then there's the score music. John Williams is generally about as subtle as a train wreck, but this works so well in favour of the film because the story has even less subtlety. I doubt that anyone who's seen this film can think of adventure films without thinking about that strangely appealing rhythm. Sure, it gets on your nerves after about a hundred or so repetitions, but varying it in accordance with the onscreen action is what makes John Williams' scoring style so compelling. There's very few composers in the world today who can match him in complementing the film.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones like he was born for the role. Hearing that the sword-swinging sequence was filmed the way it was because Harrison was suffering diahorrea on the shooting day was quite a revelation. I defy anyone to have picked that from watching the film without having been told so. His sense of humour about the whole production comes across in favour of the end result, too. When asked about safety concerns on the stunt sequences, he simply told the press that he wasn't concerned because they would have filmed more of the film first if he was in any danger. What a trooper.<br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark is worth of ten points, no question. It is one of the most enjoyable film's I've ever sat through. Just try and get the Indiana Jones theme out of your head after the film's over!"

","The most kickaxe action film of all time!  Indy Jones is one bad dude with just a hint of an antihero in his personality to give him that extra edge. I love that almost crazed look he gets in his eyes when he spies an ancient priceless artifact almost within his grasp.  No other action film has wowed me like this one.

"alindsay-al","10","3","6","18 September 2014"," easily one of my favourite films of all time
","In my opinion this film was revolutionary and changed the landscape for action films and forced directors to up their game with new franchises. This film sees adventurer Indiana Jones hired by the us government to find the ark of the covenant with help from his ex love Marion and his Egyptian ally salah before the Nazis led by Renee belloq an opposing archaeologist. Now Harrison ford as Indiana Jones is one of the most iconic roles ever and I love him in this role because of his charisma but also roughness that allow him to feel relatable to the audience. Also the supporting cast was really good as well with Karen Allen shining as Marion and her chemistry with Jones is superb and really helps the film feel natural. John Rhys Davies is also great as salah and he brings a sense of every day man and also a good comedic character that brings a lot of heart to the film. Another performance like that is the character of Marcus Brody Indies uni ally as he provides good comedic timing and a good chemistry with Jones and I'm glad he gets more to do in future films. Belloq was also a really good villain and was a good mirror for Jones in this already fantastic film. The story is great as well with the different strands of storytelling from the religious links to the ark, the relationship between Marion and Jones and also the Nazis vs Jones for the first time. It just works in ever way and this story gives me two of my favourite film moments ever with the rolling ball scene and also the black vailed ninja scene. The script is great with everybody having great dialogue and really making out a sense of realism within this sort of unrealistic story. Now the style of Indiana Jones is always positive with that awesomely iconic theme song to the iconic hat and whip, plus the unique opponent of the Nazis I think it really works. This is an epic film that really changed cinema and helped the industry"

","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is widely regarded as the quintessence of the adventure-action movie. However, there is so much to say about it is hard to understand how it can be such highly considered.<br/><br/>Everything isn't bad. There are, in particular, very good actions scenes such as the opening scene or the one in the temple with the snakes, and some well thought-out touches of humour. But we are under the impression that the plot is secondary, in fact you forget about it after some time, and that it is just a pretext for blowing us away with those action scenes, like blockbusters do nowadays.<br/><br/>The flaws are obvious, from the shallow characters to the choppy rhythm or the mediocre editing with a lot of jump cuts or continuity errors. A few extremely far-fetched scenes also discredit the movie.<br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark is therefore far from perfect and certainly cannot pretend to the rank of masterpiece some give it."

","It starts with a scene that would have us believe that an ancient civilization implemented a high-tech security system to safeguard an idol. Yes, the movie is exciting but the action is so utterly ridiculous that it makes James Bond films and ""The Road Runner"" cartoons look realistic. While it's understandable that one has to suspend disbelief when watching a film, the level of stupidity suggests that Spielberg has no respect for the viewer's intelligence. Scenes such as Jones's stunt under the moving vehicle and the revelation of the contents of the ark are sure to have any adult viewer rolling his eyes so often that there's danger of collapsing from dizziness."

"sddavis63","4","5","14","7 December 2009"," Preposterous Fun
","To state the obvious strengths of the movie right off the top: it's a good action-adventure movie, light-hearted even when managing to deal with sinister Nazis, with a fun lead character. Those things in and of themselves score this movie a few points, and one has to give credit for the fact that it really did set the pattern for the modern genre of action-adventure movies. It also established Harrison Ford (who was primarily known for his supporting role as Han Solo from ""Star Wars"" at the time this was made) as an action-adventure leading man (he does these parts well; I find him perhaps a bit dry when he takes on more substantive roles) although it may not establish him as an ""actor"" per se, since the part of Indiana Jones really isn't a dramatic part that would stretch or test an actor's ability. It required ""presence"" rather than ""talent"" and Ford brought that presence to the part very well. So, yes, there's a lot of good material here, and yet I can't say that I really enjoyed this, in spite of the obvious fun contained within it.<br/><br/>The action-adventure elements are the key to this movie, and that being the case there's not enough, quite honestly. Between them, there are long stretches in which the story is told in a largely unconvincing and uninteresting manner - appropriate, I suppose, since the story itself is quite unconvincing. It might make for a good yarn, but someone still has to explain to me why Hitler would have been interested in finding the Jewish ""Ark of the Covenant."" I know it was explained at the outset that the Nazis wanted it because it contained great power and would make an army invincible, but one would have to believe the Jewish stories about it to believe that - and Hitler obviously didn't. Then as the movie reaches its climax, the power of the Ark is revealed in ridiculously supernatural terms. That aside, I found the romance between Indi and Marion (Karen Allen) uninteresting and largely unnecessary to the story, and the story itself to be such a wild ride that at times it just didn't seem to make sense to me.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm taking this too seriously. It is fun on a regular basis - even if it is somewhat preposterous. But I still just didn't really enjoy it. 4/10"

","I'll admit from the start of this review that I am bias. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is in my top 10 movies of all time.

I love it. <br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the first installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise to be released, though it is the second in internal chronological order. The story is filled with the standard elements, (good v's evil, old lovers reunite etc) but the movie is anything but standard.<br/><br/>It pits Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against a group of Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, which Adolf Hitler believes will make his army invincible. <br/><br/>I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones. Karen Allen, Paul Freeman as Indy's nemesis, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott all deserve special credit. <br/><br/>The action set pieces are superb, the humour hits the mark and the score is another valuable asset to the movie. <br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment. To put it bluntly, it is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. <br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the highest grossing movie of 1981, considering 'Superman 2' and the insanely popular Burt Reynolds led 'Cannonball Run' was released that year it's an even greater achievement. <br/><br/>Perfect entertainment"

","Never has there been- and most likely there will never be again, such an entertaining movie as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Even though I still regard ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" a better movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" remains the most entertaining one of the Indy movies.<br/><br/>The movie is a wonderfully constructed old fashioned adventure movie, with lots of action and comedy elements. Lots of traveling, exciting chase sequences, an imaginative story, fun fights, a good main character, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has got all the elements in it to make a movie entertaining.<br/><br/>But really what makes this movie such a good one, is thanks to all the talent involved. Spielberg is a great entertainment director, George Lucas is a great imaginatively storyteller and Harrison Ford is a great perfect 'hero'. The three form a golden trio. You can tell by looking at this movie that the three by working together excel themselves and puss and motivate each other to a level of greatness. But it of course were not just those three that made those movie. Also kudos has to go to of course the musical score by John Williams, who created one of the most recognizable themes out of motion picture history. But it's not just the main theme that is great about the musical score, it's the entire piece of work. Other persons who deserves credit are production designer Norman Reynolds and director of photography Douglas Slocombe. All the talent involves makes this movie the ultimate entertaining movie. The movie also has some good and convincing 'early' special effects.<br/><br/>The movie is also very well cast. Who would had ever known that after Han Solo Harrison Ford would ever portray a memorable and good on his own character that everybody around the globe knows. Paul Freeman is great as Indiana Jones darker shadow. He's a good villain but one with class. Karen Allen is a good leading lady and she and Harrison Ford have some good chemistry together. Also memorable are John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott and Ronald Lacey as the ultimate Gestapo officer Major Toht. Nazi's always make such great movie villain in movies like this. Why? Because these guys need no introduction. When you see a Nazi you know he's a bad guy and you know he is very bad because everyone knows what those guys did in WW II. Plus of course the fact that they always wear this great looking costumes. Also now well known actor Alfred Molina shows up in a small role at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The great adventurous imaginative story provides the movie with some unforgettable moments. Especially the big action sequences are memorable. We have the market fight, which is mainly fun to watch, we have the fight in the bar, we have the airplane fight with the great indestructible Pat Roach and than we have the wonderful truck chase sequence that is very well filmed. The movie is truly action packed, which keeps the pace high, even though there also are some slower moments in the story.<br/><br/>It's pointless to recommend this movie or not, since this is one of those movies that everybody already has seen at least once. If you're one of those rare cases that hasn't seen this movie yet; What are you doing here reading users comments? Go and watch this movie and be entertained by it.

When I finally convinced someone to take me it was one of the most magical experiences of my movie going life. Up until then only two movies had made me feel that way in the theater: Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Little did I know that the two great directors had come together to product this masterpiece. It borrows the best of movie serials of the past, the adventure stories and travel pieces of the time, fantasy, history and features the best villains ever in the world: Nazis!!! Yes. These guys stink. I had learned about them in regular school, Hebrew school and TV. I hated them for what they had done to my ancestors and here was Indiana Jones going around kicking Nazi but at every turn. OK so for a little while it looked like they had the upper hand but in the end G-d gave it to them good. Just like they deserved. If all the adventure and excitement wasn't enough the last scene was a perfect blend irony. All that for nothing. I guess in a way the U.S. Government did one thing right. They packed it away in some unassuming box in a cavernous warehouse so that no one would ever find it again. Harder to find than the Well of Souls that place. I loved this movie front to back, beginning to end and it inspired my own writing and creativity. The period and the sets still resonate in my mind. And a soundtrack that just won't quit. Don't get me started on the sheer genius of John Williams' soundtracks. These three men are singlehandedly responsible for my dreams, my fantasies and my adventurous spirit. I wanted to live in the places they created, go where Indiana Jones went and see what he saw. Some say that they ruined cinema but I don't agree.

","When I was a kid, the adventure classic of all time was 'Gunga Din' (and seen today, it's still a fun-filled classic full of suspense and adventure). But not until 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' did another film take its place alongside that gem. This stands as one of the cinema's greatest comic-strip type of adventures. If you really believe any of this could really have happened you've gotta be out of your mind. But it doesn't matter--the story is told with such tongue-in-cheek style and flourish for comic effects (even at the most dangerous moments)--that you know you're just supposed to sit back and enjoy it for the Saturday afternoon treat it is.<br/><br/>
Biggest asset--aside from the casting of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones--is the magnificent musical score by John Williams. He never ceases to astound me with his talent--probably the finest film composer heavily influenced by the great scores of the '30s and '40s (by Erich Wolfgang Korngold)-- rich in texture and symphonic sound. Truly a master at making a film seem even better than it is.<br/><br/>The villains are splendid, the heroine is gutsy, the chases are memorable and the look of the film is extraordinary in its attention to period detail. The Nazi menace makes it all the more riveting. Well worth your time--you won't be disappointed. And watch for that marketplace shooting--it's the film's biggest howl."

"Leofwine_draca","10","2","4","4 August 2016"," Classic action adventure is pleasingly old-fashioned
","Stephen Spielberg and George Lucas - once, two fine directors before they ""sold out"" to the masses - teamed up to create this outstanding adventure movie which brings back the classic days of the cliffhanging serials, with an intrepid hero, exotic locations, and lots of escapes from deadly traps and villains. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a film blessed with brilliant action sequences - some of the best ever put to film in my opinion - and plenty of jokes and comic relief (a little too much, actually) to make it fun to watch. Add in a great cast of fresh and veteran performers, one of the most memorable theme tunes ever and a plot which takes in locations including Brazil and Egypt and concerns the mystical Ark of the Covenant, and what you have is a genuinely pleasing blockbuster of a movie.<br/><br/>I remember watching all three films in the trilogy and loving them as a kid, as well as being terrified and having nightmares in some instances (and who's to blame me, with all those POLTERGEIST-style rotting corpses dropping on Karen Allen in that dank tomb?). The adrenaline flows during the fluid, excellently-choreographed action scenes, which, like in John Woo's films, are almost balletic in approach. I'm talking about the classic opening shots (which beats the entire TOMB RAIDER movie hands down, and probably inspired the original game) of Indy stealing a jungle idol and getting chased by a huge rolling boulder; the exceptional fist-fight between Indy and scary-looking Pat Roach by a rotating plane, and a fine set-piece involving Indy boarding a moving truck. There are lots of other bits in there too, but those are my favourite moments.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford stars in his most famous and best role and has Indy's character spot on. He's dependable, charismatic, handsome, heroic, brave and, best of all, very human: a character even the most cowardly of viewers can identify with. The strong supporting cast is also very good, with Paul Freeman memorably slimy as Belloq; Karen Allen as the slightly annoying female lead/love interest Marion (nothing compared to the irritating blonde in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM though); Ronald Lacey as the supremely villainous trench coated Nazi Toht, John Rhys-Davies as cuddly aide Sallah, and minor parts for Alfred Molina, Denholm Elliot and others.<br/><br/>Seen today, as an adult, what I most admire is Spielberg's refusal to pander to a young audience. Yes, the film is violent, with bloody deaths and people being brutally shot and injured. There's also refreshingly little sentimentality here - just constant breathtaking thrills and spills. Incidentally, the film was apparently a big hit in Italy, where directors were quick to rip it off for a whole sub genre of their own (HUNTERS OF THE GOLDEN COBRA, anyone?). Even whole individual scenes were lifted for the likes of TEASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS, with a boulder-rolling escape for the hero, and LIGHT BLAST, with its memorably gooey melt-deaths copying the fantastic ones in this film. I still remember when I caught this on daytime telly a few years back and was disgusted to find that the shots of Freeman, Lacey and co. melting had been cruelly excised - surely top-quality special effects should be celebrated, not hidden away to avoid scaring youngsters. I was scared, and I'm still glad of it!"

Indy mentions that one of his competitors disappeared in there. They go in and the place is covered in cobwebs and insects and they are both covered in tarantulas. They brush them off and keep going. They are about to continue when they spring a trap activated by the light in the room. Spikes shoot out of the walls and hanging off one of them is Indy's competitor. They make their way past a couple of more traps when they reach the artifact. It's on a trigger that is activated by the object's weight. Indy seemingly makes the switch but activates another trap which lowers a giant boulder. After his friend tries to betray him and dies himself, Indy escapes the temple but he's intercepted by another archaeologist named Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Belloq has bent the native tribe to his will and uses them to steal the artifact from Indy. Indy is able to slip away while Belloq is commanding the tribe and a chase begins. There's a seaplane waiting on the river and Indy is able to evade the tribe and hop aboard. While they're flying away, a snake crawls into the seat and Indy freaks out. He's afraid of snakes but his pilot tells him to show a little backbone.<br/><br/>There's so much I could say about Raiders of the Lost Ark. But what makes this movie so special to me is that it's the best integration of really cool action scenes with hilarious comedic moments that I've ever seen. I'll talk about the characters more later but with this movie Indy will get into some intense gunfights or fistfights, or he'll be trying to escape a trap and he'll trip or get socked in the jaw or slip up on the weight of an artifact and set off another trap. It's kind of beautiful to watch how seamless it is and I laugh a lot every time I watch this movie. I think every action/adventure movie tries to do that and most of them succeed but I feel like this is by far the movie that does it best.<br/><br/>Moving to the characters, I mentioned in the opening paragraph that Indy is my favourite action hero of all time. For me this is true because his character works on many levels. Of course he's a professor first and he always comes across as knowledgeable of his surroundings but he also works as a badass action hero. He overcomes odds through work with his gun, his whip and more importantly his fists. Lastly, he's not perfect like a James Bond type spy, he's constantly screwing up or almost dying, only getting by through a combination of luck and help from his friends. Marion is absolutely no slouch either. She's fully capable, she owns a bar and is a drinking champ, she greets Indy by punching him in the face and she's responsible for getting him out of a couple of jams. They feel organic together and the romance between them is played just right. Sallah is really underrated, he's a funny and helpful sidekick and John Rhys-Davies is so great playing him. Denholm Elliot is good in his brief appearance. Speaking quickly about the villains, Belloq is actually a solid adversary. He strikes the balance of villainous yet understated perfectly. I find him to be less maniacally evil and more just an @$$%^*& who piggybacks off of Indy's success.<br/><br/>The Indy trilogy really shows how great of an actor Harrison Ford is. He's one of the better actors of his generation and I think he's the template for the blockbuster action hero. He can perform in any genre and he quietly helps make the movie as awesome as it is. Without him, I don't know if these movies would work as well as they do.<br/><br/>With this being an adventure/action movie the set pieces are exciting and provide the thrills that you're looking for in this genre. From dodging dangerous traps to dealing with some frightening parts of the animal kingdom, all of the action scenes are fun to watch and are extremely entertaining. I would also add that the entire trilogy travels to some cool locations and add to the mystery surrounding some of the supernatural elements of this franchise.<br/><br/>Some people consider Raiders to be the movie that helped define the modern action/adventure movie. I would agree, I don't have a ton of experience with older adventure movies but you can see touches of this movie in films even today. Even with some of the theories about the plot today, to me this movie is perfect and I can't recommend it highly enough."

","Remember when movies were fun and lasted under two hours? You get it all with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the adroit and adept movie that introduced us to the iconic, whip-happy archaeology professor who would rather eat dirt than be stuck in a classroom teaching.<br/><br/>We get tarantulas, traps in tombs, golden-monkey idols, snakes, a mix of religion with the occult, all while we fight Nazis with the specter of WWII looming large. The primary villain is Paul Freeman as Belloq, one of the smarmiest and sleaziest tools ever seen on film, who seems to have the upper hand only because he has more money and manpower behind his efforts.<br/><br/>There are several unforgettable scenes, starting from the opening tomb raid, to the fist fight near the running airplane, to the very end when the Ark of the Covenant is perfunctorily boxed up for storage in a nameless, faceless warehouse (cue Raiders March). There is never a dull moment, never a wrong beat. We get well-timed wry humor to counteract the seriousness of finding the Ark, which promises to hold such power that it would make any army possessing it invincible.<br/><br/>The melting faces look trite and corny now, and maybe they did then, too. But it's all in good fun, and if you don't want your face to melt, just close your eyes. Close your eyes and think of a time when movies dealt raw entertainment."
"fraserwilcox","Null","2","4","6 April 2016"," One of the greatest action movies ever made
","Some of the most memorable and most referenced scenes and sequences were immortalised by this triumph in film-making. Indiana Jones is a superbly crafted and superbly portrayed character in this classic action flick that deserves its reputation and love among fans of film.<br/><br/>Right, now I've said that, I'd like to get to the real reason I'm writing this review. I am getting thoroughly frustrated and annoyed by all the tedious people pointing out the ""gaping plot-hole"" that supposedly resides in this movie's story. This apparent ""flaw"" goes something along the lines of (cue whiny and irritating nerd voice): ""Indiana Jones is irrelevant to the story. If he wasn't in it the movie would pan out in exactly the same way."" And occasionally people would add: ""He adds nothing to the movie""; ""You can't consider him a hero"".<br/><br/>Shut the f*ck up, all of you!<br/><br/>While it can definitely be argued that if Harrison Ford's whip-wielding, gun-toting, lovable adventurer were taken out of the story, the movie would still end with (spoiler alert, everyone) the Nazis opening the Ark of the Covenant and all being killed, but how people conclude that that makes Indiana Jones an inessential asset to the movie is frankly idiotic.<br/><br/>If it weren't for Indy's presence throughout each scene, what would this movie be? It would essentially be just a documentary about a Nazi excavation team searching for an ancient religious artifact and then all dying (except it wouldn't actually be a documentary because it never f*cking happened). There would be no conflict or tension because all the characters would be the Nazis and wouldn't do anything interesting (at least, not until September 1939). Thematically, Indy is in nearly every scene of the film because, funnily enough, he is the main character and we are seeing the story play out through his eyes and from his experiences. He's the one to root for in the story. He's the character the audience likes and wants to see come out the other end of the story victorious. Who would you root for without him? None of the other protagonists would even be there if it weren't for Jones and don't say you'd be rooting for the Nazis because of obvious f*cking reasons.<br/><br/>Aside from him being the inadvertent story-teller, he's also the cause of nearly every great f*cking scene. What would the movie be without the giant boulder chase, the fist fight by the aeroplane or the frankly brilliant scene where Indy shoots his way out of getting into a sword fight. People must realise that without Indy this movie would be about ten minutes long, not to mention without its iconic charm and straight up fun.<br/><br/>So Indiana's absence from the film does take something from this masterpiece; about 95% of it to be honest. I honestly believe that (and I can feel hate coming my way for making this accusation) the only people who give a f*ck over this moronic and non-existent plot-hole are the people who get agitated when film-makers diverge from the norm of film-making, as if that's too much for them to comprehend. ""No I'll stick to what I know, what I'm comfortable with already"". Just because a film doesn't involve a main character with the same kind of impact to a film that's been used in media countless times before does not mean it should be criticised.<br/><br/>Above all stop calling this minute detail a ""plot-hole"". It's not one. A plot-hole is something that causes the plot to be inconsistent or contradictory or just simply events that wouldn't ever happen. And to all those people who don't consider it a plot-hole, stop pointing it out anyway and just enjoy the f*cking film, because it's actually really good."
"ejacobs23","10","2","4","2 January 2016"," Iconic as it gets
","This film is epic! The film is so entertaining and it created my favourite movie hero of all time. This movie is so iconic in so many ways. Harrison Ford was amazing in this and it is my favourite performance of his. The entertainment of this film is infinite, especially at the beginning and end were there is two of my favourite scenes of all- time. Spielberg directed this extremely well and this is his best work. Spielberg is known for his films to be iconic and a box office success. This is iconic as it gets and is in the 20 highest grossing films adjusted for inflation. If Spielberg were to be only remembered for one film (which is impossible) I'd like it to be this.<br/><br/>The one thing that didn't blow me away was dialogue. It was bad but it didn't blow me away. It had s few memorable lines but not many. I like to quote my favourite films and I always struggle with this one. A common complaint is that Indiana plays no roll in the outcome of the film but there are instances were he has saved lives. If he was not there they would be dead. Indiana is a hero and I hate it when they say he was pointless. To summarise: Iconic and extremely entertaining. This film is a classic I can watch over and over again.

","There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie francaise in the history of cinema. This is my all time favorite film. This is simply the best action film ever made. That will stand the test of time forever. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times, with no lesser joy. This film has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I just love every bit of it. Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actor, he brings THE greatest and most charismatic character on the silver screen in this Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaboration. Indiana Jones is the likable, stubborn, intelligent, and determinedan archaeologist adventurer with his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol he spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures. He escapes countless dangers, including fighting thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a dusty road, just to name a few. You can't forget John William's classic score which is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows. Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the classic B-film adventure movies. Instead, he created one of the most revolting and loved films of all time. All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one is still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Indy - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years to come. This will always be considered the greatest adventure film of all time."
"braddugg","8","2","4","19 September 2014"," This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.
","This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor takes us on an adventure and lets us know about things that we never knew. I am not sure if they ever existed but as along as I am on fun ride, I am pretty happy with the fiction element of the ride. And this one is a fun ride and good one too. Having said that, I still can't say if it still has the charm of 1981 (rather I saw it first time in 2002) but as I saw it today, it made a fun ride. <br/><br/>Thanks to Harrison Ford for carrying the style and flamboyance needed and to Steven Spielberg and George Lucan and team who made this INDY possible. It's an adventure of 1930's and art direction and cinematography are superb. The music which has now became a signature tune even to film awards in India is gonna stay with us for a long time. <br/><br/>Some film makers have claimed this film to be changing their mind and pulling them into films, example Nagesh Kukunoor. So the impact of the film is understandable and yet is extensive. The special effects are nowhere when compared to what we have today, but it was made but what was there in 1981 and boy, I must say it will stand better than many special effects films even 100 years later. <br/><br/>The best thing probably is the setup, there is a dialogue initially to help us understand what is the purpose of the adventure and then once the adventure rolls in, we are put aback by thrills and stunts and more than anything, the enigma of a charismatic man called Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>I would go with 4/5 and recommend it to all those adventure and fun loving guys. And for all the parents, your kids will love this film more than the recent crap films like JOURNEY or anything. I strongly believe this."
"movieseed","8","2","4","2 July 2014"," Still Love this movie!
","Indiana Jones is still an enduring and timeless classic in every way a great film should be. I can watch this movie when I'm a graying, senile 90 years old grandmother and still LOVE IT! The story, acting, suspense, adventure, thrills, chills and everything in between is universal and timeless. It doesn't get better than this combo of Lucas, Ford and Spielberg!<br/><br/>Some of the photography, pacing and ending Special Effects is dated a bit, but I think Ford's charisma, charm and ruggedness still holds up with age. He's still so dreamy I'm still in love ;) <br/><br/>Worth a rewatch if you haven't seen it in years like me!"
"RollerCoasterFox","10","2","4","31 May 2014"," Yes, it is that good.
","I think that this movie is TRULY better than most of the big movies coming out now. I haven't seen Ender's Game either, but from the looks of the trailer it didn't seem too appealing (most of the shots being actors in front of CGI backgrounds). Raiders of the Lost Ark is a bit of a miracle for a couple of reasons. <br/><br/>It features a dazzling number of practical effects that work better than any post-production trickery: the shooting arrows, the boulder, the truck chase, the explosions, the snakes... you can see and feel that they are real, even if the boulder is plastic and some of the snakes are rubber. The final Ark sequence is somewhat cheesy with the optical printing effects, but the ghosts being added are still real bits of cloth that were filmed being pulled about in water. So, it's real and it has a human handprint on it instead of being disconnected like so many of the pixellated effects we see today. <br/><br/>Also, the editing is terrific. It's so easy to ignore it because you are too caught up in what is going on, but that's exactly the point: The editing follows a specific train of thought in each scene as we can see what the characters are literally thinking. Take the opening scene where Indiana hears the gun cock behind him... we see the his head turn slightly with the silhouette of his ear clearly outlined. In a couple of rapid-fire shots, we see him take out his whip and knock the gun out of the man's hand. Watch it in slow-motion, seriously. I prefer watching movies like this as opposed to the James Bond movies where Bond always knows exactly what to do but they never really show how... ""Raiders"" follows the thought process every step of the way. <br/><br/>A lot of people say that cinematography in movies is boring today, but you might not exactly know what that means. There is a ""correct"" way most movies are shot that is actually quite boring. Use close-ups for dialogue (often with the listener out of focus in the foreground), use wide shots for action, and shake the camera a lot. ""Raiders"" refuses to do that. The cinematography makes sure that we can see what is going on, but also makes sure to keep it interesting. We look at the actors from above and below. We see them through dense forests, candle flames, and lattice walls. It's a brilliant variety that often goes unnoticed. <br/><br/>Anyhow, all of the technical feats somehow step out of the way so you can enjoy the ultimate roller coaster ride. This is no average Hollywood movie as we see characters get dirtied up and beat up and even looking pretty ugly sometimes... It's a throwback to when movies didn't take themselves so seriously and instead focused on being fun. Years later when people forget ""Gravity"" and even ""12 Years a Slave"" they will still remember this one."
"Kylo_Ren","10","2","4","27 May 2014"," My favorite film of all time.
","If you have not seen this film, this is it. The top. This is the most exciting and entertaining film that has ever been made. Harrison Ford creates a truly iconic character named Indiana Jones. Conceived by George Lucas and molded by Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly a sight to be seen. Inspired by many of the 1930's serial films like its cousin Star Wars, Raiders keeps you on the edge of your toes. The whip, the leather jacket and of course the hat have become iconic with film lore. Indiana Jones is the all American hero, the American James Bond. The sequels were all great and highly entertaining films thanks to Lucas, Spielberg and Ford, but Raiders is truly a masterpiece to behold."

They fear the Ark as an invincible weapon. He travels to Nepal to find Ravenwood where he is joined by old flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen).<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaborate on one of the most fun franchise ever made. It is a return to an old fashion action adventure. This has all the right ingredients, and the master chefs to put them all together. It has a great action hero with Ford at his best. He is basically a book smart Han Solo. There is the sassy love interest. Add in all the fun action they could shake a stick at. Mix it all together with expert hands, and it becomes cinematic magic.

","It's a testament to the entertainment value of this adventure classic that its approximate one hour and 56 minute run time just flies by. Whether one is revisiting it or experiencing it for the first time, it flows along extremely well, maintaining a high level of excitement and populating its diverting story with a rich array of memorable characters. Today it remains a career highpoint for its filmmakers and much of its cast.<br/><br/>Concocted by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (with official story credit going to Lucas and Philip Kaufman), and scripted by Lawrence Kasdan, it takes its inspiration from the movie serials of decades past, and goes them one better in terms of its thrills and chills. Harrison Ford stars as 1930s archaeologist / professor / adventurer ""Indiana"" Jones, to whom we're introduced in a marvellous opening set piece set deep in the Peruvian jungle. He ends up hired by the American government to locate and obtain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before Adolf Hitler and his minions can get their slimy hands on it.<br/><br/>He's accompanied by a wonderfully feisty leading lady, Marion Ravenwood, played to perfection by the appealing Karen Allen. Among Indy's friends are museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Egyptian digger Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), and among the enjoyably devilish bad guys are charming rogue Belloq (Paul Freeman), a ruthless rival archaeologist, a cold blooded Nazi officer, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler), and an incredibly creepy interrogator, Toht (Ronald Lacey). It's also fun to see a young Alfred Molina, in his film debut, as the Peruvian guide in that opening sequence.<br/><br/>Even if the viewer is thoroughly familiar with the film by now, there's still lots of enjoyment to be had in viewing the assorted iconic scenes: Indy pursued by a runaway boulder, the confrontation in the Nepal bar, the chases through the streets of Cairo, the fight near the Nazi plane, one of the best vehicle chases to be seen in cinema, and that final scene where the power of the Ark is unleashed. There are certainly macabre moments to be found throughout, but this merely adds to the sense of danger and the sense of fun constantly being created by Spielberg and associates. The efforts of a first rate crew - production designer Norman Reynolds, art director Leslie Dilley, cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, etc. - are supplemented by eye popping special effects supervised by Richard Edlund, nifty makeup effects by Chris Walas, and of course that hummable rousing theme music by John Williams that can stay in your head long after the film is over.<br/><br/>Overall there's plenty of pizazz and humour in the presentation that continues to make this top notch escapism. This was a favourite of this viewer as a child and it's lost little of its appeal 30 plus years later.<br/><br/>Followed by a prequel, two sequels, and the 'Young Indiana Jones' TV series.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

Indiana Jones is a daredevil archaeologist who will do anything and everything to get the piece of history he is after. But when the U.S. government asks him to get the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do, he may just be in over his head. The movie takes you and our hero from an African jungle, San Francisco, and to the blistering sands of Cairo.

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the many cinematic Spielberg masterpieces in the modern age of movie making. This movie is beyond expectations, beyond thrilling, and it's beyond amazing. Harrison Ford brings the performance of a lifetime as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist with a taste of adventure, thrills, and love. That's probably the whole plot of the entire series. Director Steven Spielberg brings another incredible movie to the world since ""Jaws"", and teams up with George Lucas, the mastermind behind the incredible ""Star Wars"" franchise, to bring yet another screen hero. So, this movie brought the incredible works of Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford, to bring a movie that will span from generation to generation. One of my favorite movies of all time, with everything you would expect in a movie. The incredible visual effects blew me away, and it turned to be an amazing accomplishment. The cinematography is gorgeous, the editing is crystal, the characters are priceless, the story is superb, the sound is exceptional, the action is incredible, and my two favorite moments in the film were the beginning sequence involving a giant death ball, and a death-defying pit filled with snakes. But my all-time favorite thing about this movie, is John Williams' incredible music, including the classic Raiders March. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is classic Spielberg entertainment, and you won't be disappointed! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", in my review, ""a superb piece of entertainment, provided by the unstoppable Spielberg""."
"Christian_Dimartino","10","2","4","26 August 2011"," What Summer movies are made for.
","Steven Spielberg got a lot of Oscar buzz at a young age. In three films that he had done by 1981(Close encounters and Jaws to say the least), they had gotten nominated for best picture. And deserved it. I'd of thought it would be hard to top films like those, but he did it with 1981's Raiders of the Lost ark, one of his best films. Actually, its probably his second best film.<br/><br/>It's hard to find a film thats more entertaining, fun, funny, brainy, and adventurous as Raiders of the lost Ark. This is the one that started it all. The first time America was introduced to the world of Indiana Jones. And i'm really glad that it was.<br/><br/>It makes me sad to hear that Harrison Ford has never won an Oscar. He should've at least won for The Fugitive, or, in my opinion, Raiders of the lost ark. His performance as Indiana Jones is funny and, in an un-gay way, rather charming.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic. Henry Jones Jr., a.k.a. Indiana Jones(Ford) is a professor, and, well, a badass archaeologist. He is sent to retrieve The Ark of the Covenant, which, as you know, was a biblical item. Not only does he have to save it, but he has to save it, but he has to save it from Nazis. So its a race against the clock as Indy, Marion(Karen Allen), Indy's old fling, and Sallah(John Rhys-Davies) try to retrieve it.<br/><br/>There comes a Summer movie that is just a lot of fun, filled with nice locations and thrilling action sequences. A good example of that is Romancing the stone or, most recently Knight and day(i'm not comparing it to Raiders of the lost ark but I did think it was a blast). You look at a movie like Knight and day and you remember what blockbusters used to be like.<br/><br/>Raiders of the lost ark is really what films are made of. It's hard to find a film more adventurous than anything Indiana Jones appears in. Raiders of the lost ark is somewhere on my top ten favorite films. It's a fantastic film, and its almost Spielberg's masterpiece. I hope Spielberg's next film, The Adventures of Tintin, does the same thing that Raiders of the lost ark does.<br/><br/>A"
"MovieGeekBlog","10","2","4","23 June 2011"," A perfect film
","Call me childish, call me narrow-minded, call me a ""blockbuster-junkie"", call whatever-you- want, but to me this is the perfect films! Such a bold statement might require some explanation (which hopefully I will be able to give in this post) and certainly begs the question: what makes a film perfect? I believe a perfect film is one that can be watched over and over again: a film that you never grow tired of and that whenever is on TV and you stumble across it, you end up watching. A perfect film is one of those where you struggle to pick up one favourite scene, because they're all so good. A perfect film is one of those you really wouldn't change anything about it and where all its elements (story, direction, acting, music, cinematography, editing and so on) come together in a such a way that it's virtually impossible to choose one over the other. Raiders is 30 years, but still shines as if it were made yesterday except that it wasn't because, as we all know ""they don't make them like this anymore"". I still remember going to the movie theatre when it first got released (Yes, I'm giving away my age: clearly I'm not a teenager!) and being absolutely blown away by it. At the time there was nothing like it (and arguably, that's probably still true today). Ever since then people have been trying to imitate its winning formula, and, needless to say, most of them failed miserably. Just to give you an idea of what I am talking about (and to prove my point), just think of Lara Croft, Prince of Persia, National treasure, The Mummy Trilogy and even those films inspired by the Dan Brown's books: well, those are the most successful ones Enough said. I won't even go into the list of endless B-movies. Right from the word ""go"", from when the summit of the Paramount logo dissolves into a Peruvian mountain (a Visual device which will become the trademark of the entire series), you know you're in for something which is not only original but clever and handsomely made. What follows that logo is probably one of the best first sequences of any action movies ever made. The mysterious forest, the haunting music, the bloody statue, the group of explorers, the old map, the hidden cave, the pulsating tension, the crawling spiders, the giant web, the deadly traps, the decomposed body, the big scares, the golden idol, the sliding door, the traitor, the whip, the rolling boulder, the French baddie, the wild Hovitos, the arrows, the chase across the fields, the swinging vine, John Williams's ""raiders theme"", the snake on the plane, the jokes breaking the tension: and all this is just within the first 10 minutes!!! It is such an incredible edge-of-your-seat beginning that after that the film can afford to launch into a very long scene with some massive exposition And I haven't even mentioned the hero himself, Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford deserves a lot of credits for the success of this film. Who knows what would have happened if Tom Selleck had played the role: he was the first choice, after all (I will be eternally grateful to Magnum PI). Harrison Ford manages to make Indiana Jones strong and frail at the same time, funny and sad, invincible and weak. Indy is a hero but he gets hurt, tired, dirty and sweaty. It doesn't matter how far-fetched and over-the-top the action might be, Ford makes it feel real. Spielberg directs it all with clockwork perfection but he's also able to improvise on the spot and use it all to his advantage (most famously, the now-classic scene where Indy shoots the sword-man, which as we all know by now, was pretty much improvised on the spot). He orchestrates it all with a mastery that's never showy and always serving the story and the action as he uses all the tricks in the film-maker book: long lens shots during a chase sequence, a tracking shot across the desert to show the scale of the landscape, a single one- take shot during a drinking competition.<br/><br/>He also knows exactly how to pitch the film: helped by a carefully crafted script, all the improbabilities are always levelled by humour, the action is always counter-balanced by actual dramatic scenes, the magical sense of wonder is always routed to reality and however cartoony some of the characters might be, they're always incredibly detailed. Paul Freeman's Belloq is not just a baddie. There's so much more to him: the care and attention he has for Marion, and whole untold back-story and a passion for archaeology he shares with Indy are enough to give him more depth and somehow make him more scary. He also gets one of the best lines in the film: ""we are only passing though history, this this IS history"" What started off as a tribute to those Action Saturday Matinée that Spielberg and Lucas loved so much, here becomes a roller-coaster of sheer invention, cracking action and incredible fun. So many scenes are now become classic iconic moments in movie history, whether it's to do with snakes in ""well of Souls"", or ghost-like creatures during the opening of the ark, running though the streets of Cairo, or fighting with a bald guy by a plane out of control, in a secret chamber underground, or in a massive warehouse with thousands and thousands crates (incidentally, one of the best ""last shots"" of any movie!!). This is so much more than just pure escapism: this is a manual of ""storytelling with pictures"". moviegeekblog.com"

","Indiana Jones is a college professor who the government hires to find priceless relics. After hearing that Hitler and the S.S. are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, the government hires Jones to beat the Nazis to it.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most exciting and action packed movies ever made, along with being the best Steven Spielberg has ever done. George Lucas' imagination combines with Spielberg's direction to create a film that is truly epic and amazingly gutsy. The fact that anyone would even try to cram this many action set pieces into one movie is almost as amazing as how well they executed it. Every action scene is more complex and exciting than the one before it. <br/><br/>Raiders is like a movie made by the child inside Spielberg; unbridled creativity and enthusiasm brought to life on screen. He combines elements of almost every genre as well as many of the movies he probably loved growing up (North by Northwest, The Maltese Falcon) into a truly glorious concoction.<br/><br/>Yes, you have to throw logic out the window in certain scenes and the acting/writing could be better, but it doesn't matter. Raiders has basically every movie beat on the amount of sheer fun you have watching it as well as one of the greatest endings ever. Raiders of the Lost Ark is not only Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, but one of the best movies ever made and essential viewing for any film buff."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie of all time. It is a classic Steven Spielberg adventure movie. Packed with pretty much every genre, it is something for all movie lovers and almost everyone. Hollywood doesn't make movies like this anymore. Motion pictures were invented to entertain, and this one entertains a great deal. Some of it may seem a bit campy, but that is why it is so great. It is just a plain fun and enjoyable movie. I wish, like I hinted at earlier, that a movie like this would come out nowadays. It will leave you and your sense of fun very satisfied. You'll have a great time watching this movie."
"thesar-2","10","2","4","4 June 2010"," Doc Ock Vs. Doc Indy
","Not only is Raiders of the Lost Ark my favorite adventure of all time – almost 20 years later, nothing has come remotely close, it is a masterpiece in film-making. That is NOT a word I use regularly, and for those who know me, know how critical I am with films. Suffice to say, I mean it when I say MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Everything worked in this movie. Sound, score, acting, believability – for its subject matter, humor, suspense, cinematography, twists. Simply stated: this is a must see for all ages, all creeds, all humans.<br/><br/>Did they even know what they had when they made the first Indiana Jones adventure? Did audiences know what once in a lifetime experience they were watching back in 1981 or take this for granted? I know I probably would have – if I had seen it in theatres at that time. (Side Note: I can't say for certain that I did or did not see this in first run theatres, I was only seven and my family barely went to one or two movies a year – if we were lucky.) The movie starts off with a bang – Dr. Indiana Jones is attempting to obtain an ancient artifact for a museum, but must first pass a series of tests, including who to trust, in 1936 South America. It's a famous opening segment accompany the famous Indy Vs. the Boulder scene and it sets the tone quickly on the adventure you're about to partake on.<br/><br/>Only thing is, unlike many, many imitations to follow in the next couple of decades, Writer George Lucas and Director Steven Spielberg decided action and the set-pieces weren't enough. In addition to the great action/adventure and thrill rides that will take you through the climax, they focused mainly on character depth and story. Both flourished. Namely with, of course, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford.) Though Ford didn't start his career in 1977's Star Wars, he certainly began stretching his legs and made himself into an icon. An movie star people cared about. Then came 1980's The Empire Strikes Back where he flourished and added the much needed depth to his Han Solo character in the sequel. There's no question: Indiana Jones is Harrison Ford. Or is it vice versa? Ford didn't just make the cardboard adventurer based on the old movie serials one note, he breathed life into the role, beyond just having the audience care for him. They wanted to be him. I would want to be him. And as super-human as he is, Ford made sure he was still just plain human, flaws and all. Of course, he always has to come out on top, despite the odds.<br/><br/>Beyond him, no one else, from Allen's love interest Marion to the monkey, was just one note. Sure they didn't steal the spotlight as Indy/Ford dominated, but each was just as believable and needed in their roles.<br/><br/>After the great opening that is sure to hook even the skeptical viewer, the mystery begins involving the race to find the ""lost ark,"" the ark that supposedly contains the original Ten Commandments that Moses stored, before those pesky Nazis get their hands on it. Classic good vs. evil.<br/><br/>Along the way you'll be in store with romance, comedy, more adventure and action sequences and one of the greatest scores orchestrated by the great John Williams. Just as he previously breathed life into Superman in Superman: The Movie with his fantastic music, he gives the well-written Indiana Jones a soul.<br/><br/>I understand I'm not giving this movie the proper justice with all that I could say about it, but suffice to say, this absolute classic is worth a viewing for all, including those who've already seen it. It was refreshing to see ""real"" movie making again for my, I don't know, 24th time, with NO CGI. Aside from the (today's) comical face melting in the finale, everything else not only works, but makes you apart of the rideof a lifetime. See it!"
"Lifexinxrewind","9","2","4","5 April 2010"," One of the most iconic heroes of all time in one of the greatest adventures of all time
","Raiders of the Lost Arc stands the test of time almost 30 years after its release as a immensely enjoyable adventure romp and a definitive moment for the genre. The film that introduced the world to one of the greatest movie heroes of all time in Indiana Jones, it goes back to a time when creativity and choreography were essential to pulling off the film's many stunts and action scenes. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford brings so many iconic traits to the character of Indy, and he is allowed to do so by the subtleties of the film. He is sly, cool, ingenious, but most of all, human. Boring professor by day, ultimate swash buckling action hero by weekend, this isn't a superhero or a man with gadgets to keep him ahead of the bad guys. In fact, Indiana gets the worst of it in more than one instance in Raiders. This allows the viewer to connect and root for him, especially in amusing scenes such as when he literally brings a gun to a sword fight. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg shows off his ability to tell a great story, and packs the film with great symbolism via visual cues. The use of shadows in his shots in particular are very effective, and the different sets remain convincing. The story itself works so well because although it features a few moments of cheese, basing it on actual historical artifacts makes it very easy to enjoy and also gives Indy many exciting locales to visit. <br/><br/>Using the Nazis as the villains was brilliant and gives the audience a clear ""good vs evil"" storyline, allowing the film to focus on the development of the leads without sacrificing investment in the plot. The action pieces work and create a real sense of tension and danger because it's actually a person performing the stunt. From the awesome truck chase (Wilhelm scream alert!) to the well of snakes to the awesomely ambiguous ending, Raiders is full of memorable moments that have understandably permeated pop-culture to this day. And not to mention the immense lot of popular films that are directly in debt to Raiders for making the classic adventure popular again. <br/><br/>Outside of Harrison Ford's epic performance, the supporting cast has a ball, with one of the creepiest sociopath villains of all time and a great band of friends for Indy. Karen Allen does struggle to be convincing at times, but she works well in the romantic sections of the film, especially the ""where does it hurt"" scene, equally amusing and endearing. This is a film that hits on all cylinders and set the stage for two more underrated tales to come (let's not talk about the new Indiana Jones film for the purposes of keeping this review positive). <br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Arc is a great introduction to one of the best movie heroes of all time and remains a treat to experience. This is essential viewing."
"pjoesmith","10","2","4","3 April 2010"," My favorite movie experience ever!
","With respect to the mission of IMDb, sometimes being informed (in any way) about a movie lessens the experience. I say this because of my experience with Raiders Of The Lost Ark.<br/><br/>This was one of the few movies I watched without having any expectations. I was 19 years old at the time. The movie had just come out, and I knew nothing about the plot beforehand ... I didn't even know others opinions about whether it was good or not. This total ignorance allows me to say this as a certainty ... when it comes to seeing a great movie, sometimes ignorance is indeed bliss! This was (by far) my favorite movie experience of all time.<br/><br/>This is one film I don't want to ruin by talking about it ... so let me just say this: if you ever happen to encounter a young man (say 18 or 19 years old) who has never heard of Indiana Jones, do him a favor. Don't tell him anything about the movie, invite him to a nice home theater, be sure to give him a soft-drink and some popcorn before the movie starts, turn up the volume and sit back & watch ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". I'm sure he'll long remember that great day."

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is truly one of the greatest adventure flicks ever, if not of all time. George Lucas takes a shot at writing a story that doesn't involve spaceships and the ""Force"" and what we get is a very good story. Well written characters and an interesting story that doesn't over do it, yes!! It keeps our interest and offers a unique setting that the fits the film well. Every actor has a role they were born to play and for Harrison Ford this is defiantly it. The pacing is excellent and the comedic elements are well portioned. The score by John Williams is unforgettable and like any score by the composer the theme for Indy is unmistakable to this day. This film is no less than a classic and one of Spielberg's best works no doubt. The sequels were no less incredible. Sigh, till ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" came along...damn!!"
"jeff-foley-b","10","2","4","23 October 2008"," Delivers Everything it Promises
","Looking for a provocative romance or gripping drama? WRONG FILM! This movie is about action, excitement and fun! It set the bar for this genre when it first came out, and still to this day is a benchmark to what other action films are judged. No CGI here - just great sets and innovative stunts. No sex, cussing, or gore either - no time for it. The film is too full of thrilling scenes of adventure, humor, and cliff-hanging danger. Sure its out-done now days by a quarter century of newer technology, but the spirit of the film will live on in anyone who saw it in the theaters, and anyone how rents the DVD and puts themselves back in an early-80's film mode. Yet another great George Lucas/Steven Spielberg movie that parents won't have to feel squeamish about having their kids see due to objectionable content."
"paoloemanuele","10","2","4","30 September 2008"," The greatest adventure movie of all times.
","Raiders of the lost Ark is, to me, where the minds and hands of Spielberg, Lucas and Kasdan peaked, and never quite succeeded to get even close to this high ever again. The movie simply hits every point, the characters are fully developed (for an adventure movie of course, it's no cinéma vérité), the plot is interesting and the visual effects are just the best you could get back then. Not to speak about the actors, Ford is just perfect as Indiana Jones (and that's why he will always be Indy for the rest of his career), Karen Allen was a strong actress and the supporting roles really work as friends or baddies. Comparisions with the two sequels are hard, this one is way too much better filmed, written and acted. The latest, useless installment is not even a challenge to me, being the lowest point of the Lucas-Spielberg franchise, and the gravestone of the great late Indy character. In the end, even if you don't like the genre this film is good entertainment for two hours."

","The Raiders of the Ark is a fantastic adventure film. This is one of the better films of the 1980's. Harrison Ford plays the mighty, whip-lashing Indiana Jones. Jones must uncover and save the mysterious ark from the Nazis. The acting in this film is top-rate. Harrison Ford is just amazing as he usually is. I also liked Karen Allen as Marion. She was just utterly great. As usual, Spielberg did a good job with his directing. The score by John Williams is catchy and memorable. The theme song is still stuck in my head. My only complaint about this film is that the film is a bit too dark. I wish that the film would lighten up a bit. Other than that, this is a fun movie. I rate this film a 10/10."

"CalDexter","10","2","4","23 May 2008"," Should have been re-released in cinemas last year!
","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is an extraordinary action adventure film. It will probably never be bettered. The opening sequence is gripping and the introduction of Doctor Henry 'Indiana' Jones is the best since James Bond's character in Doctor No. Harrison Ford is sensational in this film, this is quite simply the best action hero he has ever played. I love his Fedora hat, leather jacket and cracking bull whip.<br/><br/>Raiders from start to finish produces a ton of classic scenes, no one will forget the classic switch of the bag of sand for the Hovito Idol, or the Bar room brawl/gunfight in Nepal...and what about the locations and the set pieces! No CGI desert backgrounds here, just the glorious enjoyment of huge Nazi excavation sites to unearth the enchanting but mysterious power that is The Ark Of The Covenant. The fight scene between Indy and the huge German soldier underneath a rotating Nazi plane is one of the best fight sequences I've ever seen, plus the Truck chase in the desert with Indy on horseback is a joy to behold.<br/><br/>The script is excellent. Lawerence Kasdan deserves a special mention for producing good memorable dialogue. The supporting cast are superb, Karen Allen is extremely attractive as the feisty Marion Ravenwood, even though she has a tough exterior (demonstrated by that classic punch to Indy's face) She somehow hinted in the following scene that she had been vulnerable when she was first involved with Jones and wasn't as tough. Paul Freeman is terrific as Belloq, i think that he plays him with a sinister charm and has some wonderful dialogue 'Your going to give mercenaries a bad name!' Steven Spielberg's direction is the same magic he weaved with both Jaws and Close Encounters, this was a man who wanted to make a great memorable picture during production in 1980 and he has stated himself that it is the one film that he can look back on and watch with an audience or his own children and truthfully admit to enjoying it as much as anyone else. All power and credit to Mr George Lucas as well, his ideas and scenarios at the time were about how to create special effects that lifted a scene and blew an audience away (like the Ark's power unleashed at the climax) and not about how to make an empty green screen into a CGI cartoon.<br/><br/>Special honorary mention to the great John Williams. Sir, your film score for this movie is absolutely stunning and glorious. Indy's theme is instantly recognised whenever it plays. It is one of the most famous soundtracks for a film character in Movie history...i salute you Mr Williams, you are a genius!<br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark is one of the greatest Action Adventure films ever made...to be honest it really is the best adventure film. Welcome to the world of Indiana Jones!"
"ninablount","10","2","4","15 May 2008"," Why I Love Raiders
","I think out of any film ever to be released Raiders of the Lost Ark has had the biggest impact on my life. I was born years after it was released but I have seen this film more times than years I've been alive.<br/><br/>I love Raiders because ticks every single box. Firstly, because it has to be dealt with, Harrison Ford is one sexy man. I do not know any woman who would disagree with that statement and I do not know any man who wouldn't want to be him. Harrison Ford just has IT. The thought that Richard from Friends (Tom Selleck) could have been known as Indy is horrifying and well to be honest thank god for Magnum PI.<br/><br/>Now, I am a sucker for a romance story in a film. I don't really like soppy sort of love films but I love a good old romance embedded in a decent story. Oh and Raiders does this beautifully! Marion Ravenwood, firstly, is the BEST Indy girl and personally the best female character from a film. This is because I want to be her I suppose. She's been heartbroken; she's ended up opening a seedy bar in Nepal and then finally gets her man. What I love about Marion is that she's a strong woman, she holds her own against Indy but you know she's a woman, she wants to be loved and Karen Allen is a fabulous and beautiful actress who makes Indy's and Marion's relationship real and well pretty lovely to be honest.<br/><br/>OK, so Raiders has Harrison and it has the great relationship between Indy and Marion but let's not forget Raiders in an adventure film. I think all my ambitions to want to do history and all that rubbish is down to this film. OK, I know its not real life and I know the whole ark thing is rubbish but all I can ever think for weeks after it is how brilliant it would be if I could go on that adventure. But it's not only an adventure film, I've already said about the lovely romance, but you know it has so much more than just an adventure to it.<br/><br/>Finally of course it's a Spielberg and Lucas film and really that says it all.<br/><br/>I love Raiders, it's a shame Temple of Doom didn't live up to it, although I must say Temple of Doom does have the best opening to any film ever. Luckily, though The Last Crusade did and all in all I cannot wait for Kingdom."

"griffolyon12","10","2","4","17 February 2008"," They just don't make 'em like this anymore.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is truly one of the greatest films of all-time. This was the first film to introduce us to one of the best film characters of all-time, archaeologist Indiana Jones, played by the one and only Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>The story of Raiders follows everyones favorite whip-totting archaeologist as he battles Nazis, woos the beautiful Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and discovers the lost Ark of the Covenant. The story begins when Indy learns that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant. Indy can not stand the thought of the Nazis gaining possession of such a powerful, and holy artifact, so he agrees to go after the Ark himself to protect it from evil. Across Indy's adventure we meet his colorful sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), his feisty love interest Marion, and watch him in a deadly struggle against the Nazis for possession of the Ark.<br/><br/>As I mentioned in the tag-line above, they just don't make them like this anymore. This is pure, high octane adventure every step of the way. The film is superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, and the script by Lawrence Kasdan is marvelous, perfectly balancing the comedy with the action and drama, something that today's directors and screenwriters should take note of. As well the acting is amazing, Harrison Ford is the only man on Earth who could have played the character of Indiana Jones with so much conviction. Then of course John William's score was just truly amazing, one of his finest he has ever produced. Everything else: production design, cinematography, special effects, etc., all top notch.<br/><br/>This film is truly a classic in every way. The action is unlike any other action I have ever experienced on film, each action sequence was scripted to perfection (in particular the boulder chase, the plane fight, and the truck chase). Then of course the end when the Ark is finally opened is truly amazing and captivating to watch. Though what makes me love the film so much more is the last shot of the film, when the Ark is placed in that huge warehouse, it makes my jaw drop every time.<br/><br/>If you have never watched this film before you don't know what you are missing. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest, most exciting, and fun stories ever told on film. Every time you watch it you feel like a little five year old kid again.<br/><br/>Raiders gets a perfect 10 out of 10!"

In this film, Indy is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant. It is believed that it holds the ten commandments, and he and his ex-flame Marion must also fend off Hitler agents from getting their hands on it. What results is a movie with pure adventure and entertainment; a brilliant cast, great direction, rousing music score (John Williams' Indiana Jones themes is probably one of the most recognizable and memorable in movie history) and beautiful place settings, from the villages of Egypt to the Arc of the Covenant. It's a great film, but I personally enjoyed Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade more. I just think the stories and action to those two films were more spirited and compelling. <br/><br/>Just a funny note, as Indiana Jones being of the most memorable fictional characters, I actually parodied him in a college skit. It was fun; our skit was voted the best in the class.<br/><br/>Grade B"

The villains are no less than the Nazis, led by smarmy rival archaeologist Paul Freeman and slimy Peter Lorre look-a-like Gestapo agent Ronald Lacey. Assisting the hero are past and current love Marion Ravenwood (a terrific Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).<br/><br/>The film boasts stellar special effects that are used in the service of a literate, intelligently written storyline. The dialog is believable and the relationships amongst the characters are fascinating. The film has terrific atmosphere and flawless direction from Steven Spielberg, who really hit all the right notes in showing the kind of expertise that could be brought to popcorn films. The action set pieces are all splendid and suspenseful. Ford and Allen share a terrific chemistry. In fact, so strong is the relationship between their characters that the follow-ups have suffered a bit from the absence of the Allen character - a flaw that Spielberg and company seem unwilling to correct even in the newly announced forthcoming venture. The film has terrific villains and builds to a breathtaking climax with a healthy dose of cynicism thrown in at the end.<br/><br/>A truly superb film that is usually to be found on the lists of the greatest films of all time and at the top of the greatest adventure films ever."

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" truly is a masterpiece. Even after watching it over and over again, you can still find something that you haven't recognized before. In addition to finding something new every time you watch it, the things you have already seen never get old. Who didn't want to have a bull-whip when they first saw the movie? Who didn't dream of exploring ancient ruins, dodging vicious traps, and fighting the ""bad guys"" when they were young. Who didn't want to become an archaeologist after seeing Professor Jones in action? Watching Indiana Jones, takes you back to the good old days (1981), when archaeology professors were still real men, when cute petite brunettes could still take any man in a drinking game, and when special effects were still handmade. I have to say it really hasn't lost its appeal; it rather grows on me every time I see it.<br/><br/>So what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and experience the thrill. Grab your fedora hat and bull-whip, go outside, find something buried in your backyard, and escape all kinds of tricky situations. Or just watch ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and see a pro do it."
"peterparker212","10","2","4","13 November 2006"," Arguably the best Jones film yet....
","Indiana Jones the Raiders of the Lost Ark is arguably the best Jones film ever made. The story is set in the late 1930's and involves a archaeologist/ college professor/ adventurer undertaking many great feats and revolutionizing the world as we know it. Indian is played by Harrison Ford and is in my opinion one of his best roles, his acting is not fake or over exaggerated as some movies are which were made during this period. Also the director Steven Speilburg makes this title one not to miss. The Ford/Speilburg team is not the only reason this movie is so attracting, it contains realistic and contains character the audience can relate to, it is constantly surprising and the storyline is addictive, unlike somemovies, the story pulls you away fromreality,off your sofas and into the movie screen, (a trait all good movies should have). The special effects are top class for its day and are realistic. It incorporates a mixture of action and adventure to create a truly enthralling film. I am a passionate Jones fan and I am awaiting eagerly for its forth installment. The Jones trilogy is a set of films that all true fans of the adventure genre should own, it is a movie for the whole family and can be watched over and over again, it thrills and captivates the audience and has an explosive story line."

","Seeing ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" for its first release on the big screen was one of my greatest movie theater experiences as a small child.<br/><br/>The first of the three Indiana Jones movies was one of the best action films ever made, and certainly the best of the Indiana Jones sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>This film has everything. For villains there are knife wheeling Arabs, scheming Frenchmen, and of course Nazis. For dangers there were tarantulas, booby traps, imploding caves, runaway boulders, and poisonous snakes.<br/><br/>The setting is 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), an archaeologist/college professor has just returned from a failed mission in the South American jungles. The head of the archeology department, has given Indy a new project. Find the sacred Ark of the Covenant, containing the original Ten Commandments carried by Moses, and beat the Nazis to it.<br/><br/>In order to find the ark's location, Indy must first travel to Nepal to recover a crystallized medallion once owned by Abner Ravenwood. Abner's daughter, Marion, (Karen Allen) now owns the piece and will give it to him for a price. The price may be greater than the reward. Nazis are everywhere and so are Asps! Snakes! Hundreds of them are a major roadblock in securing the lost Ark of the Covenant.<br/><br/>Truly amazing action sequences are joined together with spectacular special effects and a great soundtrack as Indy tries, desperately, to keep the Ark from falling into the hands of the Nazis. Don't forget this movie was made in 1981, the Pre- CGI era in American cinema.<br/><br/>In one action sequence a stunt double for Harrison Ford climbs under a moving truck transporting the Ark on a major Cairo highway headed for a large vessel in the Red Sea. But it is actor Harrison Ford's job to climb into the vehicle while on his belly, and holding onto nothing but a short rope.<br/><br/>When the Ark is finally opened late in the movie, real drama enfolds. Special effects are used as we finally see the wrath of God.<br/><br/>Of course this movie is science fiction and pure fantasy. The Nazis are depicted as evil in a satirical cartoon like way, not pure evil like the Third Reich that devastated most of Europe in the 1930's and early 1940's. But that is what movies are supposed to be all about. ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" was Steven Spielberg's best fantasy action movie, and his best film ever until ""Schindler's List"" came along in 1993, and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in 1998.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was filled with drama, adventure, and satirical humor. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was a cinematic breakthrough an original, and a great action film."

No matter how many times you do see Raiders, it will always seem new to you: the idea, the plot line and the thrill of it all. Upon watching the AFI George Lucas Tribute, I found out the story behind Indiana Jones: Lucas and Spielberg had combined ideas to create a fantastic hero. I think the thing I like about Indiana Jones is that he's human, he doesn't have any superpowers, he does fear things but he still manages to save the day. He's a brilliant creation, complete with whip and lucky hat. This is one of those films that has everything put in it; but is one of the few films that manages to pull it off well. This is probably one of the reasons many programmes put in less-than-subtle parodies of this movie (especially the famous 'rolling boulder' scene). Raiders is a film that I believe whoever who has not seen yet should go and see. Or at least buy a hat."

Truth be told, the thought had occurred to me several times. Raiders is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema, and is a great tribute to the serials of the early film industry. I love Indiana Jones, and you should, too =) Perhaps one of my personal favorite scenes from Raiders is of course, the very beginning sequence, where Indy is in the jungle, along with a young Alfred Molina in tow. For the early 1980s, this film was simply amazing. If you have seen the recent release of DVDs for the film, and have paid attention to the bonus DVD with feature comments, then you know that Spielberg and Lucas tried to do all of the stunts, gags, and other effects and tricks without using special effects, in order to be true to the serials of the past. Today, if there is a scene where it involves a few thousand snakes slithering across the floor, more than likely, a director will want to digitally produce those creatures. In Raiders, no. They brought in asps, cobras, and all sorts of snakes for the Well of the Souls scene. One thing that I never noticed until the bonus DVD pointed it out was the fact that in the scene where Indy falls on his face and ends up having a stare-down with a hooded cobra, there was a glass plate between the two actors. You can see barely a glint of the cobra's reflection in the darkness right in front of Harrison Ford's face. I was stunned, but I laughed a little bit. Every time I see the movie, that scene still unnerves me, but now, I know that one of my favorite actors was not in any real danger. Forever this movie shall live-on in my heart, especially the thrilling score and soundtrack produced by the master of movie music - Mr. John Williams. ""Johnny,"" as Lucas likes to call him, was a perfect choice for this trilogy of adventure flicks. His crescendos are among the best, and his use of thematic music is unparalleled. The Raiders March is the ring tone on my cell phone, as a matter of fact. In short, if you have never seen this movie, watch it. Then, after you watch it, and are hooked, watch Temple of Doom. Then watch the Last Crusade, which is perhaps the most-loved Indiana Jones film of all-time. I hope to God that Raders 4 comes out soon. It is February 2006, and from what I understand, a script has been approved and accepted by Lucas and Spielberg. Let's all cross our fingers and hope that the thrilling sounds of the Raiders March and the silhouette of that famous figure and fedora'ed head and profile light the silver screen once again!"
"zundman7301","10","2","4","27 January 2006"," Best. Movie. Ever.
","Since their inception movies have come a long way, and in many ways they still have a way to go. However...the action movie reached it's pinnacle in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has never been beaten and for good reason. Oh how I wish I could be one of those who have yet to see this movie, I would give a lot to be able to watch it again for the first time.<br/><br/>I have never met a single person who didn't like this movie. They may not have loved it, but I've never heard anyone who said they wished they'd spent their time doing something else. Personally, I think that's just about the highest compliment you can pay a film. <br/><br/>This movie is a timeless classic. Don't miss it."
"R Becker","10","2","4","25 January 2006"," Maybe My Favorite Film Of All Time!
","A true modern classic. It's all been said before me -- Ford is perfect, Karen Allen (his best leading lady, hands down) is ideal, and the whole movie couldn't be changed one frame and still be as great as it is. For the nitpickers: Look for a tiny Indy hanging on to the periscope of the U-boat (U-boats couldn't entirely submerge, they had to keep at least an airpipe above water at all times for ventilation).<br/><br/>This lovingly crafted tribute to the great Saturday afternoon serials of the 1930s-1950s is full of fun, gritty action (Indiana Jones fights dirtier than any of his opponents -- he uses *every trick in the book!*), Americana, deathtraps and cliffhangers, and real Hollywood magic. Add to that the awe-inspiring musical score (better, ahem, than STAR WARS'), the eminently quotable dialogue (""You Americans, you are always the same -- always overdressing for the wrong occasions""), and that this is Ford's best role ever, and you have a must-see movie. If you haven't seen ROTLA, see it now! Right now! Me, I think I'll go watch it again. About 40 times in the theater, who knows how often on the small screen -- and it's still as great as ever!"
"russem31","9","2","4","24 January 2006"," Spectacular to say the least
","Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best films of director Steven Spielberg and storyteller George Lucas, if not one of the best films of all time. Almost everyone knows the classic tale of Indiana Jones so I don't have to regale you with the story. Suffice it to say, Harrison Ford is PERFECTLY cast as the title character Indiana Jones (I can't imagine any other actor in this role). John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody (both will make welcome returns in The Last Crusade), and Karen Allen as Marion are all great in the supporting roles. Also look out for Alfred Molina in a great performance at the beginning of the film (he is probably better known as the Spiderman 2 villain Doc Ock. Also a great score by maestro John Williams (one of his best for sure!). And of course look out for the snake scene! A spectacular 9 out of 10!"

","From the heavily booby-trapped South American temple to the violent gun fight in Marion's bar, from the confusing chase through the streets of Cairo to the painful fist fight with the Nazi strongman, from the exciting horse/car/truck/motorcycle chase to get control of the Ark to the Mexican stand-off with a rocket launcher to the final confrontation between good and evil, Raiders seems to have it all. It blends action and adventure with comedy, drama, romance, and horror seamlessly. The hero, Indiana Jones, is a man's man. Tough and rugged, he keeps going no matter what the odds, be it countless opposition or catching a ride on a sub or even (gasp!) facing hundreds of deadly snakes. The directing, acting, script, and story are all right on target. The theme is one of the most memorable in film history. All this and more make Raiders a timeless classic!"
"smilesigns","8","2","4","29 March 2005"," adventure thriller of unparalleled brilliance
","Harrison Ford acts brilliantly as a 1930's superhero/ Anthropologist. This film and its predecessors kept me at the end of my seat. I found few if any boring moments in this movie. The story line kept me guessing and wondering if all would turn out well. Even the love story parts kept me watching with held breath. The story kept me guessing about what events were to unfold and I never did predict them correctly. This movie is an original and stands out as a real classic. Harrison Ford was at his best. The story never looses its pace and stays believable. In addition this is a film where the characters have been well developed and the script stays clear and clean."
"Don-102","10","2","4","4 March 1999"," Old-Time serial brought to excellence by Spielberg...
","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy, is a throw-back to the old cliff-hanger serials of the 30's and 40's as we all know. It's just how well it is done that is absolutely awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a master technician, filming some of the most difficult stunt sequences ever put onto celluloid. His themes of Naziism and his obsession of WWII appear blatantly for the first time (not including 1941). There are great images of the swastika being denounced. Blood is sprayed on it from a boneheaded brawler and the ark burns it from the box it is enclosed in. Indy even escapes from the map room with a rope tied together with a Nazi flag. <br/><br/>The small touches of humor add to the incredible sense of excitement: a mischievous monkey solutes the Nazis, Marion's drinking game, ""It's not the years, it's the mileage"" - What a perfect action/adventure film. John William's score helps a lot as well. The break-neck pace and non-stop scenes of pursuit make these 'raiders' something to remember."
"em-49","8","2","4","9 August 2000"," one of the best
","This was one of the best movies. I absolutely loved it. Who could forget the scene where Indiana Jones is facing the samurai warrior, a seemingly unbeatable opponent with all his fancy sword tricks, and Indy casually pulls out his gun and shoots him. And if you don't think that's funny, when he attempts the same thing a second time later in the movie only to find out he has no gun, you should at least crack a smile. If you don't...you're hopeless. This movie was hilarious and if you haven't seen it you should."

"skepticskeptical","5","0","0","14 May 2020"," What?
","I am truly baffled by the high ratings and praise lavished upon Raiders of the Lost Ark, which, let us be perfectly frank, is completely absurd. I understand that many people are action flick aficionados, which I am not so much. However, I can say that I love the Jason Bourne movies, which also feature lots of action/adventure material. The problem with Raiders is that it is ridiculous from start to finish.<br/><br/>The Harrison Ford character is apparently immortal, as he is never defeated in any match with anyone or anything, no matter how preposterous may be the challenge which he must surmount. Is he a superhero? No, he is a college professor and research archaeologist! Nonetheless, he manages to lay to waste dozens of people without blinking an eye, as though he were a professional hit man.<br/><br/>The throbbing theme music came close to giving me a migraine. (Sort of like Beethoven´s Eroica symphony, which you have probably never heard, so never mind.) The ¨Nazis are evil¨ theme is also way overdone, as is the weird passive-aggressive romance between the rakish rogue and the damsel in distress--usually caused by Indiana Jones himself. And what about those melting faces and the swirling cosmic whatever at the end? What?????<br/><br/>My best guess is that most of the high ratings here come from people who saw the movie when it came out--and who were children at the time."

","This movie is beyond well casted. When you just see Harrison Ford in costume, you can already tell this definitive embodiment of the character. The suits are very retro and reminiscent of old noir movies. The sets are well constructed and bring the mythology of Egyptian culture to life. Every character in the movie, even the side or background characters, seem to have their own charisma to them, especially Harrison Ford in the leading role. This movie seems to have never ending sequences, gunfire after gunfire, and convoluted trap after convoluted trap."

I mean I had to literally dump my logic while watching it. There were thousand of rounds of bullets going past Dr. Jones and none touching him. From land to air to underground to water, Dr,Jones is doing whatever he likes. He kills nearly a hundred Nazi soldiers. I mean its too hard to accept as an adult.

Dr. Jones even often goes deep into the caverns of many institutions, and has experienced difficulties such as ant nests, snakes, spiders, enemies, and even the betrayal of his peers. During World War II, Hitler enlisted archaeologists from all over the world to look for the ""lost ark"", hoping to protect the Nazi army. Dr. Indiana Jones accepted the commission of the National Security Agency and decided to get the ark before the Nazis and then brought it back to the museum.<br/><br/>Dr. Jones came to Nepal and found Lisa Wood, the daughter of her master. Lisa had a copper pendant on her body, which was one of the most important tools for finding the Ark. The two had a relationship before. At one time, Lisa hated Jones very much. Now the two are back together and started hand in hand. Of course, some Nazis wanted this bronze medal, but they didn't succeed. Jones took Lisa to a friend's house to find out more information. Here, Lisa was kidnapped by Nazis on the street, Lisa's car was burnt down, Jones once thought Lisa was dead, and she was sad for a while. This was a very exciting chase scene. Jones found his old rival Dr. John, and John had turned to the Nazis.<br/><br/>But Dr. Jones will not give up, especially when he has not completed the task. Jones and friends came to the site where the Nazis excavated the Ark. Many antiquities had already appeared, but the Ark had not yet fallen. Based on his knowledge and wisdom, Jones judged the location of the ark, then went deep into the enemy camp and found the ark around a group of vipers. Even if Dr. Jones hated and feared the snake most, he had a way. Here, Jones discovered that Lisa was not dead. Soon, the Nazis discovered Dr. Jones, and the doctor's ark was taken away. Both Lisa and Jones were thrown underneath, surrounded by vipers. The wise Dr. Jones took Lisa to escape again, and the brave Dr. Jones wrestled with the Nazis. He even snatched the car from the opponent and finally recaptured the ark. Just on the steamer going to Britain, the Nazis recaptured the ark and captured Lisa.<br/><br/>Dr. Jones went to the Tiger Cave in Longtan again to rescue Lisa and search for the Ark. This time, Dr. Jones was arrested again. Dr. John decided to wait for someone to inspect the goods before sending the ark to Berlin. Just after the ark opened, Dr. John and all Nazi soldiers were killed, and the ark radiated great light and heat. Jones and Lisa escaped with their eyes closed, and then brought the Ark back to the United States to complete the mission successfully."

"krational66","7","0","0","11 April 2020"," Subject background analysis
","""
I have come to see this film with reverence, both for films made before I was born and for the subject matter.
I won't say much about filmmaking, the acting, the special effects, the structure, the sound, etc., which was more than expected in those days. I on the background environment 81 my opinion!
First of all, starting from the selection of the film, the United States is a Christian country, more than 90% of the people are christians, ""ark of the covenant"" is a Christian holy things, any difference of views on the Christian holy things is very fatal, so the film is very risky to choose this theme. Of course, this also determines the specific location of the film, the specific shape.
The ark of the covenant was made by Moses at the direction of god when he received his version of the ten commandments on mount sinai (ps: a metaphor for zion in the matrix) when he came out of Egypt. The Hebrews were convinced that the ark was a symbol of god's almighty power, and they received guidance and wisdom from it. At the same time, god's power will manifest itself through the ark. Almost all biblical accounts of the ark depict it as a weapon of war. In the battle of Jericho, the Hebrews carried the ark of the covenant and blew the trumpets. In this way, the ""efficacy"" of the ""ark of the covenant"" also determines the historical background of the film. Fasthis seeks for the ""meaning"" of the ark, hoping to win the war through the power of the ark.
The ark was sacred to the israelites, and no one was allowed to touch it. According to the bible, someone was killed by lightning for touching the ark of the covenant. Even a look is burned by the flame, indy says at the end of the film: ""don't look. Keep your eye shut!"" So that determines what the final plot and special effects are going to look like.
The bible has a detailed description of the ark :(quote)
""Make the tabernacle and all its furnishings according to the pattern I will show you.
Exod 25:10 ""you shall make a chest of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high.
""You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
""You shall also cast four gold rings and put them on its four feet, two rings on this side and two rings on that side.
""You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
""You shall put the poles in the rings beside the ark to carry it.
""The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be drawn out.
""You shall put in the ark the testimony which I am about to give you.
""You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
""Then you shall make two cherubim (angels) of hammered gold at the two ends of the mercy seat.
Make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; of one piece shall the cherubims be of the mercy seat at its two ends.
Then the cherubim shall spread their wings over the mercy seat. And the cherubim shall face to face, toward the mercy seat.
""You shall put the atonement cover on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give you.
This determines that the ark of the covenant in the film must be made in accordance with such ""ark"" props.
It is also a lot of people think the indy films will be found in Egypt's ""ark"", I want to put forward my opinion, there is a folk statement has never been confirmed: it is said that the temple of Babylon invaded, plunder, the ark was smuggled out of Jerusalem, by the king Solomon, the son of memmel nico risked their lives to secure transfer. Melenico took the ark with him to Ethiopia, where he stayed in the land of his mother, the queen of sheba.
There is also the claim that the babylonian invasion of Jerusalem was a booty, which is not true because in 586 BC the babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar ii attacked Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and enslaved the Hebrews. However, there is no mention of the ark among all the booty listed in the bible that the babylonians brought back to earth, a hint that it had disappeared by then. (but that's not to say it's impossible to find clues in the loot.)
It says in the movie that Egypt took the ark of the covenant from the temple of Solomon when they invaded Jerusalem. At this point I would like to make my point: the ark disappeared long before the Egyptian invasion of Jerusalem, 1000 years ago. In the time of king Solomon of Israel no power could invade Jerusalem. So the old folklore story is more reliable, and it's a pity that Steven spielberg didn't take it.
Oh, I just put forward my opinion, hope someone can correct the mistake. Expect more people to study it.

","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime. It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time. The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in. It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience. Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more."

So many great films have a depth in the cast that offers a multi-layered approach to storytelling. Spielberg cast John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott excellently as Ford's stalwarts. John Williams has a golden baton when it comes to action-scores (akin to Korngold) and the story clearly has a tint of George Lucas' imagination to it. Historically, there is plenty of fiction but that spoils nothing. Not the best of the series, but a very good start..."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first Indiana Jones film (followed by the Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade) and it is by far the best.

Here Harrison Ford who rocks the hell out of the leather jacket and the hat or just an ordinary everyday suit opens a secret door to the hidden desires of any class inhabitant.<br/><br/>From hot to cold, from dry to wet he goes, sneaking as a mouse or running like a mad elephant. Resting comes only in the routine hours of passing the knowledge to book-dwelling student.

The immense job of building the decorations makes you feel like a real-life raider searching for remnants of the past.<br/><br/>Unexpected threats pop up as soon as the thrill from a previous one stops ringing in your head. The chemistry of the characters stirred with the danger is a perfect cocktail to finish the movie in one gulp and then immediately stretch your shaking hand for another round. Epic score follows every step that you do, charging any moment until it starts bursting with sparks.<br/><br/>Putting the hat over a rolled whip and closing a suitcase I would note that the movie started its own history that is rolling like a boulder from a hill: it will stop some time but I believe that it won't be soon."

","You could pretty much say the same thing about this movie. Although over 30 years old, this movie holds up incredibly well to today's standards: fun, action packed, exciting, with a bit of religiosity in it (you'll see what I mean when I tell you the plot summary). This is everything that you could possibly want in an Indiana Jones flick.<br/><br/>I know that pretty much everybody here has seen the film, but for those of you who are living under a rock, here is what it's all about: Indiana Jones (played to perfection by the legendary Harrison Ford, a man who's made his career in playing grizzled action heroes), an archaeology professor, sets off to find the lost ark of the covenant - the ark which was supposed to hold the broken pieces of the tablets which had the ten commandments on them (like I said, religiosity). He travels with his love interest Marion (the best female sidekick of the series, played immensely well by Karen Allen) to Egypt to dig it up, but his old nemesis Rene Belloq and a whole bunch of Nazis are also searching for the ark in their pursuit of power.<br/><br/>Okay, do I really need to say how amazing this movie is? It's a classic! Harrison Ford is known for playing heroes such as Han Solo from the Star Wars franchise and Rick Deckard from the Blade Runner franchise; here he plays possibly the world's greatest adventurer and he seems to really love the part. While I have also mentioned Karen Allen's performance, I must also give a nod to Paul Freeman for convincingly playing an evil archaeologist whose lust for power is not healthy to say the least. All of the other supporting players do superb jobs as well.<br/><br/>But you can't review this movie and not give credit to the two men who are responsible for getting it made: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. What's to say about Spielberg? This is the guy who made Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc. When it comes to directors...heck, when it comes to movies...he is the guy who changed the game forever. And as for George Lucas, say what you want about his Star Wars prequels, but he was the one who introduced us to a galaxy far far away. Simply put, these are two of the greatest storytellers of all time.<br/><br/>I think I've said enough. Now go and watch Raiders of the Lost Ark."
"zianimustafa","8","0","0","21 January 2018"," Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981)
","Steven Spielberg's film still looks sexy after more than three decades. Spielberg and George Lucas gave Harrison Ford (who had worked with Lucas previously in Star Wars) a unique role, as an adventurer and lover of the archaeologist named Henry Jones Jr. - known as Indiana Jones, or just Indy.
He works as a professor wearing glasses, but in holidays he adventurer does not know fear, with his hat. When the Nazis discover the whereabouts of the Ark of the Covenant (which will give them an unstoppable power), Jones must stop them.
In my opinion, the film has the best key I've ever seen, filled with a host of memorable pieces (such as Ford's giant rock hunt), by the great cinematographer Douglas Slokamp. In addition to John Williams who composed music nominated for Oscar, which was performed by the London Symphony.
Raiders Of The Lost Ark was the biggest box office film in 1981 and has won nine Oscars, including the best director. Winning the best art output, best editing, best sound, best visual effects and finally the best sound effects.
The cast on Ford is also good. With Paul Freeman, who plays the role of French archaeologist René Bellock, Denholm Elliott played the role of Jones' colleague at the college (Marcus Prodi). And ""Karen Allen"" in the role of Habiba Jones (Marion Ravenwood).
The film also adds some humor. There is a fascination and vitality for this film, which Spielberg later admitted was ""the first film where I actually visualized without thinking."" Really attractive film. One of the best action and adventure movies, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is really fun as a whole."

Anyway, buckle yourself in when you watch Raiders and be prepared to be enthralled big time.

","Raiders of The Lost Ark is a 1981 film directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and John Rhys-Davies. It was distributed by Paramount, being labeled as an Action Adventure film. I have seen the film many times before and would gladly give you my opinions and observations to you. <br/><br/>The film is set during the 1930's where professor/archaeologist Indiana Jones (Ford) has almost went away with a valuable golden idol from South America. He then finds out at the Nazis are trying find the biblical ""Ark of the Covenant"" and unleash it's power to give their regime an extra edge. It is up to Indiana to find it first with the help of Marion Ravenwood (Allen) and stop the Nazis in their tracks. <br/><br/>I liked most of the main characters in Raiders, Harrison definitely steals the spotlight as Indiana in most of the scenes he's in. But the film doesn't make him overpowered or less relatable (which is a good thing). He has to fight off against seemingly impossible odds and strong brutes that give Indie a real challenge. Marion serves as a great companion to him and is more likable than the other two female leads in the next films. I'd even go far as to say the Egyptian Monkey was a good actor. <br/><br/>There's a lot to like about this film and the IJ trilogy in general. The cinematography is great, grand, and in-camera. John William's musical score is still memorable to this day. From my point of view, this film is a lot ""ballsier"" than most PG-13 films today with people melting and exploding fantastically. My only gripe with Raiders is that Indiana survives death by a pretty big amount, really hindering on my suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>Raiders has a lot of Christian imagery, the ""macguffin"" of the film (Ark of The Covenant) is a reference to the Bible. And the attempt to summon it's spirits contains a Jewish ritual. But that's all I can think of in terms of themes and such. The film is just a really great action adventure film. <br/><br/>After learning about the film for years, this film was widely known for decades and was a critical and commercial success. Young kids could be traumatized, but that would prevent them watching a great film, heck I've watched Robocop since I was 8. Adults will really like this, teens will also. I actually don't know anybody who doesn't at least appreciates Indiana Jones. No matter what your opinion on the film is, I will respect it. <br/><br/>Overall, I give Raiders of The Lost Ark a 9/10"

","An iconic movie so good it will stand the test of time and has spawned sequels, video games, merchandise and all sorts. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones (well, Henry Jones actually but he borrowed his dog's name of Indiana because he preferred that), he's a professor archaeologist who dabbles in the occasional adventure for the US Government and wealthy benefactors.

With writing credits to George Lucas, off the back of Star Wars, and a John Williams musical score you are surely going to be entertained.<br/><br/>This is a movie I can watch and re-watch, it never fails to entertain me. The musical score pushes a fantastic pace for the movie and delivers some iconic tunes too - I can still hum the theme tunes without any problems remembering how it went. It's a no holds barred adventure with fun, humour, romance, thrills, spills, horror and suspense. Harrison Ford delivers a fantastic performance as the archaeologist turned adventurer, I'd suggest his performance is the benchmark against which any other adventure film is measured against. This is slightly darker than other Indiana Jones films but in fairness it was the start of a dynasty so audiences were only just learning about him, character development in later films would make him more family friendly but this film was rightly a PG at the time as there is the occasional tense horrifying moment and occasional bloodshed. By today's standards that is nothing though, and you can still safely watch this with young children without fear. <br/><br/>I love this film, just look at the other reviews to see that practically everyone else loves this film too. You can't go wrong with this at all. Get the popcorn, close the curtains and crank the volume up to 10.

Our hero Indy (Harrison Ford) has the word iconic written on his forehead, he is the perfect hero he is charming, bad ass, smart everything a hero needs. The movie has an exceptional movie score by Academy award winning John Williams, his score is tense and brilliant. The movie has incredible shots the cinematography is quite amazing, as well as those visual effects, and nails a perfect editing.

","One of the most well-known films in history and certainly one of the crown jewels of Steven Spielberg's career. Which is saying something. The character of Indiana Jones has become a pop culture icon and probably the bane of every archaeology professor who has had to explain to his students that no, the movies have almost nothing to do with real archaeology.<br/><br/>Still, whether it's grave robbing, tomb raiding or whatever else, this film is a total blast of pulp adventure goodness. From the first iconic scene of the dirty and grumbled Harrison Ford turning to stare at the camera in an age when most cinema heroes were squeaky clean and flawless to the main story about the lost Ark of the Covenant and the desperate race against the Nazis, who want to claim its powers for their own war effort.<br/><br/>This movie has numerous upsides, but what I personally like the most about it is its sense of adventure. The film takes us all over the globe, from the temples of Peru to the Himalayas and finally to Cairo. Each location is a great place for an adventure and given a weight of history, fun and excitement. The characters are also a big part of the film. Indiana Jones of course being the main event, but all the side characters are also memorable and fun. From Indiana's feisty ex Marion (Karen Allen) to the steadfast and boastful Sallah (John Rhys- Davies). The villains are also entertaining and memorable as only Nazis can be.

","Lots of Bogart and Gable in this version of the Saturday matinée adventure serial. The action is ratcheted up and for sheer speed of thrills leaves in the dust such worthy contenders as THE PROFESSIONALS with the likes of Burt Lancaster and Woody Strode, and rivals for plot twists and turns such classics as Hitchcock's THE THIRTYNINE STEPS and THE LADY VANISHES. A humorously virile tale that takes its hero through a roller coaster maze of traps and escapes recalling Clyde Beatty and Harry Houdini.<br/><br/>There is Harrison Ford giving his Indiana Jones character a professorial panache when he's not outrunning the Hovitos cradling a Golden Idol in his arms. There is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood channeling a little Patricia Neal and out drinking her barroom patrons before greeting the love of her life with a sock as a way of saying 'Hello'. There is Paul Freeman always on hand to take whatever Indy finds during his archaeological forays as his arch rival Rene' Belloq. Ronald Lacey gives his grinning Nazi Major Arnold Toht enough Peter Lorre to be darkly satisfying in his gruesomeness. John Rhys-Davies as the hearty Arab excavator Sallah helps Jones dig in the right place and rounds out a rich and diverse cast of characters.<br/><br/>The pace is as breakneck as the Indianapolis 500 and leaves next to no time to grieve Marion when she's given up for dead in one of a series of teeth chattering death defying explosions. Every time the action clears the air for a little philosophical reflection we are off and running again after something Jones has lost to Nazi enemies or is on the verge of retrieving. Here we see the Fighting Male of the West as a sweaty beleaguered Academic scrambling for relics and artifacts worshiped by primitive cultures in both the East and the fascist West. Lucas provides more mythological motifs than you can shake a Joseph Campbell at, but it's all done with such zest that you barely mind being hit over the head with references to Moses and Odysseus before your breath is taken away.<br/><br/>The sweep brings to mind TOO HOT TO HANDLE with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, but the bump and the grind and the smashing glass and hiss and blood spatter is purely Spielbergian. It is a homage to old Hollywood and a move in the direction to a new Hollywood before you can blink an eye. This is THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE on steroids in a way; a faster paced epic about greed and how things can come to be valued over companionship and human life, but such considerations fly past faster than an arrow or a bullet or a poisoned dart. When it comes to plot pyrotechnics, this film sets the standard for action and adventure to all of the next generation to come.<br/><br/>There is some reference to RAIDERS in most of the summer action blockbusters that now appear on the screen. Perhaps only the great Bruce Lee has been more influential with regard to the choreography of the hero adventure tale as you see his moves in everything from the AVENGERS to SHERLOCK HOLMES to THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM to THE MATRIX.

","Hired to stop the Nazis getting hold of a priceless biblical artifact, a 1930s archaeologist has to combat swordsmen, sadistic Germans... and a pathological fear of snakes in this popular adventure film that brought the character of Indiana Jones to screens. The film begins strongly with a thrilling sequence in which Indy has to make his way through booby traps galore in a tomb, and while nothing later on quite matches this tension, there are several exciting moments to be had with a multi-tonal John Williams score perfectly complementing the action. This is hardly a deep or meaningful film, the antagonists range from one-note to one-dimensional and as a character, Indy lacks the charisma of an action hero like James Bond. The attempts to paint Indy as an ordinary university professor who just enjoys adventures never quite gels either since he is more agile and better at close combat than the very best of MI6. All that said and done, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a film full of memorable small moments and there are several excellent artistic shots throughout, most notably some diggers against an orange sunset and Harrison Ford viewed as only a shadow against a wall when first meeting Karen Allen. A supernatural twist near the end also takes the film in some unexpected directions and the iconic final shot of the film makes for a fantastic final note to end on."

","What can be said that hasn't already been said about Raiders of the lost ark. The film is classic Spielberg and Lucas in tandem, based on 1930's television serials Raiders of the lost ark ups the scale and budget and cemented the superstar status of Harrison Ford as a leading man. The action and overall tone of the movie is fast paced and creates a great sense of charm and adventure throughout. I am not sure how this film got a PG certificate upon release as some of the scenes are too graphic for children. Great work from Douglas Slocombe for the look/feel of Raiders, and Vic Armstrong for the stunt work in this film, which contains an amazing truck chase sequence. John Williams creates another legendary score after Star Wars and Jaws. Highly recommended."

","Watching this movie as a child filled me with awe and wonder. I was taken to another place and time filled with mystery, adventure and danger. I'd never seen anything like it. <br/><br/>The most thrilling part of the movie was how the scenes unfolded. A scene would start with slow tension; Harrison Ford making his way down a trail. The pace would pick up as he encountered a surprise. The scene would return to calm tension. Suddenly, with no warning, chaos! Ford running for his life.

","What can one say about Raiders that hasn't been said? This is, in my opinion, one of the five best action movies ever made (the others? Die Hard, Terminator 2, The Matrix, and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy). This movie has it all: a smart story (Hitler actually was looking for the Ark in the 1930's), rich characters, memorable villains, scares, amazing sets, iconic music, solid comedy, a likable and unsentimental romance, fascinating mythology, and some of the greatest stunt/action sequences ever filmed (the opening and the truck chase stand out in particular).<br/><br/>Raiders also benefits from the best leading lady in the series. As Marion Ravenwood, Karen Allen displays a tomboyish charm, spunk, and an unwillingness to simply be a damsel-in-distress. Case in point: when locked in the cockpit of a grounded bomber, she calls for Indiana's help for a few seconds, then decides to kill some time and some Nazis by manning the machine gun! The scene where she kisses Indy's wounds, which in another movie would be sexualized, is here very tender. Marion is resourceful, smart, and tough, making her the only love interest in the series who is Indy's perfect match.<br/><br/>As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford completely inhabits the character, creating a man who is both an academic and an adventurer. He's a bit of a scoundrel but also cares about people. Most importantly, he was an action hero who was self-deprecating and imperfect. Up until that point the James Bonds, the John Waynes, and the Clint Eastwoods were all extremely macho ""men's men,"" more prone to giving beatings than taking them. Even though Indiana Jones is tough and intelligent, he's constantly being outsmarted and out-punched. You know he'll win in the end, but usually he'll have to dig deep and use all of his ingenuity, physicality, and luck to to pull it out at the last second. Though John McClane and other heroes have followed the same template, Dr. Jones is the original and the best. * * * * * (out of five)"
"KineticSeoul","10","0","0","7 January 2017"," The first installment of the iconic explorer
","This was a very masterful, imaginative movie that will bring out the childlike hearts out of adults. The main protagonist Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford, I will just say that Ford is Indiana Jones. They first tried to cast Tom Selleck for this role but I am very glad that Harrison Ford played Indy instead. This is a film that inspired many filmmakers and video game creators by trying to recreate adventurous protagonists that goes on explorations. This film doesn't just have a iconic protagonist but many iconic scenes that is actually very memorable. Many kids tried to copy Indy and wanted to be Indy, because he is such a cool, charismatic, heroic and adventurous badass who is irresistible to women. He is more of a likable hero than James Bond and isn't a misogynist. Instead Indy is a true archaeologist at heart that loves history and does his best to preserve priceless artifacts for the future instead of personal gain. In another words, he is a role model that kids could look up to. So I couldn't help but root for the guy through his ordeals. The cinematography and set pieces is immersive and really does have the energy and pacing that will absorb audiences into the whole experience. It was even nominated for academy awards and actually won few of them. I will say again the set pieces really does elevate the action sequences. And the action is a blast to sit through and even adds the right amount of humor during certain parts. Films like this shows that the story doesn't have to be overly complex and has a lot of depth to it to make it classic. This is a solid entertainment blockbuster that excels in almost every area.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Cameronius_113","8","0","0","10 December 2016"," A great adventure movie
","Indiana Jones was a great main character; he was charismatic, intelligent and quite a daredevil but also feels like a regular human and you do feel a sense of danger when he is doing dangerous things- you can clearly see that he gets quite wounded in multiple situations and he is in fact vulnerable and not like a superhero or anything. The action is amazing and incredibly well done and well shot. You can see how everything flows and the amount of tension is great as it is displayed clearly that every character is very vulnerable and can easily get hurt. All of the environments feel real and it really does feel like you're on the adventure with Indy. The practical effects are also amazing, examples include the ancient relics and also the infamous face-melting scene. Some of the special effects do look dated however (for example some of the green-screen isn't particularly great) but this was 35 years ago so I guess I can kind of forgive it and it's not too distracting but I guess if they were unable to use this technology that well then maybe they shouldn't have used it as much. This movie is rated PG and is pretty violent for a movie of that rating- there's quite a bit of blood and also the face-melting scene. They took it even further with the next instalment which resulted in a new rating needing to be created, PG-13. I can't make a review on this without mentioning the soundtrack; John Williams is just amazing. Overall, a great adventure movie with amazing action and a great main protagonist and a very fun ride. 8.3/10"

","Da da DA DA <br/><br/>Da da duhhh<br/><br/>There are countless instantly recognizable movie themes - many of them written by John Williams. But there are none quite as instantly transformative as those two sets of ascending four notes on the horn that instantly spell 'Indiana Jones.' Four notes, and we're skidding under a closing temple door, a juggernaut boulder crashing behind us, dodging blow darts, pausing only to retrieve our hat. Four notes, and we unconsciously stop to absently brush the spiders and cobwebs off us, so entranced are we by the thrill of our archaeological treasure hunt. Four notes, and we're off to the movies - Raiders of the Lost Ark alongside Doctor Jones. And there's nowhere we'd rather be.<br/><br/>You could rattle off Raiders' iconic moments for the duration of its run time (""throw me the whip!""/""Throw me the idol!""; 'Gun to a sword fight'; ""Why'd it have to be snakes?!""), and still fall short of its iconic magic. But why Indy? Granted, the former Indiana Smith, the man all but christened James Bond's father (see part III for a cheeky wink at that) by his own 'parents,' the indomitable Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, is a fun character. He's a perfect foil to subject to all the action, intrigue, globetrotting, and treasure hunting joys that proliferated the matinée adventure serials of his pappy's boyhoods. And we have him (and them) for forever cementing archaeology as THE COOLEST profession shy of a firefighting superhero astronaut in the eyes of generations of youth.<br/><br/>Spielberg clearly knew they were onto something here, and reciprocates by being on the top of his game, delivering the quintessence of a robust, brawny, populist cinematic adventure as only he can. His opening act - again, a 007 homage - is immediately unforgettable, introducing the titular hero as a dramatic silhouette, easily outmaneuvering his cowering guide (the exquisitely weaselly Alfred Molina) as he's beset by a franchise's worth of booby traps. It's a slow build from there, toeing the line of leisurely, despite an explosive bar brawl in the Himalayas (including another unforgettable introduction for Karen Allen's tough-as-nails, exceptionally charismatic Marion Ravenwood) to tide us by. But soon enough, we're thrust into the thick of snake-filled antiquity ruins, besieged by Nazis (who else?), and from then on, the film is unstoppable. Crisp editing, flawlessly dusty cinematography, and the magnificently grandiose archaeological sets ignite the film with a rambunctious, sand-etched enthusiasm, while the action sequences bristle with breathtaking intensity (remember to return from the edge of your seat after watching Jones sucked under a moving truck, or ducking under a plane propeller mid-fistfight) coupled with disarming matinée silliness. And that climax - probably the most literal 'Deus Ex Machina' in cinema history? 'Exhilarating' is the understatement of a thousand lifetimes. <br/><br/>But the real joy, the real 'je ne sais quoi' of Raiders of the Lost Ark lives in its tiny, throwaway moments - many buoyed by Spielberg's savagely cheeky sense of humour, or flair for unexpectedly iconic character beats. ""Love You"" on a student's eyelids flustering Jones mid-lesson. Indiana interrupting Marcus Brody (the delightful Denholm Elliot)'s line - clearly unscripted - because he's so excited about archaeology. John Rhys-Davies' bombastically lovable Sallah bursting into Gilbert and Sullivan because he's ""so pleased you're not dead!"" Arch-rival Belloq (perfectly preening yet oddly dignified Paul Freeman) bursting into laughter when drunkenly threatened by a knife. Insidious, scar-handed Nazi stooge Toht (unforgettably grotesque Ronald Lacey) giggling nervously when the Ark of the Covenant is revealed to be full of dust. Indiana falling asleep amidst what should be a passionate love scene. And, of course, the unforgettable 'brought a gun to a sword fight' standoff. These are what elevate the movie from good, spirited fun to the level of unforgettable movie magic. These are what make it truly special.<br/><br/>Still, there are two indisputable MVPs for Raiders' rampant success: John Williams, and Harrison Ford. Never before have music and actor fused into such an unforgettable driving force of a character - a hero who really sweats, bleeds, grunts, cusses, undercuts his triumphant introduction by whining about snakes, and cements his place at the forefront of thirty-five years worth of audiences' hearts. It's easy to overlook Ford's razor-sharp comedic timing amidst his brimming, crusty charisma, but watch for his exasperated, exhausted grimaces when confronted by a superfluously sword-swinging adversary, fumbling aboard a descending Nazi submarine, or challenged to bareknuckle boxing mid-plane hijack, and the film reaches a level of sublime, almost peerless character comedy. It's this crystalline grounding of impossible feats within the characterization of a man who risks his life for museum artifacts that sells the inherent ridiculousness of Indiana Jones, taking him from self-parody to genre-defining, and spawning innumerable, inherently inferior knock-offs. Freeman's Belloq's villainous jeers prove prophetic: Jones is now an unshakable, invaluable part of modern cultural history. And he doesn't even have to be quarantined to a museum. <br/><br/>There's an argument to be made that The Last Crusade peps up the already nearly airtight formula with more comedy and action for your buck, and Temple of Doom, while clumsy and flawed, delves into some intriguingly grim terrain (what's a Crystal Skull? You must've been dreaming). Still, the word classic isn't used lightly, and Raiders of the Lost Ark remains just that: a game-changing, fundamental force in escapist cinematic perfection. So forget about your pesky real world problems! Because you are at the MOVIES, with Spielberg, Johnny Williams, and the perennially grimacing Indiana Jones. And here, everything is going to be okay. You're in good hands. Whose good hands? Top. Men.<br/><br/>Duh duh DA da duh DA da <br/><br/>Duh DA DA da dahhhh<br/><br/>-10/10"

","In 1936 the US Government has learnt that the Nazis think they have found the last resting place of the Ark of the Covenant at a remote location in Egypt. In order to prevent Hitler getting his hands on the Ark, which he believes would make his forces invincible, government agents ask archaeologist/adventurer Indiana Jones to find it first and retrieve it. Before going to Egypt he head to Nepal to retrieve an item he needs to locate the room that houses the Ark from Marion Ravenwood, the daughter of his former mentor. The Nazis know she has it and head their too. After fighting them off Indiana and Marion head to Egypt where they meet Indiana's friend Sallah. Marion is soon captured, and for a while presumed dead, leaving Indiana and Sallah to search for the Ark; inevitably he finds it and learns that Marion is still alive but he still has a long way to go before the adventure is over.<br/><br/>This iconic adventure film feels as fresh now as when I first saw it in the early eighties. The opening is one of the most memorable in any film as it introduces us to our protagonist by showing him retrieving a gold monkey idol from a booby-trapped South American temple only to have it stolen by is rival a rival we will see again working for the Nazis. Once the story proper gets started the action rarely lets up; Indiana and his friends are almost constantly under threat from some particularly unpleasant bad guys these Nazis are even nastier than most shown in such films. The action is impressive, and at times surprisingly scary given the film's PG rating we see blood spray when a man goes through an aircraft propeller, snakes emerging from the mouth of a long-dead corpse and, in the finale, faces melting! Harrison Ford is on top form as protagonist Indiana Jones and Karen Allen is a lot of fun as Marion and John Rhys-Davies impresses as Sallah. The bad guys are equally fun with Paul Freeman as Indiana's rival and Ronald Lacey as the vile Nazi Arnold Toht. Overall I'd say this is a great action adventure for all people looking for plenty of thrills and quite a few laughs. It might be too scary for younger children but apart from that can be enjoyed by everybody."
"classicalsteve","9","0","0","11 September 2016"," A Modern-Day Treasure-Hunt of Epic Proportions Stylistically Like the Old Action-Serials of the 1930's, 40's and 50's
","In the early 20th century, the fantasy-adventure genre was in vogue in the pulp magazines such as ""Amazing Stories"" and ""Weird Tales"" where western-society adventurers, typically British and American, replete with safari hat and khaki pants traveled to a far-away locale encountering ancient relics and ancient peoples. There would be a few obligatory scenes where an ancient people with spears would be chasing after the hero. Alan Quartermain was one of the first of these adventure-heroes traveling to distant lands seeking adventure. A few of these adventure-genre stories were produced into films, such as ""King Kong"", ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (by the same producers as ""King King""), ""Four Frightened People"", and ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Even the ""Flash Gordon"" serials had much in common with these adventure-to-other-lands series. ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a late 20th-century updated version of these old adventure films and takes place during the 1930's when Hitler and the Nazis ruled Germany.<br/><br/>Oddly, the adventure films of the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood, circa 1930 to 1960, were relegated to B-film status and the serials. With the possible exception of ""King Kong"", most adventure films were low budget B-films with lesser-known actors, lower budgets, and relatively mediocre scripts. Many of these offerings were shot on sound-stages in Hollywood. When ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" premiered in the early 1980's, the adventure film had received some serious face-lifts. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" set the standard with better scripts, better actors, location-shooting, and larger budgets, incorporating fun, adventure, antiquities, and even some humor into a satisfying cinematic experience.<br/><br/>When he's not engaging in mediocre lectures as a nerdy professor at his university, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford in one of his defining roles) is an archaeological adventurer, seeking antiquities throughout the world for museums in the western world, predominantly for the United States and Britain. His arch-rival is Belloq (Paul Freeman), a French archaeologist who has sold his soul to the Nazis in return for financing archaeological exploits. Jones studied under Dr. Abner Ravenwood, an archaeologist who has gone missing somewhere in Asia. Jones briefly dated his daughter, Marion, before the beginning of the events of the story.<br/><br/>After an altercation with his rival Belloq, losing a gold religious icon-head in Peru, Indiana Jones is approached by the US government to engage in a treasure hunt which has a nearly 2500-year history. The Nazis are after the so-called Ark of the Covenant (not to be confused with Noah's Ark, Joan of Arc, or Archie Bunker), an ornate gold chest which supposedly housed the Ten Commandments brought down from on High by Moses to the Israelites, a.k.a. the Jews/Hebrews of Pre-Christianity. According to Old Testament biblical tradition, the Ark of the Covenant resided in the ""Holy of Holies"" in the Great Temple in Jerusalem and would only have been seen by the highest priests of the temple. The Ark went missing after the Babylonians conquered the Israelites circa 500 BCE. (Whether the Ark actually existed has been debated for nearly 2000 years. Although some antiquities-hunters and Christian-Evangelicals want to believe the Ark may still exist, more than likely, if it had existed, it was destroyed by the Babylonians who probably melted down the Ark for its gold to create their own treasures and artifacts.) <br/><br/>The Allies believe the Nazis desiring the Ark of the Covenant has to do with their quest for ultimate domination, the Ark associated with divine power. So if the Nazis think they can attain the Ark, the Allies better confiscate it before they do. So US government officials offer Indiana Jones an offer he can't refuse: finance him to find the Ark before the Nazis. He travels first to Nepal where he meets his old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who has in her possession an amulet which turns out to be a crucial piece of the puzzle to find the Ark. The Nazis are also hot on Jones' trail. Marion and Indiana then travel to Cairo, Egypt, where the Nazis are already engaging in a large-scale dig for the Ark. Jones solicits the help of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) to hire a crew of excavators to find the Ark before Belloq and the Nazis. Unfortunately, Belloq has often been able to take artifact-treasures literally right out of Jones' hands.<br/><br/>One of the all-time great action-adventure films with a humorous script, top-notch acting, and wonderful scenic shots. A few scenes use some of the Old Hollywood devices, like a map with an animated line showing their journey across the globe. Some of the chase scenes go on a little bit long, but there's plenty of other ingredients which keeps the story fresh and moving. Even the love-story which is rekindled between Marion and Indiana is a nice relief from the action. One of the best scenes is how they discover the actual location of the Ark, supposedly hidden in the lost city of Tanis in Egypt not far from Cairo. While Tanis was a real ancient city now in ruins, the idea the Ark would have been placed there seems quite fantastical, considering the Ark was lost when they were conquered by Babylon, not Egypt. The Egyptians probably could have cared less about a Jewish artifact. However, we tend to run with the story all the way."

"virek213","10","0","0","27 July 2016"," 35 Years Later: It's Not The Years, Honey; It's The Mileage
","Where to begin? Writing this review, it has now been thirty-five years since this crazy Steven Spielberg/George Lucas homage to B-movie adventure serials of the 1930s was unleashed on an unsuspecting world in the late spring/early summer of 1981; and even with the three sequels that it has spawned (thus far) and the myriad imitations it has spawned, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still has to rank as one of the high points of the action film genre's entire history. There's no question that there are elements of the film that are very dated nowadays, not to mention ethnic stereotypes that were wrong then and are even more wrong today. But for sheer artistic and cinematic verve, this still ranks as a Hollywood popcorn extravaganza par excellence.<br/><br/>There's no need any longer to go into plot, as we all know it involves Harrison Ford as the intrepid archaeologist Indiana Jones battling the Nazis in a race to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant and the unspeakable power locked inside it. But it is instructive to remember how big a deal this film was to all involved. Lucas had already struck a colossal gold mine with the first two STAR WARS films that had Ford as Han Solo; and Spielberg could boast having made two huge hits of his own in JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Spielberg, however, had also gone well over schedule and budget on both of those two; and he did it again on his 1979 World War II comedy ""1941"", so much so that that film's poor critical and commercial finish almost finished him as a director. It was important for him that he deliver a film that could stick to both schedule and budget, yet still be good enough to be a hit. Fortunately, Lucas gave him that chance here; and with careful execution, all of the intended goals were achieved, and then some.<br/><br/>The two big action sequences, Ford's outrunning a rolling boulder in the famous opening prologue, and the truck chase across the Sinai Desert (eight minutes of hair-raising tension created in no small part by Ford doing his own stunt work) still must rank as some of the best of their kind ever pulled off. It also helps that Ford shows the kind of honest human vulnerability you don't find in most other action heroes (Stallone; Schwarzenneger, etc.); as he tells his girlfriend (Karen Allen): ""It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage"", which is more than a little true. There are moments where the violence, tame though it is by 21st century standards, did make some audiences back in 1981 a little squeamish (the face-melting that takes place in the opening of the Ark at the film's climax is still a tad bit sick); one must remember that this was rated 'PG', and the controversy surrounding the violence here and in its immediate sequel INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM led to the creation of the 'PG-13' rating. But there is also a certain amount of comedy relief as well, involving Ford's squeamish behavior around all forms of snakes, and the famous split-second shooting of an Arab swordsman, improvised downward from a big sword fight because Ford had eaten some bad local food on the day the scene was shot. The Nazi villains are, of course, cardboard villains (since the film was set in 1936, before anyone knew what Hitler and his minions were really up to, it was easier to do it that way); but Ford's nemesis Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the devious Toht (Ronald Lacey) are a couple of really nefarious heavies that give Ford's Indiana Jones something to chew on. And it wouldn't be right not to acknowledge Allen's slightly sardonic contribution to the film as well, especially when she knocks one knife-wielding goon cold with a skillet in the basket chase scene, an hysterically funny moment.<br/><br/>And finally, no review of this film would be complete without giving a nod to John Williams, whose score here, like many of his other contributions to the art of film scoring, gives the film its voice, from the famous Raiders March to the brass-choired Nazi theme during the truck chase. The end result is a masterpiece of the entire action genre that holds up even to this day, both real in other ways and fanciful in others, but with a balance that most of today's $200 million-plus sound-and-fury ""blockbusters"" may never be able to match."

","I'm not the biggest fan of either Steven Spielberg or Harrison Ford come to that. ""E.T."", ""Close Encounters"", the whole ""Star Wars"" thing, hate them all. But this is different. I do love a swashbuckling adventure movie and here Spielberg gives us the ultimate old- fashioned actioner. Spielberg has described his Indiana Jones as his take on James Bond, only with less intrigue and less sex but with more excitement and levity. Like Bond Indy has his own signature theme tune, gets a spine tingling big-budget opening prologue, can fight like the blazes and of course, gets the girl. Setting the movie during the Second World War provides easily identifiable baddies in the form of the pursuing Nazis and also means it has much less reliance on modern gimmicks and gadgets. If anything though the set-piece action sequences are better here than anything surely done to date even whilst some of the stunts recall Golden Age Hollywood, for example Indy's crawl under a speeding truck is only a variation of the same under an out of control wagon in many a Western of yore.<br/><br/>Richly shot, the set constructions are excellent, the outside locations are radiantly captured, the special effects and stunts are great, I especially liked Spielberg's imaginative use of silhouettes in some of the scenes. The script is tight and witty and is clever enough to preface later actions with earlier clues, like Alice's drinking ability and Indy's fear of snakes. There are also some nice throwaway comedic lines with not a raised eyebrow in sight. <br/><br/>The destructive effects of the Ark fully live up to dread expectation in the Germans' submarine bay but other highlights include the afore-mentioned car-chase and Jones' short and sweet encounter with a surprise whip-waving adversary.<br/><br/>As a great lover of old Hollywood plot-thin action-packed blockbusters, this could hardly be bettered with Harrison Ford echoing the spirit of Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power and Stewart Grainger. This is one of those rare movies which is as much fun as it looks like it was to make and thoroughly deserved its huge box-office success."

","So much hype about how Spielberg learned his craft of suspense from RKO's matinée movies and series. Not a word about him being influenced by Chinese kungfu movies. <br/><br/>I was surprised to discover that so much of this 1981 Raiders of the Lost Ark movie is almost a copy of a 1976 Chinese kungfu movie from Hong Kong. The English title of the Chinese movie is ""Web of Death"". It's about a spider with deadly supernatural power which was hidden by the spider clan to keep its power contained, just like the ark. Bad guys of course tried to find it and did, just like the Nazis in the Spielberg movie. The traps in this and later Spielberg movies are so similar to the traps in this Chinese movie. And the special effects in the final fight between good and evil are almost identical. <br/><br/>Except the hero in the Chinese movie is an awesome girl. Unlike the Spielberg movie which had to keep Indiana Jones alive for sequels, the Chinese girl sacrificed herself and died to save the good guys even though everyone tried to kill her just a few moments ago.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones movies are hits because it's easy to like the sassy professor and the Nazis are the perfect foil. But we should at least acknowledge the influence of this movie from Hong Kong on this film from Hollywood."

We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.<br/><br/>Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?<br/><br/>Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.<br/><br/>My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.<br/><br/>My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.<br/><br/>Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there."""

","I kid you not: the first 10 minutes of the movie actually made me HATE the movie. I mean, Raiders of the Lost Ark was an Arachnophobe's nightmare - 3 tarantulas clinging at the back of Indiana Jones was enough, but a hundred on Alfred Molina's character? Jesus Christ, bless his soul. So, being an arachnophobe, that ticked me off already and I had to put off the movie for a good night, or two. However, that wasn't really going to stop me from watching one of the greatest movies ever (as said by Empire in its '301 Greatest Movies Of All Time'). And so, I found my courage once again, skipped the part with the tarantulas, and continued on with the movie. <br/><br/>All I can say is: Wow. There's no wonder this movie is one of those movies you just have to watch. It is a complete masterpiece of an 80s classical flick - vintage, kinda'-sorta' cheesy story-wise, a bit of flawed logic here and there, and the protagonist with a beautiful girl at the end. Yes, In the year 2015, we've probably seen it all already and critiquing the themes of this movie in this day and age would not be fair, for sure. But had I been given the chance to watch this movie when it was first released in 1981, I'm pretty sure I would've said to myself: ""Boy, this movie will set the bar for many more adventure movies to come... hopefully"". <br/><br/>In terms of the cinematography, the acting, the casting, and the story, I could all give those a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5.

","What a thrill ride this movie still is today! Like the old cliffhanger movies of the old serials of the 40's and 50's this borrows heavily on that heritage. First there's the lead character played perfectly by Harrison Ford (Tom Selleck was supposed to be Indy, but was under contract with CBS for Magnum. I believe it would not have been as good, but that is speculation at this point) who plays the character with a bit of tongue in cheek and zeal like only Ford could in his prime. From the start of the movie it starts a non-stop roll of events that gives you just enough time to breath and soak in the last scene of action. It uses the old map trick to convey travel and sends us on a world wind adventure. Indy has a quote in the movie-""It's not the years, it's the mileage."" This film suffers neither age or mileage. It truly could be re-released today, and would be a hit. If you haven't viewed it, you should. You will not be disappointed."

","I've known this film for about as long as I can remember, and the entire Indiana Jones trilogy for that matter. When I was a kid, all three of the movies were the same to me, but as I got older I realized that while the sequels do have their good moments (Not including Crystal Skull, yikes) there's really only one of the films that I personally believe still holds up to this day and is the best out of the trilogy. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is exciting, inventive, humorous and classic. Harrison Ford offers a ruggedness and an undeniable charm to the character of Indiana. He's much more three dimensional than my 7 year old self remembers. He's not a perfect hero, he gets hurt, he stumbles and he makes mistakes, which in my opinion, makes the character even more appealing. Karen Allen plays Marion, who I think is the strongest female lead of the trilogy, and Karen was by far the best actress in the series. Not quite damsel in distress material as she proves throughout the film that she can hold her own, and she refuses to be bossed around. Part of what makes this film so fantastic is the details. Spielberg has a great attention to them and despite the film's enormous stature, I found it's the smaller things that make it the success that it is. Every shot is positioned beautifully, particularly in the opening temple sequence. That's not to say that the film's riveting chase sequences and heart-pumping action aren't notable as well. All the elements fall into place beautifully like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. There's little left to be desired and hardly a thing to complain about. If you have not seen this film already, please watch it! I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I'd say that spending a weekend marathoning through the trilogy would definitely be worth your time!"

","Lucas and Spielberg's first ode to the serial adventure is still a densely atmospheric, loaded thrill ride. Indy is such a fascinating, larger-than-life personality that he outright demands our attention when he's on the screen (which is something like 95% of the time) and, even when we think we've got him figured out, still manages to surprise us. Casting Harrison Ford was absolutely crucial, though, because without his off-the-chart levels of confidence and charisma, the character wouldn't have been able to get away with half the things he does or says. Although it trots the globe, seemingly without rest, the plot is actually very well-paced and wisely gives the cold shoulder to any hint of overwrought back-story or origin. We're having enough fun in the present, so why get caught up in anything more complicated than ""He's a professor who moonlights as a tomb raider""? Quick-witted and funny when appropriate, exciting and unpredictable the rest of the time, it manages a near-perfect blend of realism and fantasy. The dark, dated cinematography is probably the only aspect of the film that hasn't aged gracefully."
"ShibanPD","Null","0","0","12 November 2012"," Raiders of the Lost Ark
","In 1981, the stars aligned over Hollywood, and the greatest adventure movie of all time was born, from one of the greatest movie collaborations of all time. Leave it to Hollywood to turn a prosaic, meticulous scientific endeavor like archaeology into a spectator sport; the opening action sequence finds the film's hero, after capturing the object of his mission, cradling it like a football and sprinting like a halfback out of the buried site of ruins, dodging booby-trapped poison darts all the way. The premise of Raiders of the Lost Ark is credited to the creative genius of George Lucas, who somehow hit upon the idea of replacing an academic profession marked by a slow, gradual pursuit of truths about human prehistory with a romantic, mercenary endeavor, in which the practitioners are pirates in a high-speed, cutthroat, competitive race for buried treasures that have been buried for thousands of years. One of those pirates is now one of the most recognizable movie heroes of all time. Like Superman, Indiana Jones maintains a mild manner in his day job and dons iconic garb to pursue his true passion. Instead of reporting, Jones teaches at university; instead of fighting crime, he risks life and limb to unearth important historical artifacts, which he sells to museums. Like the various eras of remote history imprinted into the living rocks, layer upon layer, Raiders was developed through an escalating application of movie talents. Lucas's idea developed into a perfectly understated screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, became fully realized under the stylish, high-energy direction of Steven Spielberg, and achieved legendary status through a star-making performance by Harrison Ford and a film-score masterwork by composer John Williams. Jones, as played by Ford and directed by Spielberg, is slightly more than a hero, but well short of a superhero. His face is unshaven. He sweats. He looks like he hasn't showered in days, and he probably has bad breath. When he first steps into the light in South America, he is still in the shadows. When he swings from a vine, and we first hear his heroic theme, he falls and plops into the water, well short of the amphibious airplane that rescues him from pursuing natives. And when he gets into the getaway plane, he is met with the pilot's pet snake, which we learn Jones hates. This is a real man, with real vulnerabilities. John Williams' musical soundtrack aside, Raiders sounds astoundingly good, as exemplified by the scene in Nepal, where Jones meets Toht, the most sinister of his Nazi enemies, and Marion, the most important of his allies. From start to finish, Raiders is virtually non-stop action and intrigue, infused with humor, and polished with a touch of romance. It is a treasure hunt over three thousand years in the making, the object of which—the Ark of the Covenant—adds a spiritual, mystical dimension to a film that otherwise follows a standard action/adventure story arc. And although the end can be criticized for its ""deus ex machina"" resolution, it is the end that gives the film its soul. God in Raiders is interventionist and vengeful, and He punishes the Nazis and their accomplices for disturbing the vessel that held the tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments—the Covenant—which they have broken through their evil ways. Indy and Marion are spared, not just because they are good, but because Indy knows not to look. It's all part of a strange archaeological and religious folklore that somehow makes sense within the context of the movie, and somehow fits in with the film's Saturday matinée, Summer blockbuster appeal."

","Film exists to provide entertainment. Raiders of the Lost Ark does just that, in its purest form. Very few other films can claim to such a beloved status as this, adventure's masterpiece. <br/><br/>I feel like this is a film that anyone who ventures onto the IMDb has seen. As such, it's redundant to tell you to see this one. No, there's no deep message, or allegory, but 2 hours of unrivalled fun. Action, explosions, suspense, wit, romance, comedy... the ultimate blockbuster.<br/><br/>Cinephiles may look down on Indy for not having thematic value, but that was never the intent. Armed with the most lethally sharp script in Hollywood, Spielberg and Lucas created an extraordinarily likable character put into a unique, original situation. Religious mystery? Shooting lots of people? Yes, but it's OK because they're Nazis. Or Belloq. Everything about this film is top notch, from its acting, to music, cinematography, set design... pure joy.<br/><br/>I'd always seen this film as timeless: the version I saw was of fantastic quality and the film looks fantastic, explosions are convincing, the violence is surprisingly graphic but not extreme, but the little thing that bugs me is the CG. It's the only part of the film firmly rooted in the 80's, and it bugs me to see such primitive effects next to the most pristine presentation otherwise.<br/><br/>But this little thing can't hold back Raiders.

For example, the blue screen filtering is plainly obvious in some scenes but that didn't bother me at all because unlike most CGI-ridden films today, this one had energy, entertainment, adventure and, perhaps above all, heart. I also liked that they tried to keep it as real as possible, such as filming on real locations. The fusion of humour, energetic action, suspense and even romance is terrific. The comedic scenes, and there are plenty, are spot on and had me laughing out loud, even after repeated viewing.

","Raiders of the Lost Ark introduced the world to Indiana Jones, an archetypal action hero for all generations. This film shows Indy racing with the Nazis to attempt to uncover the lost Ark of the Covenant from the Christian Bible. Through the movie he faces many dangerous scenarios, cunningly escaping with a combination of wits and physical prowess. Aided by his now-famous whip in tight confrontations, and aided by his professor's cunning in puzzle situations, he skillfully demonstrates the ability to come out on top of every encounter.<br/><br/>In the first scene of the movie, Indiana Jones is on an expedition to some country in South America where he goes into a cave and has to outsmart different levels of puzzles to eventually get a golden idol. He evades every trap, gets to the idol, and then outruns a giant boulder to the exit. Upon arrival at the exit, his archenemy Belloq confronts him with a small army and takes the idol from him. Seeing Indy escape so many perils with such skill foreshadows his ability to escape from great peril throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Pretty early in the movie Indy meets with a woman named Marion who will have some clue about the location of the Ark. It becomes clear that she and Indy had a romantic past and shortly thereafter we learn that she also had a past with Belloq. Whenever a movie has two archenemies and a common romantic interest, the bad guy will take the girl captive and the hero will rescue her. Believe it or not, that all happens later on.<br/><br/>One of the subtleties that are fun to watch throughout the movie is the famous Indiana Jones hat. Throughout every action scene, whether he is in a fist fight, in a pit of snakes, leaping across a bottomless pit, or racing through busy streets knocking over baskets carried on top of people's heads, it stays on his head, never once falling to the ground. Indy's always stationary hat is an adamant reminder of his unrelenting pursuit of good. <br/><br/>The thing that makes Harrison Ford such a good Indiana Jones is how the acting in scenes of endless crises. When he falls into a pit of snakes, with Marion, and the ""tomb"" gets sealed by Belloq, Ford doesn't revert to cheesy facial expressions or unnecessary gimmicks; instead he faces it with a calm demeanor that shows his analyst nature, always looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. <br/><br/>One of the less subtle things that are pervasive is the use of the Nazis. They are shallowly developed characters, but that isn't necessary to the storyline. What keeps the story going is the symbolic motif that ""Nazis are bad"" with anti-Nazi instigations. Nazi symbols burst into flame when near the Ark, the Nazis are all killed when they open the Ark, and when Indy tries to cling to a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament it snaps right off, Mercedes being a German company. The anti- Nazi symbolism used throughout the movie is pervasive enough to be noticed and humored but small enough to not create any serious backlash.<br/><br/>The biggest thing that bothers me about solo action hero movies is that there is never any real fear for the main character. With only one main good guy, when he is in peril early on in the movie, there is always the notion that he will unduly escape and save the day. When a movie encompasses a group of good guys that the story connects, then the audience gets more fearful knowing that at any time anybody in the group could die. Indiana Jones is the sole purpose for this film, so putting him into danger as early as the first scene isn't necessarily for the danger aspect, but simply to build his character and reputation. <br/><br/>Indiana Jones is the, not a, the, archetypal action hero. You can replace dozens of action heroes in other movies with Indiana Jones and you will often find the same result: Good guy saves the day, bad guys lose. Indy set the tone for generations to come for being a noble and skillful hero without accrediting fame or fortune: he taught when he wasn't on an adventure."

Even the current generation, used to cgi effects won't be deterred from the old time effects present in the movie (matté shots, physical stunts, etc...). I mean, for some reason Lucas and Spielberg decided to maintain the same style of filmmaking in the latest installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, despite the time gap elapsed since Raiders (27 years) and the technology developed since.<br/><br/>This is an adventure-fantasy movie, period. No greater aspirations or elevating themes suggested. We have a hero, Professor Henry Jones Junior (AKA the gung ho archaeologist Indiana Jones), who is running against the stereotypical bad guys to get a land mark archaeological gem, the lost ark of the covenant, overcoming all the traps they lay for him, fighting of every scrimmage possible-and imaginable:- there's a fight in a moving airplane, a pursuit in the streets of Cairo, an escape from a large moving boulder, etc . In this Indiana Jones movie, the first installment in the series, the bad guy is a suave french archaeologist, aided by a group of nazi soldiers and gestapo officers (yes, the movie is set in a pre- second world war scenario), who always out wit Indy, but never seem to get rid of him!<br/><br/>George Lucas has long stated that Indiana Jones is an homage to the old republic serial adventures. Well I haven't seen any of them (they never ran in my country, Portugal), but every one of the Indy movies seem like a very large and entertaining episode that when it's over leaves in me an overwhelming hunger for the next movie, so I supposed that was the general idea perceived by Lucas.<br/><br/>The next thing is to try and explain to you why am I reviewing on this particular Indy movie. Because it's the best in the series? No, at least not for me. That accolade falls to the third movie, ""Indiana Jones and the last crusade"". Never the less, after seeing it recently I felt I was looking at a rough diamond. Not quite polished and there for not yet presented in all its magnificence, but awakening the nostalgic feelings in you, because you know your in for a fast and bumpy ride, keeping your blood running. Your in for the various lushing sets; the many adventures to come; the different exotic places around the world, everything well scored by John Williams (he actually has a different tune for each character and situation, a device that he followed through the entire series)!<br/><br/>And in the end who (or what) do we have to think to: George Lucas' witty imagination? Harrison Ford's superb rendition of the Humphrey Bogart type of hero? Steven Spielberg's ability to film a fantastic adventure movie_ I've seen the recent Tintin movie he made and trust me, he still knows how to do it!<br/><br/>Only one thing plagues my mind: when these guys are gone, who will we turn to for a good adventure movie on the Sunday afternoon?!!!"

","Copying isn't always a bad thing. Copying is what 80s cinema did in a big way – from remakes and spoofs to homage and reference, cinema thrived on recycling the past. Raiders of the Lost Ark borrows the adventuresome plots and exciting action of 1930s serials, classic swashbucklers and the James Bond franchise, while hinting at influences as disparate as Lawrence of Arabia and the Cecil B. DeMille religious extravaganzas. And like all of the great blockbusters of this era, its success comes not only from its derivative nature or its non-stop action, but from the fact that it is simply brilliantly conceived.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark also works by being somewhat tongue-in-cheek, pre-empting any sneers at the genre's clichés by spoofing them itself. The screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan features such self-satirizing lines as ""You can't do this to me, I'm an American!"" But this isn't quite like the brilliantly daft 1980 Flash Gordon, for which your sense of irony must be switched to max. Kasdan's script is fully-functioning and wholly professional. Every moment and every line counts. Exposition scenes often dovetail into action ones, so we never have a chance to get bored. The scene where the army intelligence people come to ask Indy about Ravenwood and the staff of Ra serves two purposes. Firstly, it gives the audience the necessary background for the quest ahead without being too presentational. Secondly, the officials' lack of knowledge and sympathy endears us further to Indy, and lets us know that we won't be calling in the cops or the army for this one.<br/><br/>Director Steven Spielberg has elaborated on Kasdan's work by fashioning action scenes that are both fun and inventive. Spielberg injects sequences with so many neat little ideas to continually amuse us and stop this from being a no-brainer. Take for example the local man falling onto the front of the truck during the road scene. Spielberg makes the moment both funny and exhilarating by showing us for a split-second the man's surprised face in the windshield. By-and-large the director keeps a rather detached eye, his camera often peeping through a bit of scenery or overlooking the action with a god-shot. It is this approach that gives so much of the picture its distinct, memorable look. Intense moments like Sallah's realisation that the dates are poisoned are composed of a series of attention-grabbing shots with no camera movement, creating a series of iconic images like the frames of a comic book. And this is really what Spielberg is at this stage of his career; a comic book director. But he happens to be a very good one.<br/><br/>What really makes Raiders of the Lost Ark such a treasure is its fabulous characters and the way they are presented. The hero Indiana Jones is introduced as an enigma, a mysterious figure in hat. The opening shots reveal him to be a leader at the head of a band, an expert in the field and eventually, a handy man with a whip – and only then do we see his face. Karen Allen's Marion is easily the best of the Indiana Jones heroines, tough and resourceful in her own right, able to be his partner in adventure. And Paul Freeman's Belloq is the ultimate Indiana Jones villain. Smart and sophisticated, his enmity fuelled by rivalry rather than a simple conflict of interests, he's probably the most believable foe Indy has ever come up against. At the other end of the scale there's the sinister thug Toht, played with relish by English TV actor Ronald Lacey. Lacey makes his entrance as the campy and comical Gestapo stereotype, but when he coldly whispers ""Let me show you what I am used to"" his tone is utterly menacing and the character becomes genuinely scary. There are so many more perfectly written and played supporting roles – John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Denholm Elliott as Brody – and it's not clear whether the actors were cast to suit the characters or whether the characters were developed around the actors. Most likely a mix of both.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Arc is really what all these early blockbusters were – a distillation of all the techniques for making high-quality entertainment. Yes, its ideas are cobbled together from the last five decades of action cinema, not to mention adventure literature and comic books, but it gets away with it. It gets away with it not just because of its knowing and light-hearted take approach, but because of how its makers have learned from the past, completely refining every aspect of the genre to make a modern classic."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","0","25 January 2011"," The Greatest Action Hero since Bond
","To ""Star Wars"" fans Harrison Ford is Han Solo. To serious film buffs he is the star of classy dramas like ""Witness"" and ""The Fugitive"". To everyone else he is probably best known as the creator of the greatest action hero since James Bond.<br/><br/>The character of Indiana Jones originated in the love of producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg for the film serials of the 1930s and 1940s and their desire to create a modern equivalent, set in that period but using the techniques of the eighties' blockbuster. Another influence seems to have been the superhero comic; Indy does not actually have superpowers but, like any self-respecting hero, he has two distinct identities, just as Superman had the shy young journalist Clark Kent and Batman had the millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. In the lecture room he is Professor Henry Jones, professor of archaeology at the fictional Marshall College and a scholarly, mild-mannered, tweedy intellectual. In the field he becomes Indiana, a tough guy whose trademarks are a fedora hat, a leather jacket and a bullwhip. Despite their period setting, the films also have something in common with the Bond series; both franchises feature a tough action hero who travels round the world, often accompanied by a glamorous female companion, to prevent the destruction of civilisation as we know it by the villains. Like the Bond films, the Indiana Jones films often start with an opening action sequence which only has a very limited connection with what is to follow.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the film which introduced Indy to the world, and the only episode in the series not to feature his name in the title. (By contrast, the words ""James Bond"" do not appear in the title of a single Bond film). The action takes place in the Egypt of 1936 (apart from the opening scene which is set in Peru). The plot is a complex one, but the basic idea is that Indy is battling a gang of Nazis who are searching for the biblical Ark of the Covenant, believing that if they can recover it they will be able to exploit its power to conquer the world. This concept- a gallant adventurer in some exotic location battling the villains for possession of an artifact with mystical powers- has served as the basis for a number of more recent adventure film, including ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" and the two ""Tomb Raider"" films whose archaeologist heroine, Lara Croft, can be seen as a female Indy, a sort of Indiana Joan.<br/><br/>The film was a huge success at the box-office, and was also a hit with most of the critics, although there were a few dissenting voices, notably Pauline Kael (never a fan of the popcorn blockbuster). It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, but lost to ""Chariots of Fire"". Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Ford himself, who makes Indy a hugely charismatic figure- not infallible, but determined, courageous and indomitable- the sort of man everyone wants on their side in a crisis. The glamour is provided by Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood, who makes an attractively feisty heroine- much better than Kate Capshaw's annoying character in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".<br/><br/>John Williams's musical score was a popular one, although to my mind the main march theme is a bit too similar to all the other identikit pseudo-military marches which Williams composed for other action blockbusters during this period. (Is it ""Raiders""? Is it ""Star Wars""? No, it's ""Superman""!). Spielberg handles the action well and the film moves along at a brisk pace, making this a fast-moving roller-coaster of a movie- fast enough to persuade us to overlook the fact that the plot is really all a lot of hokum. (Klaus Kinski, who turned down the chance to play the main Nazi character, called the script ""moronically sh*tty""). There are also elements of humour- the scene where Indy whips out his pistol and shoots a man who is threatening him with a sword always seems to get a laugh, largely because it slyly mocks the unwritten conventions of the swashbuckler genre. (The hero must fight at least one hand-to-hand duel per movie and must not take advantage of superior armaments, even against the most despicable opponent). ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" may be a commercial blockbuster, but it offers enough in the way of thrills and excitement to be worth watching, even by those who would normally avoid the genre. 7/10"

","I loved this film, it's got every bit of the great things to make it a film with high ratings: action, adventure, romance, comedy. I thought the film was great but the snakes in the well of souls had scared me to death. I loved the scene when the cobra stood up right in front of Indy and the way his face looked when he was backing away from the snake. I laughed at the way his face looked. I loved the way the ark looked. I am still wondering if that is the real ark or a fake one. I liked the scene at the ending when the spirits came out and the power of the ark was revealed: death. I was scared to death when the camera had shown all of those snakes in the well of souls. I will never forget that part of the film. I hope there is another film like this!"

","I remember going to an old style cinema in Hertford just before it closed down and watching this film when it as 12. I came out of the film realising what it as like to be a kid. This film is a roller-coaster of fun, emotions, highs, lows and superb action. If you want to watch a film and just relax and not necessarily be intellectually challenged, this is the one. It is a perfect family film for all ages to watch. It also features my favourite scene where Indy shoots the swordsman with a tired sigh. This was an accident as it was supposed to be a massive swordfight but Harrison Ford had dysentery. Tom Selleck was originally required but was busy doing Magnum - thanks the film gods for that! Give me Indy over James Bond any time."

","Every year there are films that try to replicate the Indiana Jones formula, the most recent failed example being Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br/><br/>It seems easy - create a likable everyman hero, put him in perilous situations that require quick thinking and quick getaways, give him a good foe to prevail over, sprinkle liberally with bugs and snakes and serve for 2 hours.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of Raiders neatly encapsulates the appeal of the entire franchise. There is a little humour, tremendous inventive action sequences, booby traps, treachery, treasure and of course creepy crawlies.<br/><br/>We also get to follow the expedition for a good three minutes and try to gather exactly what is happening before we even see Indy himself.<br/><br/>It is pre WW2, and Indiana Jones is hunting, as always (although we don't know that yet) for lost artifacts and relics that he wants to donate to museums and keep out of the clutches of evil-doers who only want the items to finance nefarious doings.<br/><br/>This initial sequence has him tip-toeing through the various traps and pitfalls in order to claim a golden figurine from the centre of a room. It seems that if you have an extremely valuable golden figurine and feel that you must go to the trouble of rigging booby traps and indeed a massive self destruct trigger you might be better served spending the same amount of time hiding the figure instead. Saves you time, money and having to rebuild the whole cave system in the event of a failed treasure hunt.<br/><br/>Imagine how p*ssed the natives would be if the figure was simply knocked over by a rat or a bird? Whether Indy gets the item he seeks or not is seldom important, it is the ride that matters, in this case though he fails.<br/><br/>Back on US soil we meet the Monday – Friday Indiana Jones, a very popular college professor of archaeology who is admired by his students, and consulted for his expertise by various parties.<br/><br/>In this case it is the army that comes calling, asking for advice regarding an intercepted German communiqué. Apparently Hitler himself has commissioned a hunt for the ""Ark of the Covenant"", and has found the area where it is thought to be located.<br/><br/>Of course, Indy agrees to check things out for himself, and with his close friend Marcus, played by Denholm Elliott along for the rise he almost immediately sets off.<br/><br/>Here we meet another oft-copied Indy signature, the overlay of a map showing exactly where on the globe Indiana is headed, this helps give a better impression of the vastness of some of his travels and the extent that he goes to to achieve his aims. Initially he heads to Nepal, as a vital piece of equipment that will aid him in his hunt is conveniently located there, even more convenient is the fact that it is held by an ex-girlfriend of his in a seedy bar that she runs herself, her name is Marion (Karen Allen).<br/><br/>Marion herself is another strength of the movie, she is spirited and spunky without ever being sexy, and is often in need of help without ever simply being helpless herself.<br/><br/>After an uncomfortable hello and the obligatory action sequence Marion decides to tag along, and when I say decides she doesn't have too much alternative as her bar has been razed to the ground. If there is a lesson to be learned from this it is that hanging around Indiana Jones does tend to put you and the things you own in peril.<br/><br/>Once the action moves to Cairo the pace of the action steps up another notch as Indiana comes into closer proximity to the naughty Nazis, who being the bad guys will stop at no lengths to get what they want. They have been making slow progress in their search but the arrival of Indiana inadvertently helps them along.<br/><br/>We have now met all the key characters in the film, and the final hour or so is simply masterful. In set piece after set piece the audience can hardly pause for breath, each new drama finds Indiana in more and more peril, and brings him closer to his goal but equally finds him also closer to losing everything.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film is just great, the action barely relents and important plot events aren't simply introduced in between in expositional conversation, but they unfold as part of the action in a logical manner. You can watch the film with your brain shut off and simply go wow at all the pretty colours and explosions, but Raiders is a little deeper than just mindless action and rewards are had for paying attention.<br/><br/>The film is a little scary and violent enough in a PG 13 way that action fans won't be yawning, each death causes consequences that either bring more characters into play, or trigger other events that must be dealt with.<br/><br/>Being that it is an 80s film there are some terrific stunts that happen throughout the film, Indy's trademark hat is especially handy in this case as it camouflages the stuntman's face from the screen in the more dangerous bits.<br/><br/>Running your eyes down the page should show just why this is almost the perfect action film: stunts, humour, action, danger, Nazis, a hat! What more could you ask for? Two sequels is my only answer.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we got three.<br/><br/>Too many directors now aim to make ""epic"" films, in the 80s it was enough to have a movie with a beginning, middle and end, and not bother with red herrings, unnecessary twists or gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>Sometimes fun is enough.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9.0 / 10. Still awesome. This is just classic stuff.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

Yes, she was at one time, but the Marion we meet in Raiders is wiser and stronger. As mentioned before, there isn't a lot of character study done in this film, but through the fantastic performances of Ford and Allen we know all we need to know.

"Rcwilkinson123","9","0","0","22 May 2008"," One of the greatest films ever
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' kicks off what is a truly special trilogy. Recent trilogies like Spider-Man, Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the Star Wars prequel trilogy may come close, but can't quite match Indiana Jones- especially 'Raiders' and 'The Last Crusade.' Truly Harrison Ford brings so much charisma and relatability to the character. Kudos to George Lucas for writing yet another compelling story, and to Steven Spielberg's direction, one of several classics that he has directed.<br/><br/>Bringing in an artifact like the Ark of the Covenant from the Bible surely is a risky move, but with the message that is sent to those who are evil and seek it for power, the storyline is acceptable. Besides, you can't dislike a guy who is completely human, without any added benefits, yet is willing to take on the challenge of keeping such a sacred artifact from the Nazis. Plus, the character of Indiana Jones is relatable because he's not perfect. Yes, he will think ""what the heck"" and shoot a master sword-wielder. Then, as a human, he does things that are partly beyond conceivable, but still perhaps possible- stunts like single-handedly taking over a Mercedes truck, including the feat of sliding under the truck. Just amazing stuff that can only be executed through proper direction.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of my favorite movies, and for good reason."

","After many years I just once again viewed the start of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga that being the first film made in the series 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" watching it as a kid was more enjoyable, but still the film is a joy ride to watch due to it's nonstop action and thrills it provides. In a way this is a classic B type movie that pays tribute to something you would see just for outright fun with it's action and thrills. And hand it to the master of adventure and escape that being Steven Spielberg who with his direction just sweeps a viewer up off their feet. Plus combined with his teamwork of George Lucas who produced and helped add facts into the story the two maybe made the best adventure series of memory.<br/><br/>Set in 1936 Harrison Ford as archaeologist and part time adventurer Indiana Jones decides to part out from his college to meet up with his feisty ex Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen)and they plan a search for the powerful and mystical Ark of the Covenant. Along the way their biggest challenge will be fighting the religious crazed Nazis plus add in dodging booby-traps, and staring down deadly snakes. This film scene after scene is a thrill ride a true cliffhanger of adventure and joyful excitement. This would clearly be the icon role that Harrison Ford is most remembered for as his ""Indy"" role is more respected than his ""Han Solo"" role in the ""Star Wars"" films. Overall great action adventure film one of the best made of all-time."

","It's true when the tag lines say ""If adventure has a name, it must be Indiana Jones!"" This movie is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time! Harrison Ford is amazing as the archaeologist who's always in over his head! Once more, Steven Spielberg's direction is dynamite. I actually like the ""Indiana Jones"" movies better than I do the ""Star Wars"" movies, which were both created by George Lucas. It's got better writing, and better action, I think.<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes is where the swords man is swinging his sword and Indy just takes out his gun and shoots him. In case many of you don't know, Harrison Ford actually had a fever (no, he didn't need more cowbell) during the shooting of this particular scene. Originally, Spielberg wanted him to fight with his whip, but Harrison Ford said, ""Why don't I just shoot him?"" And he did, and the whole set laughed their heads off.<br/><br/>I love this movie!"

A hero who doesn't see himself as a hero at all, but a protector of history (and the whole fortune and glory thing doesn't hurt either) George Lucas and Steven Spielberg once again give us a movie that stands the test of time, a classic in ever respect.

","It seems utterly implausible that there exists anybody who doesn't love 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Undoubtedly one of the most riveting cinematic adventures every committed to screen, the film was released in 1981 to phenomenal critical and box-office success, and made the rugged, handsome, tenacious, whip-cracking treasure-hunter Indiana Jones a household name. The concept of the film was originally envisioned by producer George Lucas, hot off the release of 'Star Wars (1977),' who had wanted to homage and revive the cliffhanger adventure serials of the 1930s. He teamed up with rising director Steven Spielberg, who had also already hit it big with such successes as 'Jaws (1975)' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).' Together, equipped with a story by Lucas and Phillip Kaufman, and a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, they embarked on the production of perhaps one of the most exciting films ever made.<br/><br/>The story itself, which takes place in 1936, is deceptively simple. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, at the time most noted for playing Han Solo in 'Star Wars') is a respectable tweed-wearing archeology professor at an American college. However, when he is not teaching rather dull lectures in which he represents archeology as a non-exciting profession, Jones is traipsing across the globe in search of treasured ancient artifacts with the goal of historical preservation, donating his pieces to the museum of Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott). We can only watch in awe as, in one of the most breathtaking opening sequences of any film, Jones navigates the perilous Peruvian jungle in search of the golden Hovito Idol, facing such pitfalls as an immense rolling boulder, poison darts and masses of deadly tarantulas. However, after acquiring the idol, Jones is outsmarted by his immoral and greedy French rival, Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), ultimately leaving Peru with nothing.<br/><br/>After his return to America, Jones is approached by two Army Intelligence officers (Don Fellows and William Hootkins). The US military has intercepted a message from Cairo to Berlin, where the evil Fuhrer Adolf Hitler has ordered his men to uncover the legendary Ark of the Covenant, the sacred box reputed to contain the original stone tablets upon which are written the Ten Commandments. In his globe-trotting mission to discover the Ark before the evil Nazis can get their hands on it, Jones receives assistance from an old friend, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Once again, Jones finds himself coming up against his old foe Belloq, whilst a Nazi colonel (Wolf Kahler) and their resident torturer (a truly sinister Ronald Lacey) only add to his troubles.<br/><br/>In order for 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to be such a success, everything needed to be done bigger and better than the audience had ever seen before. The film is essentially one lengthy action sequence after another, culminating in a terrifying, effects-driven climax when the Ark is finally opened. With the exception of this final scene (which was engineered by Lucas' company, Industrial Light & Magic, and is probably the only sequence that has begun to show its age), most of the film's daring moments were produced using old-school special effects and clever stunt-work. Interestingly, the brilliant, oft-cited truck chase sequence was actually filmed by the second-unit using Spielberg's extensive storyboards, with Harrison Ford's close-ups added later in production.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that countless similar films had been released in the past, and Lucas and Spielberg drew a lot of their inspiration from other works. So what makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' so damn amazing? Probably more than anything, it is the wry sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast certainly looks as though they are having a grand time, with Harrison Ford greeting each of his character's new and perilous challenges with a soft sigh and an adjustment of his trademark fedora hat. The scene in which Jones nonchalantly blasts a cocky swordsman with his Smith & Wesson is one of the most memorable of all time, making you want to stand up and cheer for your favourite hero (the idea itself was conceived by Ford on the day of shooting, when, suffering from dysentery, he decided that he had had enough of filming that fight scene). An uplifting score from long-time Spielberg collaborator John Williams also helps make the film so very memorable.<br/><br/>Unlike your typical film hero, Indiana Jones is not an invincible superhuman, getting decidedly battered and bruised at every turn. At one point, his rival Belloq remarks that they are surprisingly alike, despite their antagonistic attitudes towards one another. This is quite accurate; both adventurers often use suspect means to acquire the treasures they seek, the main differences between them being the motivation: whilst Belloq is driven by greed, Jones is concerned with historical preservation of important artifacts. Likewise, Marion is not your typical damsel-in-distress, a proud, independent bar-owner who is (usually) able to take care of herself. At the 1982 Academy Awards, 'Raiders' was nominated for a total of eight Oscars (including Best Picture, though it lost to Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Fire'), and it left with four, including Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It also received a Special Achievement Award for its sound effects editing.<br/><br/>'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was followed by two extremely enjoyable sequels, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)' (the latter being my very favourite of the series), and, just a few weeks ago (June 2007), filming for a fourth Indiana Jones adventure commenced."

","The opening action sequence of this film is as good as any movie you can name, & better than most. The plot involving the Ark Of The Covenant is excellent too. When this film came out, it was the first of its kind. <br/><br/>There are two weak sequences in this movie. The first one is the early one with Jones in the class room lecturing & the female students flirting with him. This piece does little for the film & quite frankly could be cut entirely out of it. <br/><br/>The second one is the opening of the Ark (in a way the climax of the film). This special effects jolly is interesting wizardry for the 1981 time frame, but it gives viewers nothing to ponder as far as what is actually in the ark. Compared with the Last Crusade's climax which has meaning, this one comes up with none.<br/><br/>While this film has humor & the best action sequences of the series, it comes off more with an atmosphere of a later TV series rip-off known as ""Tales of The Gold Monkey."" On TV this only lasted a season. It is the same with this film, once you have seen it, you have seen it enough. <br/><br/>This was the best of the series until The Last Crusade, but the Crusade took what this started & tied it together better. <br/><br/>157"

","I must admit I have a soft spot for old-fashioned adventure movies,especially the classic good vs evil kind.And what movie could better represent that category than Raiders of the lost ark... This is the first,classic Indiana Jones adventure in which he gets an assignment to find the Ark of commandments itself,to prevent it from being taken into possession by the Nazis(this is supposed to be in 1936 and the superstitious dictator Hitler is crazy about the occult). A lost artifact,which may still be in the possession of his old mentor professor Ravenwood,will be essential in this quest so his first destination is Tibet,Ravenwood's last known resort.Ravenwood is however no longer alive,so he then travels to Egypt,accompanied by Ravenwood's (at first) somewhat reluctant daughter/Indy's previous crush Marion(Karen Allen).The Nazis have discovered Tanis,a lost Egyptian city where the Ark is believed to be buried...so there's naturally no time to lose.<br/><br/>Well,I do like profound,philosophical movies that makes you think.But hey,who can resist a real,fantastic adventure every now and then?

","Steven Spielberg was supposed to direct Return of the Jedi, but Hollywood politics intervened, and instead, we got the Ewoks. OK, the Ewoks were probably going to be in the movie whether Spielberg was involved with the movie or not, but the weakest of the original Star Wars movies is one of those ""What if?"" moments, as I think about how the saga could have ended if the visionary director was involved. The primary reason for this thinking is that just two years before the release of Jedi was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a collaboration between George Lucas and Spielberg. The story goes that Lucas and Spielberg were trying to come up with a story for a James Bond movie when it looked like they were going to have a crack at the franchise. Unfortunately for them, the Bond people went a different direction, allowing Lucas and Spielberg to use some of the ideas they had in their mind to come up with the character ""Indiana Jones,"" a swashbuckling archaeologist who escapes the inescapable situations, restores truth and order, and gets the girl in the end. The movie Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of three adventures following Indy around the world, and the movie that features the best of Indy's girlfriends. Fresh off his Han Solo success, Harrison Ford fell into the role of Jones, as Tom Sellick was originally tapped to play the role. The movie is a series of adventures, ranging from the jungles of South America (who hasn't seen the big ball rolling toward Indiana Jones), to the mountains of Nepal, finally ending the deserts of Egypt. Karen Allen plays Marion, a former lover of Indy's, one that has been jilted in the past. We get the feeling the first time we see Marion and Indy in the Nepal bar that Indiana is the type that has trouble keeping girlfriends, and Marion is the only one he could possibly be with. The movie revolves around Indiana trying to find the fabled Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do, as Hitler wants to use the power of the Ark to win his conquest of the world. Breathtaking adventures, fantastic chase sequences, and a wry sense of humor (the scene where Indiana beats his sword carrying adversary is one of the biggest laughs in any movie I can think of) makes Raiders of the Lost Ark an adventure film that holds even to this day. When the movie ended, I was disappointed that it was over, as I wanted the adventure to continue. It did, later in the decade, with two sequels, with plans for the fourth edition to come out in 2008."

","Producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg created this motion picture in an attempt to tap into the excitement and spirit of the old adventure serials they watched as young children, and they ended up topping the even the very best of the very series they were emulating in every conceivable way. Easily one the ultimate adventure films of all-time, RAIDERS is an enormously entertaining, sometimes breathtaking roller coaster ride that became watershed classic in it's own right. Lucas and Spielberg manage to find the pitch-perfect balance of updating and revitalizing serial clichés without sub-coming to them, and the commutation of the efforts are right on the screen. From it's very first scene onward, RAIDERS is an absolute blast that keeps getting better and better.<br/><br/>Obviously, much of the film's success can be attributed to Harrison Ford, who (not only in this film, but also in 1977's STAR WARS and 1982's BLADE RUNNER) always manages walk the thin line between straight-faced sincerity and knowing campiness. Although I think Ford's later ventures into straight drama have been extremely uneven, there is absolutely no denying that he is perhaps Hollywood's ultimate pulp idol. The long underrated Karen Allen is great fun as the film's progressively feisty heroine, and the remainder of the cast is also expertly used. Above all else, however, it is Lucas and Spielberg who continually surprise and delight the audience again and again in this box office smash (it was the top grosser of 1981), and it arguably remains the finest joint achievement from the pair."
"barnabyrudge","10","0","0","7 June 2006"," First Indiana Jones film - also the best. A fabulous film.
","Steven Spielberg launched his Indiana Jones franchise in style with this thrilling, cliffhanger adventure movie that owes much in terms of style and pacing to the old serials of the 1930s. Bristling with imaginative escapades, exhilarating action sequences, clever plot twists and enthusiastic performances, this is perhaps the most complete and enjoyable of Spielberg's early films. Some might argue that Jaws or Close Encounters Of The Third Kind are just as good  perhaps even better  but for me this is the finest of all his films prior to Schindler's List. What also helps Raiders Of The Lost Ark immeasurably is the refreshingly tough and resourceful female character played by Karen Allen. Not only are we introduced to a great screen hero in this film, but he also gets a mighty spirited leading lady with whom to share his remarkable adventures. and that's something that far too many films lack.<br/><br/>Lecturer and archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) narrowly misses out on a priceless golden artifact in the rain forests of South America, being beaten to the prize by his arrogant French rival Belloq (Paul Freeman). Jones barely has the time to be bitter, for he is soon approached by an American team who want him to go to Egypt to locate the Ark Of The Covenant which, if you know your biblical stories, was the box in which Moses put the smashed, powdery remains of the stones upon which were written the Ten Commandments. Jones is informed that the Nazis have been searching for the Ark to present as a great trophy for their leader Adolf Hitler, who is allegedly a nut on the subject. Jones first heads for the Himalayas, where he hopes to get help from his old partner Abner Ravenwood. He discovers that Abner is dead, but his daughter Marian (Karen Allen)  formerly Jones's lover, and now very angry with him for walking out on her  is still alive and has vital clues to help him find the fabled prize. Jones and Marian go to Egypt, where Jones learns that his old adversary Belloq is working for the Nazis in their quest for the Ark. In a battle of wits, Jones tracks down the treasure but is once more robbed at the last moment by his slippery rival  leading to a series of incredible adventures in which Indy tries to regain the Ark from the enemy before it is taken to the Fuhrer in Berlin.<br/><br/>John Williams provides a belting music score that is widely regarded as one of the best pieces of movie music ever conceived. There can't be many people in the world who wouldn't hum along with the famous Indy theme. Spielberg keeps his narrative moving at a staggering pace, with barely a pause for breath between absorbing exchanges and bouts of extraordinary action. Jones is utterly perfect as Indy (hard to believe that he was the second choice to play the role after Tom Selleck, isn't it?). Allen is great as Indy's courageous sidekick, and Paul Freeman's slimy villain Belloq provides the actor with easily the most enjoyable role of his oddly quiet career. The worldwide locations remind one of a period James Bond film, but the quota of action has somehow been cranked up a level on the Bond films, if that seems possible. It's hard to say what the film's highlight is, for it is stuffed with high points  perhaps the exciting fist fight between Indy and a bare-chested Nazi giant at an airfield, perhaps the thrilling truck chase in which Indy recovers the Ark, or maybe the clever climax in which the bad guys die a spectacularly gory death on a Greek island? It barely matters, since Raiders Of The Lost Ark is, from first frame to last, one of the most thoroughly entertaining films of all-time."

What more can be said about this classic of American adventure cinema ? In the simplest terms, this type of movie appealed to the archetypal heroes and villains we have grown up with in comic books, Westerns, space operas, and according to Joseph Campbell, humanity' earliest myths and campfire stories. It made audiences excited about the movies again, rooting for the hero again, booing the incredibly evil villain again who no doubt will get his comeuppance, and this film has a huge following. There is even a new Indiana Jones movie in the works. This is the first of the Indian Jones Trilogy (Temple of Doom and Last Crusade) which continued through the 80's. Harrison Ford will always be remembered for the role of Professor and Archaeologist Indiana Jones, a swashbuckling type, complete with brains, brawns, sleuth skills and a whip. His only weakness ? He's deathly afraid of snakes! It's the 1930's. Indiana's father, another famed archaeologist, has searched for the Biblical Ark of the Covenant all his life. The German Nazis are also actively searching for it. Indiana is sent on a mission to stop the Nazis and find the Ark of the Covenant so that it could be protected by America. He meets up with the beautiful and strong Marion Ravenswood (Karen Allen) and with the highly intelligent and exotic Salla (John Rhys-Davies) and embark on a dangerous quest to find this elusive holy relic which is rumored to have cosmic powers. There is never a dull moment in this film. Shot on location in North Africa, Egypt and South America, this film manages to keep us at the edge of our seats as we see the struggle between Jones and the Nazis, finally coming to a climatic finale in which the Ark is opened. The special effects are rather tame now, but even so, they produce a powerful spell that works well for this movie. It's a classic. With music by John Williams, stunning cinematography and fine acting, this film is sure to keep anyone young at heart and thirsting for today's movies to be more like this."

And that's exactly what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is.<br/><br/>While the ultimate goal is to find the Lost Ark, the steps include a plenty whole lot of dangers, stunts, spectacular tricks and freaky other things. This leads to a re-definition of the archeology term...<br/><br/>During all the movie, I never asked myself what made it good or bad. I was simply absorbed by it. I couldn't put off my eyes from the screen. There's always something fairly exciting that happens at every moment or so.<br/><br/>Spielberg once said that he would like to direct a Bond film. Well, if he's not chosen, it's not because he can't do the job. The action scenes and the special effects are simply great and entertaining. And the variety of stunts is highly imaginative. I particularly liked the fight near the airplane and the car and truck chase during the Ark transport.<br/><br/>But the best part of the movie is certainly the Ark's opening at the end. What follows is a masterful pyrotechnic, explosive and visually dazzling special effects extravaganza. Even if you try to look elsewhere, you simply couldn't.

It's now a synonym of adventure and Indiana Jones is a symbol too.<br/><br/>But if you want to become an archaeologist, do not expect to live things that way...<br/><br/>Rankings: Best: RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 2nd best: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Worst: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"

","these elements of adventure: Nazi's, treasure, exotic locations, our generations kind of Count of Monte CristoWhat Dumas's novel was to nineteenth century readers, especially teens and children at the time, is what Indiana Jones is to contemporary movie lovers. I know the two story lines do not parallel each other that specifically, but the feeling in both, the great adventure with good and evil and money and relics and danger and women and secret identities and exotic locations.All of those things are in both movies. They both get that child in you who believes in being a hero to come out, to dream a little. We should all watch this movie at different epochs in our lives to see if it makes us feel the same thing."

","Indiana Jones is a different kind of action movie. Taken place in 1936 when the Nazi party was still running Germany. And WW2 was yet to occur.<br/><br/>Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. is an archaeologist who is likes to travel the world to find adventure and priceless artifacts. Course not all the time does he succeed in getting what he wants.<br/><br/>One day when he's attending his archeology class at an university in Washington D.C. he's given a job in finding something that's said to be impossible to uncover. The Lost Ark that the Hebrews carried back in the days of Moses. Which is said to be a connection with communicating with God. The price of the Ark is unimaginable.<br/><br/>Finding this ark will be risky and a challenge when the Nazis are already in progress in locating it in the Deserts of Africa. Once Indy finds the Ark he'll learn it's more than a price less artifact for a display in a museum.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is done by the same people who did Star Wars. Directed by Spielberg and written by George Lucas. It has action, humor, fights, and plenty of good stuff for a perfect action filled movie. It's worth owning on DVD."

","I remember as a little kid always trying to stay awake watching Indiana Jones' movies, but never quite making it. When you are 7 years old, your attention span can only go for so long. However, when I reached my teen years, only then as I able to grasp how much of an impact the Indiana Jones' trilogy has impacted our culture and our movie going experience.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first and probably the most beloved entry in the series. I can't help but agree with many of those who praise it as the best, but then the awesomness of the Last Crusade creeps back into my consciousness. I can never decide which one is better, but for now this is a review on Raiders and not the Last Crusade.<br/><br/>Not needing the go into the story so much, as I am sure other reviewers already have, let me just that the action does not stop from the minute you see the boulder chasing Indy in the Amazonian temple. All the action sequences are fantastic, and Raiders, I must admit contains the better villains, especially the man in black whose name escapes me at the moment. The heroine, Marion, played by Karen Allen is also probably the best heroine in the series too. She is strong, humorous, and believably pretty. Of course, no one ca review Raiders of the Lost Ark and not mention the scene where the Ark is opened. I'd call that one of the top ten scariest scenes in cinema history."
"pal5017","10","0","0","6 April 2006"," Best of the Indiana Jones series and one of the all time greatest!
","This is by far and away the best movie in a trilogy of great movies. After establishing the fact that Indiana is a likable and yet not immortal hero, that the suspense never stops and that the characters still have room to be developed, there are two other things that really make this movie incredible.<br/><br/>First, Marion Ravenwood is the best heroine of the series. If there's a possible rip against the next two, it is her absence. She is tough and aware of the events, and yet she is still beautiful and perfectly ladylike. It might seem like somewhat of a contradiction, but to anyone whos seen it, they know what I'm talking about. Elsa Scheider and Willie Scott of the later movies simply don't match up to Marion.<br/><br/>Second, the movie is incredibly clever in that Indiana, despite all the trouble he faces, has absolutely no impact on the outcome. He could have told the government to shove it, and it would not have mattered. The Nazis eventually open the Ark, only to find that to be a somewhat gruesome thing. Its a funny irony, that the artifact they are so desperately looking for is better left untouched. Some might see this as bad, but I thought it was an interesting twist, and it does NOT ruin the movie at all. Besides, all the action and humor leading up to that point should more than make up for anyone who disliked that aspect.<br/><br/>Either way, this movie is, IMO, the greatest of all time, a real must see!<br/><br/>PS, I've just seen some negative reviews, and just like it was with When Harry Met Sally, most of the whiners seem to be coming from foreign countries, like France and Germany (who of course have a long history of popping out excellent movies...lol). None of them seem to have any good reason to rip the movie except that they're disappointed to see their own people getting beat up on. Oh, jealousy..."

","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.<br/><br/>STORY: The movie opens up with a sequence where the famous archaeologist Indiana Jones is searching for a golden idol in a temple in 1936 South America. He manages to find it but gets it taken off him by rival archaeologist, Belloq. Indy returns to America where he works at a univeristy. He gets informed that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant in Cairo. Even worse, the Nazis are lead by Belloq. He is sent to Cairo with the help from allie, Sallah and the beautiful Marion Ravenwood to recover the lost ark before Belloq can take something away from Indy again.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Raiders of the Lost Ark is perfect in every way possible. First I'll start with the acting and characters. Harrison Ford was perfect for the role of Indiana Jones. The movie would've sucked if Tom Selleck got the part. Karen Allen was great and good-looking as Marion Ravenwood. Paul Freeman was also good as the main villain, Belloq. John Rhys-Davies was also great as Sallah. Danny Devito would've been too comical.<br/><br/>The screenplay was great as well. The love scenes are far from cheesy. I rather liked the scene where Indy tells Marion to kiss ever part of his body that doesn't hurt, and they end up kissing each other on the lips. Indy's smart comments were great as well, especially ""Didn't you guys ever go to Sunday School?"" When the dialogue tries to take itself seriously, it does.<br/><br/>The action probably the best thing about this movie. From the famous boulder scene in the beginning, to the truck chase in the Cairo desert, you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. And who could forget the scene where Indy runs into the swordsman, and shoots him! Classic! The special effects were great as well, especially as there wasn't any CGI back then. The fibreglass boulder at the beginning looks like sheer stone. Most of the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence were hoses but you could not tell. The explosions were real, and there are a lot of them in the Indy vs Large Mechanic fight as they fight under a plane as Marion shoots things with the planes turret. Finally the scene where the ark gets opened is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed with horrifying effects that will make cower in terror(I mean scary, not bad).<br/><br/>THE BAD: You must be joking! BOTTOM LINE: Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect film. A must see!"

","Has anyone noticed what an incompetent bungler dearest Indy is? How EVERY TIME he comes up against Belloq he LOSES whatever he has--statues, girls, the Ark itself? As Belloq puts it at the beginning (approximately), ""Once again we see that there is nothing you can recover that I cannot take from you."" And he's absolutely correct--right up to the Ark TWICE!! It happens EVERY TIME!! The only thing Indy manages to do right is find the Ark itself--and Belloq promptly grabs it away, because gee, guess what? They're digging on a knoll against the setting sun right next to the Nazis' dig, and making no secret of it. Till finally at the end God Himself has to save the day. Good thing for Indy (and the rest of us I guess) He's on the side of the democracies. Which opens all sorts of theological questions and problems I won't touch. Mind you, Indy can work miracles too--he can ride a submarine thousands of miles across the ocean without drowning, or even getting wet. AND keep the Nazis cooped up inside the whole time (a very good thing since there's no place to hide on the sub's hull). To be fair to the movie, Indy is such a lovable lug (and it was so nice to see that Ford was finally learning to act) that only the sub ride bothered me initially. To fully grasp IJ's incompetence I had to see ""Raiders"" several times. Which I did, but that only shows I have a weakness for roller coasters and gratuitously fx-heavy endings, however illogical. Mea culpa."

","'Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Last Crusade' are equally excellent adventure/action films. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' sees Indiana Jones teaming up with a girl to find the lost ark and to keep it from the hands of the Nazis. I admire this film for its action and the sense of adventure and exploration, and I admire it over 'Last Crusade' for a more focused plot and quirkier characters. It's less spiritual than 'Last Crusade', and Indiana is not as personified as a man with a lot of story. (His father in 'Last Crusade' brings out the background story and another side to Indiana than we see in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.') They are both equally good films which offer plenty of action, and I have never heard anyone say that they do not like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Completely recommended."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is as silly as a Saturday morning cartoon and as corny and historically inaccurate as a children's history book. But is one the greatest action/adventure movies ever made.<br/><br/>The reasons because of that is because of the perfect blend of action, comedy, and drama. Also because the character of Indiana Jones is likable and believable. Don't dismiss this film as a silly children's romp. For someone who is more into art house films and serious films, Raiders is an edge of your seat thrill ride that won't fail to entertain. The story of the Nazi's wanting to get the lost ark is silly but it works anyway, because it gives a reason to root for Jones, for him to succeed, and to give us breathtaking, flawless entertainment.<br/><br/>If you love movies, don't miss Raiders of the Lost Ark. It exciting, funny, and brilliant. It deserves to be in the AFI's top 100 American films of all time. Don't miss this great ride.<br/><br/>P.S. Don't forget the popcorn."

","Watching this movie again on DVD's is fascinating, and it really brought back great memories of going to the theater with dad and having one hell of a ride. While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.<br/><br/>What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief: Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.<br/><br/>Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end? There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later. Going to see the movie again? Go out of your way to get the new DVD set"

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Every decade has it's own particular set of films for which it can be associated with. In the 1970's there was the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and in the 1980's one of the stars of the space trilogy would play a no nonsense archaeologist who would bring the past to life and make the art of going searching for treasure cool once again.<br/><br/>As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford would always be remembered for his whip and trademark hat. Perhaps more famous for this role than his part as Han Solo in the ""Star Wars"" films, Ford is wonderful as the wonderful explorer with a penchant for mythology and women. Three superb films, and a potential fourth on the way, Jones would keep children entertained for a long time. From a cinematic point of view though, it's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the first encounter with Dr Jones, which really impresses.<br/><br/>Deep in a tropical jungle, we are introduced to the charismatic Dr Jones. Stealing an idol, Jones is subsequently robbed of it himself by arch rival Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Skipping forward a few months and he is now back teaching at university. It isn't long however before Jones meets representatives of the American government and subsequently finds himself in search of the greatest treasure of all. The legendary Ark of the Covenant.<br/><br/>It's amazing to think that this film was first released such a long time ago. Whilst it's aged remarkably well, it's one of those films which all people from mid 20's onwards have grown up with. Shown on British television remarkably often, this film never grows old and is always fun to watch. Most people in fact could probably quote lines from this film with minimal effort. That's part of it's beauty, the fact that it remains so enjoyable after so many viewings.<br/><br/>Perhaps the main reason for this is just how great Harrison Ford is as the lead role. Originally overlooked in favour of Tom Selleck, Ford would step into the breach and provide a brilliant performance. Ford is remarkable at being able to switch between the rough and ready type and the respectable type at ease. Most actors are primarily able to be either your adventurous action hero or your well dressed intellectual, but few are able to be both, especially in the same movie. Ford somehow manages this with ease however.<br/><br/>All in all, everything about Indiana Jones just works. Whether it's the Spielberg direction, the Ford acting, the great plot or the inspiring music, everything about these films works. Out of the three though, it's the first one which really clicks and really contains the finest of all the elements. If you've never seen this film, then it should be your number one priority. If you, like so many others, have seen it a million times, might as well watch it again. Ultimate adventure fun."
"mozartzbitch","10","0","0","21 November 2004"," A classic, and most deservingly so
","This film deserves every form of recognition it has received. A perfect mixture of breath-taking action, memorable heroes, delightfully evil villains, well-timed humor, and historical accuracy. Not that all the events in this film are true or that much of it is based on truth, but it is at least based both on real expeditions which Hitler sent Nazis on, and real biblical references to the ark of the covenant. <br/><br/>The highlight of the film is action sequences choreographed so beautifully by Spielberg. There is nothing action films have seen to top some of the sequences in this film. The action is not insanely gory or painful like in Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan. There is blood, but it is not that painful to watch. But the sequence from when Indy is stealing the ark from the plane to when he finally steals it from the truck; that sequence is an all time classic. It starts with a plane the Nazis intend to use to ship the ark to Cairo. Indy fights a plane mechanic first before an intense fist fight with a really bulky Nazi. In the middle, his girlfriend, Marion snags another plane and is shooting off attacking Nazis, and Indy is gradually beating the Nazi, before colliding him into the propeller of the plane right by them. Indy brakes out of the plane which is about to explode. You then see a huge explosion before the Nazi load the ark then onto a truck. You are given a few moments to catch your breath before Indy chase the truck down. The battle when he jumps onto that trunk as intense as anything film can offer you. He fights off Nazi after Nazi. He dangles from the side of the truck, and keeps knocking Nazis out left and right. He finally escapes with the truck and that is that. I know it needs to be seen to be appreciated, but it is the most excitement you could ask for if action is what you seek. <br/><br/>This film however, is more than just a strong action flick. It deals with extremely strong parallels of good versus evil. It really portrays the Nazis as these negligent villains, who seek the ark for nothing but access to a weapon. Indy meanwhile, truly seeks it to see it opened and look at what has been buried for thousands of years. And you see this massive army of trained soldiers with armed artillery who can not fend off one man and his whip and gun. <br/><br/>This is a must-see for all action lovers. And do not think that the film is outdated after 20 years. On technical level, it is. But first of all, the Oscar winning visuals are not outdated by that much; and secondly, what it lacks it lacks in that department it makes up for with timeless ingenious film-making."

The film you can watch ten million times and it never looses its luster. It is all of these things. After all its the Raiders of The Lost Ark. Spielberg said himself he looks at every movie he has ever made and says there were things he didn't like about them. Things he would change. Not this one. He said it was perfect. And he was right. If you don't own this movie on VHS AND DVD you will melt like a Nazi staring at the Ark of the Covenant. Ford was never better. It was his defining moment. Immortalized forever. If you learn anything from watching this movie it is this: the moral of the story is America rocks and Germany doesn't.

","Indiana Jones is the quintessal live-action cartoon, but that doesn't mean that it's not worth watching. When I first saw it I was expecting a campy action flick with too many guns and James Bond car chases. Of course, I was completely wrong.<br/><br/>This is the first and probably the best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Henry Jones Jr., commonly known as Indiana Jones, is a professor of archeology who sometimes does... specialty jobs. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, he searches for the Ark of the Covenant, a Biblical relic said to strike down 'armies' in a second. Indy barely hesitates to accept the little stint.<br/><br/>Lucas's special effects are unique and CGI-free. From rolling stone balls to snakes - lots of snakes - this flick does an excellent job. The filming is nothing special : just enough to tell the story well. Indy braves a lot of unique traps and obstacles, all of which are of course awesome to watch.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. I'm no film critic, but nobody in Raiders was blatantly bad. Belloq is smooth and intimidating as Indiana's Nazi rival. Harrison Ford IS Jones, no doubt about it. Nobody will ever play Indy as well as that.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10. Awesome. DO NOT MISS. If you don't see this movie, you have no idea what you're missing."

","(May include SPOILERS)<br/><br/>This was one of my favorite films as a child, along with Jason and the Argonauts, Jurassic Park, Critters, the Lion King and the Naked Gun. The first adventure of Indy is like one of the great Donald Duck comics of Carl Barks came to life. It's as funny, exciting and has a wonderful treasure as a McGuffin (the thing everyone in the film wants). Except, of course it's more violent. But as I am a twisted kind of person who enjoys violent films and black humour, I can't say that is anything else, but a recommendation. But if you don't want to see a hulking German mechanic being chopped by an aeroplane propeller, see something else.<br/><br/>Actually, when you think of it, the plot has been seen millions of times before and after (man gets a mission, meets a girl, girl hates him, fights some sherpas and Nazis and arabs and the wrath of God and gets the girl in the end), the characters are as thin as paper and the ending is quite dull (funny though). But who can say no to a movie, that has Nazis, ghosts, lots of snakes, a hero, who never drops his hat and a monkey who can give a nazi salute. Fans of new blockbusters might want to check, if they can spot the actors of Doc Ock and Gimli (no challenge to real movie fans, but they must have seen this already)<br/><br/>There's everything anyone could ask for in this movie, even a very romantic scene, when Marion fixes Indy's wounds up! Well, anything except serious drama and nudity, but there are other films for those. There's almost nothing bad in this movie and that makes this my top ten movies of all time #10!<br/><br/>***** (10/10)<br/><br/>Best part: <br/><br/>Of course it HAS to be the iconic running away from a giant ball of stone that has inspired video game programmers, artists and movie directors alike.<br/><br/>No, it MUST be when Toth's face melts at the end. That was was the creepiest thing I ever saw as a kid (well, next to the documentary about Ötzi the mummy)<br/><br/>No it IS the ""swordfight"" against the arab.

Karen Allen also does a great job in this movie. She works very well alongside Harrison Ford. John Rhys-Davies also does a great job in his very funny role. <br/><br/>The story is also very good. It involves Nazi's going on a hunt for the Ark of the Covenant. Indiana Jones is hired by the government to try and find it. <br/><br/>There is also a fair amount of scenes with action in them. My particular favorite is Indiana fighting the big Nazi around the airplane. Another favorite is the truck fight scene, were Jones is throwing guys from a large truck.

This entire collection of Indiana Jones flicks is so entertaining and never seems to get old. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is near the end when Indy threatens to blow up the Ark with a rocket launcher, and during Belloq's speech a fly actually lands on his cheek, crawls onto his lip and either goes into his mouth or is sucked in deliberately by the actor.

","Perhaps the best and most entertaining fantasy adventure ever made. The combination of Lucas and Spielberg behind the camera is winning while Harrison Ford is excellent in his landmark role, most iconic role. He's been Han Solo, Jack Ryan but Indiana Jones is the one for me. This is so exciting, funny and it has a glorious B-movie feel to it all. The timing of everything is excellent and many could argue whether Spielberg has had a finer moment since and considering he has had the likes of the sequels, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan amongst others that is some indication as to how good this film is. Karen Allen is also very good and in many ways Indy's love interest's in the sequels have not lived up to Allen's role. *****"

","Even though it's way over twenty years old, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is still one of the best action adventures ever created. This movie has all the things that make an action movie great: - A wonderful story about lost cities, ancient artifacts, and great mysteries. Even though everybody knows that most of these stories are nonsense, it's great to fantasize about them. - Main characters that are actually still human, instead of the superheroes Hollywood throws at you these days (both in ""real"" superhero movies like X-Men and Hulk, and in movies where the main characters are normal humans but somehow completely invulnerable (""Tomb Raider"", ""Mission Impossible 2"")). Of course everybody knows that the good guys are going to win, but in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the heroes have weaknesses, are vulnerable, don't do completely idiotic things, and abide by the normal laws of physics.<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Sure, it mostly plays it straight, but it isn't afraid to be a bit tongue-in-cheek from time to time. I take this kind of approach over the super-serious approach any time.</li></ul><br/><br/>
All of the above things make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" excellent. It's a fun mix of story, action, and humour, without any kind of pretenses, that does exactly what it's supposed to do: entertain you for a couple of hours. Escapism at its best. <br/><br/>***1/2 out of **** stars"

","Early eighties movie that was great. Despite the dated special effects (melting faces, reflected snakes, bouncing rocks) this is the best movie made to date. It was a good decision for Spielberg to opt out of making 'For your eyes only' or whatever Bond movie that was next. The plot is 30's dashing and derring do? The villains are gumptious and the ending is out of the Daliesqe imagery. Without digressing to the obvious the main character is not dead and acting like a ghost, or crawling through ventilation ducts.

","Truly the greatest way to start off an adventurous trilogy! Raiders of the Lost Ark proudly introduced Indiana Jones to the world. He fights as both an archaeologist and an adventurer to get ahold of the treasures he is looking for. He will stop at nothing to get the Germans out of his way, but the action sequences are extraordinary and it's great to see Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood team up and find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford make a great trio together and all come up with Indiana Jones' greatest adventures. Watching Raiders of the Lost Ark made me want to rush off and watch the next installment of the famous trilogy. I recommend Raiders of the Lost Ark for anyone interested in the adventures of archaeology and a of course the World War II subject. Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford have outdone themselves in the production and a brilliant classic adventure film was born! But this is not Indiana Jones' last adventure, for it is only the beginning of the thrilling adventures up ahead. There are still more treasures, villains, and women to hunt for, for that is the life that Indiana Jones lives!"

","Smarting after the failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", film-maker Steven Spielberg was looking for something that would restore the magic touch he'd showed in previous efforts such as ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  He and ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas then came up with an idea about an adventuring archaeologist called Indiana Smith, casting Tom Selleck in the role.  The character was later renamed Indiana Jones, and after some wrangling with the producers of ""Magnum P.I"" (with whom Tom Selleck was contracted) the part was recast with Harrison Ford, already a big hit with audiences as Han Solo in ""Star Wars"".<br/><br/>It's 1936, and fedora-hatted, whip-wielding archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) treks through the South American jungles seeking a golden idol.  In obtaining it, he survives the pitfalls of a booby-trapped temple (including poisoned darts, a bottomless pit and a huge rolling boulder) only to lose his prize to his arch-rival, suave Frenchman Belloq (Paul Freeman). <br/><br/>
Back in the States, working his day job as a college professor, he is approached by the US government who tell him the Nazis are on the point of discovering the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artefact of considerable destructive power.  Jones is assigned to find the Ark before the Nazis do. He secures the help of bitter ex-flame Marion (Karen Allen) and salty old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) but finds himself in over his head before too long...<br/><br/>What drives ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is its spirit and sense of adventure. Many of the action sequences (despite featuring their fair share of blood) have a very lighthearted feel to them, particularly the famous scene where Indy, facing off with a massive swordsman, casually shoots his foe than engage in a protracted fight.  Later action scenes including a fight under a moving plane, and a finely constructed horse/truck chase sequence, are fluidly paced and exciting.  John William's score (including the highly memorable theme tune) accentuates every scene brilliantly.<br/><br/>Mixed in with the action are elements of mystery, romance and gory horror. Although the Jewish Spielberg was to give a more serious depiction of the Nazis in later films ""Schindlers List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", here is content to portray them as simple-minded, comic-book baddies.  Knowing Spielberg's background, you can sense just a little sadism in the ways the villains are dispatched, particularly in the film's bloodbath finale.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford became a pop cultural icon with his portrayal of Indiana Jones, with trademark hat, whip and ready wisecrack.  He embodies the reckless, savvy but relentless hero as he's thrown from one situation to the next.  Jones is strong, but he's not invincible and visibly endures considerable pain through the course of his adventures.  This creates an identifiability with the hero, which strengthens the characterization.<br/><br/>Karen Allen is a superb heroine, pristinely beautiful without being too glamourous.  It's a pity her initial hard-drinking persona degenerates into mindless screeching but Allen still holds up very well, and has a great chemistry with Ford.<br/><br/>The direct opposite of the rough and ready hero, Belloq thwarts Jones in the film's opening scenes and later leads the Nazis in the search for the Ark. Paul Freeman plays the villain well with a suave, gentlemanly relish. Backing him up is Ronald Lacey as creepy, lisping Nazi agent Toht.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, ""Raiders"" was followed by two sequels for Indiana Jones in 1984 and 1989."

","I don't think it helpful for me to blabber on and on about how it is my favorite movie of all time and how I dressed up like Indiana Jones every Halloween for seven years. Instead I hope to clarify to naysayers why exactly Indiana Jones is the most remarkable and fascinating of all movie heroes.<br/><br/>There are many words that can describe Jones: Courageous? Yes; Smart? try Brilliant; Obsessed? Absolutely. And he's also quick and funny and drop dead gorgeous etc. But of all the qualities that Make Dr, Henry Jones Jr. so memorable, the most accurate and powerful is: ""Cursed."" As a rule, a rigid regulation, no matter how noble his cause or how fearless his pursuit, nothing may ever ... EVER ... go right for Indiana Jones. That is why he is never boring. The circumstances that contsantly surround him are not just dire ... they are unnecessarily hopeless. They make Job look like Harvey Weinstein. In pursuit of two Arabs dressed in white who have placed Marion in a laundry basket to kidnap her, Indy happens upon a courtyard filled with nothing but Arabs dressed in white carrying laundry baskets;  After barely making it out of a booby trap infested tunnel alive with a priceless golden idol, he loses it to his rival and is chased away by hundreds of angry natives; Finally locating the resting place of the Lost Ark he lowers his torch only to find it is infested with snakes (and it couldn't have been spiders or crocodiles. It HAD to be snakes);  The most likely explanation of why he survives at the end of Raiders is that God gets tired of picking on him.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that of all the people who had some part of the creation of Jones -- Harrison Ford's delivery  is incredible, Lawrence Kasdan did his finest work ever on this script -- The credit must go to George Lucas and Steven Spielberg who were both responsible for Indy's conception and the conception of all the painful, frightening and wonderful pitfalls he must undergo.<br/><br/>As for the movie Itself I give it a 10 out of 10. thats all."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure movie of such rousing fun, action,thrills,chills, and style - it's a modern classic! The film was conceived as a modern throwback to the 'serial' short films of the 40's and 50's, and delivers the impossible cliffhanger moments with panache. Again, Steven Spielberg's brilliant direction keeps things moving along, and the film never fails to deliver.<br/><br/> Harrison Ford is perfect as Indiana Jones, and it's hard to believe that the role was originally offered to Tom Selleck. This film really made Ford a leading man that can carry a film all by himself.

","I have seen this movie repeatedly over the years and never grow tired of it. The movie entertains me on so many levels. The cinematography, musical score, the characters all breathe life into the movie so well. The action sequences are really exciting and Harrison Ford is at his best in bringing archeologist Indiana Jones to life. I enjoy the character so much because he does not come off as a superhero. He seems human, not invincible as some screen heroes are often portrayed coming through huge trials without a scratch. Sure Indiana Jones does some things that seem over the top or impossible, but his character isn't without flaws. He is human and gets beaten up pretty badly as he goes through numerous trials and tribulations.<br/><br/>
The movie never fails in keeping the viewer's interest as one great action scene occurs after another. This particular movie is my favoite of all the Indiana Jones movies. I feel the movie holds up very well even after all these years. The film does not feel dated at all. The movie launched quite a few ripoffs during the early 80s, none which ever stood up to the success or greatness of this one. Many tried, but very few succeeded.

","After watching Raiders of the Lost Ark probably a hundred times, I have come to the conclusion that it is a movie that contains a number of truly entertaining scenes with at least an equal number of silly ones.  The best scenes are so individually memorable that they could outclass many full length action/adventure films on their own.  The silly scenes just seem to become sillier with each viewing.  I am not really a fan of Steven Spielberg due to his infuriating need to use excessive sentimentality and lightheartedness in his pictures, but Raiders for the most part avoids that tendency.  The violence is oftentimes fairly brutal (he really seems to savor killing off Nazis) and the lead character, Indiana Jones, is not exactly a man of stellar morals.  But there are some parts in the movie where Spielberg does become annoying.  I've always listed this movie among my favorites, and I always will.  To some degree, an appreciation of the old cliffhangers that inspired Raiders of the Lost Ark might make the film more entertaining, but there alot of great moments that should entertain just about anyone.  It doesn't quite inspire the awe in me that it once did, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a great deal of fun for those with a sense of wide-eyed adventure."

While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.<br/><br/>What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief: Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.<br/><br/>Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end? There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later.

He is the embodiment of realistic acting. His character would have been completely unbelievable had it been played by anyone else, but Ford lends to it a certain quality of honesty and reality; the same admired traits he contributed to the Star Wars sagas. I feel safe in saying that had anyone else been cast as Indiana Jones, the franchise would not have been as successful as it was...and is.<br/><br/>With the new release of the Indiana Jones Boxed Set on DVD, the popularity of this series has been rekindled. Collectors and fans alike are flocking to the video stores to stock up on the latest release of their best and dearest favorites. According to Yahoo.com, it is the second-highest top selling DVD collection in the Action/Adventure genre as of right now, what with having all three movies and an additional DVD full of extras. (01/01/04) <br/><br/>The Raiders of the Lost Ark is all about the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artifact which is written a lot about in the old testament. It was reported to lay waste to vast armies and bring sure victory to any army which marched into war bearing this relic. It was old, even in the days of the Bible. What was built, was an elaborate case in which to house and carry it, fashioned by one of the twelve tribes of Israel and fought over every since.<br/><br/>The infamous German dictator is in search of the ark, which puts the American Government into the holy relic business. They enlist Dr. Indiana Jones, famed archaeologist, to find the ark and bring it back to safety before Hitler's men can get their hands upon it.<br/><br/>Not a bad premise, actually, and the Spielberg/Lucas team bring it to life for us. The story was fresh and edgy, with a wonderful cast and crew. Every aspect of this movie was action, fantasy, and an awe-inspiring creativity.<br/><br/>While I did find Karen Allen a bit whiny, and wanted to see her beheaded by the fifth scene, she finally pulled through and delivered a stellar performance by the end of the movie. <br/><br/>By any standards, this movie is still a huge success, and a goal for any aspiring actor/director/screenwriter/cinematographer to shoot for.<br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie, was the feeling bestowed by Ford's character that you actually knew him. The character development was wonderful, but without Ford's down-to-earth performance, that character development would not have been nearly as effective. So honestly, what I liked best about this production was Harrison Ford. He does not play his character like he knows everything, has no flaws, and is the perfect ... anything. He is honest, in his portrayal, about his shortcomings, lack of knowledge in certain areas, and his physical vulnerabilities. Excellent performance.

","There are two types of classic movies. There are the `classic' movies, the ones that all critics love but the major of people don't really like, and then there are the classic movies, ones that can never not entertain. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those that never cease to entertain. Also, in today's movie environment, it's hard to find an action movie that also constantly entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is a rarity nowadays.<br/><br/>The famous plot has Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) first being chased by a gigantic boulder (which has been parodied so many times it felt like I had already seen it), and then going on a treasure hunt to find the Biblical lost ark, which supposedly holds the original Ten Commandments before some Nazis do. Along the way, he meets up with his former teacher/friend's daughter Marion (Karen Allen) who has an important piece of the puzzle, and together the travel to stop the Nazis from, basically, taking over the world.<br/><br/>It's easy to picture this movie as a cheesy serial, and, in fact, Steven Spielberg himself said that that's all he thought this was as he was making it. Little did he know that he was going to create one of the most influential movies in the history of American cinema. That has both good and bad side effects. The good is that there seems to be no work like this, none that can compare. The bad is the countless number of imitators. Many have done the `map with the line tracing where the hero goes' now, and it seems like Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the first action movies that has a lot of comedy in it, and now every action movie is labeled as an `action comedy'.<br/><br/>Rarely does a movie come along in this vein where you are entertained even when there isn't a fight scene or something that most people would consider exciting on screen. Spielberg knows what the audience wants, and by gum he gives it to them. The majority of people don't want a lot of exposition, so just enough is given. Even when something exciting is not happening on screen, you have to pay attention to understand what everyone is saying with all of their accents. That could be one advantage to seeing this on DVD. Although it would be great to see it on the big screen, I could put on the subtitles at home.<br/><br/>I hate to say this, though, but there were a few things about this movie that bugged me. First, even for a crowd-pleasing movie like this, the lack of character development on many side characters bothered me (I'm a guy who loves his character development). Also, although John Williams is a genius composer, the same few bars got a little tiring after he played them over and over again in every scene. All in all, though, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG for strong violence/blood and some language."

This is easily fixed in the studio, how did these pros miss this!?<br/><br/>When talking to the feds in the university chapel, there is a two to three frame jump cut. Hello? This too is easy to fix, and I caught it after one viewing. We are talking basic quality control here. Who restored this film, high schoolers?<br/><br/>Someone else mentioned this, and I want to second it. The 5.1 mix is very poorly done. I had to crank my center channel to hear the dialog. When Marion slugs Indy, I barely even heard it. The mixer was going for realism, but the original mix was for a melodramatic, ""serial"" effect. This from the creators of THX and Skywalker Sound?<br/><br/>There were several scenes where dirt was on the camera lense protection glass. How hard is it to eliminate those large, out-of-focus blotches?<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen a little computer magic done in other places as well. A couple examples would be removing the reflection of the cobra in the glass that protected Harrison and Karen in the Well of Souls. The other would be eliminating the push-rod that flips the truck in Cairo.<br/><br/>A few reviewers mention scenes or audio that is cut. I did not see any of these cuts on the Widescreen version. What I saw was the entire movie that I remember seeing in 1981.<br/><br/>Dear LucasFilm, please provide (not in a collector set!) a SuperBit version of Raiders of the Lost Ark with DTS. Remix according to a film print and find people who can detect even the most BASIC flaws or errors. Let's hope the original Star Wars trilogy is treated with a little more detail and care."

"FilmOtaku","8","0","0","22 September 2003"," A perfect action/adventure film
","The last time I saw this film was about twenty years ago when my Dad and I went to see it about four times in the theater.  When it came to the local classic movie theater it was a must-see for a friend and I, and I was completely delighted with how it translated into my relatively `adult' life. <br/><br/>I use the term `adult' loosely for many reasons, but primarily because while sitting in that dark theater watching this movie, I was suddenly 10 years old again.  The outrageous action sequences, the wry comments by Indiana Jones that were probably lost on me when I was a child and the interesting comparisons between what I thought was terrifying as a child and the reality of its present impact on me was very fun to experience.  (I remember almost losing control of my bowels at the end of the film when I was a kid.)<br/><br/>
Another thing I realized after watching this movie was that Spielberg cannot write or direct proper roles for women in his films.  Karen Allen was almost (but not quite) as irritating as Kate Capshaw was in the second (and vastly inferior) installment.  The only allowance I can give is that the film in itself is so over the top that perhaps the whiny damsel in distress is appropriate, but that's about the most positive spin I can put on that element.  <br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to the Indiana Jones trilogy being released on DVD so that I can hopefully gain a little more insight into the production of the films, although perhaps the reality is that it's best to leave the films alone and let them stand on their own merit as fun, action packed films.  <br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Why are we watching movies? You can come up with thousands of reasons but the main reason Spielberg is exploring must be rediscovering the child in us...he did it with so many movies (from ET to Hook) but Indiana Jones must be the ultimate superhero. All is based on the great adventuremovies of the fifties, you know Burt Lancaster and other Rod Taylors, but perhaps it's the budget, perhaps it's the humour (Harrison Ford is funny), perhaps it's the B-movieacting...je ne sais pas but Raiders Of The Lost Ark is adventure at its best. The original of the trilogy (well, you all know Indy 4 is in the make) brings us back to the thirties at where Indiana Jones is set to Cairo to stop the nazis finding the lost ark (a tomb in where the ten commandments are hidden) and along with Marion (a great acting Karen Allen, just shame about the red trousers) they are having adventure after adventure. Cinema without intelligence? Yup, but a ride on the rollercoaster brings you no use of the brains as well and you always wanna ride again...love that picture so much!!!"

The movie hums along at such a brisk pace and packs such an exuberance that any minor critiques  will soon be lost as the smile appears on your face.<br/><br/>Ford has always been of the more ""Hollywood"" style actors and there are few movies more appropriate for this kind of style than this.<br/><br/>The whole movie's downright whimsical nature combined with slight adult sensibilities no doubt help broaden this movies appeal as it will surely delight audiences young (but not too young ^_^) and old."

"sdillon-1","10","0","0","30 July 2003"," The greatest pure adventure film ever made.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in my opinion, not only the finest film in the Indiana Jones trilogy but also the greatest pure adventure film ever made. Better than The Adventures of Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn), Where Eagles Dare, The Mask of Zorro, Romancing the Stone, The Mummy or any James Bond film.  This unadulterated thrill ride first exploded onto the big screen in 1981 and remains unsurpassed, despite many good and not-so-good imitators.<br/><br/>Combining the immense talents of George Lucas as writer and producer, and Steven Spielberg as director, this film echoes the great cliffhanger serials of Hollywood yesteryear but also outshines them by a long way.  Set in the 1930s, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones.  Jones is essentially a grave robber, a mercenary archaeologist who has hair-raising adventures uncovering rare artefacts.  He gets hired by the US government to uncover the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis, and is propelled into a thrilling globetrotting adventure.  Along the way he is helped by old flame Marion (the superb Karen Allen) and friend Sallah (the equally superb John Rhys Davis).<br/><br/>There are really too many great scenes to mention.  From its riveting opening (that boulder scene), to the Nepal bar fight, the Arab swordsman, the map room, the snake pit, the truck chase and the supernatural finale as God's wrath is unleashed, this is as exciting as films get.  Spielberg is firing on all cylinders here and having great fun.  There are also many laugh-out-loud moments.  Where else will you see a monkey perform a Hitler salute?<br/><br/>Ultimately, what really makes this film so interesting, is how Indy is just as obsessed with finding the Ark as the villain Belloq (the wonderfully slimy Paul Freeman).  Twice he chooses to abandon Marion because of his obsession.  As Belloq observes `you are a shadowy reflection of me', the clichÃ© for once rings true.  In subsequent Indiana Jones films, he is far a more straightforward hero, here he is a much darker and more interesting character.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the special effects, sound, music (the peerless John Williams), production design, editing, cinematography etc are well up to scratch.  It's impossible to find a more rattling good yarn than this film."

But that's what it is. Back to basics in the most powerful way possible.<br/><br/>How could it go wrong anyway? You have the two genius filmmakers of the 70's and 80's in Spielberg and Lucas carefully crafting an audacious adventure flick. It was a nailed on success. In their 90's and 00's moods though, it is highly doubtful they would have made the picture as good as this. But that debate is for another time.<br/><br/>Oh and yeah, it has a score by John Williams, the most gifted movie composer of them all. As he did with Superman and Star Wars, he elevates 'Raiders' to more than just a movie. It's a truly awe-inspiring experience that grabs hold of you and stays with you long after the end credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Spielberg, Lucas and Williams.

","Written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the classic Indiana Jones series, is a story about a man, Indiana, who is hired by the government to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do.  The Ark holds the original Ten Commandments. Jones is an archaeologist and adventurer.  He teaches by day, but when an adventure comes along, he will stop at nothing to get his treasure. Indiana is portrayed as a near completely fearless leader with merely one fear: snakes.  As he goes about his journey to retrieve the Ark, Indiana braves nearly impossible challenges.  However he is always either aware of the traps set for him, or somehow lucks out when he falls into them.  The main catch of this movie, as well as the rest in the trilogy, is the awesome suspense, keeping the audience's attention at all times.  The suspense is kept by placing Jones in ridiculous situations in which he always manages to narrowly get out of.  For example, in the beginning of the movie Indiana finds himself fleeing the cave from numerous traps.  At on point he is hanging from a ledge while a door begins to seal shut nearby.  The door closes almost all the way and Indiana is still hanging.  It looks as if there is no way he will get up in time, but of course, he makes it just in time to slide under the door and reach back under to retrieve his whip and pull out from under the very second it seals shut.  Just after that, in one of the most memorable scenes of the movie, he finds himself being followed by an enormous boulder getting closer and closer with every step.  In this scene, he manages to fall into a hole as the boulder rolls over, leaving him unharmed.  He falls through the whole into more trouble, but still managed to escape the inescapable.  These types of situations continue throughout the duration of the film.  Though the outcomes of the situations are rather predictable, they never seem to get old or boring.  Know-it-all, fearless, confident Indiana Jones keeps suspense high in every way, at all times, making this and the rest of the series classic films."

The basic story is that the Ark of the Covenant, containing the 10 Commandments, is in danger of being found by the Nazis.

","Raiders, the original, classic Indiana Jones adventure, is one of those films that when you revisit makes you realise how hardly anything so fresh, exciting and superb comes on our screens these days.  Following on from his only flop (1941), Steven Speilberg and George Lucas' all-stops homage to the old Saturday morning serials introduced us to the whip-cracking Dr Jones who would quite happily confront sword-windling Arabs and stowaway on a Nazi submarine but think twice about sharing a plane seat with a snake. <br/><br/>
In his first and greatest adventure, Indy (Harrison Ford) goes out in search of the Ark of Covenant when he is told that Hitler is out looking for the very same thing.  What follows is a non-stop array of spectacular action, death-defying thrills and ultimate tongue-in-cheek humour but its not all down to Speilberg's handling of the action that makes Raiders a classic among classics.  Ford is just as perfect and superb in the role as Connery was as Bond and the whole experience would not be the same without his thick sweat or ice-breaking smile.  Karen Allen also gives an endearing performance as the fiesty heroines whilst Paul Freeman and Ronald Lacey make terrific villains.  The film was an overwhelming success and Speilberg kept the magic perfectly in two equally successful and classical sequels."

In the beginning of the movie, Indy's greedy helper tries to take an idol that has been booby trapped, and ends up suffering a gruesome and gory death. Other scenes include skulls inside a cave filled with snakes (Indy hates snakes) and, probably the nastiest part in the whole movie, at the end when the main bad guys open up the Ark, a white light comes out and their flesh melts away. It looks pretty fake and kinda looks like wax melting, but it's still pretty nasty. Other OC is the main bad guy (who dies a grisly death in the end) is a really bad guy who sends chills down your spine. There is a little suggestive content when Indy's girl friend (not girlfriend) is changing and one of the main bad guys looks at her back when she is in a bra (not anything much). There are lots of scary moments, and some really nasty parts, but it's still a great movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I would recommend this to a fan of thrillers, Harrison Ford, or anyone who is interested in ancient artifacts. A great movie starring a great actor and a great storyline written by a great screenwriter and directed by a great director. Not recommended for children under the age of 13."

I like films where you don't have to concentrate too hard, where you can sit back and enjoy the adventure. Every little boys fantasy on screen.

","...and don't let anyone tell you indy-lovers differently. This is simply THE action-adventure flick of all time. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it now or you'll miss a piece of film history. This motion picture is perfect to the very last detail: the cast is great, the action is unlike anything you've ever seen, the direction is fantastic and the acting is unusually good. Harrison Ford deserved the oscar, i'm dead serious: the way he portrays Indy is inimitable. He realizes he is playing a human being, not some kind of super hero. The acting by Karen Allen is also excellent, Marion is Indy's best love interest ever. The nazi guy with that huge forehead and those creepy glasses was also great. <br/><br/>This is the most unbelievable motion picture in all of film history: it is so insanely entertaining, the action just never lets up! Certainly the film does take its time to calm down and display some humor and romance, but before you know it, you're just thrown back into the action. Who could forget such memorable action scenes, like the rolling bowl scene at the beginning, the one with the snakes, when he almost destroys a city with a truck, the final scene with all the ghosts and goblins... all these scenes are unforgettable. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I have it taped since i was four and i wouldn't dream of deleting it. Deleting Raiders is like deleting a part of my life. Oh, i wish i could've seen this movie in the theatre in 1981, but i wasn't even born yet.

OK, so ""Die Hard"" may have been the beginning of an action movie sub-genre, which ""Raiders"" wasn't (with the possible exception of the two sequels), but the latter was clearly the first blockbuster by today's standards.

","I've heard various comments in recent years of how Schindler's List is Spielberg maturing as a director. But in reality he matured in 1975 with Jaws, which along with Close Encounters, Raiders, and ET are the director at the very peak of his powers. Schindler, although superb, appears to be the director trying a little too hard to be serious and adult. Raiders is as 'adult' as any film you're likely to see in its remarkably sophisticated technique and mastery of audience manipulation, which along with Jaws even tops Hitch in this area. Spielbergs visual flair is astounding at times in this film, the natural fluidity of camera work and the perfect use of light, particularly in facial lighting is brilliant.

But when the U.S. government asks him to get the Ark of the Covenant before the nazis do, he may just be in over his head. The movie takes you and our hero from an African jungle, San Francisco, and to the blistering sands of Cairo.

I guess what I'm saying is that some things Indy can do are just a little unbelievable for me. 2)No offense, but do ya think they could've done a LITTLE better job at making sure that the audience couldn't see the glass cage the snakes were in? 3)I know ""Raiders"" was made in 1981, and they didn't have all the fancy computer technology crud we take for granted these days, but the special effects were, well, kind of cheap looking compared to some movies made at that time.  You could tell the ghost effects were kind of ""borrowed"" from Speilberg's ""Poltergeist,"" and the part where the dude's face melted was just, well, *weird.* 4)This movie is too overrated. 5)What's up with the ending??????????????????<br/><br/>Well, now you know my view on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It's not one of my *favorites*, but, if I had to, I think I could watch it again. The problem is that this movie is too overrated, like ""Titanic.""

","I don't care how illustrious ""Chariots of Fire"" was back in 1981; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" takes the cake every time! This is undeniably the best action picture that was ever created, with a hero that could take Seagal and Jackie Chan in a heartbeat. Seagal and Jackie may be formidable, but Indiana Jones has style and guts, and tackles Nazis and the supernatural to boot. Karen Allen as Marion is also one of the best heroines of the pack, no nonsense, no wimpy screaming, and not the first to yell for help; she can hold her own.<br/><br/>I just recently saw ""Raiders"" on the big screen for the first time (I'm only 20 years old) and I was blown over once again, no matter how many times I let it run through my VCR. It has a sense of humour without going slapstick, and has grit without becoming totally serious. The stunts are supreme, and (most importantly) the hero is not ashamed to show us he is exhausted, in pain, or can sweat. We are sweating right along with him. Spielberg and Lucas can not be praised enough for bringing archeology and history to this extreme wonder of entertainment. ""Raiders"" is easily on my Top Ten list of all time. Rating: Four stars (and a half for good measure)"

","Raiders is a shining example of what a big American blockbuster should be like, it is so rare to see such intense action combined with a fantastic story full of wonderful characters.

Raiders doesn't try to be offensive nor does it achieve it, seeing the odd soldier getting pounded is trite now, personally I quite enjoy seeing Nazi's get the thrashing they so deserved.

","Choosing one word that best defines Steven Spielberg's The Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first film in the Indiana Jones trilogy, would be an incredibly difficult task. Exciting, entertaining, action-packed, and humorous are all good words to describe the movie; however, the best definition for the film can only be made by combining all those words into one. The film possesses all the qualities that make watching action-adventure movies so entertaining, while adding a new and humorous twist into the mix. The Raiders of the Lost Ark set new standards in the genre at the time of its release. That is to say, it has changed the silver screen forever, defining the action-comedy motion pictures of today. New movies, like The Mummy for example, have characters cast and portrayed in the same stereotypical and likeable roll because of the discovery made by Steven Spielberg. Overall, The Raiders of the Lost Ark created the groundwork for many popular movies of today that may have never existed without it. To further prove this point, the best aspects of the movie, specifically the characters and actors, the innovative story, and the blending of action-comedy must all be examined and appreciated.<br/><br/>To begin with, the attention to the characters and casting had a great effect on boosting the movies popularity. Defining and depicting memorable characters that were humorous, strong, and easy to relate to is definitely one of the most positive aspects of the film. For instance, the archeologist and professor Indiana Jones, the hero, chooses to use a whip rather than a pistol or more deadly sidearm. This makes him appealing to the audience due to both his unique and memorable qualities as well as his nonviolent nature. Furthermore, by casting actors who are believable and realistic representations of their roles, the audience is better able to connect with the picture. While the characters were typically stereotypical and fairly impersonal, they were made this way on purpose for two reasons. First, it allowed the movie to poke fun at the way in which other action-adventure movies' characters were all so similar and predictable. Second, it allowed the viewers to enjoy this film's rapid pace without getting lost in the complexities of each character. For example, Indiana Jones begins a chase scene by jumping off his horse onto the back of a truck. By having Indiana use a horse instead of modern transportation, the audience associates him with the standard action-adventure hero of the past, giving his image greater depth without having to provide much background explanation. At the same time, these staples of the genre are marked as humorous when observed in retrospect, with the past contrasted against the present. All things considered, the characters and actors are rarely so well done in a motion picture as in The Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the casting of this picture is also one of its strongest points. It difficult to imagine the film having even a slightly different cast since each actor and actress relayed their roles so perfectly in the movie. For instance, Harrison Ford, the ideal choice for Indiana Jones, instantly projected the image of a strong and witty character so well that it would take an entire page in a novel to accomplish the same task. His previous role as Han Solo in Star Wars made him identifiable and likeable to the audience, and the fact that his role in both movies was very similar made him an excellent choice. In addition, Karen Allen, who plays Marion Ravenwood, is able to create the perfect counterpart to Indiana Jones. When paired together, Marion's strong and feisty attitude compliments Indiana's character without detracting from his image. Finally, the villains, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) and Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) both manage to portray their evil actions convincingly. Specifically, Belloq, a French archeologist, uses hit wits to play both sides for his own benefits, and Dietrich has a flair for villainy and a nefarious image that is exactly what one would expect from a Nazi secret agent. On the whole, the actors were chosen with a great deal of forethought, and the film proves that investing time to pick proper talent to do a movie can make it great just by their presence.<br/><br/>In addition to the characters and actors, the story of The Raiders of the Lost Ark was a perfect fit for the action-comedy genre. To be precise, Steven Spielberg was able to create a film that traveled to a variety of locales all around the world, introduced the heroes to harrowing and exciting action sequences, and created a plot that kept you on the edge of your seat. To begin with, the movie had a grand scope, constantly moving the action to new places around the globe. For example, just a few of the places visited include the mountains of Tibet, the Tunisian desert, and a German U-Boat near the French coast. By introducing the viewers to so many new settings, it is less like watching a movie and more like traveling with the heroes to follow the story. Furthermore, the story allowed for many new action sequences that have never been done before in other films. Since the hero is always in search of an artifact that must be discovered, it sets up for a great variety of dangerous situations. For instance, the scale of these sequences goes from escapes from natural dangers like giant boulders, spiders, and snakes to technological threats such as gunfights, and car chases, as well as the supernatural. The diversity and sheer quantity of the challenges, traps, and dangers that the hero faces are commendable, seeing as most films cannot manage to fit in even half as much in the time given. While the plot may be considered simple at its roots, the scale and variety of events that occur keep the audience from knowing what is going to happen next.  Consequently, The Raiders of the Lost Ark was successful in creating an imaginative and enjoyable story that was easy to follow and also an electrifying experience for the viewers.<br/><br/>Finally, the perfect melding of action and comedy in The Raiders of the Lost Ark is its most compelling quality. A balance was struck between poking fun at other films and television shows in the action-adventure drama, while creating great effects and new experiences of its own. In turn, the movie defined the action-comedy genre by setting the standards that future movies emulate and will be judged upon. On the one hand, the audience is treated with heavy doses of satire and comedy. For instance, one scene has a monkey hail an undercover German agent, making a statement against one of the many vices the Nazis practiced in a humorous fashion. On the other hand, the escape from the giant boulder and the dangerous snake pit provide a strong sense of action and danger. While most of the sequences are taken from the clichÃ©s in action-adventure genre, they are presented using either a humored twist or with added thrills, making the experience fresh and enjoyable for any audience. Additionally, the movie featured some of the best fight sequences on the silver screen. For example, one particular sequence takes place underneath the slashing propellers of a Nazi Flying Wing. By taking the fight to such a creative and original setting, the film is able to provide a whole new level of thrills for the audience. On the whole, one of the greatest qualities of this film is that it never takes itself seriously, providing action as well as comedy into a two-hour thrill ride.<br/><br/>
All in all, The Raiders of the Lost Ark has managed to single handedly define and lay the foundations for the action-comedy genre. Without this film, fans of both the action-adventure and comedy genres would be missing out not only on the trilogy itself, but also some of the great films that came after it. Modern day movies like The Mummy, its sequel, The Mummy Returns, and The Mask of Zorro can be entertaining, but anyone who has experienced the Indiana Jones films, especially The Raiders of the Lost Ark, will have a better appreciation of the feeling that movie-makers are trying to recreate today. Seeing this classic movie for the first time is a treat that no one should miss. Whether you are looking for action, adventure, thrills, comedy, or just good, old-fashioned nostalgia, Indiana Jones in The Raiders of the Lost Ark is your ticket."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastic classic movie! All of the credit for its success and fun goes to George Lucas (Star Wars) and Steven Spielberg (A.I. Artificial Intellegence). The cast is what kicked some ass. That included Harrison Ford, Karen Allen (Starman), Paul Freeman (Power Rangers:The Movie), John Rhys-Davies (The Lord of the Rings).<br/><br/>If you look hard enough, you will find out that Raiders is really sort of a sequel. I say this because if you notice, The Temple of Doom took place in 1935, and Raiders took place in 1936. So the Temple of Doom is actually a prequel.<br/><br/>There is so much to say, but I have so little room to explain. Basically, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is going after the Ark of the Covenet before the Nazis get to it. At the same time, he has competition, which is Belleq (Paul Freeman). A rich, sleazy archeologist who steals from Jones whenever he gets the chance. Jones' love interest is Marion (Karen Allen) who tags along with him.<br/><br/>This is definitley a movie for all ages and I recommend it to every family who reads this review. <br/><br/>Look for a cameo by Steven Spielberg at the docks near the end of the movie."

","This film will certainly be remembered as one of Spielberg's best because it is filled with the exhilarating fun at which the man has proved himself to be a master.  A previous reviewer seemed to state that it doesn't have much appeal in England.  I don't see why that should be, because BBC1 have just shown the trilogy on Thursday nights and many of the main roles in Raiders are played by British actors.  The character Indiana Jones performs a transformation quite akin to Superman - from quietly spoken college lecturer to tough adventurer.  The music by John Williams is fantastic and exciting action sequences are never far away.  The role of Jones fit Harrison Ford like a glove and Ronald Lacey was perfectly cast to play the Gestapo villain.  My favourite character, though, was Belloq, a big break for Paul Freeman.  A suave and utterly selfish rival archaeologist who would appear to be an intellectual match for Jones.  Part of the success of the Indiana Jones movies can probably be explained by the diminishing quality of the James Bond films around this time and the desire by audiences to see other escapist entertainment."

","The one thing that i love about all the Indiana Jones films, is that adventure that gets you pumped and primed for more. But ""Raiders"" sets the standard. As they say, the original and the best. Nothing has or will ever come close to ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"". Why? because at every turn, a new sub-story or add-on is occuring. Sure, the action may stop for a while, but thats the beauty of it. It adds to the explanation of the story better, and progresses into an easy to understand plot line that you wished would have gone that much longer by the time you get into the car park. The characters are wonderfully cast and portrayed as Harrison Ford (will always be best known for this role, by far his best role in a movie), Denholm Elliot as his cheerful friend, who encourages him all the way, and Karen Allen as the eractic Marion, who loves to take this role out of control. Either way, ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"" is a must see, if you havent seen it.

","Action and adventure dont get any better than they do in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Director Steven Spielberg and Producer George Lucas team together to create one of the most exciting cinematic experiences ever.  It is the first film in the Indiana Jones series and is by far the most creative and original.  Harrison Ford is legendary as Dr. Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting acheologist professor who must attain the lost ark of the covenant before the evil Nazi empire does.  Ford's performance as rugged, brainy and comical Jones is his defining role.  He is the perfect Indiana.  It is impossible to imagine anyone else in this role and he is a joy to watch.  The supporting characters are brilliant as Jones must travel far and wide to battle a rival French archeologist and his allegance to the 3rd riech.  The film works because Spielberg develops his characters well and the audience truely cares about them.  It is an archipal good versus evil film where desperate action scenes leave us cheering for Jones and his allies.  The script and plot is quick and clever.  John Williams scores an inspirational soundtrack that tells the story inconjunction with Spielberg.  The best action film of all time.  Final Rating = 9.3/10"

"Indy-52","10","0","0","18 November 2001"," the best film made in the history of motion pictures!
","2001 marks this legendary, innovative adventure yarn's 20th birthday, and since it is also my #1 favorite movie of all time, I decided it was time for me to write a review of it. This is Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford at their absolute best. Practically every action set piece in this film has gone down in movie history, just like the rousing, incredible score by the great John Williams (JAWS, STAR WARS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND... he's done 'em all!). By the way, I'm not getting paid to write this review, since no one really needs another. I'm writing it simply to express my immense affection and love for it.<br/><br/>This is the true, great roller coaster ride that STAR WARS simply wasn't for me at the time. Harrison Ford, already a star after playing Han Solo, fares considerably better in this role. In fact, this could be the best-cast part that any actor has ever been in, in any movie. If you could say 'born-to-play-this role' about just one role, it would be Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Thank God for Magnum P.I., otherwise Tom Selleck would have taken the role in all the movies (honestly, I think he would've been okay, but it would now be unthinkable to picture anyone but Ford as Indy). The story of the film doesn't have a lot of developments or twists, it's just a roller coaster ride of a movie that never lets up. It would be hard to say that the first, introductory sequence is the best, since there's so much more that the movie offers, but I think it's the best-known to casual moviegoers. It's the one where we first meet one of the all-time greatest screen heroes that is, of course, Indiana Jones. The year is 1936 and we're somewhere in a South American forest. Indy is looking for a gold statue and although he will find it he will get very near to being killed in the process... only to see it being taken away by his arch-enemy called Rene Belloq, played blandly by Paul Freeman. This is the famous sequence where he escapes from a giant boulder, where he finds a miriad of tarantulas on his back, and where picks up the gold statue from the standard carefully but causes the cavern to collapse. After this sensational opening sequence the film slows down a while to show us that Jones also works as professor in college. He is contacted by his superiors and is sent on a mission to find the Ark of the Covenant, an important artifact where Mozes wrote the ten commandments, before the Nazis do (how someone can work as a teacher and an adventurer is beyond belief, of course, but so are many aspects of this movie). He will travel to Cairo in Egypt, and that's where the majority of the movie takes place. On his way there, he goes to Nepal, where he needs to find another artifact that will help in his mission. It is owned by Marion (Karen Allen), an old girlfriend of his, and she initially refuses to hand it over. Soon later a group of Nazis, led by the very creepy Toht played by Ronald Lacey, break into her bar for that same necklace that Indy came for. Eventually the Nazis will cause a fire, fight with Indy and Marion (she's not your typical damsel in distress, she often helps Indy out and takes care of herself), and die under the fire, although Toht turns up again later in the movie. Once in Egypt, Indy and Marion will be thrown into one big action set piece after another. They will be pursued by swordsmen in the marketplace, thrown together in the snake pit where the Ark lies, destroy some Nazi airplanes with undescribable explosions, be engaged in a massive truck chase sequence, tied together with their eyes closed as God exacts his wrath on the Nazis at the film's effects-laden, spectacular climax.<br/><br/>
This is truly one of those films that you enjoy so much that you don't even dare to think about something like plot inconsistencies. This wasn't an especially ambitious movie, it only wanted to thrill you, but it was so well made that it became a true movie classic. Part of what made it special was that it was a true labor of love, a happy collaboration between buddies Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who co-wrote the story and executive produced. The fun they had really shines through: every set-piece is magnificently filmed and thought-up, with a real sense of fun, excitement, and awe that one just doesn't find anymore in contemporary action films. And who could forget that magical scene where we expect Indiana to start fighting a swordsman showing off his skills and he just shoots him? Another truly magical touch is the unforgettable music score. Who hasn't heard of the legendary 'Raiders March' theme? But that's just the half of the magic that Williams produces here. There is a truly awe-ispiring theme going on in the scene where Indy is underground in Egypt in the room that with the sunlights shows him the way to where the Ark is. It's an extremely effective theme that's also heard in the stunning climax.<br/><br/>And of course there is Harrison Ford, who is so confident and simply perfect in his role he should've gotten an Oscar. Unlike many other actors playing heroes, he doesn't hit a single wrong note in his performance. He could never be replaced in that role, while Sean Connery as James Bond, for example, could. It is also clear to me now that a big part of the film's success has to be credited to Ford. And Spielberg was at the absolute top of his form by the time of this film (consider he was nominated for Best Director for this film and the next year for E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL), likewise with Lucas' creativity. John Williams has been Oscarnominated for practically every score he wrote since JAWS. After doing some brilliant work the year before with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, he went on to write his best music ever for this film. All the best talents in Hollywood at the time collaborated in 1981 to make what I think could be considered the best film of all time. No other film in history has achieved the excitement, sense of wonder, and sheer brilliance of this one. It is the ultimate fun time at the movies, and you have missed out on a part of life if you haven't seen it. [PG]"

Best of all the story line is great.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes - like how did Indy get inside the submarine without being noticed?  But these minor infringements can easily be overlooked in what is on the whole a cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>I guess I've seen Raiders upwards of 20 times now, and could easily watch it that many more.  I have introduced my daughters to it, & they love it almost as much as I do.  I think this is one of those timeless movies - certainly it plays on many that have gone before it, but that's part of the charm. Long live Indy!"

","The exciting saga of an archaeologist who is sought upon by the United States Government to find The Ark of the Covenant before the Germans do. The future of the free world depends on Jones finding the relic, because ""he who marches with the ark before him is believed to be invincible"". The film mixes fantasy with an actual circumstance that could develop, which keeps the viewer on the edge of his. Jones is faced against his arch enemy Renee Belloq, a French archieologist, who heads the expedition that takes place in random abstract locations around the globe. Jones is joined with Marion Ravenwood, his former teacher's daughter, on this great quest to save mankind. Ronald Lacey is excellent as Toht, Belloq's allie and a sinister villain who will kill anyone who stands in his way. Some great scenes include the infamous ""boulder chasing Indy scene"" and the ""pit full of snakes"". The film also contains the greatest action sequence in the history of filmaking-The Desert Chase. To tell any more would ruin the movie. A film everyone should see, and a film one can watch over and over again. My favorite movie of all time, it is #60 on the AFI's top 100 list. A 4 star wonder and a classic of its age. Spielberg's greatest accomplishment. The definition of a true adventure. -Jake Klim (jklim007@yahoo.com)"

","I am an avid insomniac, and while I wander through the hours of darkness brought forth by dusk, there is always one film that brings true entertainment and wonderfully depicts why films are made; for adventure, for amusement, and especially for fantasy.To be flung into the past ages and on the highest octane and pulse-pumping thrill in the history of cinema.The Raiders of the Lost Ark, is the greatest film ever made and they are many reasons why it is, among them a few names: Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford.An absolute wizardry of filmmaking and filmmakers.The most brilliant director, writer, and actor not of just their generation but of every single cohort in motion picture history. Enough praise can never be said in a lifetime about Raiders and if proof is needed then it must be presented.The film is timeless, so perfect it seemingly could have been made in any time era: past, present, or future-this being the true test for all great films.Although this review is purely opinionated as all reviews and critiques are, there are several elements to explore for true indulgence of this film delicacy.I ask for yourself as reader and film-viewer to rent or watch (if owned), the picture and when Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Junior is running for his life from a 40-ton boulder, a prized antiquity tucked under his arm for which the pursue occured; ask yourself is he not adventure in flesh?

","This was one of those movies I thought for a long time I wouldn't like but I instantly ended loving. Inventing the concept of ""roller-coaster ride"", the movie is a constant journey through the means of the never-seen. I can only say thank heavens that Lucas and Spielberg didn't reformulate the Bond adventures and came up with this one instead. Because the movie is a fantastic ride, and never lets you stop for a second, quickly becoming attached to your memory with its great one-liners, its trademark soundtrack, its lead characters and its new concept of a globe-trotting adventure. Highly recommended action fest, the movie should be seen by everyone who still has a kid's heart inside. Marvelous fare, and a huge victory.

","Terrific action adventure takes few breaths as it throws it's intrepid, globe trotting, archeologist protagonist in front of vile Nazis, giant boulders, unrelenting natives, heavy fisted baddies, and even snakes. Adventurer extraordinaire Indiana Jones is hired by the Government to find and attain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do and along the way encounters everything from risk of loss of limb to a little romance in this adventure set in the late 30's.  Ford embodies charismatic Jones like no other could and pairs up nicely with Allen, who plays the damsel not-so-much in distress. Rounding out the cast is the impeccable John Rhys-Davies as Indy's faithful and charming friend Sallah and Paul Freeman lends an almost charming fiendishness to the antagonist Belloq. The film score, by the legendary Williams, is one of the finest film scores ever and compliments perfectly every twist, turn, and tumble this film has to offer. First action piece should be reading material for film students on how to hook an audience within ten minutes. A giant film from which all other adventure films should be rated.

","If I had the power, I would crown RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK the absolute greatest film ever made. Well, that'll never happen, but it has in my mind. It's basically the blueprint for how to make a great action movie. Other than STAR WARS, this was the film I was most-obsessed with when I was little. I remember wearing my Indiana Jones-style Fedora and my little shoulder bag, using a whip my dad had to swing around in the backyard while I sang John Williams's world-famous ""Raiders March."" I was only two years old when the film came out, so I never had the chance to see it up on the big screen the way it was meant to be seen. I find it so entertaining because it has a little bit of everything: action, adventure, horror, suspense, and even a bit of romance. It's got the perfect actors playing the perfect roles, the story is good, the music is excellent (my all-time favorite soundtrack, too), the direction is top notch, and the pacing is great. There's not a dull moment in this movie. Even the quiet dialogue scenes are enjoyable, with some of the best lines ever written (""I am but a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me. To push you out of the light."") or improvised (""It's not the years, honey. It's the mileage."") The supporting cast is great as well, and the villains are appropriately creepy, and Belloq is one of my favorite screen villains. Not because he's menacing, but because he's just as interesting as the hero of the film. Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones is, without a doubt, one of the greatest--if not THE greatest--matches between actor and character. The action pieces are great as well: who can forget Indy's escape from a booby-trapped South American temple, or his fight with a huge Nazi mechanic near the deadly blades of a giant Nazi plane, or the thrilling truck chase through the desert which is still my favorite action sequence of all time. (As if you couldn't tell, RAIDERS has a lot of things that I rank as my ""all-time favorites""). I'm shocked that there have been no plans to rerelease the film in the theaters for it's twentieth anniversary this year, and that there's still no plans for a DVD release. How could RAIDERS not get both? The greatest film ever made certainly deserves it."
"XRANDY","Null","0","0","20 June 2001"," If only more ""action/adventure"" movies were this good
","Warning Spoilers!<br/><br/>	A stupendous movie that is much more than an `action and adventure' flick. Sure there's a lot going on with all the impressive stunts and exciting fight sequences, but the mix of humor, sly serendipity, crafted dialogue and the heroic resilience of Indiana Jones all add up to a fun and smart film that more than meets its terminus ad quem---to entertain.<br/><br/>
	I remember seeing this for the first time and enjoying it from beginning to end.  The opening scene in the cave was exhilarating, the hero was refreshingly flawed, the leading lady was sexy, the villains were classic, the ending was fateful; the whole thing was just so damn good.  It also had clever side moments like the student who wrote `I love you' on her eyelids and Marion's drinking contest in Nepal.  Not to mention the famous shooting of the flashy swordsman scene, which is still, after repeated viewings, a fresh and spontaneous vignette.<br/><br/>
	Now for the one thing that REALLY bugs me about this film.  I am more than willing to suspend reality for the pure enjoyment of a movie, and I know that such a position is virtually required for a movie like this, but what the hell is the deal with the U-boat?  I mean I can buy the multitude of snakes living in a mass (snakes would never do this), I'll ignore the big stones, entrenched for thousands of years that Indy moves with ease, and I'll simply appreciate the numerous, highly improbable stunts.  The reason is because they all ADD to the film's allure.  I have no problem suspending belief if it enhances.  But the U-boat scene doesn't make sense.  Indy jumps on board (on the outside of the craft) and rides for hundreds of miles and the submarine NEVER SUBMERGES?  WHAT??????  The reason it irritates me is that there was no reason that it had to be a U-boat.  It need only be a German battleship.  Then Indy could have latched on, hid somewhere and enjoyed the ride no problem.<br/><br/> 	By the way Spielberg shines here as a director.  His use of shadows and innovative camera cuts add much to the film.  He was without a doubt the man for the job."

He goes after treasures and so his adventures take him all around the world. This movie in particular is good because it has a cool plot that really moves. The opening classic sequence is amazing, but it doesn't stop there. Four fifths of this movie are really great. Then there's a stupid, fake looking, climactic scene, but so what.

","In My humble opinion, Raiders of the Lost Ark ties Star Wars as the best movie of all time. If that doesn't give you a hint as to the contents of this review, nothing will. <br/><br/>It's 1935, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a professor of archaeology. Only, that's his day job. Jones is a globe hopper who has a unique talent for acquiring rare antiquities. Jones' talents come to the attention of U.S. Army intelligence, who just happen to require a little assistance. It seems that Adolf Hitler and his Nazis have set out to recover the long lost Ark of the Covenant. The Ark, according to the bible, was the container in which the Ten Commandments were housed. According to legend the Ark will bring incredible power to those who possess it. Jones, always up for a challenge, agrees to try to find the Ark before the Nazis do. <br/><br/>I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the rest of the movie, because 99% of the people reading this review will already have seen the movie. As to the other 1%, trust me when I say that nothing I could write here would ever do this movie justice. Raiders is the classic action adventure, there has never been anything like it before, and nothing since has ever measured up to it. Including it's two sequels. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford is perfect as the adventurer who completes his goals no matter what it takes. The rest on the supporting cast do a fantastic job, including John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's Egyptian connection Sallah and Paul Freeman as Beloq, the French archaeologist who heads up the Nazi team searching for the Ark. The only weakness in this movie comes from the casting of Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Jones' former flame and current partner in his quest for the Ark. Not that there is anything wrong with Allen's acting, I've just never felt that she was right for the part. Oh well, if that is my biggest complaint about a movie I'm doing OK. <br/><br/>I could rave on and on about this movie for hours, but in the end I would probably be just preaching to the choir. If you are one of the very few people who have never seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. I guarantee you will not regret it. <br/><br/>10/10"

A few thoughts on the beloved Raiders:<br/><br/>-Great, dark villans.  Great rivalry between Belloq and Indy.<br/><br/>-Allen and Ford are great together, and the score is wonderful.<br/><br/>-Wisely holds back on the supernatural until the very end.<br/><br/>-Indy seems like a semi-real person.  He's not a kung-fu master or anything stupid like that.  He gets hurt and shows fear, although he sure gets punched in the head a lot without getting knocked out.<br/><br/>-Great locations, Cairo is really mysterious place and is a perfect setting for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>-Stunts and battles are great, without any CGI assistance.<br/><br/>-Comedy is present, but it's not ""in your face"".  Funny things happen, but they aren't ""jokes"" like one liners.  Plus all of the comedic events still stick to reality.  Toht gets two great laughs and he is by far the darkest character in the film.<br/><br/>So how can a movie have comedy, romance, horror, adventure, action and suspense, and not be stupid in some way?  Well, it CAN'T- this movie is a miracle, it shouldn't have turned out this well.  The sequels, although entertaining and better than most sequels are, don't even approach this movie.

","The reason I find this movie so enjoyable is that Indiana Jones is an ""everymans"" hero, someone whom if I were suddenly thrown into a similar Hollywood-esk situation, would probably do the same sort of things; be afraid, make mistakes, and sometimes not know what to do next. It is only through perseverance and occasional dumb luck which allows Indiana Jones to reach his goal.<br/><br/>In so many countless action movies the hero steps into death-defying situations with the coolness of a cucumber, dodging every bullet with the deftness of a ballet dancer, swiftly decides every move with the foresight of a fortune teller, and finally come forth from the rubble with nary a snag on their three-piece suit. No, Indy is a hero with whom we find is frightened to enter a snake-filled altar, makes an error in judgement when he tries to destroy the most prized artifact in history (with a bazooka no less), and doesnt always know what to do next ""I dont know, Im making this up as I go along"".<br/><br/>The excellent score by John Williams sets the mood of each scene so perfectly, I couldnt imagine replacing a single note. The now legendary main title theme is brilliant, and the haunting well of souls theme brings a dramatic chill. But its the music during the map room scene which is my favorite of this or any movie, the tension is brought out so well with the music no words are needed from either character.<br/><br/>An adventure film classic, elements I felt were lost in the two sequels, (although I know many liked the third in the series), this has always remained my favorite ever since I first saw it in 1981. It fulfils the highest requirement for a movie: it entertains."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) is a high spirited adventure flick with a multiple supply of cliffhangers.  Has to be one of the best films by Steven Speilberg besides Jaws(1975) and E.T.(1982).  Tom Sellect was originally chosen to play Indiana Jones but decided on starring in a TV show so Harrison Ford got the part instead.  I'm actually glad that it was Harrison Ford and not Tom Sellect who got the role.  The climax of Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) is a cross between The Devil Rides out(1967) and Quatermass & the Pit(1967).  Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action classic that has been repeated but not surpassed."

","I love Harrison Ford movies, but this is the BEST movie I believe I have ever seen.  True, I love Star Wars too, but I saw this movie BEFORE I ever saw Star Wars, and it has found a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>In all my years of viewing movies, I have yet to find another movie with quite as much style as this.  Everything was done so well.  Putting together a terrific heroic score like John Williams did with the ""Raiders March"" is only something that happens once in a lifetime.  That score will always make me feel the need for adventure.  It just gets you going, and makes you excited, helps you get into the movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and the little things that just make it so amazingly clever.  Such as the scene where Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is confronted by a thug with a big sword.  The thug shows off his swordsmanship as to intimidate Indy, but Indy just draws his weapon as casual as you possibly could and shoots the thug with his pistol.  That's incredible.  Done very well!<br/><br/>Oh, or how about the famous scene where they open up the seal to the Well of the Souls and Indy just comments, ""Snakes, why'd it have to be snakes?""<br/><br/>""Movie magic"" is a term described when talking about the special effects in a film, but for this movie, I'd use it to describe how Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford all came together to make an adventure movie that will surely stand the test of time."
"Movie Mac","10","0","0","20 October 2000"," One of the most original films ever made!
","I don't think there was a decade where more original movies were made than the 1980s. This was the one that sparked classics like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Dick Tracy"", ""The Neverending Story"" and , of course, the other ""Indiana Jones"" movies. It is both a satire and a tribute to the old adventure serials shown on TV that Steven Spielberg hated and George Lucas loved. It is a very politically incorrect film with cartoony visuals (that I hope never get changed!) and a brilliant musical score.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie a million times and find it just as entertaining as when I first watched it on a Saturday afternoon in place of a matinee film. It truly is unlike any film I had seen before. Who on earth would have dreamed up an archaeologist as an adventurer? That is the basis for many things to come.<br/><br/>It is a strange sensation trying to put this film into words. It is dry, silly, nutty, constantly loaded with action and yet it remains one of the greatest films of all time. I'll see what I can do in describing it:<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is set in Pre-World War II times when the Nazis, apparantly, were obbsessed with religious artefacts and tried to take possession of the fabled Ark of the Covenant which contains some vast power. It really exists in a universe of its own (think ""Being John Malkovich"") and not ours which is what makes it such great escapism. The man who has been assigned by the U.S. government to track the Nazis down is an archaeologist named Indiana Jones. What follows is an epic set in several locales of weird beauty and surprisingly good places for chase scenes and fight scenes.<br/><br/>This movie is set in South America, North America, Nepal, Egypt, Tunisia (I think), the Atlantic Ocean and some unknown deserted island. It has fight scenes and ""temple scenes"" involving Nazis, drunken Nepalese men, swordsmen, marksmen, traitorous jungle men and one big, bad Nazi soldier. It also has the best chase scene ever in a movie involving numerous vehicles, weapons and endlessly creative opportunities. What I have just described is what is on the surface level.<br/><br/>The subtext in this movie comes from the universe it creates - and rips off. The sets look as though they have been built for destroying, the costumes look like they have been taken out of the circus, the make-up is deliberately bad, the acting is over-the-top and sentimental and the special effects are cheesy, tacky and meant to be that way. I hope they never update this film!<br/><br/>What makes this film convincing is the brilliant camera work, editing, direction, sound effects and music. They make the cartoony universe all the more convincing and it provides a balance for the sometimes biting subtext. The other side of the balancing act is done on the entertainment scale. I believe this film to be the best pure entertainment ever!<br/><br/>(One other thing. The character of Indiana Jones. Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones. The most original anti-hero ever made. That ""shooting-of-the-swordsman"" scene shows just what kind of a character he is!)<br/><br/>I said before that Steven Spielberg hated adventure serials and George Lucas loved them. I found this out from a book on Lucasfilm's CV. This is what I think made the film such a spectacular success. This is one of my favourite films. a genuine original in the tradition of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Truman Show"". Never change it, Mr. Spielberg. You have done an amazing job! 10/10!!"
"JAM-31","10","0","0","20 October 2000"," The Greatest Adventure Movie of All Time
","From beginning to end, this rip-roaring action movie is perfect.  It was my favorite movie for years until it was topped by another Spielberg film, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (and only because that movie's subject matter is more important)  <br/><br/>It hits perfection on everything associated with adventure films, and nothing in its genre has come close to topping it since, save maybe its first sequel, ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" <br/><br/>
It has a great plot, characters, music, exotic locales, villains, stunts, cinematography, and special effects.  Thrilling and expertly choreographed and photographed action sequences--the gunfight in the Nepalese bar and the hijacking of the Nazi plane are excellent examples.  It deserves its spot on the AFI list of the top 100 greatest movies of all time.  It was inspired by the serials of the 1930's, but represents them better than those films do themselves.  The stunt work is incredible, with hero Indiana Jones (introduced here for the first time) running from giant boulders, dragged underneath trucks, and punching and whipping his way through dozens of fights with nasty bad guys.  Harrison Ford is excellent, and so are all the supporting roles, especially Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, and Ronald Lacey as Toht, who is possibly movie history's most menacing henchman. ""Raiders"" is also scary and suspensful--many of us who grew up in the eighties remember being frightened by the beautiful spectre released by the Ark, who then morphs into a screaming death's head.  Its also quite amazing that the many snakes and spiders in this film were all real. <br/><br/>
Whenever you feel down, this is the movie to watch.  Pure escapism.  It is so uplifting and exciting, what more could you ask for?  Grade: A+"

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those films that has earned every bit of success and critical praise it has been given over the years. It's the perfect adventure film, it raised the bar for the genre to such a high point, that I personally haven't been able to view any other movies of this type without making comparisons. But really, I can't think of any movies that have even tried to attempt to capture the excitement of Raiders. There have been other adventure films in the last twenty years, but none have really been on the scale of this, or any of the Jones films. The movie is a laugh riot on top of everything else. I was watching it not too long ago with my father, during the famous scene between Indy and the swordsman who takes a knife to a gunfight he remembered how the audience was in hysterics, how it was one of the biggest laughs he had ever had at a movie (I was too young to remember). This film inspires these types of memories in a lot of people, which pretty much guarantees its status as one of the greatest films ever made. But there had to have been high expectations at the time, from the director of Jaws and the creator of Star Wars, two of the highest grossing films of all time.<br/><br/>Yep, not much to be said about this one that hasn't already been said. So let me ask something. Why do so many people spend time summarizing the plot of this film in the ""User Comments"" section of IMDB anyway? Aren't there many places you could go to for the plot of a film? That's not really commenting on the movie if all you're doing is giving a greatly detailed description of the story with a quick, ""I liked it!"" at the end, is it? This really brings out the anal retentive in me. Oh well, looks like it's time for me to get a life. 10/10 stars, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a hum-dinger of a movie. Don't ask me what that means. I heard someone say it once and thought it was funny. G'night!"

","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>What a wonderful and fun movie this is.  I saw this movie when I was about seven years old, and since then I've always wanted to be an archaeology. (of course, I realize archaeology is nothing like the movie, but, it's still fun)<br/><br/>From the opening scene to in the South American jungle, to the climatic scene in a remote island in the Aegean Sea, this movie is so memorable, awe-inspiring, and filled with wonderment.  It's almost become an enigma of adventure movies, and the funny thing is, it's so simple.  Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is our somewhat sarcastic, free-spirit hero who gets help from an independent spunky woman named Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and a boisterous, friendly, baritoned-voice Egyptian named Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).  (Whenever I feel happy or I have done something victorious I can't help but break into a few bars of ""Monarch of the Sea,"" and ""A British Tar is a Sterling Soul."") Anyway, they fight against a competing French Archaeologist, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) and arrogant, Nazi stooge General Herman Dietrich (Wolf Kahler) and the sniveling, impish Nazi thug named Toht (Ronald Lacey) in the quest for the Ark of the Covenant. Denholm Elliot also has a brief role as the intellectual Dr. Marcus Brody, (who became much more prominent in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.""<br/><br/>All the characters are memorable, especially Ronald Lacey's portrayal of Toht.  You can't forget the small balding guy, competely decked out in the all-black uniform, and those glasses perched on the end of his nose, he is great in the bar scene at Nepal.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just tons of fun, with plenty of action-packed scenes, elaborate sets, and memorable and witty dialouge.

"dust-7","Null","0","0","6 August 2000"," Unexpected classic!
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>One of the greats of cinema. Without question, one of the greatest films ever made, probably surprising the heck out of the producer and director, behind it - who were shooting for a . . . 'B' movie.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford breaks out of Han Solo into a character even shadier, at times, and even more resourceful (I'm just making it up as I go along). They had signed Tom Selleck. But Ford didn't joke around - unlike in later Raiders films. He had an edge, maybe honed from years as the tv bad guy gunslinger on Gunsmoke, and the like. He was everyman, but not the '80s man. He was tough. And if Star Wars didn't make him a star - though it basically did - then seeing him spin around and disarm the guy about to shoot him in the back, using only a whip, marked the beginning of Harrison Ford, superstar.<br/><br/>The score is Oscar calliber, and really contributes overall to the film. The direction is generally very crisp and the 'flow' just about right. Nice editing. There's humor in the film, but the characters aren't prostituted for the sake of cheap jokes. One might argue the introduction of Marion is little unbelievable, maybe even a bit long. But it's difficult to find an extraneous scene, or a needless movement, in this. From start to finish, it's quick cut, the action follows logically, and even the obv plot holes (Indy hanging on the sub, for ex) are forgotten with the next astonishing scene. However much Speilberg, Lucas and others may have thought it was all a hodgepodge of 'great ideas' that they'd always 'wanted to do', that these were just 'intended' to be B movies, the film is well crafted, well thought out, with convincing bad guys, with the sense of real threat and danger to the heroes, with competent allies (not buffoons), and with a prize at the end of the quest of which is certainly worth standing in awe.<br/><br/>Marion, maybe because Allen was so striking on screen herself, was actually an interesting character, even though she's in hysterics much of the time. She had a feel for a kind of bratty banter that the 'classier dames' of subsequent films couldn't match. One could identify with her, in the jokes (as with the frying pan to the head), and in the serious moments, with the fire blowing past them tied to that pole. She was the girl next door, embarked on an adventure she never anticipated from a life she never wanted. but who distinguished herself with honor, nonetheless. Indy knew what he was in for. Not her.<br/><br/>There was also a sense of discovery, absent in the next films. It was new. This stuff was something to cheer, to be interested in. Take a moment to take it in. Cairo! - Rhys-Davies, shouts. And it is an interesting roof top view and setting. But he's not a jokester. He says it with a calm pride. There's the sub pens. There's the German flying wing, full on aircraft, that goes spectacularly - boom! There's the thing with the red line and the map, that became the cliche - where in the world are we now, kind of thing. We see the map room, a remarkable set, and the well of souls, equally remarkable, and the sunset above. The presence of the supernatural is also there, throughout, from that beam in the map room, to the burning off of the swastika on the crate, to even Belloc's challenge - blow it up! - which he knew Indy could never do. It's bright - lots of scenes out in the sunlight, lots of bright, non-colored, natural looking lighting. Not exactly Blade Runner (which was another good H. Ford film, in its own right). It's bright, it's new, there's something going on here, it's . . . a movie.<br/><br/>And it's important to remember the plot. They find the Ark, fairly early on. It's supernatural. So it's supernaturally dangerous, conceivably, a supernatural weapon in the wrong hands - though that's never really explained; and we see what happens at the end to the bad guys, who have the Ark. But, before that, at some level, we can imagine there's a risk if it falls into Nazi hands. We suspend belief. And so, a good portion of the movie is the Ark chase. We know why it's important. We understand the prize. There's no question about what the movie is about, and where it's going - possession of the Ark, the US or Germany its destination. Maybe in that it really is clear-cut, like the serials they were copying. It's sort of like a James Bond, some secret agent, with the amplified, domesday, supernatural destructo ray in his car, trying to get back to England and avoid the evil goons of the evil warlord. Cause we can't let them have the weapon. The movie makes sense, even if some of the scenes don't always. There's the urgency that the Ark not fall into the wrong hands. And to that there's no question. What Ark? THAT Ark. You see, the one in the big box. That Ark, right there. We have to put it in our truck, or they'll put it on their truck. Just that simple. And I think something that simple was lost in subsequent Raiders efforts, as well. So, too, for a few reasons you can call it a computer game plot, if you like. But a real computer game plot, as in subsequent efforts, or say in The Phantom Menance, are far less worthy and satisfying and very different than what Lucas and Spielberg achieved in Raiders of the Lost Ark."

The packed laughed at Indy shooting the swordsman, even though we all must have seen it thousands of times between us. This shows the sheer brillance of the film. You can watch it again and again, but it STILL entertains you.<br/><br/>As a friend said when we left the cinema to the strains of John Williams, ""They just don't make films like that"""

","Well, I guess i'm the first person here that doesn't think ""Raiders"" is a classic. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but not as much as you guys do. As someone else here said, ""I couldn't sit through the whole thing."" and that's true, it's hard to sometimes because it does get slow at times. With that aside this is a good movie, not great, just good. You already know the plot. Good story, acting, and a cool theme song. *** out of *****. By the way, don't flame me for this opinion.

"bd74","Null","0","0","17 June 2000"," Let me tell you a story about this movie...
","In the past, I was never able to watch this movie in one sitting.  For some reason this movie seemed boring.  I remember when this movie was playing in theaters, though I didn't get to see it back then. Whenever it aired on tv, I usually just watched the first few minutes of the movie and then I'd stop watching it. Or I'd watch fragments of the movie. But never the entire movie. A few days ago I decided to check out the video and watch this movie--the whole movie, just for the sake of watching it. I wanted to see why this movie is considered so great. It's quite notable that this movie was such a hit at the box office. The fact that this movie made nearly 250 million dollars in the 1981-1982 period says a lot. Back in the early 1980s only about four movies had grossed over 200 million dollars; that was before the time of the box office blockbusters of the late 1980s and the entire 1990s. Well you know what? After watching the entire movie, I enjoyed it, thoroughly. It was not as boring as I originally thought. I guess the reason why this movie thrilled audiences so much back when it was playing in theaters is that there really had not been an action/adventure movie like this one before. This movie's success turned Harrison Ford into a full-fledged movie star. Although this movie was made twenty years ago, it has aged pretty well. The special effects look good, even in this age of computer animation. The action sequences are great. I love it when Marion tells Indiana, ""Till I get back my $5,000 you're going to going to get more than you bargained for. I'm your goddamn partner!""  And needless to say, the score is outstanding. Also, the movie's ending is shocking--and it has been copied in ""The X-Files"" series. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an all-around entertaining movie. It is the perfect movie to watch on a Saturday evening. It is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest movies. It is also definitely one of the greatest movies ever made....though I wish there had not been any sequels/prequels. ****out of ****."

Raiders Of The Lost Ark<br/><br/>
Directed by: Steven Spielberg, 1981<br/><br/>
George Lucas wrote and Steven Spielberg directed. There you go.<br/><br/>
Raiders is a groundbreaking, exhilarating and rugged action-adventure, that literally set a new standard at the time, while it also payed homage to the old time swashbuckling Hollywood movies in grand style.<br/><br/>
Filled with wit throughout, a great story, some unbelievable and awe-inspiring stunt work, a wonderful and inspired cast lead by Harrison Ford, Karen Allen and Paul Freeman, and Raiders is as good as it can possibly get. <br/><br/>From camera work to dialogue, from backdrop use to editing, from coloring to effects, this is truly inspired entertainment.<br/><br/>
Ford totally embodies the role of Indiana Jones with his charming never-say-die attitude, bull-whip and omnipresent fedora hat (he did most of the stunt work himself too), and it is important to state that the movie would have suffered immensely had Ford not been chosen (Tom Selleck was originally cast).<br/><br/>
Also; check out the fluidity and ease with which Spielberg directs. Amazing.<br/><br/>
This is how you do it. If nothing else how about that musical (John Williams as always) score? You will know it when you hear it. Trust me."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","3","8","16 June 2008"," Classic
","Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The world famous archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is hired by the U.S. Government to locate the Ark of the Covenant but unfortunately the search will be a tad bit harder since Hitler also wants the Ark. This was my first time watching this in God knows how many years and while I didn't enjoy it as much as I remembered I still had a good time with it, although I still think Spielberg has made much better films. What I loved most (and this might be cliché) is the amazing throwback to the early serials of the 30's and 40's. It's clear that the screenplay is going for that type of adventure and Spielberg's direction really hits all the right marks as we go on an adventurous ride that takes us from various countries and throws the hero into all sorts of obstacles. There are countless classic scenes here from the running from the huge rock to the gun/sword scene and the wonderful pit of snakes. The screenplay certainly throws just about everything into the mix and having Hitler be the bad guy just adds a lot of pulp fun. I'm really not sure why I didn't love this movie like many others do but I'm going to take a guess and say that the over the top adventure was just a little too much to me. Outside the classic scenes in the film, whenever the movie pauses to do something not involving a stunt, I just found it somewhat boring. I certainly don't mean boring in a bad way but I just kept waiting for the next big stunt. Ford certainly has this character down pat and Karen Allen does a terrific job as his sidekick."

I had in my mind to watch the trilogy in a row and then go to the theater watch the new film. But after seeing this ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" I changed my mind! It's not really my type of movie! I think it really is a classic and a top film for the fans of the genre, but not for me! I just don't appreciate this kind of cinema. Period. So, I won't waste my time (and money) watching the other films.

Mr Ford always appears to be sleepwalking through his roles; somebody please wake him up. Robert Mitchum had a similar style, except Bob had charisma which is missing in Harrison.<br/><br/>Indiana battles Nazis, fights off snakes, makes several great escapes and moves around enough to be awarded frequent flyer miles.

","A brave American archaeologist defies, almost singlehandedly, Nazis, Arabs and a sleazy Canadian in an ongoing pursuit filled with gunshots, explosions and fist fighting in order to bring to the safe hands of the US academia a significant relic of the Hebrews. Apart from the political undertones, there are way too many predictable things happening in this movie as the 'good' guys win over the 'bad'. Seeing this movie at the age of 7 must be exhilarating. Seeing it at the age of 14 must be quite fun. But if you are any older than that, most scenes will seem redundant. I believe that most viewers' ecstasy with this movie stems from their nostalgia to when they first saw it and that's legitimate."

","Favorite Scene : After a serious battle in the bazar Indiana Jones clearly tired and still trying to chase after Marion, a swarm of villains move to reveal a boss like foe. Dressed in black and red with a larger sword this enemy stood out compared to the regular white and tan cloaked swarm. It looks like Indi is about to embark in a intense fight scene, but Indi pulls out a gun shoots him and moves on. Its comical, but also it brought realism to me of how Indi is in control and calm during these fights. I also enjoyed when Indi was terrified of the snake in his lap during the plane scene, a man who is seemly unfazed by everything around him scared to the core of a pet snake, it made the character feel some what human despite what he was going through.<br/><br/>What took me out of the film : When Indi was fist fighting the bulky German man I couldn't believe he didn't get the pulp beaten out of him. Ill take the sword fights and some of the other fighting scenes with a grain of salt, but this seemed too fictional to me.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable, and a need to see movie. A 6/10 due to somewhat unbelievable turn of events of plot and lack of suspense it felt somewhat predictable, but still very entertaining."
"Wuchakk","10","2","5","4 February 2015"," One of the top five action/adventure films ever made
","The biggest blockbuster of 1981, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" introduced the now-iconic Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford. The film is a series of globetrotting adventures as Jones and other characters seek the lost Ark of the Covenant and (gulp) dare to open it.<br/><br/>""Raiders"" ranks with my top five films of all time. Not only is the action/adventure exhilarating from beginning to end, the story's compelling and the characters are interesting. Ford is excellent, of course, but you also get Karen Allen (Miriam), Paul Freeman (Belloq), Ronald Lacey (Major Arnold Toht), Wolf Kahler (Colonel Dietrich), John Rhys-Davies (Sallah) and several more (e.g. Denholm Elliott). Rhys-Davies and Lacey are standout examples of the excellent supporting cast.<br/><br/>Everything about ""Raiders"" magically works and you can tell the incredible effort that was put into making it. While Steven Spielberg directed it, George Lucas & Phillip Kaufman came up with the story and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay. Needless to say, it's significantly better than the three sequels/prequels, as well as the direct-to-video/TV ones. Don't get me wrong, most of the other Indy adventures are worthwhile, but none capture the beginning-to-end magic of the original.<br/><br/>The film was so successful that a hoard of movies clearly borrowed from it in the ensuing decades. Some quite successfully, like 1999's ""The Mummy,"" and others not-so-successfully, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Speaking of the latter film, it has a lot going for it, including the Indiana Jones appeal: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc., but it's all for naught as the plot and characters are merely a clothesline to string together continuous action and F/X sequences. It's all style and ""excitement"" without substance. ""Raiders,"" by contrast – fun as it is – includes an interesting story, character depth and even some fascinating insights. On top of this is the string of action sequences second-to-none: The jungle treasure opening, the Nepal bar brouhaha, the streets of Cairo chase, the Well of Souls in Tanis sequence, the plane episode, the truck sequence, and, of course, the thrilling and horrifying opening of the sacred Ark.<br/><br/>The jungle scenes were shot in Kaua'i; the Cairo/desert scenes in Tunisia; the Nazi submarine base in France; the college scenes in Hertfordshire, England; the D.C. scenes in San Francisco; and other scenes in Stockton, CA, and England.<br/><br/>The film runs 115 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+"

When movies gave you that sense of being there. We left wanting to be Indiana Jones. They don't write them like this anymore. Rather they don't film them like this anymore. This is the epic movie that began the adventure. I don't know if I like Harrison Ford more for Indiana. This movie should be added to a list of must sees for the next generation. I will be showing this to my kids. I hope they appreciate it as much as I do. This is a movie that stands up over time."
"powermandan","10","2","5","15 December 2014"," Cinema's Greatest Hero!
","AFI (The American Film Institute) ranked Indiana Jones the second best hero in film history after Atticus Finch. Why!? Atticus is a lawyer that loses his case! If there was a group of terrorists or evil Nazis, Atticus would last ten seconds at the most, whereas Indiana Jones could, and has, taken them. I know that Atticus is a realistic hero, but he is still a fake creation by author, Harper Lee. Indiana Jones is also a fake creation, but he is more of a hero than anybody else. To Kill A Mockingbird is a great movie, but its got nothing on Raiders. <br/><br/>Laid back archaeology Professor Jones, is summoned to seek The Ark of the Covenant with special powers from the biblical day before the Nazis can find it. He then clads up his leather jacket, satchel, whip and cowboy hat, turning into his alter ego--Indiana Jones--an unbeatable adventurer that defies certain death. <br/><br/>Two things set this apart from the other movies. Number one: everything is iconic. From the ball chasing him to the very end is a series of non-stop memorable moments and dialogue. Number two: the best story. Nothing against the other movies (even though the last one made no sense), but this one has the most complex storyline and subplots. Temple of Doom had the weakest (I like to say ""simplest"") story, but fantastic action and thrills. Last Crusade had a stronger story, but had slightly inferior action and thrills. Raiders does the best in keeping the action, filming, thrills and story in an even proportion. A very, very high proportion. From a story aspect, this is held in high regard. From a technical aspect, this is held in an even higher regard."
"jdslider12","10","2","5","14 December 2014"," A timeless action & adventure flick with a fantastic story, directing and cinematography (for that time)
","Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a memorable action/adventure that is still a hit, almost 25-years later than when it came to our lives. The plot is a competitive quest for the Ark of the Covenant, a real, religious artifact that Indiana Jones endeavors to find. While in competition with Nazi Germany, at that time (late 1930's), Jones goal is to find it, and place it with his friend, a keeper of the local museum. The Nazi's, under rule of Adolf Hitler have their own plans for the Ark – one's that could put the whole world at risk. Yet, with the Nazi's against him, and in pursuit, with many more resources than he has, Indiana Jones has to improvise a lot. A reluctant partnership with his former love, Marion, takes the character development to a new level, as Indy, who is used to watching his own back is forced back into a protector of another – Marion. As Indy later realizes, it's not just his fate that he is protecting/preserving, or even that of Marion, but in fact the whole world.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones, the main character in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) engages the audience in both action and adventure, with tempered violence (in comparison to what's seen today). While serving as a Professor of Archaeology at a university, with many admirers, and in demand, he takes time to explore his passion in searching for truth, evidence, and ancient artifacts that he donates to museum. His journey is often perilous, as evidenced by the opening scene in this movie, and throughout. Indy (Indiana) doesn't back away from a challenge, despite the dangerous obstacles he will likely face. <br/><br/>The theme for this movie (as personally interpreted) is to seek truth, while preserving the past and shaping the future. As Indy (Indiana) is considered a hero in this movie, relating this film to a character such as Superman, may sound extreme, but also appropriate. While both movies have a primary protagonist that is perceived as a hero, but under guise, they also have vulnerabilities which they work hard to hide from those that seek to harm them.<br/><br/>Through a linear series of events enhanced through music, this film follows a suspenseful, surprising, and rhythmic pattern, with twists and turns that keeps people in their seats. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a timeless film that engages in both action and adventure, without all the blood and gore that are commonly found in more current films. Instead, less advanced techniques were used. <br/><br/>Lighting and angles used in this film were used especially well, considering the limited technology of that time. The deliberate use of lighting techniques are most important and noticeable in indoor scenes, including the cave (at the beginning), the well of souls, and at the make-shift arena on a desolate island, at the end. Camera angles were also well used, putting the audience in both the position of close observer of events, and then into the action. Even with less modern techniques, one is sure to experience the effect of their usage. These and other varieties of techniques used in the film served to connect the audience to the story, as well as the characters. This reinforced the theme, both directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) came to life, based on a serial (sort of a comic book), in the 1930's and 40's. Through collaboration of E.T. – the Extraterrestrial director, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (Star Wars), along with some others, it was made into a movie. This began the adventure series, with the primary character as Indiana Jones."

","The movie begins in the jungles of South America- a place full of wonder and mystery (a prime spot for our main character Dr Henry Walton Jones Jr or Indiana as he prefers to be called). We later learn that Indy is a Professor of archaeology but has a far more interesting life outside the office as a daring adventurer. On his journeys he encounters interesting characters such as Belloq and Arnold toht along with his friend Salah and of course his sort of girlfriend Marion and many other evil Nazis.<br/><br/>The practical effects in this movie are superb especially for the 80s- (better than some effects today). These scenes include: the boulder that chases Indy through the deserted tomb, the escape from the underground system and the gruesome yet awesome face melting scene. Other great action scenes that are so iconic include the truck scene where Indy gradually makes his way to the drivers seat and of course the fight by the on coming propeller blades. All so suspenseful and entertaining!<br/><br/>I adore Spielberg and Lucas movies more than any others so its no surprise that this film is one of my all time favourites. Lucas' writing is just wonderful it opens up a new world like in the Star Wars saga. And Spielberg's directing brings it all to life so they obviously make the perfect duo. This is indeed Ford's best performance (he really does suit Indy) and drives the film as the leading role. William's score also makes the film as he does every time without disappointment.<br/><br/>I love this movie as you can tell already I couldn't recommend it enough! I give this film a 9.4/10 can't think of any faults in particular. A awesome movie that will remain one of the best for years to come!"

The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film!

","With all the Broadway versions of spectacles coming out now, I was just wondering how a musical version of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" would go over, music by John Williams (possibly based upon all his involvements with Spielberg) and lyrics, of course, by me... With that said, there is a tongue-in-cheek quality about ""Raiders"" and its follow-ups which has caught my intention and probably many others familiar with the great movie serials of the 1930's and 40's. ""Raiders"", of course, was influenced by that (and possibly some of Universal's old Maria Montez/Sabu movies), and in the summer of 1981, this is the movie that every teenager in America had to see and older audiences went to see with great nostalgia in their hearts because of the memories it brought back for them.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, and nobody else could have done this part quite so well. He takes the role seriously, even though there is a glint of smugness in his eyes that he knows the role he's playing will give him screen immortality. Of course, there are four sides of Indiana-the college professor longing for life outside the classroom, the adventurer who is willing to go anywhere as long as he doesn't run into snakes, the romancer who always seems to end up with the wrong woman, and as we learned in ""The Last Crusade"", the son of Sean Connery who always longed for something greater with his father and finally got it.<br/><br/>This first edition rightly got a ton of Oscar Nominations, including Best Picture, and made a ton of money. Being one of the few Best Picture nominees to actually be a blockbuster, ""Raiders"" takes its viewers on a ride from which they will want to return again and again. The Lost Ark is, of course, the Ark of the Covenant, and therefore, the film has a ton of religious references. Nasty Nazi's (lead by urbane Paul Freeman) are after it, believing it will give Hitler (and thus the Nazi party) divine power. But Indiana, learning the hard way about Nazi evils, is determined to stop them at any cost, even if it means being trapped in tombs with cobras, asps, rattlers and all sorts of poisonous vipers. Oh, did I mention that there were snakes there, too? <br/><br/>His lady friend here is Karen Allen, a tough cookie whose first scene has her punching him out. She's a raspy voiced broad who has seen a thing or two in life and lived to tell about it. She's the type who lives up to ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", and thus, she's a good match for Ford's Indiana. What happened after the plot line was concluded here and the fourth entry (25 years later) was left up to the viewer's imagination. No other woman in between those two films could compare with her.<br/><br/>In addition to Freeman as the Nazi is the very creepy looking Ronald Lacey who is obviously based upon 30's and 40's characters played by Peter Lorre, and his presence is unforgettable. Such memorable character actors as John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott add to the fun of the film, with a young Alfred Molina in a smaller role. Even though he doesn't appear in the film, Spielberg's presence is felt throughout, and when you mention this and some of his other films, you think of him before you think of any of the actors. The special effects are outstanding and the score is so magnificent that it sounds even great in symphonies, such as the one I saw years ago at the Hollywood Bowl conducted by Mr. John Williams himself."
"CinematicInceptions","8","2","5","3 August 2014"," Classic movie with a good story.
","I find that the third movie of this series is the best, but the first is certainly done well too. Indy is well played by Harrison Ford, as is Marion by Karen Allen along with the supporting roles of Sallah and Belloq. The action is good for the time it was made, and the storyline is solid with good characters. The only time the effects and acting were really lacking was in the climatic scene with the spirits within the ark making all of the Nazis bleed to death on the spot. The dialogue flows well throughout as does the general plot. I might have spent less time in the streets of Cairo had I made the movie, but apart from that I don't really have any complaints. This film has the classic spirit of a hero that can overcome almost anything with help. That sort of thing appeals to modern audiences less, but isn't necessarily bad, considering that the lack of that type of hero tends to result in a somewhat annoying 'save the world' type of plot that this movie doesn't have. I like this film better than some other Spielberg movies like Jaws and Jurassic Park because the characters and the movie itself have more personality. The theme by John Williams is pretty good, though I think he sometimes tries to make his songs sound good on their own and not fit the scene and consequently not really come out sounding good on their own. It's good about not letting the religiously historical plot turn it into some kind of morality lecturing movie. The graphics on some of the gore and the sound effects are less than perfect, but that's coming from someone who has had movies with Lord of the Rings quality special effects around his whole life. Still, the explosions are much better than in Independence Day which was made 16 years later. As a whole, the movie is a good classic that I give an 8.2, but would probably be rated better had it been made 30 years later."

It's action packed and exciting and tells you everything you need to know about Indiana Jones within moments, before the main plot kicks in, which focuses on Indy's quest to get hold of the mystical Ark of the covenant before the Nazi's do.<br/><br/>Despite been considered a classic action adventure, there's quite a few long sequences throughout where the action stops. But it never becomes dull because there's always something interesting happening or something visually stunning to look at. But when the action scenes arrive they are exciting and memorable, and are much better executed than any movie made nowadays that rely heavily on CGI. Just pure stunt work and real explosions, and the tone of the movie just has the right amount of seriousness and humour to it, which makes the plot and the action even better. The special effects still hold up after all these years and even if they do look a bit cartoon-like it actually adds to the movie because of it's intentional references to older Hollywood B-movies.<br/><br/>Ford really makes the movie but he has a fine cast to support him. Karen Allen as his love interest Marion, Paul Freeman as his rival Belloq, John Rhys-Davies as his friend Sallah, and of course who can forget one of the most menacing and creepiest villains to appear in a family movie, Ronald Lacey as a Nazi officer.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie is terrific.

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of a perfect movie.<br/><br/>Quite a bold statement I hear you cry, but I'll do my best to quantify it!<br/><br/>Put very simply, this film delivers on everything it promises. The poster and artwork for the movie tell you that it is a 1940s adventure with Nazi villains and a dashing male hero who uses a whip!

","In the 1930s, an American archaeologist and explorer (Harrison Ford) beats the Nazis to a priceless artifact, the magical box containing fragments of the stones on which God wrote his laws.<br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark was commercially very successful, this attempted wrap-up of pre-war Saturday morning serials spends a great deal of money and expertise on frightening rather than exciting us. Second time around, one can better enjoy the ingenious detail of the hero's exploits; still, there are boring bits in between, and the story doesn't make a lot of sense. Yet this was the genesis of the modern action-adventure blockbuster for all the family, and few of its successors have a fraction of its wit, verve or sense of fun. In 1999, the film was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry."
"winner55","7","2","5","13 November 2007"," fun, but not
","This is one of the films that led me, slowly but surely, to loathe the work of George Lucas.<br/><br/>To be sure, it is not a bad film - in fact, it succeeds in generating the same kind of excitement as the B-movie/serial action films of the 1930s, the formula for which it is intended to resurrect. But it is that resurrection itself that annoys me, for two reasons.<br/><br/>First, Although the serials of the '30s were certainly a bit of daffy fun, they were just badly made. In order to enjoy them, one has to 'dumb down' quite a bit. In the early '70s revival of these films on the college circuit, this meant taking drugs before or during viewing. Without inebriates, it means adopting a child's perspective - and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is, why insist on an expensive Hollywood production that requires the same 'dumbing down'? And do so in a manner so as to close off other, more mature approaches to the adventure film format? Secondly, the cultural references of the 1930s action B-movie were all outside of film itself - references to the political crises in Europe, to fears generated in the wake of the depression, to ennobling efforts to maintain American values against threats from within and without, to the rise of organized crime, to a developing technology no one fully understood at the time, and to increasing awareness of the strangeness of non-European cultures. A heady mix, and it's clear why Americans found the B-movie useful in sorting out and coping with so many different issues.<br/><br/>But the cultural references in ""Raiders"" are all to movies of the 1930s. In other words, there is NO world beyond the movie screen for Mr. Lucas. Even the myth of the 'Ark of the Covenant' has more to do with DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" than it does with the Ark as described in the Bible, since it is clearly intended to work magic, which is about as much of religion as DeMille really understood. And let's not even discuss the hopelessly card-board Nazis here.<br/><br/>This 'dumbed down' inversion of cultural reference makes ""Raiders"" feel claustrophobic and regressive more than any other film mining the same ore I can think of. To be sure, Spielberg gives the film a professional gloss and a sense of action Lucas' other films lack. And both Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are truly delightful to watch.<br/><br/>So the film is certainly fun to watch - but it doesn't inspire any greater respect for writer-producer Lucas, one of the true con-men of modern cinema."
"jhaggardjr","10","2","5","24 March 2002"," This is what excitement is all about!
","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is what excitement is all about. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film is a great adventure tale made in the tradition of those old Saturday matinee serials. Harrison Ford put on the fedora for the first of three appearances as Indiana Jones, the archaeologist who has taken us on three great adventures. Here, Dr. Jones goes after the mystical Ark of the Covenant. The action scenes and special effects are spectacular. The film plays like a rollercoaster ride and there's plenty of on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement. Karen Allen, who plays Dr. Jones' love interest Marion, is a great heroine (easily the best of the series). The villains include a French archaelogist (Paul Freeman), who's kind of Dr. Jones' counterpart; and some really nasty Nazis. This movie is as good as it gets. Great direction by Spielberg, who collaborated with ""Star Wars"" creator (and good friend) George Lucas to create a brilliant movie series. The second movie ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" followed in 1984, and that was followed by the third movie ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" in 1989. All three movies are excellent, but ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the best. <br/><br/>**** (out of four)"
"timkretschmer","5","4","14","16 February 2007"," The first step on the way to a really good Idiana Jones movie!
","Why do I think the third Indiana Jones is far more better and thus deserves to be voted better than the first one does: 1.) It has the right humor. Indy is not so dogged like in the first one. 2.) It features a beautiful woman, not a strange and manlike wannabe beauty like ""Raiders"" does. 3.) It features a sophisticated screenplay with character development and supporting subplots. 4.) It shows us more of the great location where it is staged on. 5.) It features better actors like Sean Connery is. So, to make my point as clear as possible: ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lacks exactly these five points. - In spite of this, it is a good movie and, after all, the one in which the basic idea of Indiana Jones is introduced. But if you can only see one Indiana Jones, than please do yourself a favor and choose the ""Last Crusade"""

The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well.

Often there was no rational explanations for his actions which made the film uninteresting.

"CherryBlossomBoy","6","2","6","9 April 2017"," Echos of the Lost Cast
","The film that captured the imagination of entire generations aged rather well and is still a decent watch but some parts have rotten away like bad cheese. What still stands are the lush, romanticized depiction of the pre-WWII period, the camera-work and the music. And Karen Allen's brazen quirkiness.<br/><br/>More obvious now than before is that Tom Selleck's stand-in, Harrison Ford, proved an unsuitable lead. He brings in a rather difficult chemistry for the film that is supposed to be a goofball, roller-coaster adventure. Ford is clunky, suffering and reluctant, bordering on depression. There is a conspicuous lack of joy about his Indiana Jones that shouldn't be there, because it's at odds with everything else in the film. His comebacks at other characters come off as angry snaps rather than comic relieves. He doesn't possess that devil-may-care attitude that would convince the viewer that his character actually likes all these adventures, nor does he exude that suave, Bondian eroticism that should sell that scene where all of his female students want to eat the good professor alive. The audience must have given him a pass simply because everybody still saw a Han Solo in him.<br/><br/>The lack of a lead that is neither too serious to expose the silly nor too hammingly humorous to drag everything into a camp is what the whole film suffers for. It's because the plot itself treads the fine line between awesome and idiotic. It mixes top-class religious artifacts and magical powers with Nazis and harebrained schemes of world domination, cartoon action with sadistic villains and their gruesome deaths, some really terrible lines of dialog with some really good one-liners, and a bungling detective story with a truly awe-inspiring and larger-than- life finale. Without the poster face that could make you forget that this mishmash of ideas, that only George Lucas could churn out, doesn't quite hold water it's easier to be taken out of the film by some of its lowest points.<br/><br/>What keeps it together still is the brilliant direction of Steven Spielberg. His visual style was at that fledgling time of his career pretty flamboyant, with daring but perfunctory choice of angles, camera movements and compositions, which lent itself to great pacing - moving quickly through the plot points and keeping the tension in the set-pieces with the idea that no one notices how ridiculous they are. He builds up very well towards the climactic end and the revelation of the real hero of the film: the mythical Ark. Its matter-of-fact act of self-defense is a big pay-off so few films achieve these days. It's doubtful that a conventional director, however competent, would have been able to deliver anything better than a B-schlock with the given material.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford made a career playing gloomy characters that got stuck in unpleasant situations and just wanted to leave. He should have been nowhere near this film. Steven Spielberg is a genius for making this work at all, let alone gain a cult-status, of all things."

In particular, Jones, the seemingly weak hero, has repeatedly saved the day with his wit and courage, which makes it a charming halo.

","Review:
'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.
When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime.
It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time.
The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in.
It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience.
Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.

","Indiana Jones is possibly my favourite action/adventure movies and one of my top 50 movies of all time, not just because it's by Spielberg and I just love every single one of his films, this is a legit cult classic and Spielberg has a true stroke of genius.<br/><br/>Back in the 70's, 80's and 90's this Spielberg guy couldn't stop making great films, of course Scorsese's still my favourite director but Spielberg was hitting all the high notes at the box office, he had one of the greatest composers (John Williams) working for him and he work with lots of talented people. This is the last time I will talk about this, but the only reasons I prefer Scorsese is that<br/><br/>1. He doesn't need a big budget to make a fantastic film
2. Darker storytelling and hilarious black comedy
3. He still makes great films to this day
4. He has never made a BAD movie<br/><br/>With saying that, this movie is one of my favourites, our first scene to the film is possibly the most famous scene of all time! Indiana Jones entering the cave and him making it just in time, grabbing his hat putting it back on and keeps running, this scene within itself is already a movie. Spielberg directed one of the most stunning movies and one of my favourite musical scores, John Williams is the greatest composer working today and one of the greatest ever! Normally, in Spielberg's films the musical scores interrupt how great the film is and just keeps going throughout the entire movie, but this one doesn't feel like it is overstaying its' welcome. There is nothing to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, it's one of the most entertaining, kick-ass, huge budget awesomeness (in which category Spielberg really succeeds in). Grade: A+"
"miraiinaoka","9","1","2","22 June 2019"," Seemingly endless supply of adventure!
","An oldie but a classic nonetheless! The score went perfectly well with the intense action that was going on for most of the movie, and the other sound effects were phenomenal as well, a typical Steven Spielberg feat. All of the actors played their part well, specifically the scene with the high speed chase through the desert where the Nazis were shook off the truck one by one by Jones' doing."

When I saw it as a child I fell in love with it. Little bit of classic belief ( X marks the spot). the times when it scary in terms of the skeletons did do their job but thought they weren't enough to give people nightmares (personal opinion, could be incredibly wrong) just a piece of advice if your scared of snakes this might be a film that you might think about avoiding.<br/><br/>One of Harrison Ford's best performances easily on par with his Han Solo performance."
"krishshautriya","10","1","2","14 March 2019"," Spielberg at his best!!!
","In my opinion, there are only a handful movies which are perfect. This is one of them.
Harrison Ford plays the coolest archeologist in cinematic history, who is searching for the lost ark of the covenant, and he has to get it before the Nazis.
This movie is great for a lot of reasons. The action is one of the best ever filmed. There is no shaky cam, and the stunts in this movie are some of the best stunts performed on screen. Especially, a stunt towards the end of the film where Indy is dragged behind a truck. Kudos to Harrison Ford and Vic Armstrong for risking their lives for our entertainment.
Secondly, the acting, even from secondary characters is great. All the characters, be it Marion or Sallah are memorable. Also, this is a movie where all the jokes land.
Lastly, the music. The music composed by John Williams in this movie is one of the best music of all time.
This movie is one of the best movies ever made. It is right up there with Die Hard and The Dark Knight and T2 - judgement day.
Definitely check this one out."

","If the concept of adventure were a man, his name would be Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), and that's what this film is, its an adventure plain and simple. Ford fully encapsulates the idea of the action hero without descending into either the muscle bound strongman or the camp geek traps. Raiders of the Lost Ark plays like an adventure serial condensed into a single narrative, combining elements of Western action with an archaeological edge that would make games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted popular in the 90s and 00s. But what makes this movie work is the comic satire surrounding Ford's character, as though the film is making fun of itself as it goes along, and its that style of cinematic comedy which makes it one of the most watchable action adventures of all time."

","I re-watched Raiders a couple of months ago and, 30 something years after its release, I can find no real flaws.<br/><br/>Rewatching Raiders this time I did notice a lot of Spielberg style similarities from movie to movie. For example, the scene where Indie chases the caravan of military vehicles reminded me of the look of Duel, Spielberg's first movie. And the way the faces melted and the way the ghosts and skeletons were animated, that was similar to Poltergeist, which Spielberg wrote. But just because he re-purposed techniques doesn't make Raiders of the Lost Ark any less grand.<br/><br/>Raiders is as American a movie as you can get. With a swarthy hero, a loud mouth dame, and a whole lotta double cross. Remind you of any other movie about an artifact? Maybe with 'Maltese' in the title?<br/><br/>Sure it's not 100% original and sure the effects are a bit dated but you could watch it right now and be entertained all the way through.

"Spoffdarko","10","1","2","18 July 2018"," Still to be beaten.
","In the action/ adventure genre I believe Raiders of the Lost Ark is the yardstick by which all other films should be measured.<br/><br/>There simply was not an action/ adventure film made before this which is as good, and there has not been one since (although the sequels came close).<br/><br/>Everything here works, there is nothing wasted. Nothing to bloat the film and make it boring, nothing to slow down the pace and nothing unnecessary. RotLA cracks along at a good pace, but occasionally gives the viewer time to breathe before we are off again on another leg of the adventure. <br/><br/>This is action movie making at it's very best, the cast, direction, cinematography, score, locations, story, everything is just perfect. Everyone involved in making RotLA brought their ""A-game"" to the table, and it shows. <br/><br/>RotLA is such an evocative film, from the opening jungle scene, to the Cairo markets, to the outline of Indy against the sunset as they dig for the Well of Souls, to the final ""storage room"" scene. The images Spielberg created here are masterful, the score by John williams complementing them perfectly. The action is pure edge-of-your-seat stuff, and there are a good few laughs thrown in too.<br/><br/>I was around 6 or so when I first ever saw it and I was blown away. I am still blown away every time when I watch it now (I am now 41). <br/><br/>A modern classic in every sense of the word, one that is far superior to the mindless cookie-cutter tripe that is churned out pretty much every week in cinemas 37 years later. <br/><br/>It really fascinates me how people can say that Raiders is for ""kids with no brain"" and give it a poor rating. These are probably the same people who turn up at the multiplex each month to see the next Marvel film, which is just the same as the last Marvel film, but with a slightly different character.<br/><br/>Nothing else to say really, if you haven't seen Raiders then see it. <br/><br/>You can thank me later!"

","I remember watching this film in 1996 as part of a school project. We get an adventurer, his mission to find a biblical artifact, and the Third Reich at his heels. It's basically a throwback to the 1920s and 1930s adventure serials that told the sagas of service members battling German soldiers around the world. And that's what you get here. Harrison Ford was great for the role, and now that I'm older I like this film role of his better than Han Solo and all the others. I also like Indiana Jones better than I like James Bond. The women aren't too cliched as damsels in distress and Karen Allen does justice in this film as the streetwise love interest of the main hero. And those locations; what a way to go! From South America to an island in the Mediterranean. After watching my dad's VHS tapes, I became a fan. This is my second-favorite Indy film (after Last Crusade)."

Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) is a great adventure, romance, and 80's film that has remained an icon ever since its initial release. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford does it again, first with Han Solo, and now with Indiana Jones. His charismatic presence and tough charm solidify him as a relatable yet spectacular hero that you cant help but fall in love with. <br/><br/>The score and soundtrack are also breathtaking, putting you right next to Indy on his many wild adventures for holy and ancient artifacts.

"moshomaniac","10","1","2","28 January 2018"," Raiders of the Lost Ark: A tribute to the film serials of the 1940s, and one of the all-time greatest movies
","In writing this review, I'll say at the very beginning, I love this movie. It reigns supreme as my all-time favorite. Conceived by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, this movie, released in June of 1981(a month before I was born) was an instant box-office smash, giving birth to Indiana Jones, played to perfection by Harrison Ford, coming off his success from Star Wars(1977) and Empire Strikes Back(1980). The film captures the spirit of the Saturday Matinee with an absolute brilliance. It action-packed, it's funny, it has fantastic visuals, great acting all around, it is a winner in every regard. Released 3 years prior to the PG-13 rating, the film does contain some scenes of fairly intense gore and blood (which would probably warrant a PG-13 today), but I think that a mature 11 year old can probably handle it. I also must mention the score, done by John Williams, the ""Raiders March"" is quite possibly the most exciting and invigorating score I've ever heard, instantly establishing the film's adventurous tone, and the theme for the ark of the covenant is mysterious and wrought with intrigue. Its interesting also to note that the submarine from 1981's DAS BOOT(directed by Wolfgang Peterson of The Never-ending Story) was rented for one scene. Indiana Jones became of the most recognizable characters of the 1980s, and the original fedora was donated to the Smithsonian. Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of Steven Spielberg's best films, and a great American classic that no video collection should be without. 3 sequels followed: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom(1984); Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989); and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull(2008); but none truly captured the spirit of the Saturday Matinee more than this essential classic. What more can be said except, if you haven't seen this, check it out!"

"zkonedog","9","1","2","25 February 2017"," The Standard For Action/Adventure
","I've probably seen ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" as many times as any other movie I've ever watched in my life. Each year or two from age 12 or so now to age 31, I've sat down and enjoyed this film. The amazing thing about it? It never seems to get old!<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Raiders"" sees archaeology professor Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) getting a tip that the Nazis are digging at the supposed place of the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. Armed with his trusty whip, adventurer's cap, leather jacket, and journal of clues, Indy rushes to Cairo for perhaps the greatest ""find"" of his life. Along the way, he meets up with old flame Marion (Karen Allen), as well as getting himself both in and out of numerous dramatic scrapes.<br/><br/>Almost without a doubt, ""Raiders"" set the standard to which action/adventure movies are now held. The music is eternal, the scale is large, and the action is always moving ahead despite still being able to support interesting characters/dialogue. Only helping matters is the fact that Ford is perfectly cast as Indy, creating what is at least in the conversation for most iconic film role of all-time. From the very first time you see Indy, you know that this guy is an adventurer through and through. It's tough to have such a visceral connection to a character without any background, but director Steven Spielberg makes it seem effortless.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about why ""Raiders"" is such a great film (both technically and culturally), but I'll suffice it to say that some 36 years after its initial theatrical release it still remains not only a classic in the ""stuffy"" sense, but also a movie that new viewers of today can appreciate just as much. People 36 years from now will be saying the same things...I'm sure of it!"

We went on a rafting trip on the Snake River, saw the geysers in Yellowstone and other fun interesting things.<br/><br/>One night we went out to dinner then went to an old movie theater in Jackson Hole to see Raiders. What a great movie for a 13 year old boy, full of action, great storytelling, and at the time state of the art special effects. I wanted to be INDY.<br/><br/>Now i am middle aged, my father has passed away. If I would see this movie today for the first time I probably give it an 8. Still a great score. But for me every time I watch it, I can become that 13 year old boy in Jackson Hole WY.<br/><br/>Great movies bring out emotion. It is what makes them great. For me Raiders brings me back to a better time when life was pure and simple and my father was still alive. Pure emotion.<br/><br/>Why this movie will always be a 10of10 for me.

"moviemattb","10","1","2","3 May 2016"," Happy 35th Anniversary To One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Of All Time!
","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is my second favorite movie next to ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,"" and it is also, in my opinion, my absolute favorite movie by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg teams up with George Lucas after his success with ""Star Wars"" as both of the greatest filmmakers had set out to pay homage to the old serials of the 1930s. The movie is about an archaeologist and professor name, Indiana Jones as he goes on an adventure to search for the Ark of the Covenant with the help of the love of his life Marion Ravenwood. However, Indy's rival Rene Belloq has been working with the Nazis as they both go after the Ark, and it is up to Indy to retrieve the Ark before its too late. It has been 35 years, since this movie came out back in 1981 and it still is my favorite of the series. The series itself may have pay respect to the ""James Bond"" movies, but they also pay tributes to the old serials of the 1930s until the fourth one pays tribute of the 1950s sci-fi B movies. With that said, whenever I watch this movie, it never feels dated nor is it cheesy. Like the ""Star Wars"" series, you will always feel the experience as you go on for the ride as the ""Indiana Jones"" series explore exotic locations and search for artifacts. By getting to the point, Harrison Ford is definitely Indiana Jones as he is as Han Solo. He does a brilliant job with the role as his character is someone that you don't want to mess with because he is rough, cool and is always amazed when he is discovering artifacts. Of course, he is always into as I quote from the second movie ""Fortune and Glory."" Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is my favorite of all the girls that Indy has met in his life. Not only is she beautiful, but she can be also feisty too. Sometimes she be a damsel in distress, but she never whines and complain like Willie Scott did in the second movie. Her character is pretty complex as you learn about her as she and Indy did had some history together as she had romantic affair with him. Paul Freeman as Belloq is a really good villain, and quite a rivalry to Indy as they are always after the same artifact as they're trying to retrieve. The rest of the cast all did well. Steven Spielberg does an amazing job on directing the movie with George Lucas coming up with this brilliant concept that he had created. Lawrence Kasdan has wrote a brilliant script, and the story itself always kept me investing as well as the characters. The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic are absolutely fantastic for its used of practical effects, matte paintings and miniature work. John Williams' music is completely unforgettable, and there is no denying that the theme he created would be as iconic as the ""Star Wars"" theme. The action scenes are very well done as well as the physical work that were put on camera. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is also wonderful as I do get a sense of the 1930s, which it does put me in the right atmosphere. The humor is done well, for example, Indy has an Arab Swordsman in his way as you think there is going to be fight between them, instead Indy just shoots him because he has no time for that. The movie is also very well putted together, and it does go by at a very good pace. I never see any flaws with this movie, because this movie is definitely flawless, and it will always be either one of the greatest or the greatest adventure films of all time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a classic adventure film, and I am giving it a 10 out of 10."

The Ark of the covenant but he must contend with Adolph Hitlers men and a Frenchman who is as ruthless and cold blooded as Hitler himself but the question is. What menacing power does the Ark behold and how dangerous is it to anyone who dares to open it. This was and still is 1 of my all time favourites<br/><br/>This is a movie to be remembered that has all the elements and originality of a truly great movie. It has it all if you haven't seen it. Get your popcorn and expect something that will grip you, make you laugh and scare the hell out of you too. A must see."
"nmholland","10","1","2","10 March 2016"," One of the Best Films Ever Made, Inspired the Action Genre
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, a brave adventurer who just so happens to be in a race against the Nazis to uncover the Ark of the Covenant, an item that comes straight from the Bible. Indy must gather friends in order to beat enemies, and overcome his foes against all odds, to prevent them from parading the Ark around as a weapon.<br/><br/>Raiders is one of Spielberg's first big films, behind Jaws (1975), and he nailed it. This film is loved by children and adults alike, and will never be forgotten. He brought terror like never seen before to the big screen with Jaws, and with Raiders he created, as well as popularized, a new genre of film: action. This movie has inspired many action films, such as Die Hard (1988), The Matrix (1999), or even T2: Judgement Day (1991). Thanks to this movie, we get to see action movies regularly, whether they're good or bad.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is of course one of the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones. It's crazy that this movie came out 35 years ago, and one can still pick up an Indiana Jones figure at your nearby Walmart. Harrison Ford does amazing as Indy, showing that audience that he can play more that just one awesome character. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is also a good casting choice, and Marion is still my favorite Indy love interest today.<br/><br/>The direction Spielberg handled this movie in is amazing. All of the action is filmed so nicely, with not too many cuts, and clean transition when there are some. The best part of this film, the truck scene, is filmed absolutely perfectly, with no disturbances whatsoever, thanks to the fantastic camera work. This nicely shot action is also due to Harrison Ford doing his own stunts. Unlike most actor working today, save for Tom Cruise, Ford did all of his own stunts, assuring that Spielberg could get close ups of his face during the action scenes. These two elements combined make for some white knuckled action, very abundant throughout Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>The last thing I'll say about Raiders is the villain. There's an old saying that goes, ""a movie's only as good as its villain."" Although the viewer doesn't receive much backstory about the villain, he's still very intimidating, thanks to his army of Germans doing his dirty work for him. Paul Freeman's Belloq is a great character, that supposedly goes a long way back with Indy, however this is all we really know about him. Even though the audience doesn't know much about his background, he's still fleshed out as a character, and his tension with Indy is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is easily one of the best films ever made, thanks to its acting, villain, and incredible action. I'm going to give Raiders of the Lost Ark an A+, or a 10 out of 10."

It's almost impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>Of course in this one he was a great adversary in Paul Freeman's Belloq, something which none of the succeeding Indy adventures have quite managed to repeat. Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies are great too as Indy's sidekicks, though that is totally the wrong word. They contribute massively to the viewer's enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The plot is too well known to repeat - suffice to say it's Indy against The Nazis in a race to find The Ark Of The Covenant, the chest alleged to contain the Ten Commandments (an idea Phil Kaufman apparently got from his dentist!) Sequence after sequence sticks in the mind, but the truck chase for me is one of the most exciting set pieces in cinema history. Spielberg and Lucas, what a team they once made."

","Really loved this film. Harrison Ford amazing ""We went on an adventure to make an adventure,"" Spielberg said in 2013 and part of the enduring appeal of the film – which was followed by 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – is the appeal of the charismatic hero figure. Jones is a brave and humorous hero but is allowed to show weakness and be afraid, making the character real. Who can forget the line: ""Snakes. Why'd it have to be snakes?"", as he drops a torch into the Well of Souls, revealing a floor crawling with thousands of the poisonous creatures."

","What do you get with Steven Spielberg behind the camera, George Lucas serving as the creator and executive producer, Harrison Ford as the lead along with great score, story, humor,romance,supporting actors and a iconic opening scene? You get Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>With Harrison Ford riding on his success after starring in the hit space opera Star Wars, he was Lucas' first choice for the titular role.Little did the public know something big was coming.<br/><br/>After the release, people were dazzled by the film's uniqueness and the unforgettable visual effects. Harrison Ford became every girl's crush just like the ones in the film.Spielberg had just made one of the greatest action films of all time.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1936 with Indy after a golden idol worshiped by the tribal people in Peru.He's accompanied by a young Spanish man named Satipo, portrayed by a young Alfred Molina. What follows is a iconic opening to remember.<br/><br/>Back in America after returning, Indy is approached by government officials to stop the Nazis from obtaining the Ark of the Covenant and thus do the former before them.<br/><br/>Indy then travels from Tibet after approaching love interest Marion portrayed by Karen Allen in humorous fashion to Cairo where the film's best moments occur.From memorable and hilarious Sallah to the iconic fight with the Arabs, Cairo remains the film's best location.<br/><br/>After encounters with nemesis Belloq and the Nazis and a high octane car chase,the film enters its iconic and nail-biting climax.The climax is a really good one and avoids being disappointing.<br/><br/>Also,the negative characters are really good, with Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq in a quite a funky performance and Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, who was perhaps the most hated character in the movie.He was someone I loved to hate.<br/><br/>Overall, Indiana Jones and The Raiders if The Lost Ark is a marvelous film with iconic action, stellar performances, visual effects, memorable action scenes,humor and not to forget the iconic score.It has a certain charm which isn't present in the later installments,even in the almost-superior The Last Crusade.It is one of those rare movies you wish you could watch for the first time again.It's just that good."

","This movie is a masterwork in so many different ways, from the acting to directing and writing to the entertainment value. Harrison Ford is perfectas Indiana Jones to the point where I can't see anyone else in the role. All the other acting is great, especially Karen Allen as Marion and Paul Freeman as Belloq. The snappy and clever writing by Lawrence Kasdan and the all-around amazing directing by Steven Spielberg are amazing and are perfect for this movie. The action is exciting and very frightening in some places. The movie has an incredible flow and also does a great job at introducing Indiana Jones as a character and at the same time also is a masterwork as a fun movie you can watch on a Friday night.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is the definition of what a great movie is, everything in this movie is simply incredible. John Williams, as always gives one of the best scores ever made for the screen, the directing, writing, acting and everything in this movie is simply masterful. The ending is amazing and Raiders of the Lost Ark is still a movie I can watch anytime and still be entertained and awe-inspired by. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of movies, and that's really all I have to say. Thank you."
"willcundallreview","8","1","2","5 August 2015"," A very good start to a very good series of movies
","Raiders of the Lost Ark, a start to a massive franchise of movies and one of the most consistently liked movies ever. With big action, sly humour and of course top acting from Harrison Ford, it is hard not to dislike this movie and it's many qualities. That all said I do still feel this is slightly overrated, not in a way where I think it is bad and others good, only that I feel it is not the most perfect film ever.<br/><br/>As said Harrison Ford is our star man playing well Indiana Jones, he makes the archaeologist look like an action man and also can have a few laughs too, just don't involve snakes. As for the rest of the cast well it kind of splits, Karen Allen I wasn't so sure on, she isn't bad but I just couldn't believe her well enough. Actors such as Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davis and Ronald Lacey make it even more fun and also sinister, the film knows how to get the right balance of good and evil.<br/><br/>As for the man directing the whole thing, Steven Spielberg, well for me he does a good job but not a great job, he is consistent but I didn't think it was overly awesome. And now for what I consider this movies biggest flaw, the script. It is just not that good and although fans of the movies will say that it is what makes this so good, I can only disagree as I feel the whole story from George Lucas is the best thing, not the screenplay from Lawrence Kasdan. And on that, the story, and what a gem of a plot we have here, unravels nicely but never gets too slow, the action is well timed and the comedy in-between is unique.<br/><br/>With the script maybe being my only problem, then the score is just a little chip in the whole work, a kind of slight inconvenience(at times). I have never heard a score that is so good but then suddenly so annoying, when the action comes around I dislike it, but when the others scenes that have John Williams score in come, they are good, it is quite strange. I must also add here in terms of technical things, the locations and sets are stunning, well designed but not too corny either, a big well done to the team on that one and also to the cinematography from Douglas Slocombe who's skill this movie owes a lot to as well.<br/><br/>Listen this film may be flawless and I might be missing something, or maybe my review just seems a little too mean. The movie is very entertaining don't get me wrong and I would re-watch this many times but I just feel I am among the minority who don't think this is that that great, even though I think it is great even. Nevertheless this is the kind of film anyone can enjoy, any age, any film genre fan, all can have fun watching this legendary piece of cinema. On that previous point, some viewers may get scared by the numerous fake dead bodies, so always remember that before you have nightmares.<br/><br/>One thing I often see about this film is people saying it is the first of it's kind, and I agree it is but another point to make on that is that, when you set a benchmark for film like this, your movie although the first of it's kind, must also try to be the best of all that follow it. Basically what I'm trying to say is, don't watch this like your still whatever age you were when it first came out, I mean for newer fans they have many adventure film for this to compare to, and I find that it is Spielberg, Lucas and Phil Kaufman's(who helped with the whole story and script) job to make this one of the best even in the future."

"EzioMonty117","10","1","2","17 July 2015"," A film so good, it's the film that refined the action-adventure genre
","First thing to say, i love the Indiana Jones Movies, but the first movie is always my favorite. Everything the film has to offer is outstanding: Action, comedy, romance, history and suspense. So to start my review on the entire series. Let's get started.<br/><br/>The film starts With Indy and a thief Satipo finding the Golden Idol in South America, when Indy finds the Golden Idol, a massive Boulder appears, Satipo betrays Indy, then one shot later he dies. The Boulder chases Indy out of the Cave, then he meets with his Arch-rival Rene Belloq, that he tells Jones to give him the Idol, he does then he orders the Group of half-naked people to chase down Indy, Indy luckily Escapes and comes to Jock's plane. In the plane, he finds a snake, and says to Jock ""Snakes, i hate snakes"". A few days later, he's back as a teacher talking about history to the students, after that, Marcus Brody tells Indy to find the Ark of the Covenant. He starts his quest by finding Marion Ravenwood, Indy comes in to the cabin and Marion is not happy to see him, because she didn't see Indy in a while. She slaps him and she tells him to come back tomorrow. Three Seconds later, she comes across the evil Gestapo Nazi Agent Arnold Ernst Toht, his first line is ""Good Evening Fräulein"". He tries to torture Marion by burning her with the Medallion she has, Toht fails and Indy comes to save Marion. Then a fight scene comes and Toht tries to take the Medallion, but since it is burned, his hand gets burned and Marion and Indy escapes to Cairo.<br/><br/>When arriving at Cairo, Indy meets his companion Sallah and tells him about the Ark and that Belloq and the Nazi's are after it. Later, when Indy and Marion walks across town, they meet a Nazi, then the Nazi steals Marion and Indy tries to find her. After like 3 minutes of finding, he comes across a Swordsman, luckily Indy shoots the guy and the crowd is happy. Indy finds a basket case where Marion is captured. The Nazi puts Marion inside a truck, then Indy spots a truck and the truck explodes, Indy thought that was the truck Marion was in. Later Indy meets Belloq...again and Belloq tells Indy that he's the one that's opening the Ark not Indy, Indy tries to kill Belloq but fails but he luckily got helped by Sallah's kids. Indy and Sallah talks about them two searching for the Ark of the Covenant together. Later they come to where the Nazi's work, Indy and Sallah works together, Indy goes Down to a hidden Place to solve a puzzle where he has to find where the Ark is located. He knows where it is. Belloq and a person finds Company, which is Toht, he shows his burned hand and says ""Heil Hitler"".<br/><br/>Indy, Sallah and many others are digging in the spot where the Ark of the Covenant is. They find the area where the Ark is, but it's surrounded by snakes so Indy and Sallah must be careful, they manage to get past the snakes and takes the Ark of the Covenant. This time, Belloq comes and gives Marion something to eat. They drink vodka and gets drunk. Marion tries to Escape with her new dress, but she gets caught by Toht. Toht says his final English Words ""So, what shall we talk about"". Later, Belloq and the Nazi's discovers the People digging for the Ark. When Indy tries to get the Ark up from the area, they get caught by the Nazi's, the Nazi's take the Ark and Marion comes with Indy down the Area. When stuck down the area, Indy finds a way out by smashing a wall with a statue and they escape the area. Indy Chases the Nazi's in this 7-minute scene. Indy rides a horse, drives a truck and defeats a bunch of bad guys. After a long Chase, the Nazi's won't get away. Indy is on a boat to come away from the Nazi's. A day later, the Nazi's have located a boat with Indy on it. Indy tries to Escape and fight the Nazi's one more time to save a captured Marion. Later the boat comes to a small island. There Indy finds the Nazi's and Marion. Indy dresses up as a Nazi so he doesn't get caught. The Nazi's are seen walking with the Ark to the Place to open the ark, but shortly after, Indy is seen holding a bazooka trying to shoot the Nazi's. Belloq says to Indy that he can shoot the Ark, but he declines and gets captured and stuck on a pole.<br/><br/>The Nazi's are prepared to open the Ark, Belloq dressed as a priest opens the Ark along with Toht and a German Nazi Dietrich. When they open the Ark of the Covenant. Spirits come flying by, and the final Words said by Belloq is ""It's beautiful"" A ghost comes to Toht, where the ghost has a pretty face then the Next split-second turns to death. The others Nazi's dies by Lightning, Dietrich's face shrivels up, Toht's face melts and Belloq's face explodes on-screen. The ghosts go back in the Ark and Marion and Indy are free. One moral: Don't mess with God. Indy returns the Ark to Brody, they said that the Ark is not going to the museum, but in a Warehouse owned by top men.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best films i've ever seen. The film's humour, action sequences, acting, practical effects, villains, characters, script, fight scenes, cinematography, directing, Opening sequence and the Whole film is outstanding. No cons at all. This film is recommended for anyone, please note that this film has a few scary scenes, so if children can handle the melting scene, kids can watch it too"
"ofpsmith","10","1","2","14 July 2015"," The classic action flick.
","Indiana Jones. One of the most famous and timeless action film series of all time. I love them! Okay I love 2 of them. But either way Indiana Jones is still a timeless classic. And Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite of them. In 1936 Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones (Harrison Ford) is an archaeologist who is recruited by the US Government to find and protect the ark of the covenant before Nazis do. The Nazis are led by Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). Along the way Indiana is helped by his old girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and his buddy Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). With a great story, fun action scenes, and great characters this is one of my all time favorite movies. Number 14 to be exact. If you haven't seen it, go do that right now."
"vishaal811","10","1","2","3 July 2015"," The Quintessential Action-Adventure Movie!!
","This is one of the most influential and exciting movies that has ever been made. There are a number of classic scenes in this thrilling, including the boulder that chases Indiana, the fight on top of a bus and another classic scene that I will not reveal in this review as it will reduce the impact of that scene. <br/><br/>Raiders of The Lost Ark focuses on Indiana Jones who is an archaeologist professor in a college and is also an avid explorer of historical artifacts. The Lost Ark is of great significance and its discovery is something that the Nazis are after as a gift to the Fuhrer. Indiana Jones and his team embark upon a mission to locate this ark and return it to America where its hidden secrets might be uncovered.<br/><br/>As the movie focuses on the plot, the acting is not something that is given much focus. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones who is a cool, charismatic guy who has a way of overcoming any obstacle that comes in his way. <br/><br/>The movie is one that must not be missed due to the brilliant direction, tight editing and spectacularly filmed action sequences. A must watch for all."
"anaconda-40658","10","1","2","30 June 2015"," Harrison Ford Raids the Ark!
","Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies: A masterpiece in craftsmanship and skill by a director who delivers adventure like no other. It regards intrusion into the realms of evil and the dangers in fleeing it. Set in 1930's, archaeologist Indiana Jones is sent by the United States government to locate the Ark of the covenant before it falls under Nazi possession. He seeks out a past girlfriend who possesses a key element needed. Tremendous film filled with adventure, romance, suspense, massive chase sequences, a pit of snakes, and an opening where Jones flees from a large rock. This film contains more excitement and energy within its first ten minutes than most films of its nature. Director Steven Spielberg delivers in all its comic book glory. Harrison Ford plays Jones with wit and humour while Karen Allen plays the gutsy Marion Ravenwood. Strong supporting work by Paul Freeman as the villain Rene Belloq out to possess the Ark and ultimately pays the price for his greed. Ronald Lacey steals scenes as the sinister Major Arnold Toht who attempts interrogation on Ravenwood until ultimately reaching the same fate as Belloq. John Rhys-Davies plays a digger hired by the Nazis but he is also an old acquaintance of Jones and therefore assists him. An exciting film about history and adventure. Score: 10 / 10"

","For the past few years I wondered if this film was as thrilling as people made it out to be, and to be honest, the only reason why I watched it is because I love the ride at Universal Studios. Yes I know, go ahead and laugh. Fortunately, I finally took the time to watch Indiana Jones do what he does best and I came to my conclusion. Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the standard for action-adventure movies. The action scenes are astounding and the music adds intensity to every moment. Great acting, beautiful settings, and a solid story-line also help make this a timeless, epic film. I truly wish I had seen this movie sooner. The fun in this film is guaranteed to bring out your inner child. My suggestion, get the popcorn and snacks ready, and watch this on the biggest screen you can find!"
"estebangonzalez10","10","1","2","15 June 2015"," It's not the years honey, it's the mileage!
","""It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.""<br/><br/>So I'm continuing to write these short reviews for some of my favorite films which I've never had a chance to comment on. It's about time I give Steven Spielberg some love for one of the earliest films I have the memory of seeing. I don't know how old I was when I first watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, but if my memory isn't playing a trick on me I have to say this is the first movie I actually fell in love with (perhaps it has to do with the fact that it was released on my birth year). Raiders, First Blood, The Goonies, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future, the Star Wars trilogy, and ET (I'm not including animated films) are the films that made an impact on me during my childhood; and either I watched them on repeat or the images have simply stuck in my memory. The opening scene where we are introduced to Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as he is trying to steal a golden idol from a cave deep in the Peruvian jungle has always fascinated me. He's forced to escape when he's crossed by Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the traps go off as we are introduced to the adventurous tone of the film accompanied with the fascinating score by John Williams that has changed the fast-paced blockbuster genre forever. That is all we needed to be introduced to such a fascinating character. As a young boy I imagine I'd easily get distracted by a feature film, but all it took were those opening minutes for me to be hooked to the TV screen for its entire runtime. What followed was one action-packed adventure after another like the scene where Indy faces off a swordsman with his gun, the snake pit scene, the chase sequence involving a truck and some jeeps, and several others that continue to excite me today. It helps that Harrison Ford was playing the titular role and he absolutely owned the part. This is one of the best collaborations between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and everything about this film was a thrilling experience. Harrison Ford turned Indiana Jones into an iconic figure, and several sequels have followed the success of Raiders without ever being able to match it. Even the romance between Ford and Karen Allen works in this film along with the comedic moments that make this adventure such an exciting and thrilling ride. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","At this point, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has so many imitators, but none of them come close to matching this thing's level of craft. Hell, even its entertainment value. And you can throw around all manner of high praise for this movie (each one being apt), but really this is everything I go to the movies for: great script, well-drawn characters, spectacle, and a wonderfully wry sense of humor. The set pieces - orchestrated like amusement park rides - are just piled on one after another.<br/><br/>But the guy that makes this all work is the character himself. Indiana Jones is Ford's best-suited role, hands down. And between the script, direction and Ford's little touches, he's just such a memorable character.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mmallon4","10","1","2","18 May 2015"," The Return of the Great Adventure!
","Indiana Jones is my second favourite movie character of all time. My number one favourite is Han Solo. Yes, the same actor played my first and second favourite movie characters. I don't care how many mediocre movies Harrison Ford may appear in during his later career, that's like eternal levels of respect and a miracle that this is even the case.<br/><br/>The character of Indiana Jones is the ultimate escapist fantasy. A tough hero who goes on adventures around the world when he feels like it to obtain relics, escapes life and death situations, thwarts the bad guys and gets the girl in the end. Even his action moves are so indentified with his character (e.g., climbing underneath the back of a moving vehicle then holding onto it with his whip).<br/><br/>Yet Indy is still human like the rest of us because of his overzealous confidence, thinking he's several steps ahead of the bad guys when he is not, his ability to make mistakes and his irrational fear of snakes. If there's a scene which I feel sums up the character of Indiana Jones, it's when he pulls out a gun on the sword-wielding Arab, a moment which wasn't even supposed to be the film (likewise that clothes hanger gag is also truly the product of genius minds). Making the character an unassuming nerdy professor is the other stroke of genius and making him a Clark Kent like figure; It's the biggest contrast of personalities, yet entirely believable. Just look at any Han vs. Indy debate for people pulling every facet of this character's personality apart but you can't blame them. Would Harrison Ford have had the career he had if it wasn't for Raiders? Or would he have faded away like his co-stars in a galaxy far far away?<br/><br/>Does Raiders of the Lost Ark have the best character introduction of all time? The opening of the film tells you everything you need to know about the character of Indiana Jones, as well as having the hairs stand up on your back - Just that boulder alone permeates our culture. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those movies which everyone has seen, even those who haven't seen it. So many frames in the film are ingrained into the subconscious of film buffs and the general public alike. I feel what makes a film moment iconic is when you're pondering to yourself as you watch it of ways it could be parodied of spoofed; there's no shortage of that in Raiders.<br/><br/>Nazis are the ultimate cinematic bad guys and this was even more poignant in 1981 than today when survivors of the Second World War were still alive. Even Ronald Lacy as Thot is no less scary with his baby face. The movie captures and emphasises the fear of Nazis and their quest for world domination; ""The army which carries the ark before it...is invincible"". Yet the film's climax seems to state that within the Indiana Jones universe, the Judeo Christian God exists or at the very least some higher power.<br/><br/>There are shots in Cairo in Raiders which feel very Lawrence of Arabia and I'm not talking about the grand landscape shots. Likewise, in Lawrence of Arabia, there are moments which I could swear could have been a shot from Raiders of the Lost Ark. As for the music, I can remember listening to John Williams' The Raider's March when I was younger simply to lift my mood and inspire me. From the beauty of Marion's theme, the excitement of the desert chase music to the otherworldly Ark theme, how can one argue John Williams isn't the greatest film composer of all time? With all the Indiana Jones movies, I will watch the entire end credits just to listen to the score.<br/><br/>The genius behind Raiders of the Lost Ark is the same stroke of genius which made Star Wars so great; I believe it's all to do with simplicity. They took such a simple B-movie level concept and glorified and made it larger than life. Spielberg and Lucas did it first and better than anyone has since and that's why these movies have such a widespread appeal and endure the way they do."

If you're looking for a fun action packed movie then this is a film you can count on. The special effects were great and still hold up surprisingly well compared to todays era of CGI. These older films forced everyone making them to use their imagination more and its awesome to see.

Spirits come flying by, and the final Words said by Belloq is ""It's beautiful"" A ghost comes to Toht, where the ghost has a pretty face then the Next split-second turns to death. The others Nazi's dies by Lightning, Dietrich's face shrivels up, Toht's face melts and Belloq's face explodes on-screen. The ghosts go back in the Ark and Marion and Indy are free. One moral: Don't mess with God.

","I cannot believe i waited so long to see this absolute masterpiece of a film. This film was so much fun to watch from start to finish and that was mainly as a result of a very interesting and engaging plot and an awesome performance by Harrison Ford as Dr Indiana Jones. The overall plot of this film right from the opening sequence got you really invested in the film. It had some interesting twists and turns that managed to take us to many new locations but none of it seemed silly. Harrison Ford is just a master at creating fantastic heroic characters as is seen in Star Wars and he doesn't disappoint in this. Indiana was such a badass, funny and intelligent character that was so entertaining to watch you are cheering for this guy in every scene. What i loved most about this film is how it managed to catch aspects of so many different genres so perfectly. It had awesome action/adventure sequences, some romance, a few scary horror like scenes and bits of comedy to lighten the mood a little. This film had everything and did it so right. Not only did it have everything it was also very well paced, it didn't feel like it slowed down or went too fast at any point.<br/><br/>Also, the score in this film by John Williams was so damn incredible that it helped make almost every scene so much better. He has created a score that you can listen to at any time it would still be amazing, something he is so good at. In the end this film was an amazing blend of so many different themes and did everything so right that it is one of the best action/adventure films out there. - 9.2"

","Up until recently, I had not seen any of the Indiana Jones movies. I bought the box set of all four films for Christmas and I decided that I would work my way through the series. I have been told by many that the Indiana Jones movies were great, however I was a bit skeptical. After seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark, all of my doubts are gone. <br/><br/>I was transfixed from start to finish. The movie begins with Jones pursuing an ancient artifact in what seems to be South America. The opening scene is exciting and compelling. The action is entertaining, while not appearing to be extremely over the top. Jones is not able to secure the artifact that he is pursuing and returns to his job as a college professor. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie focuses on Jones' quest to locate and retrieve the Ark of the Covenant, a precious artifact that dates back to the biblical era. There is a heightened sense of urgency to find the Ark because the Nazis are also after it. The body of the movie contains Jones' adventure of finding the Ark. The path of his trip takes him through Nepal and Egypt. <br/><br/>I will not go into detail about the rest of the movie, however I will comment on what I liked the most about Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>The cinematography and visual effects were excellent. The sound was amazing. I personally enjoyed Jones' style of overcoming obstacles in the movie. Jones did not simply use brute force or an abundance of advanced weaponry to defeat his enemies and find the Ark; he used his intelligence, his bull whip, and his revolver. Jones is the definition of resourceful in this movie. Jones also uses the help of a few friends during the movie. These individuals were instrumental to his success. <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. It was visually pleasing and entertaining from start to finish. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes history and also anyone who enjoys a good adventure movie."
"Hotwok2013","Null","1","2","10 December 2014"," Wonderful Escapist Entertainment
","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a movie that is in just about everyone's list of top ten favourite movies, & many people's top three. The first 10 minutes of the movie showing Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in the Peruvian jungle in search of a golden statue is an absolute blockbuster of an opening. Back home teaching in his college in the USA, where he is a professor of archaeology, he learns about the Ark Of The Covenant from museum curator Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Eliot). Brody informs him of the power of the artefact (""An army carrying the Ark is invincible"") & that Nazi Germany also is searching for it. So begins Indiana Jones quest for it. What follows may be somewhat far-fetched at times, but no-one could deny its marvellous escapist entertainment value. Director Steven Spielberg must have spent many of his boyhood hours at his local cinema showing Saturday matinée movies, because it shows in his Indiana Jones trilogy & many other of his films. He fully deserves his reputation as the king of modern-day escapist movies."
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","2","15 November 2013"," The Most Fun To Ever Be Had At The Movies...
","My number one favourite movie of all time, and pretty much the pinnacle of adventure Cinema. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a film that no matter how many times it re-runs on Television, I can sit down and watch it indefinitely. It is a marvel piece of cinema that was brought to life by two of Hollywood's biggest names, Steven Spielberg & George Lucas (Director Philip Kaufman was originally set to direct before Spielberg, he is credited as a co-writer on the story). Both were inspired by the old film serials of the 1930's and 1940's, where adventurers will survive and escape virtually all kinds of in-escapable peril. Harrison Ford is in his prime as the famous fictional architect Indiana Jones, whose journeys would involve bizarre riddles and strange hieroglyphics that would usually result in disasters of biblical proportions.<br/><br/>At the very beginning of the movie, we're in the middle of a jungle exhibition with a mood defining score from John Williams and a younger, thinner Alfred Molina. Suddenly we enter a tomb and already the film has set its entire mood and expectations within minutes. Suddenly we see what little of Jones's regular life is like as a College professor, and in no time we see him off on another adventure searching for the legendary Ark of the Covenant (Built by the Israeli's to hold the fragments of The Ten Commandments). This sees Indy travelling to Nepal to meet his old flame Marion (Karen Allen), who may hold the key to finding the Ark. Unaware that both of them are being followed and hunted by Nazi Gestapos sent by Hitler to collect the Ark for himself, this revelation pairs Indy and Marion together as they head for Cairo to find it first.<br/><br/>Among the highlights of the movie as said before is the cave, the bar fight in Nepal, the famous market chase and the undeniably funny ""Gun to the Swordfight"" scene (Ford had diarrhoea). All these scenes and so many others continuously loop in the memories of my brain. Even the ending of the film is so famous, it has been more than parodied to death in recent Pop-Culture.<br/><br/>The special effects and visual style in this film are truly a lost art. From the wax melting faces and giant fibreglass boulders, to breathing streets of Cairo and dimly lit dungeons meant everything and anything could come out at you anytime, anywhere. Among the talent behind this movie, Joe Johnston won an Academy Award for his effects work and would later turn to directing. His most recent feature being ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), which has a wonderful throwback to ""Raiders"" (""And the Fuhrer digs for trinkets in the desert""). Michael Bay was the storyboard artist who thought the movie was going to be horrible, then he finally saw it and loved it enough to become a film-maker himself (Yet he really needs to learn a thing or two).<br/><br/>Even now as I write and dive into this movie, I can't fully explain why it's all such a gem to me. Adventure films before and after never really reached this kind of magnitude, not even in the sequels. No matter when and where it's on, I just have to sit and watch it. All in all, you're along for the ride and once it has started there's no going back. I have been researching thoroughly through the history of Cinema, and whilst I have found many better treasures among Japan, Sweden and Italy etc. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", even after all I've said there's no possible way to fully describe what the experience meant to me. But why it means so much, summed up in one sentence is: ""One of the most imaginative thrill ride movies ever made, and that's what I consider Cinema and story telling all about"".<br/><br/>Final Verdict: I loved it the first time I saw it, and I'll most likely continue to love it till the day I die. It's not the best film ever made, but I'll never be able to hate it. 10/10."

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","18 January 2013"," When Tintin meets Han Solo ...
","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is like these showers that work on cold or hot water, where both fans and detractors can be right. Ironically, the elements that are lauded by some and that contributed to cement the film's legendary status are used by others to justify their dislike. Still, no one can deny its significance in film-making history.<br/><br/>The first opus of Indiana Jones' adventures was the highest-grossing film of 1981 and when adjusted to inflation, still one of the most successful ever. George Lucas was the executive producer, working with his lifelong friend Steven Spielberg, and there's no doubt that Spielberg wanted to direct his ""Star Wars"", a family adventure film with the kind of enthralling and innocent escapism that only the magic of cinema can convey. Indeed, ""Raiders"" is a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes that built the popularity of the adventure genre whether it's from movies, or comic books. And as a fan of Tintin, there's no doubt that Spielberg made the closest film ever to the Belgian reporter's adventures (although it was more obvious in ""Temple of Doom"" with the Chinese boy) and it's funny how most American critics failed to notice that.<br/><br/>South America, Africa, Nepal and Egypt, whips, guns and swords, temples and military camps, planes, trucks, horses and submarines, Spielberg gratifies us with so many spectacular sequences, whether it's on the visuals or action departments, that it would be impossible to list them all. Starting with the immortal opening in the tropical forest, where Jones steals the idol, escapes from poisoned sticks, a rolling giant boulder, a bottomless pit, surprising booby traps, we're embarked in a series of thrilling episodes, each one standing alone as a classic, driven by one of John William's most iconic score (which is saying a lot). And to its own credit, the film succeeds in creating cohesion between all these heart-pounding vignettes through an interesting plot. We're in 1936, at the rise of the Nazi party, and as a passionate of the occult, Hitler sent men to find the Ark where Moses received the Ten Commandments. Any army that would possess it would become invincible.<br/><br/>Beyond the inspiration for a catchy title, the Ark epitomizes the mysticism that always surrounded the archaeologist's adventures, and allow to pick the Nazis as convenient villains, since their sophisticated manners contrasting with their extreme barbarity, is the perfect counterpart for a character like Indiana Jones, a tough and rough no-nonsense guy, civilized but condemned to visit the wildest places to fulfill his dreams. Jones is the kind of unintentional hero driven by his own passion, he never seems to enjoy the action, but rather its pay-off, and maybe that's what makes him so endearing, he's like a clever mix between Tintin and Han Solo (to stay on the ""Star Wars"" connection). And with the archaeologist again the Nazis, science and civilization against barbarity and evilness, in between you have the obligatory helpers, traitors and sidekicks.<br/><br/>Counting the clichés is pointless, naturally Arabs are either jovial or cunning, the Frenchman is sneaky and charming, Nazis all deserve to die, Marion, Karen Allen as the heroine, granted, she's a tough woman, we can see coming from a mile that she'd be dressed in a very feminine way, that there's more between her and Jones. The whole film works on archetypes, the power is that it also plays with them. Whether it's Jones being afraid of snakes, it provides an interesting Achilles' heel for the hero, but it inspires the great punch line for the opening sequence when he finds one in the plane. The racism of the scene where he casually shoots the swordsman is only redeemed by its hilarious cleverness. The film has a way not to take itself seriously yet doing it at the same time, and I guess that's why it's either praised or despised. I value Spielberg's intelligence enough to have expected the criticism.<br/><br/>Indeed, he would easily be accused of designing a movie precisely to attract people, that all the great things of ""Raiders"" were 'marketed'. I'm sure it's right, but what's wrong with that? Maybe it's because Spielberg is one hell of a storyteller. I'm sure he is, although I wouldn't tag the film as a story, but I did follow it with interest. Is the film too naive, too childish? Maybe it was designed by the mind of a director young enough to remember all the representations of his childhood, I'm not surprised that a young Jewish kid would have dreamed of stories where Nazis could be demised the way they are in ""Indiana Jones"", before depicting them in a more adult way in ""Schindler's List"". The film relies on a representation of a world, from comic books to B-movies, belonging to childhood, and maybe the film worked because it awakened our inner child.<br/><br/>I guess the haters tend to approach the film from their perspective rather than adapting their approach to the film. I can share Pauline Kael's view when she foresees that the deliberate corniness of ""Raiders"" would put the deathblow on films like ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Raging Bull"". I agree even more because even though ""Jaws"" is the film that paved the way for blockbusters, I've always seen it as an adult masterpiece while ""Raiders"" IS a popcorn film, reinventing an aesthetic of old-school fun and entertainment tailor-made for theaters. It's interesting that Ebert closed his review by advising to see the film with someone we like, to grab his or her arm (was he thinking of the terrifying howling mummies?). Indirectly, he pointed out the film's minor weakness, being designed for cinemas, with half the charm lost on TV, videos and now DVD's. Even ""Star Wars"" can be enjoyable for the whole Shakespearian and Family saga undertones.<br/><br/>Maybe ""Raiders"" killed the very kind of movies that could be enjoyed even outside theaters. Still, I can't imagine the world of movies without ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""."
"Blueghost","Null","1","2","13 January 2013"," Classic film making at its best.
","The summer of 1981 was not a memorable season save for one thing; this outstanding movie. Following in the footsteps of classic serial's that used to run in movie houses, combined with the finest film making techniques utilized in epics and dramatic classics through out the era of film making, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is more than just an homage to film's of yesteryear viewed by youngsters in movie houses across America. It is the reinvention of the classic adventure.<br/><br/>Here we see massive and delicately crafted sets and locations. We see marquis players mixed with solid character actors. We see old fashioned cinematography coupled with effects shots to bring this high adventure film to light. There's action, there's romance, there's intrigue, there's good verse evil, it's a period piece, it's got comedy, it's even got Nazis--classic bad guys from the golden age of Hollywood.<br/><br/>The world renowned Stanford based archaeologist Doctor Henry Jones is consulted and contracted by the US Army's Office of Strategic Services to search for a relic that Hitler believes will help him conquer the world. We're there with and his friends as he grapples and races against Axis to obtain a supernatural artifact from the time just before the Roman Empire. The national socialist regime in Germany believes such a find will help win the war.<br/><br/>This is my favorite Indiana Jones film simply because nearly everything you see in it is real, and the acting just below over the top, while at the same time being both energetic and detached to bring us a classic adventure film. There are real convincing characters mixed in with caricatures. It's a fine combination of film making styles; a classic adventure style mixed in with a near comic book style, mixed in with classic epic film making techniques. The cost was high, but the payoff was worth it. Appropriate lenses for the right shots, truly giving us the right visual feel for the film. Truly outstanding work here in terms of bringing all technical and creative story elements together. You can rarely find a match for it in the same genre.<br/><br/>It is a bit over the top here and there, but overall, when you sum up the scenes and the entire story and visual experience, it is a masterpiece. You can see that a lot of money was put into this project, and it shows on screen; i.e. lots of tender loving care for a classic film that mimics appropriately her ""sister ships"", so to speak.<br/><br/>Technical notes; the one thing that's bothered me about this film are the squibs for the gunfights. Particularly the full automatic fire as they were mis-timed. There's a miniature effect's sequence during the chase that's a little ho-hum. I think we the audience were still used to real cars being driven remotely off cliffs, then set ablaze or to explode while in mid flight (classic Hollywood). The backers paid extra for thousands of extras, and that's a major plus, giving the film authenticity and weight. Also, the stunts are real. Whether it's Nazi soldiers on a truck, or Harrison Ford in a pontoon aqua bi-plane, a chase through suburban Cairo or an actual U-boat as it squares off with a merchant on the high seas. Save for two or three effects' sequences, all of it is real.<br/><br/>That, verse the last installment where the commies were the villain of the day, and nearly every shot was digitally rigged in some way. The unspoken agreement between film maker and audience member was broken by not showing a heightened reality that is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but a CGI experience that is ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". This is the lesson for the film makers. But, that's another film for another review.<br/><br/>The reactions from the actors are real in a story that is far fetched. The places and dressing of everything in the shot, as well as the shot itself, sells us the story and imagery we view on the screen. Marry some first class music to it, scored by the inestimable John Williams, and you have yourself one incredible film.<br/><br/>A terrific film with high ideals and themes, set amidst a tumultuous time in European and world history.<br/><br/>Definitely one not to miss.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

"kdnor2011","8","1","2","20 December 2012"," A very good Adventure Film
","I would consider myself a casual fan of the Indiana Jones movies. I enjoy them and watch them on occasion but don't go around quoting them or thinking about them all the time. That being said I do have to agree with the majority of people that the odd numbered Indiana Jones movies are definitely better than the even numbers. And while Last Crusade is my favorite, I will say that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a pretty damn good movie.<br/><br/>My biggest issue is that the film has a bit of a pacing problem in the first half. You start out with a very cool and suspenseful action scene, and then we just sort of watch people talking for about twenty minutes, then a small action scene, more talking. And then the second half kicks in and the pacing gets better. I don't mind talking in films, but the stuff Indy talks about here isn't that interesting to me. Also I think that the climax is kind of lackluster after such build up. We get all this build up and then they have a stand off until Indy just sort of gives in. And how did Indy know to close his eyes? Other than that, the movie is pretty much perfect. I can't really find any problems in the writing, no annoying characters, every character is well developed and likable, except of course for the villains who are fantastic, I actually found myself hating them and wanting to reach in and punch them. The action scenes are choreographed perfectly, and there a feeling of suspense. The acting is perfect, I saw this after having Harrison Ford set in my brain as Han Solo, yet when I watch this I don't see Han Solo I see Indiana Jones. Most of the special effects hold up well, and it has a nice sense of humor to itself.<br/><br/>While I may get blasted for not giving this film a perfect score I will say Raiders is a great adventure movie that just falls a little short in the pacing department. And seriously, how did Indy know to close his eyes?"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","1","2","19 September 2012"," A perfect example that defines the classic style of Hollywood!
","After seeing the original Star Wars trilogy and the prequels, I watched another movie that had Harrison Ford (Han Solo from the original trilogy) in another film series (I was a 90s kid watching some stuff from my childhood days until a few years later, I stumbled upon this at my teenager years and I'm still 18). I guess some of you know the premise of this film: A hat-wearing treasure hunter guy with a kick-a** whip trying to find a treasure while getting the girl of his dreams and gets into lots of booby traps along the way. I thought to myself, ""Wow. That is what I call an epic premise"" and this movie is a perfect example of great cinema that defines the classic Hollywood style.<br/><br/>It takes place in the year 1936 where Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles in South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap doing so, miraculously, he escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to humanly existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Renee Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it. With the story now said, no wonder this is a fabulously well-done feature from Steven Spielberg and it's one of his greatest ones next to ET and Jaws.<br/><br/>The story in this movie is a much more compelling one with a great mixture of action, adventure, humor, and romance. It also has some great visual style, some brilliant costumes and make-ups, and some of the most gripping action sequences only to be outmatched by it's excellent cast of characters like Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling Indy, Karen Allen as the beautiful and bada** Marion and Paul Freeman as a great villain and John Rhys-Davies as a Cairo digger and John Williams' memorable and light-hearted musical score that fits very well throughout the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Raiders of the Lost Ark is, and always will be, one of the greatest films ever made to cinema and is always worth watching.

","Indiana Jones, Professor of Archaeology but with an adventurous bent, finds himself involved with trying to track down the hiding place of the Ark Of The Covenant. Unfortunately, so are a batch of Nazis.<br/><br/>Spielberg's homage to the pulp serials of the 40s was an enormous success, and deservedly so - it is non-stop action, adventure and spectacle from start to finish, laced with humour, character and what were, for the time, state of the art miniature and photographic special effects which still stand up well in the digital age.<br/><br/>Here is where I am prepared to go against the conventional wisdom. What it was not was high art. The material it homages was cheap, disposable, ephemeral (and was intended to be) and the homage is accurate: the fact that, in this case, the material is delivered with thought and care and high production values does not mean that the pulp origins of the source material have suddenly moved from sow's ear to silk purse.<br/><br/>Don't let that spoil your enjoyment, though!"

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is easily one of the best action/adventure films released in all of the history of cinema. It is fast paced, has lots of action, lots of humour and has one death-defying cliffhanger after another. The part I thought was very hilarious is when Indiana shoots the swordsman. That made me laugh my head off. I found for this movie to have the rating that it has, it has some bloody scenes, for example, when one of the Nazis get his face melted after the ark gets opened. I was surprised that it actually got that rating. But the scene that really got to me is when Indiana and Satipo get tarantulas on their backs. Every time I watch that, I cringe.

"StevePulaski","10","1","2","21 January 2012"," Heartbeat, excitement, exhilaration, and determination
","If there was ever an action movie that loves other action movies while succeeds at trying out new things for a change it's definitely Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is a classic, unforgettable, and a truly fantastic adventure film that completely blows others out of the water. Just in the opening scene we are treated to delightful cinematography, impressive effects for the time, and a nail-biting setup combined with extraordinary music to foreshadow the string of events that will soon follow.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones is a compelling character, from the way he looks and talks, but just the way he fights. Every move he makes seems well thought out and genuine rather than just constant instincts and ""think-fast"" scenarios. He is produced by Lucas, directed by Spielberg, and played extremely well by Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>Action films nowadays have no real story. It's usually about a sentence in length. The same can sort of be said about Raiders. It centers around Indiana Jones , an archaeologist who usually goes on risky, death-defying adventures to try and recover ancient artifacts. The US Government hires him, one day, to go in search of the Ark of the Covenant. His mission, that he chooses to accept, is to find the ark and return it to the government before the Nazis uncover it.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, this story transforms into a globetrotting adventure. Indy teams up with his old flame Marion (Allen) and it becomes clear that he is more concerned with finding the ark than drumming up another relationship. A beautiful dodge to a cliché so commonly used. The main villain is a man in a black cloak named Belloq (Freeman). He is involved with some of the most gripping action scenes in the film, most notably the one in the bar.<br/><br/>The special effects, at least now, appear to be a bit cheesy. We currently live in an age where we can build anything our heat desires from the ground up on CGI. Still, in Saturday morning serials, clearly the feel Spielberg wanted to capture, special effects are supposed to appear a little hammy. I'd take Raiders's action sequences over incomprehensible, score-driven scenes of peril with monotonous digitized backdrops we are so used to today. I'd also take its music, suspense, cinematography, buildup, and characters over anything today as well.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an ecstatically giddy adventure film with one jaw-dropping scene after another. It captures the age of films we'll probably never see again. The age where everything was done for a purpose, and adventure scenes actually played like an adventure. This has the right amount of developed story and the right amount of exhilarating action scenes to be considered the perfect and most satisfying adventure film ever made.<br/><br/>Starring: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Paul Freeman. Directed by: Steven Spielberg."

The film co- stars Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freeman as Indiana's nemesis, French archaeologist René Belloq; John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's sidekick, Sallah; and Denholm Elliott as Indiana's colleague, Marcus Brody.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones is no ordinary archaeologist. When we first see him, he is somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936, running a booby-trapped gauntlet to fetch a solid-gold idol. He loses this artifact to his chief rival, a French archaeologist named Belloq, who then prepares to kill our hero. In the first of many serial-like escapes, Indy eludes Belloq by hopping into a convenient plane. So, then: is Indiana Jones afraid of anything? Yes, snakes. The next time we see Jones, he's a soft-spoken, bespectacled professor. He is then summoned from his ivy-covered environs by Marcus Brody to find the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. The Nazis, it seems, are already searching for the Ark, which the mystical- minded Hitler hopes to use to make his stormtroopers invincible. But to find the Ark, Indy must first secure a medallion kept under the protection of Indy's old friend Abner Ravenwood, whose daughter, Marion (Karen Allen), evidently has a ""history"" with Jones. Whatever their personal differences, Indy and Marion become partners in one action- packed adventure after another, ranging from wandering the snake pits of the Well of Souls to surviving the pyrotechnic unearthing of the sacred Ark.<br/><br/>A joint project of Hollywood prodigies George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, with a script co-written by Lawrence Kasdan and Philip Kaufman, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark is not so much a movie as a 115-minute thrill ride.But this is the kind of movie that, even today, audiences immediately fall in love with. It has all the right ingredients: a smart script, a likable hero, a dash of romance, more than a touch of comedy, and a lot of fast-paced action.Also,it is one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.Added to that,the commercially successful film holds up as a spectacle film, spooky fun house ride and rollicking adventure yarn. Steven Spielberg was, then and now, the finest director of grand-scale Hollywood blockbusters.Obviously,it is one of the most indelible adventure films in cinematic history."

","Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and explorer in the action adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936, the story follows Indy, as he is often called, as he attempts to beat the Nazis in a race to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant. Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies join Indy in his quest as Marion Ravenwood and Sallah respectively. Paul Freeman plays Dr. René Belloq, Indy's adversary in the movie. The movie follows Indy in South America where he recovers a gold idol, only to have it stolen by Belloq. His next trip is to Nepal where he acquires the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and a partner, Marion, after a battle with Gobler (Anthony Higgins) and his henchmen. Indy and Marion then travel to Egypt where they meet up with Sallah, enter into several skiffs, Marion is believed to have been killed, the Ark is found, stolen, and then retrieved once again. After retrieving the Ark, Indy and Marion board a boat for America but a Nazi sub shows up and the Ark is stolen yet again; Indy, however, sneaks aboard the sub. The Nazi's stop at a secret island to open the Ark, catch Indy, and tie him and Marion to a post. The Ark is opened and spirits attack those who watched, not including Marion or Indy. The Ark is brought to the United States and stored away in a warehouse. The movie is full of action and adventure, with traps and danger at every turn. The editing was paramount in making this movie a reality as different parts of the same scene are in fact in different location. The very beginning of the movie starts in a cave set in South America, but only the outside of the cave was filmed on location. Indy actually runs out of a set in the US and emerges out in a jungle of South America. This is the only way that the traps and special effects can be properly done. The lighting in scenes such as the ones inside the map room and the Well of Souls is important to the film, but for different reasons for each. The map room required the lighting to move as if it were the sun moving across the sky, changing the lighting as it goes. Inside the Well of Souls darkness needed to prevail while still allowing us to see what was going on. If it had been bright inside the Well of Souls the fear the scene is supposed to portray would be lost. In the end of the film the Ark of the Covenant, which was retrieved by Indy, is placed in a crate and stored in a warehouse. This is important as the warehouse in this film is the warehouse from Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, another action adventure film starring Indy, loaded with traps, chases, close calls, and filled with historical belief's tied into its plot."

","This cultural legacy is still a movie of splendid imagination and swift pace that clutches you with its very first playful image, dashes you through a progression of remarkable escapades, and drops you back in reality two hours later with a juvenile smirk. This movie commemorates the stories we exhausted our youth plowing through in comics and movies, where the hero gets out of bed wondering what intrepid feats and shocking terror he'll be surviving in the next couple minutes. And indeed, it marks off the rainforests of South America, the surroundings of Tibet, the barrenness of Egypt, a clandestine submarine base, a remote island, an ancient cryptand an American archaeology classroom. Our hero tangles with vicious Nazis, slippery gravediggers, inebriated Sherpas and devious Frenchmen. It all culminates in the literal wrath of God, building to that dazzling meltdown with tarantulas, boulders, spears, falling rock, flaming airplanes, runaway trucks, preserved tombs and of course, snakes, all the while riding horse carts, biplanes, motorcycles, submarines, ships, trains and trucks.<br/><br/>Indy and Marion outlive a chain of ghastly snares, tricks, surprise attacks and doom worse than mortality of which Lucas, Gordon and Kaufman propose numerous, Karen Allen equaling Ford bit by bit through the film's romantic, comic and action-tilting requirements: A drinker and fighter, Marion is promptly established as no measly damsel in distress. And one chase features a truck, three jeeps, a horse, a motorcycle and a tremendously arduous stunt in which a character must achieve a 360-degree rotation of the racing truck. All is realized with the touch of a master entertainer at the helm, merging stunts, visual effects, painstaking technique and pure sweat. The crucial bounty sought by Jones, Belloq (Moriarty to Indy's Holmes), the U.S. government and the Nazis alike is the Ark of the Covenant.<br/><br/>Two elements make this defining film more than merely a triumph of spectacle: Its sense of humor and the quaint stylishness of its characters. This is time and again a hilarious film, the biggest laugh coming from the ancient and obvious gag involving a sword and a gun. And to the standard of the 1940s' Lone Ranger, Dick Tracy and Flash Gordon serials, the personalities of the crucial characters are extremely charming. In this first outing, Ford creates an aloof, modest, persistent character.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is like the dieselpunk successor to The 39 Steps, Saboteur and North By Northwest, relentlessly putting the action in adventure. Lucas' idea was to imbue with fresh energy an old dramatic style, with its thrill-seeking, sharply winding composition always building to exciting release. It takes us back to our youth. Virtually all summer movies today attempt that, but it's easy to become immersed in today's dime-a-dozen blockbuster dreck and forget the true profundity of difference between saying that about a mediocre film and about a Spielberg film, the Indiana Jones phenomenon in a very distinct way. Today's Armageddons, Snakes on a Planes, REDs, Fast and Furiouses, Wild Wild Wests, Sucker Punches, Die Hard 4's, and yes even Indiana Jones 4's try to achieve their errand by being childish instead of childlike. The original Indiana Jones trilogy, beginning here, is the quintessential template.<br/><br/>Ford brings every scrap of his terse appeal and physicality to his Indiana Jones, a reserved professor who releases his inner gallant in vigorous quest for fortune and glory in precious artifacts that belong in a museum. One of the moments that connect us to Indy is when he's slipping off of the side of a bottomless pit, having hardly caught hold of a root protruding from the earth. Spielberg cuts to a close-up of Indy, smiling in respite, but when we go back to wide, the root yanks out of the earth and he's about to fall into the void. That close-up unites us with Indy, that momentary ""Whew!"" amidst all the chaos.<br/><br/>Spielberg gives dutifully focused meticulousness to clever and resourceful action sequences, scored with exactness by John Williams. The stunts, photography and editing so conscientiously applied to the myriad chases and scuffles are the gauge for action-adventure films since in their lucidity and vigor. The quest is the whole, with Jones showing his nerve, but ultimately meeting consuming powers with wonder and humility. The religious tinges and sweeps against mortality are crafty pickings on the part of Spielberg and Lucas. They know moviegoers want to lose control and get excited, to devote themselves to a story not just to defer disbelief, but to believe. Reality can hold its horses for now.<br/><br/>Raiders endures for numerous reasons, not least of which is due to Spielberg's supreme dexterity as a visual storyteller and his knack for finding electric performances in his actors that nevertheless slip right into the whole cacophony. His style is masterful, and yet invisible. Every individual set piece is breathtaking in its tempo, joke delivery and emotional upshot. The scene in Marion's Nepalese bar begins with a beefy drinking game. This is promptly trailed by some romantic friction as Indy returns to her life and they parley over a supposedly missing relic she might still possess. Eventually, Nazis arrive led by a dark, goggled, panting sadist. The action that ensues has everybody giving the mortal skirmish their all, but it's all the punctuating details that make it unforgettable, bullets puncturing a barrel of whiskey and Marion leaning over to guzzle some before it spills, Indy wrestling with a brute whose arm is aflame, and the Nazi ringleader ordering his machine gun-wielding henchman to just shoot them both. Unlike most present-day action films, Spielberg crafts dynamic pictures with diverse on screen action."

","Anybody and everybody should see this movie. Period. End of story.<br/><br/>I'm 18 years old, I was born in the 90's, and so I watched films like Aladdin, The Lion King, and Toy Story. However, I am not oblivious to the awesomeness of the movies of the 80's and this is just one of those movies.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, both having directed a few not-so-good movies, are both masterminds when they put their hearts and souls into movies; this is one of those movies. Spielberg proves once again why some of his movies, like ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Jurassic Park,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" to name a few, are among the most famous movies in history. As for George... well, let me just say that he has shown here that he can do more than just outer space battles in a galaxy far far away...<br/><br/>Now, to the cast: I think that we all agree that they are all pitch perfect here. Paul Freeman is great as the antagonist Belloq. Karen Allen is stunningly beautiful as the damsel in distress Marion, although she clearly shows that she can hold her own in battle. And, of course, the man Indiana himself. No one can play the role better than Harrison Ford. He brings life to the character, the movies, and so if I had to choose his signature character in any of his movies, it would be Indiana. I think I speak for a lot of people here.<br/><br/>All in all; it's worth it. Rent it, buy it, do whatever you can, just make sure you go and see this movie. It's 100% worth it."
"okeeff04","Null","1","2","18 September 2011"," A timeless classic
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first installment of four in the Indiana Jones saga. I believe the underlying theme is centered on the central characters and the plot of a good archaeologist racing against the clock to find the lost Ark of the Covenant before the evil Nazis. The story is centered on Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), an archeology professor who also moonlights as a treasure hunter, collecting important and sometimes priceless artifacts for a local museum. Produced by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, this dynamic duo takes the viewer through the jungles in South America to the mountains of Nepal and on to the deserts of Egypt in this epic search for the lost Ark of the Covenant. In the first action sequence of the movie, Indiana and his unnamed assistant negotiate deadly booby-traps in search of an ancient Peruvian gold idol. After recovering the idol, the walls start trembling and the two make a mad dash for the exit. Coming upon a seemingly bottomless pit, Indiana's guide tricks him into handing over the idol so that they both can escape the temple filled with booby-traps. The guide leaves Indiana to die and runs for the exit. Indiana with the aid of his bullwhip crosses the crevasse and later found the guide impaled on a booby trap. No sooner than finding the guide, a massive bolder is ejected from the ceiling of the passageway heading right for Indiana. Racing towards the exit, Indiana escapes the gigantic stone bowling ball and dramatically exits the cave covered in spider webs only to be surrounded by local poison blowgun toting locals. The camera is positioned facing Indiana and leads him towards the exit. Indiana's nemesis, Dr. René Belloq (Paul Freeman) takes the idol, and Indiana narrowly escapes with his life. The first sequence was filmed in both a studio to control the environment and on location. The special effects, camera angles who are a mixture of point of views and third-person angles coupled by the musical accompaniment compliment the first action sequence well and the movie as a whole, leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat. After returning to the classroom, Indiana receives another opportunity to retrieve the lost Ark of the Covenant. However, he must find a medallion from a lost love and daughter of his mentor, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). After a run-in with Nazi's agents, Marion agrees to give the medallion to Indiana at price; she is now partners with Indiana. The couple travels to Egypt and hires an old friend, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) to find the best digging crew in all of Egypt in order to beat the Nazi's to the Ark. Before heading out to the high desert, Marion is kidnapped by the Nazi agents. In my opinion, the best scene in the movie is the chase scene through Cairo where Indiana encounters a sword wielding Arab, who demonstrates his prowess with this weapon. I was anticipating a sword battle; however, Indiana who was only holding his bullwhip, opts to pull a revolver from a concealed holster, shoots the scimitar wielding bad person, and resumes the search for Marion. Several action sequences follow until the discovery of the Ark. The Ark is then transported to a deserted island where the Nazi's and Belloq, against the advice of Indiana, open the Ark. Brilliant lights and demons liquefy the Nazi's, The Ark replaces the lid, and only Indiana, and Marion remain alive. Throughout the movie, images of swastika, German soldiers, and evil musical scores reminded me of the struggle between good and evil. This well-developed movie had a good balance of action and special effects."

"johnnyboyz","7","1","2","10 August 2011"," All but pillaged over the years as the model blockbuster; here and now, the film neatly withstanding time as a giddy excursion into action/adventure filmmaking.
","Steven Spielberg has always been the sort of director whom, when provided with a 'log-line' or one sentence premise, has been able to use his ability to just grab the idea by the scruff of its neck and run with it. A bunch of people on an isolated tropical island populated by dinosaurs eventually running amok is given a radical overhaul and transformed into something more exciting and more substantial than it has any right to be; a man drives a car over a long distance across the barren states of the U.S.A., but is terrorised by a crazed truck driver becomes something quite special; a cynical parent of two young children faces the fight of his and his family's life when blood thirsty creatures invade Earth and he must guide them to some sort of safety. Raiders of the Lost Ark, along with the likes of the above in Jurassic Park and Duel among others, feeds off Spielberg in this mood and on this form; a feature that comes complete with dastardly villains trying to end the world; unadulterated heroes; feisty sidekicks; love interests; rounded, jolly foreign supporting acts of a differing ethnicity to that of the lead's as well as the Nazis as the bad guys.<br/><br/>Following the adventures of one of the best loved protagonists in film history, Raiders begins deep in the jungles of South America sometime in the 1930s; the music ominous, a group of men trudging on to what appears to be the laughter of the wildlife as they undertake a march many have previously attempted, but never completed. One of the men, following in a pack behind that of Harrison Ford's lead Indiana Jones, draws a gun; but our man is whip-smart in a literal sense to the revelation, and manages to hear; react; work his skill with the bull-whip he possesses and then defuse the situation without ever having to use grosser means of violence. We can tell Jones knows his stuff, or does his research; he treats a temple ""no one has ever come out from alive"" as if he had been there before and done what he's about to do a dozen times. He ventures in, his accomplice the picture of fear contrasting Jones' own state, and beats the system; swiping the prize and getting back out again – in the process avoiding a boulder who's trigger system has done well to survive all these centuries of people not making it this far.<br/><br/>There is something indescribably endearing about a man capable of the above, and yet by day, is a stuttering; glasses-wearing academic whom stammers around wielding arrays of scrolls he struggles to carry properly; in turn, knowing an awful lot about issues and subjects of an archaeological nature most would dismiss as somewhat nerdy. Jones is called upon by the American government to come into contact with a Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a mission laid out in no uncertain terms as being highly dangerous and mostly with the threat of the Nazi party spreading their wings into North Africa to try and find it for their own means. As a Macguffin, Spielberg does his utmost to effectively render the thing near enough to a character all by itself; a dangerous, looming character with what appears to be its own mind and priorities as these pesky early-to-mid twentieth century human-beings toy with it; transport it; fight for it but essentially wake it from its rest. An early revealing of the object in sketch form, lying there on a text book page radiating light and power, acts as an unnerving envisaging of what the thing is capable of. Jones initially rejects the proclaimed ""power"" that the Ark has, citing it as something in the region of ""occult mumbo-jumbo"", and therein that statement lies a refreshing little transition for Jones to undergo as he learns of its true power and of certain people's dedication towards it.<br/><br/>Working with the Nazis is a French archaeologist named René Belloq (Freeman); an 'Id' to Jones' superego: a well dressed and far more formal man to Jones' grizzled demeanour and whose morals are equally spread eagle on the spectrum. Along for the ride, after an excursion in the snowy barren nothingness of Nepal, Jones enlists Marion Ravenwood (Allen), whom he shares a botched romantic history. Ravenwood is a woman capable of holding her own; the sense of the film's overly guilty disposition rife in its having her in the midst of a drinking contest when we first see her, before placing her at the forefront of a sober; competent conversation with that of another human-being minutes later. Ford and Allen bounce off one another to varying degrees of success, their romance of old constantly hovering in the background as we observe the man's shot at redeeming himself to her as a man and not a runaway – the film maintaining her hard bodied edge throughout proceedings without ever sagging to levels of objectification.<br/><br/>There is an awful lot to enjoy in Raiders with nary a lot to necessarily get agitated about; the film is flat out adventure from the point of the Ark's uncovering, culminating in an eerie finale during which the culmination of several things explode at once in a dizzying moment of terror and thrills. The film is mostly an array of set pieces and stunts, but there is a grounded sense about the chase and adventure. We do not entrust Jones to be infallible; when he is shot, we grimace; when he takes a beating and bleeds, we observe him stumble his way back up and sense injury. In spite of its nature, the film never threatens to descend into that of anything below taut and engaging; rather, it is mostly a project filling us with a joyous feeling - lovingly constructed by a man out to do what he enjoys most, in making something exuberant that his audience can get stuck into."
"classicsoncall","9","1","2","26 June 2011"," ""It's not the years honey, it's the mileage"".
","Thirty years on and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" still packs a punch as a rousing adventure movie. From the opening boulder attack to the exciting Nazi truck chase scene, the film takes the viewer from one harrowing encounter to the next without skipping a beat, presenting it's protagonist, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the adventure serial hero come to life fifty years after the genre was born. Exotic locales and desert sands create a foreign mystique that have often been duplicated, but never topped in American action flicks.<br/><br/>I recall seeing the movie when it first came out, and how fresh and dramatic it appeared on screen at the time. When Indy was confronted by the sword wielding Arab and simply shot him, I remember thinking - yes, how sensible and effective. No overblown theatrics or inane hand to hand combat, just drop the villain where he stands and get on with it. One of the problems I always had with confrontations like this as a kid was the back and forth dialog between the hero and the bad guy before they actually square off. Not so with Indy, a practical combatant when it comes to saving one's neck.<br/><br/>And how about that snake pit? That scene easily passes the test as one of the creepiest sequences going. Doesn't just the sight of a simple garter snake slithering on the lawn startle the heck out of you? So picture yourself in a den with hundreds around you - heart attack material right there for sure.<br/><br/>You know, I've seen easily a few hundred Westerns in my time, and one of the signature moves of that genre is the buckboard chase scene made famous by second unit director Yakima Canutt. It's the one where he drops down underneath a stagecoach or wagon and holds on to the underside, making his way to the back of the coach before letting go. Indy does it here during the truck chase scene, and the first thing I thought was what a great tribute to Yak that was. Very well done, requiring perfect timing and nerves of steel.<br/><br/>Since this first film in the series came out, I've seen and enjoyed the others, but as is the case most of the time, it's the original that holds sway as the best for being the one that started it all. Indiana Jones will remain a cinema icon for a long time, and he might have given us all an insight into the freshness and originality of his character when in another one of his desperate moments, he casually replies - ""I'm making this up as I go""!"

","This film really is excellent. Definitely the best adventure film out there. It is heart warming, classic hero vs villain action, where morals don't get mixed up. Because that's the beauty of this film. Don't get me wrong, I love a good thought provoking complex plot, but the simplicity of this film is just magical. You make good and bad decisions in life. Those who choose to act for good keep their lives and the baddies get served their justice. <br/><br/>Personally, among his many incredible and touching films, this truly does shine as Steven Spielberg's greatest movie. It will stay in my heart and many other's forever more as a highlight of cinema experiences in our childhoods. Who could help but cheer as a young child when Indie runs along the submarine's top!"

","Superbly outstanding film. It has it all. A great story line, plenty of action and a historical perspective that is most interesting and possibly quite plausible.<br/><br/>The lunatic Hitler wants the Lost Ark since he feels that with it, the German armies will be invincible.<br/><br/>There is some irony in the film. Harrison Ford, as archeology professor, Dr. Indiana Jones is rather dull as he lectures the class. Go know that even though the first scene is action-packed, there will be plenty of action as Jones as lover played by Karen Allen, attempt to dupe and run from the Nazis all the way. I must say that the latter get exactly what they deserve at the end.<br/><br/>Steve Spielberg filmed a non-stop action eventful film within an era of historical perspective."
"tsheridan94","7","1","2","7 February 2010"," Best action movie ever?
","It's very possible. It's definitely the best Indiana Jones movie that's been made. This movie actually runs on a path similar to a heart-rate monitor, where there are sudden blips of action interspersed in periods of relative calm. This is a very effective way of running this genre of film, because the sudden action creates a certain tension. There is the possibility of something big lingering. This style has become more and more common place recently, but was revolutionary at the time. In all the years since this style became popular, maybe even revolutionized by Raiders, the Lost Arc still is one of the most effective users of this pacing. Honestly, is there anyone who doesn't think that scene in the cave or that scene with Harrison Ford under the truck among the best action sequences of all time?<br/><br/>The other element that this movie has that so many action movies somehow forgot to include recently is a plot. This genre has recently become a joke, with the extent of the stories going only so far as to allow the maximum amount of explosions and assorted other pieces of eye candy. Raiders of the Lost Arc doesn't include as many explosions (although there are some) as many other films. There is a lot more emphasis on human stunts on feats of inhuman athleticism.<br/><br/>As far as the obligatory love interest for Indiana, Marion Ravenwood is easily my favorite. She's very believable emotionally and almost reminds me of a non-Italian Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny. At least in the respect that her emotions toward Indiana fluctuate between intense anger and almost swooning. But not quite, because Marion is one tough chick.<br/><br/>And Harrison Ford much improves anything he touches (although 8I can't speak for his new Extraordinary Measures, which I have no interest in seeing. Brandon Fraser generally ruins everything he touches. But that's a tangent for another time.) Anyway, Ford is fantastic, perhaps the best action movie hero of all time. Not only is he a wonderfully flawed relateable character, he can also be brutal. I guess that just goes with the profession. Or maybe not. Indy is one glorified archaeologist. If only all archaeological digs were this exciting, I guarantee this would be one of the more common professions.<br/><br/>Those are some of the coolest death scenes, too. All I can say is watch out for rotors, and make sure to avert your eyes. And if you want to survive, make sure you have a great theme song."
"lucianomarzo92","8","1","2","23 August 2009"," Classic Action
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is definitely my favorite action movie. It's entertaining all the way through. Harrison Ford is great in this movie. I think its his best movie and the best character he's ever acted. Temple of Doom wasn't as good, but the Last Crusade is. Temple of Doom started off good but of fell apart after that. This is not true in Raiders of the lost ark, it maintains a classic action quality throughout. The Last Crusade is about almost was as good as the original, so if you like Indiana 1, you should watch the Last Crusade. These two are definitely worth watching. The fourth one was alright good for the first hour or so. But the plot collapsed at the end (seriously). Most everyone who has seen this film should see what I am talking about. But you haven't seen great action until you have seen Raiders of the Lost Ark though. Classic."
"zurnderrick","10","1","2","23 August 2009"," It's a radio for speaking to God!
","This is the best action film of all time, in my opinion. It't got great action, great stunts, great dialogue, it's just a fun, action packed masterpiece.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford, Han Solo from Star Wars is perfect for the role of Indiana Jones. Would you believe Tom Sellick was going to play him. This film is also known for it's iconic scenes, like the boulder roll, the opening of the Ark of the Covenant, and the brilliant car chase scene. One thing I find odd is that Alfred Molina is covered in spiders in the one part, and in the future, he will be playing a villain to Spider-Man, Docter Octopus.<br/><br/>Overall, this movies classic, and deserves all the praise it gets. If you want an action-packed thriller that you will never get tired off, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the film for you."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","2","3 August 2009"," One of the best ever.
","The first Indiana Jones is sooooo awesome. It mixes action, romance and biblical stuff all in one film. Like with Knowing, which doesn't feature romance. Raiders of the Lost ark is about an archaeologist named Henry Jones Jr. a.k.a. Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford). Jones is part professor part adventurer. He is sent down to look for the Ark of the Covenant. His arch rival Belloq is going after it too. With the help of Marion(Karen Allen) and Sallah(John Rys-Davies), I think that's how you spell both names, he will find the Ark of the Covenant. Little does Belloq know what the ark is capable of. He may have to read the bible to figure that one out. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest of the Jones films. I don't even have to explain why. If you've seen it, then it should be pretty self explanatory.One time, somebody told me that the first one is stupid and pointless. Well do you know what I was thinking? You're stupid and pointless."
"film-critic","8","1","2","14 July 2009"," Do you think Illinois Nazis wanted the Ark as well?
","As a child of the 80s, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the epitome of movie making. Two big directors, a huge star, Nazis, the unknown, a spooky finale, action, adventure, humor, far away lands – this movie, this one singular film had it all. This film had something for everyone; man, woman, and child could all sit around and be amazed by Indy's adventure. Everything about this film is addicting. Watching it then, and even today – Indiana Jones' theme music stuck with me for hours afterwards. This film is more than just a casual view; it is a part of history in the making. The cult icon that Spielberg and Lucas created breathed a celebrity life into the world of archaeology, but also has handed the world a character that felt real and exciting. With that said, re-watching this staple of my youth today, in 2009, it became a far different cinematic experience. ""Raiders"" is an important film, it is still an amazing film to watch, it is still two hours of entertaining adventure, but does the DVD do it justice? Is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only really meant to be enjoyed on VHS? These questions arise from crisper images shouting through my player at night, the lack of detail around the edges (don't be ashamed of the VHS fuzz), and how bright this dusty hero should have looked. I am not judging quality here, but Indy will always remain a VHS protagonist in my book.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as a stand-alone film works better than anything that could be released today. It takes the adventurous introduction of a man in search of a gold statue and juxtaposes it with an image of Indy as a teacher. It is a film that even after numerous viewings, the deadpan humor of Harrison Ford remains funny and repeatable in a group of friends. This, unlike ""Crystal Skull"" relies on Indiana's skills, it takes us to places that actually could exist, and builds a mythology that is real. We were not overwhelmed with CGI or great effects, these were the days of stuntmen and real explosions – this was made during a time where realism took precedence over computer. Yet, isn't that the mantra of Indiana? Isn't the idea of this film to inspire youthful minds to become archaeologists, to make them aware that modern technology could take a backseat to a fedora and/or whip any day? There is this classic nature of both this character, but of the way Ford portrays him. Ford gives us this hero that is literally an everyman – he bleeds, he has fears, he punches when he should run – these are all great relatable features that still makes Ford's Indiana Jones so iconic. The costume works, but it is the level of strength that Ford brings that makes me replay my VHS over and over.<br/><br/>What else makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" perfect? The Nazi element, the idea that Hitler was searching for more than just total world domination was brilliant. Lucas and Spielberg took a trusted villain, a villain from the classic radio era, and made him search all over the world for this Ark of the Covenant. The spiritual element within this film is not overbearing, mostly explained, and it again gives us a task that may not be too out of reach for the average viewer. Watching it today, older, wiser, and somewhat more film skilled, I loved learning that Karen Allen could drink like it was her job. I never did catch the romantic twist forming between Belloq and Allen, but it seemed more relevant as I am older. Our man Dietrich was both hysterical and utterly evil; one of my favorite scenes was when he tricks us into hanging his coat. Brilliant. Proving again that ""Raiders"" takes you on this journey, a journey that could have been stale and caper-ish, and delivers a story that seems bold, refreshing, and new each time that you watch it – no matter what age you are.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a timeless film. I cannot wait to watch it again – every element from the design, to the characters, to the finale is perfect. Despite the passion that I have for the VHS version, the DVD does thankfully make this film more accessible to the modern masses. This was created during the time where Ford was making skilled movies, a trait that he seems to have forgotten today. Do not watch this series backward, do not begin with ""Crystal Skull"" and expect ""Raiders"" to be the same. It is a retro film, a film about using skills sans computers. It is near perfection from everyone filming, writing, and acting within it. I would recommend this film to anyone looking for creativity, excitement, and/or a time where cinema was fun.<br/><br/>I miss these days.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"
"Ecron14932","8","1","2","17 March 2009"," The ultimate adventure protagonist
","Okay, so there's a ton of remarks already on how this movie is one of the greats, how it's the perfect action/adventure movie, etc. While I don't necessarily disagree, my particular affinity for Raiders (and, to a lesser degree, its sequels) stems from the character himself.<br/><br/>Indy's basically an un-super superhero. He has the traditional superhero accouterments: distinctive costume, unique weapon, mild-mannered secret identity - and yet he's far from superhuman. He wounds, falls, and fails just as much as any of us.<br/><br/>Here we have a guy who's basically just as weak and fallible as any real-life human, who is constantly thrust into larger-than-life situations that are consequently a little too much for him. Unlike most action heroes, Indy always manages to prevail not because he's super-strong, prescient or invincible, but because he's canny, stubborn, and just plain lucky enough to make it through.<br/><br/>This, in my opinion, may be one of the reasons that Indy is so likable and memorable a hero. He's as iconic and mythical as any superhero, yet in the end he's just one of us. He doesn't have the the superpowers of Superman, the endless resources and training of Batman, or the infallible intuition and instincts of James Bond; he's just a real-life guy thrust into a larger-than-life scenario, winging it the best he can. And furthermore, the movie wisely treats him as such. Through all the action scenes of the movie, there's nary a moment where the audience groans and thinks 'that could never happen' or 'there's no way he could survive that.' The movie pushes Indy's limits and the bounds of reality without ever outright breaking them.<br/><br/>And so while the movie may be remembered and acclaimed for its legendary stunts and set-pieces, and not improperly so, I would say credit should also be given to Indy himself for being a character who captured the imagination of viewers everywhere, myself included, by being a perfect mix of comic book hyperbole and real-life humanity."

","Why is this film so highly rated? I enjoyed it as a pop-corn adventure, but its IMDb ranking still seems too high. There's lots of action, most of it unbelievable, what with Nazis as the bad guys, but it's all good fun specially for kids. Harrison Ford is solid without being spectacular. His charisma helps a great deal. The music is annoying, constantly giving the viewers cues on when to laugh, cry, etc. Spielberg should have a little faith in his audience. Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best in the Indiana Jones series and is far superior to the recently released Indy adventure.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","It's a film I hadn't seen for years, until just now when the little one and I watched the RiffTrax version. We used to avidly follow MST3K's erratic adventures on Sci-Fi Channel UK until axed in the early Noughties, now it's reborn we've found a whole old new world out there to see again anew!<br/><br/>Story has hunky archaeologist trying to discover and then rescue the Ark of the Covenant through a sea of sweaty action adventures with Nazis, Arabs and snakes but this time with the bonus of 3 disembodied voices constantly taking the mickey out of everyone and everything on screen. As with all of the MST3K past classics it can be hit and miss  the misses are cues for the tumbleweed but when they hit it can be side-splitting stuff. I agree with my daughter in that I think they were better tearing into terrible old and/or dubbed movies (who can forget the unclassic Prince Of Space?), but they obviously would like to reach a broader audience with shorter memories  and as they say, some movies ask for it! This is the only way to see modern films, the only trouble being the process is irreversible - to watch the original in the original frame of mind ever again is impossible. I have no idea how they've got round copyright issues, just glad they did  or if they didn't, keep on running boys!<br/><br/>The film itself? There can't be really much left to say about a film that has sunk into movie-fans collective consciousness like this one has - it was OK then, but it's much better now."

","Written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, RAIDERS of the LOST ARK is a template for success in the genre. Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford)is a man's man, professor, acclaimed archaeologist and international adventurer that is hired by the US Government to locate the mystical Ark of the Covenant. Indy will need the aid of his ex-flame Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen), no stranger to archeology or adventure, as he embarks on a thrill filled quest for the Ark. He must make his discovery before a team of Nazis do. There is poison, snakes and plenty of traps as obstacles in the adventurous trek that leads to Nepal, marketplaces in Cairo, treacherous jungles in South America and a top-secret Nazis submarine base. In the end Indy and Marion witness the glorious unleashed power of the Lost Ark before the US Authorities have their way with the Biblical treasure. Others in this apt cast: John Rhys-Davies, Paul Freeman, Alfred Molina, Ronald Lacey and Wolf Kahler. This grand story of bravery, persistence and determination is glued together with the outstanding musical score by John Williams. This is the start of something good."

Raiders is classed as one of Spielbergs best films (along with ET, Close encounters and Schindlers list).

The Ark of the covenant is the best possible object for Indi to try and take out of the armies of darknesses hands.

","The film opens in the dark jungles of South America, the scene is set with a mysterious person dressed in a fedora, leather bomber jacket and carrying a whip, accompanied by a party also on the expedition. This scene is given a darkened tone by this mysterious man appearing as only a shadow in the distance, which is supported by dim lighting and an eerie score. All of a sudden, a gun is drawn upon the man by one of the party members, only for the man to break out his whip and disarm him, with a crack of a whip followed by an echoing gun shot. The mysterious man emerges from the shadows, introducing the audience to the legend himself Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true epic and original in terms of the adventurer genre. The opening scene with the golden idle, will always be remembered throughout cinematic history where Jones evades and escapes a number of booby traps. From then on the plot thickens, which involves Jones racing against the Nazis for the discovery of the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artifact that comprises the power of God. Throughout this conquest we see him fend off Nazis in a bar that is going up in flames, fend of Nazis in a Cairo marketplace, discover the existence of the Ark using the crystal medallion in a map room, uncover the Ark in a snake pit, fight Nazis in close proximity of a German bomber, re-claim the Ark in a truck chase and survive the almighty power of the Ark. Each scene is jam-packed full of adrenaline, excitement and suspense and will always be remembered throughout cinematic history.<br/><br/>This film could not have been what it was without the cast members that were chosen. Harrison Ford is the only person who could have played Indiana Jones, since not only was he able to play the action adventurer, but he was also able to play the university professor convincingly and also accurately. Karen Allen was excellently cast as Marion Ravenwood, since she did not just play a damsel in distress, but also was able to undertake a bit of action herself. Her chemistry with Ford was incredible and to date they have to be one of the best on-screen couples. Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq was outstanding as the villain, his overall presence was the reason for this. He did not ever fight Jones in hand-to-hand combat, but always had his henchman do the dirty work and tormented Jones with sharp and slimy lines in the process, while also claiming every archaeological find that Jones gets his hand's upon. His piercing blue eye's and his stinging French accent also gave him more of a darkened presence. Ronald Lacey as Major Toht also played an unforgettable villain, who makes a touching tribute to Peter Lorre. Jonathan Rhys-Davies role as Sallah gave the film some humour as well as some warmth and Alfred Molina makes one of his first screen appearances as Satipo, a role that certainly proved his acting capabilities.<br/><br/>The film is backed by excellent cinematography that is close to that of David Lean's work, an outstanding score by John Williams and production design by Norman Reynolds who designed the sets of the Well of the Souls, the Fertility Temple at the film's beginning and the Ark of the Covenant itself.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that gave rise to Indiana Jones that will continue to move audiences of all current and future generations."
"MaxBorg89","10","1","2","25 May 2008"," The adventure of a lifetime!
","When it comes to picking my favorite Steven Spielberg film, I never quite know which one to choose. To make things easier, I divided the movies in two categories: serious and ""popcorn"" (in the good sense of the word, naturally). As far as the first group is concerned, there is no doubt: the best of the serious films is Schindler's List, tightly followed by Saving Private Ryan. But in the blockbuster group, the dilemma emerges again: Jaws? E.T.? Close Encounters? They're all so good it's damn near impossible to select an absolute favorite. And then a series of images and sounds come to mind: boulders, Nazis, snakes, the legendary theme by John Williams, and many others, all related to the best trilogy of the '80s (yes, even better than Star Wars), and most of all to the unsurpassed first installment: Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Explicitly conceived by George Lucas as a revival of the adventure serials he enjoyed as a kid, Raiders has one word written all over it: fun. That's its reason to exist, and it never fails to deliver on those terms. From the moment archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is introduced, surviving death traps in South America, you know you're in for two hours of flawless entertainment: starting in the jungle, continuing in the desert and climaxing on a mountain top, Raiders takes Indiana, and the viewer, around the world on a never-ending ride disguised as the quest for the Ark of the Covenant.<br/><br/>The magic of the film, as pointed out by Total Film, is all in Spielberg's approach to the story: the sillier the concept, the less seriously you have to take it. Several lesser directors (Michael Bay first and foremost) have done exactly the opposite, sucking all the fun out of the picture. Raiders, on the other hand, rises above all its imitators because it knows how far from realistic Lawrence Kasdan's terrific screenplay is and turns that into an asset: Hitler's passion for the occult might even be based on fact, but the chances of Nazis cooperating with a French scumbag (Paul Freeman, excellent) to retrieve a source of unlimited mystic power are slim to say the least. Yeah, so what? The dialogue is consistently quotable, the music instantly hummable and the action scenes justly deemed some of the best ever filmed.<br/><br/>And then there's Ford: humane, sardonic, occasionally rude, occasionally a bad-ass, constantly lovable. Having already worked with Lucas on American Graffiti and Star Wars, he knows the right way to play the part and does so with utmost perfection. His charisma is ideally matched by Indiana's fundamental quality: he is no superhero, just a regular person who gets dragged in extraordinary situations. Also, for a genre defined by the charms of James Bond, he is all but invincible with the ladies, his love-hate relationship with Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), the first and best of the ""Indy girls"", going in the most unexpected directions for the whole duration of the feature. He's a unique character, aided by equally unique sidekicks (Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies) in a most outstanding genre picture.<br/><br/>To be brief: there is no reason why Raiders of the Lost Ark, alongside the other Indy movies, shouldn't be on every must-see list in the world. The Indiana Jones trilogy is a faultless combination of B-movie spirit and A-list talent that can't be described as a simple series of adventure or action films: it practically constitutes a genre of its own."
"adrongardner","10","1","2","13 March 2008"," Raiders of lost cinema
","The Greatest adventure movie of all time?<br/><br/>Its very possible. This folks is how its all done. Humor, drama, action. Its all here.<br/><br/>I think Raiders of the Lost arc is not only a wonderful piece of entertainment, the movie is also a showcase for what is wrong with many modern movies. Including those from both Spielberg and George Lucas.<br/><br/>Raiders is a movie that takes off running and never stops. The hocus-pocus story is high- cheese, yet we never question it for a second. The action set pieces are all good without coming off as overly deliberate or choreographed. It is not until the end are there really any effects to speak of, and this is where Raiders shines. The movie is driven almost completely by the great story and Harrison Ford's immortal portrayal of Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. <br/><br/>Later Spielberg and Lucas efforts, most notably the Star Wars Prequels and even Minority Report, are boondoggled with all sorts of visual computer wizardry, but the people and the story are both thinner than paper. Though for a half hour or so it proved to be an amazing theatrical ride, even Saving Private Ryan was plagued by a generic story, generic characters and a director all too obsessed with tanks and Thompson machine guns than the thoughts of the men carrying them.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Arc is old fashioned film-making full of dirt and grit. The sequels all were entertaining but none so convincing as the first. The acting, directing, editing, writing and of course, the amazing John Williams score meld to perfection. Indeed, this is how movies should be made. In the action genre, I don't think any other movie of its era, or even since, came come close other than Die Hard. More than 25 years later, Raiders of the Lost Arc has lost none of its shine. This is a movie filmmakers should study carefully, even the ones who made it. They haven't made much as solid as this since. Raiders of the Lost Arc is one of my favorite movies and probably one of the best movies that will ever be made."

","Raiders of the lost ark is a timeless classic. there now with that said and out of the way I can honestly say I feel that way because Raiders of the lost ark is perhaps the only movie that doesn't promise you anything but it gives you everything a movie lover wants. Clearly George Lucas and Spielberg's love affair with the old serials and old comic books paid off big. This movie is a homage to a age we will never see again the real golden age of movie making. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones forget the casting of Tom Selleck Selleck could not have pulled it off as well as Ford. Spielberg remarked that they needed a actor of the level of Bogart who both said would've been perfect for the role of Indy. I could see Bogart playing Indiana Jones and Grace Kelly or Lauren Bacall playing Marion Ravenwood while Errol Flynn could've chewed the scenery as Belloq or maybe Rathbone being Belloq. This movie is timeless and any cast from the golden age of Hollywood would've done justice to it. This movie needs to be in every serious movie lover's collection."

Harrison Ford is wonderful as our hero Dr. Jones, adding the right amount of bravado and seriousness to the role, whilst Karen Allen makes a very good feisty heroine as Marion Ravenwood. Also lending great support are Denholm Elliot as Indy's confidant Dr. Brody, John Rhys-Davies as good friend Sallah, Ronald Lacey as the ruthless Toht and Paul Freeman as adversary Belloq, a French archaeologist who has an equal interest in the Ark.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film is the epitome of adventure, and his direction suits the movie down to the ground. And the action is great fun as we cheer each time Indiana squeezes out of yet another thrilling tight spot, though never unscathed! Rounding off this very entertaining film is Michael Kahn's professional editing and John Williams' rousing, triumphant score which is instantly recognisable and, as Spielberg himself has said, ""the heartbeat"" from which this film flows. Special effects and stunts are also very impressive.<br/><br/>Thursday, December 30, 1993 - Astor Theatre<br/><br/>Unsurpassed as a classic genre piece and perhaps the most fantastic adventure flick of all time is Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". A roller coaster ride of thrills and spills, it follows the exploits of daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones from the treacherous jungles of South America to the searing deserts of Egypt as he searches for the Lost Ark of the Covenant in which the Hebrews kept the sacred stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments.<br/><br/>George Lucas' story is enthralling and oft times very funny, while Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay is well balanced and true to the fine script. Spielberg keeps the movie fast-paced while still allowing enough of the plot to sift through, Harrison Ford is ideally cast and crafts a memorable screen hero with his world weary, cynical and sharp performance. Karen Allen's portrayal of strong willed heroine Marion Ravenwood is impressive, Paul Freeman is most enjoyable as Indy's arch rival Rene Belloq, and the rest of the support cast (including John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliot and Ronald Lacey) are also marvellous.<br/><br/>Add to this superb craftsmanship the editing skills of Michael Kahn, the art direction/set decoration prowess of Norman Reynolds, the costume design which brings 1936 brilliantly back to life and the highly charged and exciting score from the pen of John Williams, and you have a most memorable film.<br/><br/>One can even forgive the razzle dazzle finale depicting the Wrath of God as He closes the lid on the Nazis.

""Now you're getting nasty."" <br/><br/>Quite simply one of the greatest screen adventures of all time and easily one of my favorite movies of all time. <br/><br/>The story introduces archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), who is hired by the U.S. government to go on a quest for the mystical lost Ark of the Covenant. Accompanied by his old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and ex-flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), he must retrieve the ark before the Nazis and his adversary, French archaeologist Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) acquire it first. <br/><br/>The first thing that strikes me about this movie is the performance of Harrison Ford, as Indiana Jones. There is a real dark edge to the character of Indiana Jones. For example, Raiders really hits on some of the emotional complexities of the character. I think the darkest aspect pursued in Raiders, is Indiana Jones relationship with Rene Belloq. (Paul Freeman) While, Indy used his strength, brawn and wit to defeat the bad guys, Belloq was much more cunning. <br/><br/>I also view Belloq as the most believable villain in the series, and as Belloq himself notes, to Indy: ?I am but a shadowy reflection of you.? He could see and cut right through Indy. I absolutely adore that entire scene with Indy meeting Belloq in a crowded bar. All around great stuff. <br/><br/>Karen Allen is also another reason, why Raiders is the best of the entire series. Her character is well developed, and perfectly played. I love her whole interactions with Ford, they had perfect chemistry together. I think my favorite scene between them is when Marion thinks the whip coiled on Indy's hip is a snake, and she attacks it with her torch- burning Indy, who replies. ?Ouch! Jesus!? Lastly, of all the gals throughout the series, Marion to me has the most charm. Be it striking that dude on the head with a frying pan, or challenging Belloq to a drinking contest in that dress! <br/><br/>I love that scene where Indy shoots down that one Arab guy with the sword, as well.

","A pitch perfect homage to the Republic Adventure Serials of the 1940's, directed with energy and assuredness of touch by Steven Spielberg who injects the B movie material with an attention to character and composition missing from the majority of comtempory blockbusters. Lawence Kasdan's script based on George Lucas's story is a masterclass in lean, affectionately crafted action cinema with any extraneous scenes torn out. Thus its effectively a series of finally crafted set pieces laced together with the odd expositionary moment where necessary, moving toward its exceptional climax, possibly one of the best of all time, with boundless enthusiasm, pace and wit. There is a line of argument, particularly amongst European Critics, that the success of Raiders...cemented a trend in American Cinema that had begun with Jaws and then Star Wars for the kind of thrill seeking feature that has lead to the degradation of so much big-budget output throughout the following 20 years. Its ironic certainly, because Raiders is such a well made and perfectly styled creation made with an obvious affection for a lost form that it effortlessly ellipses other films of its type and remains the benchmark by which this type of movie must be judged."

","Minor anachronisms in the interest of plot and convenience are fine, but it is annoying when a major plot line is based not only on something that didn't happen, but on something that couldn't have happened. It is laughable that the Nazis could have had a whole army charging around British-controlled Egypt in 1936.<br/><br/>However, what really lets this film down is that it moves from one set piece to the next relying on dumb luck. Jones is evidently a smart man, yet he never uses his noggin. He never has a coherent plan.

","Some films you can theorize about and speak in solemn tones about the nature of their artistry. Some films, on the other hand, just make you grin from ear to ear as you remember the sheer thrill of experiencing them for the first time. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is happily one of those second types of films, a movie you do not passively watch so much as you careen through with equal measures of fear and glee. It's the two-hour equivalent of the best amusement park ride you've ever been on, and I mean that as a sincere compliment. The opening scene alone is worth the price of a rental, as Harrison Ford's immortal Indiana Jones escapes an evilly booby-trapped treasure chamber only to run right into, and then past, an ambush. It contains one of the best fight scenes ever filmed, and possibly the best chase scene ever filmed.

At every oppurtunity the Germans have to simply kill him,they tell him their plans[James Bond style]and tie him up?Having got the Ark [and tied Indy up instead of killing him!] the ark kills the Germans but spares Indy!I KNOW its only a fantasy but people generally seem to regard it as a really great film-perhaps that says more about them?"

His goal of course is to find the Ark before the Nazi's do, and we're along for the ride!  The movie seems to climax several times, from the escape from Peru to the burning bar in Nepal.  The street fight, the discovery of the Ark, the fight beneath the flying wing, the desert chase, and of course the opening of the Ark.

","Everybody knows that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest films ever made.  I almost feel like I'm wasting my time commenting further on it. However, since I rank it at #1, I feel the need to justify it.<br/><br/>The amount of talent on board the filmmaking staff is staggering, and the film benefits most from their inspiring of each other.  Steven Spielberg's direction is impeccable.  He has an unparalleled ability to visually tell a story.  Clearly this man was put on Earth to make films.  Together with the creative mind of George Lucas, the great scripting of Lawrence Kasdan, and the masterful musical score from the master himself, John Williams, Spielberg makes us a part of the experience to the point where we forget we are watching a movie.  And let's not forget Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Can you imagine how much the picture would have lost had Tom Selleck, the original star of the film, had stayed on instead of Ford?  Ford's expressions, deliveries, and general mannerisms make the character his own. No matter the incredible and often superhuman tasks he pulls off, he's still just a regular Joe that with whom we can empathize.<br/><br/>""Raiders"" can be viewed again and again while the viewer's interest never fades.  It stops channel surfing in a heartbeat, despite editing and commercials.  When it's on, I'm just plain glad that I'm watching it.  It is perfect right down to the famous final shot (which tips its hat to the Godfather of American film: ""Citizen Kane"").  What more can I say that hasn't already been said?

"alice liddell","9","1","2","30 September 1999"," Weirdly dated, but still fun.
","There is very little, I find, more distressing than going back to films you loved as a child, and finding they weren't all that great after all.  For instance, obviously THE PHANTOM MENACE was an insulting atrocity, but I watched the revered trilogy beforehand, and found it - dare I say it? - a trifle monotonous.<br/><br/>RAIDERS isn't that bad - Spielberg is a director, whereas Lucas quite clearly isn't - but it has insuperable flaws I didn't think possible from such a master storyteller.  It sets itself up as a non-stop rollercoaster in the vein of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but, unlike that masterpiece, it has very tedious longueurs, and lacks that film's use of plot as character study. The film's racism is also more of a problem than it might have been when I was five, although Nazi caricatures will never cease to amuse.  The period detail is virtually non-existent.  And the storytelling and direction seems very jerky at times.  It certainly lacks the depth and power of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or E.T.<br/><br/>This doesn't stop the film being a pinnacle of entertainment, offering a multitude of pleasures.  It is a very canny film, as if Spielberg had read a book on Hollywood narrative conventions, and decided to joyously stretch them to parody.  For example, when we first hear of Indy's old teacher and the woman he left with, we expect a classic Oedipal conflict, but minutes later we find out he's dead.  The hero/villain doubling is blatantly alluded to, as if to save us the bother.  The typical Hollywood reining in of an independent, resourceful woman is textbook.<br/><br/>The usual course of the hero, with its obstacles and goals, is royally exaggerated: we can see Spielberg, a la Hitch, sadistically piling on the opponents  and life-endangering situations with a trowel, really putting Indy through it.  Each new difficulty is more dangerous, more complex, more ludicrous than the last, and yet Spielberg never lets down on the tension, never patronises his audience, as if he knows what we like, and knows that we know that he knows it, and are clever enough to know better, but craving escape enough to want it.<br/><br/>The film has a complexity enough if we want to look for it.  Indy's archaelogical plundering is mirrored by Spielberg's cinematic parasitism: the film is loaded with references to the aforementioned Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Leone, Huston, Welles, Hammer Horror and many others.  There is, despite the racism, an implicit critique of Indy's activities, and the outstanding closing shot, a very brave, dispiriting ending for a Hollywood film, is as much an admission of Hollywood's conventionalising of magic.<br/><br/>The Mcguffin of the Ark is brilliantly worked out, despite its patent silliness, and unlike Roger O. Thornhill in NORTHWEST, Indy does not mature, does not realise that human companionship is preferable to childish, egocentric abandoning of responsibility in favour of idiotic ideals that are none of his business.<br/><br/>So what are we left with?  Set-pieces to treasure, even though we know them inside out.  A lovely, spunky heroine in Karen Allen (whatever happened to her?), that will be sorely missed in the rest of the series.  Terrific visual gags and witty dialogue.  That wonderful theme tune that seems to ironise rather than lionise its hero.  An amazing Harrison Ford performance, gruff, comic, romantic, yet fundamentally insular and unyielding.  The film's superb patterning, e.g. the fire motif, or the connection between the tarantulas on Indy's back at the beginning, and the Nazis on the back of his truck near the end.  A Gilbert and Sullivan loving Arab sidekick.  Worth revisiting than: I just found it a little dated."

Holy Grail of all Adventure Movies?<br/><br/>It probably has to do with either one of two facts: either, one, I'm just turning into a sour old fart (not entirely unthinkable); or, two, and perhaps more germane, I've simply seen way more compelling and awesome fantasy-adventure-escapist movies in my time that beat the pants off of ROTLA.<br/><br/>As much as I know that fact number one may (sadly enough) be the truth, I'll just stick with number two. Let's face it, there are much better action-adventure movies out there. I won't bother posting a list of my favorites. Instead I would actually invite you to think about it, and look for your own favorites. Yes, they ARE out there...<br/><br/>Well, so hate me if you must for not jumping on the band wagon and shouting the praises of this movie to the heavens.

Booorring!<br/><br/>It WAS a good movie for its time though, and I will always have high praise for ROTLA for the way it added some real spice to the genre and helped launch better such movie projects in the years after it was released.

","This movie is like the 1930s Saturday matinee serials, and it has some fun moments, but it isn't a brilliant masterpiece, or anything close. It falls into the same category as George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" trilogy: fun, but not really intelligent. It's bizarre how people can confuse the two. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a very intriguing, though slight, plot and it is fun to see Indiana Jones search for the Ark of the Covenant while fending off the bad guys in some great action scenes. But the slight plot starts to wear very thin after the ark is discovered, and the movie dives into a constant battle of Indiana getting possession of the ark and Belloq taking it away, and it becomes very tedious. After the ark is discovered, the movie becomes plagued with filler scenes, beginning with the scene in which Indiana and Marion try to steal the plane, and continuing with the truck chase and the boat ride until the gruesome end, which is very lazily written. Sure, there are some fun moments, and those less interested in plot development will get a kick out of it, but a masterpiece, or even a very good movie, it isn't."

I know so much has been said.  My two cents' worth is.  A great character, one with incredible determination but human failings, a wonderful female sidekick with whom he has a history. A series of magnificent ""hopeless"" situations.  Nazis.  A mystical object from the Bible.  Pacing that is exquisite.  One narrow scrape after another. Broken ribs.  Carrying on with broken ribs.  Just enough of the supernatural to make for a good conclusion (although, how do the heroes know that you're not supposed to look at things), though the majority of the film is about real people in the most insane maze of events.  I saw this in the theater the second day it was out.  It hadn't had the hoopla that the Star Wars movies had had.  I came out of it feeling so excited that someone in the movie industry could spin such a tail and conclude it in the most satisfying way.  I would love it if when adventure movies were made, that someone could keep a sense of humor once in a while and let these fine actors put life into wonderful characters."

","Here's a sordid confession - when I was twelve or so, I preferred ""Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom"".  A few years later, when ""Last Crusade"" was released, I thought that IT was the best in the trilogy.  Yes, that's the kind of fool I was.  I even thought that sections of ""Raiders"" were just a trifle dull.  THAT'S the kind of fool I was.<br/><br/>But I grew up, and, as you would expect, my admiration for the first Indianna Jones film has done nothing but increase; it's now clear as day to me that it's the best thing Spielberg has ever done.  (Not quite clear as day.  In order to be sure I'd have to see ""The Sugarland Express"".)  For this film alone Spielberg deserves a place at the High Table with the great directors.  It's one of the most purely pleasurable cinematic outings of all time.  Perhaps we can't credit Spielberg for the perfectly cantilevered script (what a pity it was to spoil its perfection, by making other Indianna Jones films, good though the second one was), or for the tub-thumpingly terrific musical score.  How lucky Spielberg was to find John Williams, a composer not afraid to write actual music, as opposed to mood noises; nor afraid to take everything seriously, even as he underlined the humour.  Like Spielberg himself.  And I suppose Spielberg was lucky to make the film in 1981.  Made today, it would be arch and hip and flippant, it would showcase inferior special effects, and the soundtrack would be poorly recorded.<br/><br/>But good fortune is a tiny part of the story.  This is CLEARLY a film made by a director with eagle-eyed quality control: it contains not a weak shot, nor a dead scene, nor an uncommitted performance, nor a dud line.  (Whatever happened to that director?)  You may START, as I did, thinking of it as a slightly-too-slow-but-still-fun adventure yarn ... but as you watch it again and again (and you will), you'll come to realise that it's a cinematic masterpiece."

","One of the strong points of this film is the detail in the settings and the nature of adventure.

Then we move to the colourful Nepal setting and lastly the Egypt setting. At this point of the film I thought it would become an epic picture. However I was quite wrong.<br/><br/>The major fallacies of the film are the religious overtones that are ever-present in the film. It becomes suffocating. I know that Hitler actually did send expeditions during the war to uncover certain places/artifacts that would increase the power of the Nazi regime. What doesn't make sense is why Hitler would search for the Ark of the Covenant which is solely Jewish and Hitler despising Jews. It seemed quite illogical.<br/><br/>Secondly the score is over the top and actually draws you away from the film. Constantly you will hear the Indiana Jones theme song being pulsated into your ear. It comes to a point where it is incredibly overbearing.<br/><br/>Thirdly the action scenes are dull and prolonged. To put it simply the actions scenes are like watching two snails brawling. Being an adventure film of epic proportions this film should have had interesting action scenes however yet again it falls short.<br/><br/>The immersion that was seen in the beginning of the film with Indiana searching for the golden artifact completely disappears in the later sections of the film. When Indiana is searching for the Ark the same level of detail and immersion is completely missing and ruins the scene.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is enjoyable but the fallacies ultimately cheapen the viewer's experience."

Adored it then, entertained though mildly irritated by it now. It is not an adult film and should not be seen by adults who remember it fondly. The joins in the plot show far more, the setting up of 'memorable' moments calculated to make an audience respond like children in a sideshow - i.e use of spiders and snakes, a jeckyll and hyde hero (teacher turned adventurer) bumbling Nazis. It is a super hero film pure and simple, with mild humor - it needed more of this, which the second film remedied - and not very original shocks. Of course it is made with the full force of the Hollywood film industry behind it (imagine a Goliath holding up an ant)and Spielberg stages the action scenes very well. But the whole mumbo jumbo story coupled with the embarrassing music, starts to grate. There are some fringe benefits for the oldies: John Rhys Davies' booming voice, Karen Allen's scene with the French baddie - she obviously prefers him to Indy who forgets her in seconds when he's 'digging' or whatever. The gleaming photography of desert landscapes and middle eastern towns is evocative, though in some ways too good for the material - it evokes more emotion than the plot or the actors, whose only real emotions are made of of grunts and shrieks. This is partly why the comedy doesn't totally work - the photography undermines it. Still the whole thing is fine if you're about to sprout your first pimple, but you wish they spent this much effort and talent on something that resonated more and not comic books. This is one of the films that kicked off the whole superhero mania that still crowds out anything more 'thoughtful' these days."

He is only a College Proffesor remember.<br/><br/>The film is never too dull throughout. between action scenes, there will always be a good bit of dialogue and nothing to pointless that you'll be egging the character to hurry up. It's near perfection.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of films I've seen today, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (as well as the rest of the Indiana Jones Trilogy, has that fantastic feeling of viewer satisfaction of suspense followed by relieve. Yes, you KNOW for a fact that Indy will ""whip"" (sory about the bad pun) his way out of any obstacle placed before him, but you're never too sure. it seems that whoever planned out the action scenes (Whether is was Spielberg, Lucas or some other guy), knew exactly how to make us slide further and further to the edge of our seats just because we were almost certain that our be-hatted hero was going to fall to a sticky demise. But no. ALWAYS, and I repeat, ALWAYS, AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE, The theme will blare up, Indy will turn around and completely turn things to his advantage. This has never grown old on me and even when i watch it again I still feel that he won't make it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd better stop otherwise I'd be going on for a few pages. In short: It's got Spielberg, Lucas, Harrison Ford and it's probably on second to the Star Wars Trilogy.<br/><br/>NEED I SAY MORE?"

","This film is a fine adventure classic in the spirit of the old Saturday matinée serials, with one escape from danger or death after another. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are a great team who, in spite of personal issues between them, manage to stay one jump ahead of the Nazis who also covet the ark and its great mysteries. After some narrow escapes in South American jungles against assorted evils, Ford and Allen embark on a worldwide journey which ends in Egypt where a local contact and guide provides aid and advice as the search begins for the ark. A Nazi doctor also covets both the ark and Allen for his own personal prize. The snake pit scene is one of the most harrowing scenes and is filled with great drama and horror. The stunt work is great throughout the picture even though some of the escape routines are pure hokey. The film is great fun and spawned several sequels because of its wide popularity."

","Classic scenes abound for sure, but unfortunately they're spread around some of the most lull-inducing moments ever.  Somehow most of the general world overlooked my problems and cherish this thing.  I can almost see how: the huge rolling boulder; the truck chase; and of course, the snakes.  Which makes me not hate this, but really look at it as a missed oppurtunity.  It starts when Ford retrieves a small statue in the opening moments of the film, painting himself some sort of adventurer.  It ends up that he's an archaeology proffessor who makes the occassional globe trotting adventure to pick up nicknacks here and there.  His college receives information on the Lost Ark, which is, as one character puts it, ""a radio for talking to God"". Ford's motto for most things is that it belongs in a museum, so he sets off after it.  But in between some dynamite action sequences are far too many dialogue passages that just lose you (or just me, I guess).  Take the scene in the college auditorium that goes on and on and on and...  Arks and staffs and myths and locations.  Just get on with it!  Then there's stuff with the Nazis and Allen's character, showdowns in pup tents, among other things. Plus a suprising amount of gore at the end, with melting faces and suctioned bodies.  John Williams contributes another classic score which I still whistle twenty years later.  I have found a few like me who must fast-forward a lot of the time, but don't take my word, most everyone adores this."

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is just the kind of movie that serves its purpose: it is entertaining, thoroughly enjoyable with great actors; and most of all, just plain fun.<br/><br/> Harrison Ford plays Dr. ""Indiana"" Jones, a knowledgeable professor by day, famed archeologist by night (sorta). After he loses the glasses and suit at night (or when his darker, more adventurous side is needed), and equips himself with a whip and a hat, he becomes the most adventurous history-powered character in.well.history.<br/><br/>This time around (well, the first time for the audience), Jones is hired by the American government to find a mysterious, Biblical artifact named ""The Ark of the Covenant,"" which, anyone who has gone to Bible school should know, is a very powerful weapon that only priests could touch without dying as history tells. Well, guess what? Some Nazis are hoping to find it before Jones and they want to - wait for it - use it as a weapon.  This cannot happen. So Indy gears up and ships out to get them thar' Nazis (I love talking in hick language during plot summaries!) along with an old flare, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who has in her possession a very important medallion.<br/><br/> ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" achieves its goal of being not only a great popcorn flick, but also a great flick in all sense of the word. It delivers the goods in more than one way.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is completely believable as Indy, a guy who is not as gung-ho as the stereotypical heroes of the average adventure-dramas. We feel that he is at many times stressed with his missions but carries them out with a smug smirk anyway, just because he is Indy, and that's what he does.<br/><br/> Karen Allen provides just enough umph and sassiness to the film to keep the plot and character progression moving, as well as to add a few gray hairs to Indy's head.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg directs this film excellently with help from writer/co-producer George ""Star Wars"" Lucas and Philip ""The Right Stuff"" Kaufman. The cinematography is beautiful, and the camerawork brings out the emotions in the characters in both visual and symbolic ways.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Raiders..."" has established itself as a film franchise in of itself over the years, spawning two (no, wait, an upcoming three) sequels since its release in 1981. When it came out it was a huge hit, and now it is marked in history books, as well as having been branded in the culture of not only America, but also the whole world.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is without a doubt one of the best adventure movies ever, that set the path for many films we see today.

"DesertDogMedia","7","1","5","8 August 2014"," Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark
","Title: Indiana Jones - Raiders of the Lost Ark<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: Indiana Jones has to find the Ark of the covenant before a group of rogue Nazis do. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: The two roles people know Harrison Ford for playing are Han Solo from Starwars and Indiana Jones from Indian Jones. These are well known because they are both high budget Hollywood movies in which Harrison does a good acting roles. Now name another movie he is in bar these, apart from Blade Runner and Apocalypse Now there are not very many memorable movies that he in is. But regardless he is the driving force of this movie, chances are this movie wouldn't be as entertaining if there was a different actor playing Indy. Everyone else was good at their roles, but they were overlooked because of the focus on Indy the movie kept pushing you onto. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: Worms eye view from the bottom of the pit in the first scene<br/><br/>Costume: The Afrika Korps uniforms are correct, but not needed in this movie as the Afrika Korps weren't formed until years after this movie was created. Indiana Jones' outfit is a timeless classic look at even the youth of today would recognize. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: Red Knee Tarantulas seen in the first scene of the movie are native to Mexico only, guess where that first scene isn't set. Most of the snakes in the 'Well of Souls' are not native to Africa, such as Burmese Python and Reticulated Python. I would also expect there to be a lot of death snakes there as it looks like they're not getting out of that well. Sand weights less than gold, if the idol in the first scene is pure gold, Indy would need a much bigger bag of sand.<br/><br/>Incorrect History: The German Afrika Korps didn't exist until 1941. Indy is going to blow up the Ark with a rocket launcher which doesn't exist at that time. MP-40 submachine gun was inservice 1938, P-38 pistol was inservice 1938 also, two years after when this movie is set. Marcus Brody says ""The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains and laying waste to entire regions"" This isn't in the bible. In 1936 there were British military posts in Egypt, so chances are Nazis wouldn't be able to dig, let alone force Egyptians to dig without the British Army finding out. <br/><br/>Incorrect Geography: Thailand was known as Siam until 1939, this movie takes place in 1936 and has Thailand written on a map. Jordan was known as Transjordan until 1949, another incorrect map.<br/><br/>Overall Feel: Classic action/adventure movie with a historical theme and romance subplot. One of, if not the best movie in the Indiana Jones quadrilogy. It does need to learn its history though as there are too many incorrect science and incorrect history moments in here"

I mean, Germans are presented like stupid robots. They don't even have the ability to move when they are in danger or something, they just wait to die. Most of the scenes and character decisions are really unlikely to happen in real life, that's something i can't forgive even in the fantasy/adventure movie.

","The perfect action-adventure matinée movie? Damn near close. If I had to pick it apart I could find a couple of things that aren't exactly flaws but just aren't sensible (ie how Marion just happens to be alive with the explanation of one line). But who need sense when you've got HISTORY, DR JONES?! One thing I noticed this time around though - Marion is really a bad-ass woman! In the annals of tough gals, she may not be Ripley but she could hold her own in a bar fight that had Ripley in it (see how she drinks anyone under the table, and can be sly with a, uh, butter knife!) Maybe it's just in comparison to the horror that is Kate Capshaw, the polar opposite of bad-ass.<br/><br/>But yeah, what else can be said? It's the kind of storytelling that feels so seamless that it almost goes by in a flash, but there's still so much UMPH in those action set-pieces, primarily when Jones is chasing Belloq and the Nazis and drives the truck. Damn if that still doesn't rock one's the socks off. One last thing - the special effects was done by Richard Edlund, who three years later would make the masterpiece of his 80's career with Ghostbusters - I say that since now I can't watch certain sky and make-up fx in this film without yelling ZUUL!"

","This is the first of the great trilogy by a great director, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Steven Spielberg (Jaws, E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Harrison Ford (originally meant to be Tom Selleck) stars as Indiana Jones, a hero with a felt hat and a whip. The film begins with a great scene where Indy tries to get an ancient gold statue. Then obviously the main story comes, some U.S. government have heard that the German Nazis (oh, this is 1936, during World War II) are searching for religious artefacts in Cairo, more prominently the Lost Ark (the Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments). It is Indy's job to stop them from getting this Ark, otherwise they could unleash an unnatural force that can probably wipe out anything and everything. Indy is accompanied by his past girlfriend Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) who has something to get him started with his search. He doesn't know it yet, but the man mainly responsible for helping out and leading this dig, along with French Major Arnold Toht (Ronald Lacey), is his old enemy (the one who nicked his gold statue), Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman). What follows is obviously lots of gun play, a lot of German Nazis, some explosions and a little bit of fantasy. Also starring John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, BAFTA nominated Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody, Alfred Molina as Satipo and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich. This is a fantastic start to the great trilogy, the third film is still my favourite, but you must see the one that started it all. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Music for John Williams, a Special Achievement Award and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTA for Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Film. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

"agentbond","1","3","67","23 February 2001"," One of the best Action/Adventure movies of all-time.
","If adventure has a name...it must be Indiana Jones. That line says it right there. The contrast between this movie and all of the heros before it was that Indy was human. He gets hurt, unlike his predecessor James Bond. With whip and revolver in hand, Indiana was an exotic hero. Indy was sofisticated (a college professor), he was handsome and adventurous. Harrison Ford was liked by all audiences, women found him attractive, men found him daring. Qualities found in Brittish spy, James Bond. Most people know now that Steven Spielberg was denied the directors position for a 007 film. He teamed up with George Lucas to make an American hero- Indiana Jones. There are many parallels between the two characters, but I'm not going to get into that. Another thing that made Raiders great was the plot itself. An archeologist travels around the world to find the Ark of the Covenant- the ark that contained the 10 Commandments and was said to have special powers. Indy gets entangled with a rival French archeologist who is working with the Nazis. An amazing story which keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time. What keeps you there is not just the plot or action sequences, it is also the score by John Williams. Some of the best soundtracks are from John Williams (Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman). This adrenaline-pumping score of the Raiders March makes you wish you had a theme song everytime you walked into a room. This is a great movie, it should be seen by anyone who enjoys a good adventure."

Everyone knows the theme and recognizes the hero with the hat and whip. I think that's why this movie gets so much hype. It's so iconic and nostalgic that people overlook everything else.<br/><br/>The story is pretty mindless. It's a race to see who can find the ark first. Indy always gets outsmarted by the other guys but manages to escape again and again. There's no real dialog that has any depth to it and as great as the soundtrack is, it is also distracting. The ending is kind of lackluster. I mean, the face melting is cool, but afterwards it just ends with no real resolution.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's just an ok action/adventure movie that happens to have a really charismatic and iconic hero. I'm not even a fan and I was Indiana Jones for Halloween one year. But if you want a great adventure movie, there are others that beat this by a mile. In my opinion, the Goonies is a 10x better adventure movie. The characters have emotions and a reason to fight, the bad guys are funny but not in a cheesy way, the soundtrack is incredible but not intruding, and the ending has a true resolution that leaves you smiling.

Too much is unbelievable and for effect and the convenience of the story only.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones and makes a likable hero. The only problem I have with this character, is how easily (and seemingly mercilessly) he randomly kills people. Interesting, considering he is a professor. Marion (Karen Young) just as easily kills people left, right and centre without blinking an eye. But then again, we don't really know her background, so she might be a cold-blooded killer for all I know.<br/><br/>The slapstick humor at times ruins the suspense and excitement of the film, but I suppose Spielberg didn't want to make the film too serious (interesting then where all the killings fit in if not to be taken seriously...).<br/><br/>The action and adventure is non-stop and it truly is entertaining. I love archeological action adventure films. I thoroughly enjoyed the locations as well, and the fact that the film was shot on location - a term that might be a phenomenon in the near future no thanks to CGI. I also enjoyed all the practical effects and the loads of stunts the film has to offer. They also used 7,000 real snakes for the film, instead of CGI. That's what I love about films from the 80's. This was still real film making, instead of doing (almost) everything from behind a desk!<br/><br/>If you don't take the film too seriously and overlook the many plot flaws (and that very weird ending) then this is a film to enjoy again and again purely for the adrenaline rush. They simply don't make them like this anymore..."

","No, not really, but is a pretty good film, maybe one of my favorites. It has some great action, some great characters and everything in here is about the rule of cool. Indiana Jones is a perfect character who gets everything right. He is smart, strong and catches every woman he wants. This would usually not be a great idea for a character, but it works perfectly in here. The difference between Indiana Jones and any self-insertion character, is that, actually, even if i don't look for self-insertion, is a very fun character. He has personality, and even if it doesn't have flaws, at least is entertaining to watch. The film is also great generating suspense, constructing the mystery of the lost ark, and at the end, giving a very satisfying conclusion. Great story, great action, simply great. Raiders of the lost ark is one of the, if not the, most memorable films i've ever seen. Even if the characters were boring, the scenes work perfectly."

The 1981 classic captures your cravings for adventure that you haven't had since you were a young boy or girl. It plays into imagination in a way that no movies succeed in today. Harrison Ford plays a timeless character, which is even more scruffy looking and bad-ass than his previous iconic role as Han solo. Beyond the dusty surface of Raiders, lays a deeply genius film.

In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. <br/><br/>Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic.

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is universally considered to be an extremely entertaining action/adventure movie, so I won't waste your time reviewing the film itself. If you've already seen it, you know it's awesome; if you haven't... well, to quote Indiana Jones himself: ""Trust me."" It actually does live up to the hype. What's truly important for those thinking about purchasing this ""special edition,"" however, is a discussion of the bonus material.<br/><br/>The extras on this disc definitely do NOT warrant purchasing this edition if you already own the previously-released Indy Trilogy DVD set. The extras can basically be summed up in a word: ""meh."" Each of the handful of featurettes is around 10 minutes or less, and there are no surprises. Some brief ""making-of"" clips from the filming of ""Raiders"" are semi-interesting, but are all very short. Another featurette is just a bunch of actors from the series making bland comments about how great Indiana Jones is, set to overly-familiar clips from the various movies (Watch Indy run from the giant ball! Now watch him shoot the swordsman!). The endless repetition of clips from the movie is one of the tiresome aspects of DVD bonus material, and serves mainly to make you so sick of the film that you don't want to see it again for awhile! The best featurette is the one about how they did the ""melting face,"" but even this is short and, really, no great shakes. Next is the apparently mandatory ""for interest to fanatics only"" stuff like storyboards and a gallery of production stills.

","The opening scenes of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK had me convinced we were seeing something special- the discovery of the vine-overgrown temple ruins, the penetration to the heart of the temple and the theft of the golden statue, the subsequent hair-raising escape from the self-destructing structure... it was all fantastic. It was at that point that the movie began to self-destruct. It went from being a fast-paced action film to an uneven love story cum religious tract. Granted, a good many of the serials that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK borrows from (sometimes, shot for shot) aren't as accomplished overall- but, back in the day, those 12 to 15 chapter serials were done for a lot less than the cost of the titles for a Big Budget effort like this. There ARE a good many sequences throughout the movie, but there are also a good many less-than-impressive sequences and lapses in logic and unexplained plot points that remain (one of my pet peeves has always been the idea that Jones somehow managed to ride a submerged Nazi submarine halfway around the world, a point that was taken up in an episode of THE BIG BANG THEORY, but I've never seen the missing scene that allegedly explains the discrepancy)."

","If the Dos Equis guy is the ""the most interesting man in the world"", then Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is the most adventurous man in the world. Armed with a fedora, a whip, and his trusty pistol, Indiana Jones is brains and brawl all wrapped in one. Who else would bring a whip to a sword fight and actually win? There's only one, and he is the most adventurous man in the world, Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Sent on a mission by the United States government, Indiana Jones tries to stop an old foe Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) from helping the Nazis find the scared Ark of the Covenant. Who knew archeology was so adventurous?<br/><br/>However, Raiders of the Lost Ark was more than just an action film pitting good versus evil on the big screen. It's also a love story wrapped inside chase scenes and encounter with poisonous snakes; and if there is one thing that Indiana Jones hates its snakes. If Indiana Jones is going to successfully find the Ark of the Covenant he will need the help of an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Marion is tough, and can hold her own and can certainly hold her liquor, and she's the keeper of a secret tool Indiana Jones needs to find the prize Ark. But if he wants it, then she's going with him. Her sense of adventure and fighting skills are on par with Indy's, but her ability to escape trouble could put her and Indiana Jones' life on the line. Save the girl, or finish the mission, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a love story wrapped inside an action adventure movie.<br/><br/>The first of four in this series, Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the leader of the pack. This film may not have all the visual effects Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull possessed (2008), but the story line, the fighting, and even the old school visual effects helped to make this movie an all-time classic that will live on for generations to come.<br/><br/>There is only one man to call when the world needs to be saved from Nazis in search of a lost ark of the covenant. He's the only man who can go toe to toe with poisonous snakes, or fight his way out of trouble, and still keep his patent fedora hat firmly planted on his head. He is the most adventurous man in the world, and his name is Indiana Jones."

"dietri03","8","0","2","22 March 2014"," Raiders of the Lost Ark Film Analysis
","Raiders of the Lost Ark stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist who is on the hunt for the Ark of the Covenant, as contracted by the United States Army. Jones begins his quest by visiting Marion Ravenwood, played by Karen Allen, in hopes of securing the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, which is a key piece to discovering the location of the Ark. Indiana and Marion find themselves in Cairo, being attacked by Nazi's and pursued by Dr. Rene Belloq, played by Paul Freeman. Rene is also an archaeologist in search of the Ark of the Covenant, although his mission is to secure it for the Nazi's and has become the rival of Indiana Jones. <br/><br/>An ever present theme in this film is the moral implication to never give up. The opening scene follows Indiana as he enters a cave to recover a golden idol. He overcomes walking through jutting spears, swinging over a bottomless pit and stepping on the right cobblestones to avoid death. Once he grabs the idol the entire cave is set off of every trap possible. He ends up on the wrong side of the bottomless pit without his whip to get him back across, left hanging into the bottomless pit from a broken vine after attempting to jump over, and chased by a large spherical ball the size of the walkway in the cave. Yet he persevered, never giving up and leaving the cave with the idol in his hands. <br/><br/>In the next scene where he is outside of the cave, Dr. Rene takes the idol from Indiana. This is another example of never giving up as Indiana manages to escape from the natives and arrive home to teach another day at the campus where he is a professor. In addition, he takes another job offered by the United States Army to recover the Ark of the Covenant. Indiana did not let his loss of the idol keep him from trying again on another artifact. <br/><br/>Following the opening of the film, the theme is present through every action that Indiana takes to the end of the film. While Indiana is with Marion at her tavern, Indiana does not give up when the Nazi's attack looking for the headpiece. While shopping in the marketplace in Cairo with Marion, Nazi's spring forth and attack, seizing Marion. Indiana doesn't give up and instead finds the Well of Souls where the Ark is buried and recovers it. He then fights through the Nazi's and saves Marion, taking both her and the Ark with him on a ship to sail to the United States. After the ship is attacked and both Marion and the Ark are taken from him, Indiana persists still, finding himself tied to a pole with Marion while Dr. Rene and the Nazi's open the Ark to find their doom. Through persistence and perseverance, Indiana Jones recovers the Ark and Marion through his devotion to never give up. <br/><br/>The musical score helps to aid the viewer in obtaining the desired feelings by director Steven Spielberg. Through each action scene, music was played that created a heightened sense and built anxiety within the viewer to wonder how Indiana Jones would come out of each fight and trap. There are countless scenes like this throughout the film, including the riot at the marketplace in Cairo and the air strip at the military base in the desert. In each of these scenes, the music plays louder than the previous scenes and the instruments and other sounds portrayed through the musical score are quick, short and blunt. <br/><br/>In addition to the musical score, the other sounds that were used throughout the film help the viewer to become engaged with the film. At the marketplace in Cairo as Marion is running away from a Nazi with a frying pan in her hands, she runs into a dimly lit open doorway to a building and the Nazi follows after. Although the viewer never sees what happens inside of the building, the viewer hears the ""GONK!"" noise of a frying pan, followed by the Nazi falling back out of the doorway unconscious. The sound emanating from sources not on the screen, are used to extend the dimensions of the film beyond what is seen and to achieve more powerful dramatic effects. Although the viewer doesn't see Marion hit the Nazi or move the body herself, it can be assumed as the viewer watched her run into the building with the frying pan, hear the noise of the frying pan, watch the body fall and watch the body move into the building. <br/><br/>A newer series of films that expresses this moral implication of never giving up is those that include the character of Iron Man. In the movie Iron Man, Tony Stark never gave up in his hopes to escape being held captive in Afghanistan. He later never gave up his quest for green energy by developing the arc reactor. In Iron Man 3 and The Avengers, Tony Stark had accomplished creating an entire building that was completely supported by an arc reactor. In The Avengers, Tony never gave up his ultimate quest to protect the world from obliteration and sacrificed himself for the good of humanity. By never giving up, Tony Stark was able to accomplish all of these things and more.<br/><br/>Through the anticipation, anxiety and heightened feelings brought by the musical score and the engagement of the viewer through sounds within the film, the viewer is forced to follow Indiana Jones and be waiting for more action. The feelings of the viewer are in favor of Indiana Jones and they strive to be successful like Indiana Jones. Through his belief of never giving up he was able to accomplish what he set out to do, with a happy ending."

Plenty of intentional humour to relieve tension and suspense, to give the viewer a chance to breathe.

"awesomesteinberg","10","0","1","20 February 2014"," The Ultimate Action Film, Spielberg's Best
","When Jaws was released in 1975, it became a global phenomenon, gaining universal praise, (Hey look, praise for a movie released by Universal) grossing over $400,000,000, keeping many out of the water, and made a star out of its director, Steven Spielberg. His 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released to similar success, and is now one of the classic of the science-fiction genre. His next film, however, 1941, was a colossal bomb, showing that as good as he was, he wasn't invincible. So for his next project, he turned to his friend George Lucas (Director of Star Wars), and told him of his plans to direct a James Bond movie. Lucas then presented a similar character he had come up with, Indiana Smith, a homage to adventure serials from the forties and fifties. The two then collaborated on the project, with Spielberg directing and Lucas producing, and created what is now known as Raiders of the Lost Ark. (With the protagonist changed from Smith to Jones)<br/><br/>For the two people on the planet who have not seen this movie, here is the basic premise: In 1936, Indiana Jones is an archaeologist who is recruited to find and retrieve the lost Ark of the Covenant, which is essentially ""a radio to God"", which could make whoever carries it invincible. The problem is that Hitler is also interested, and evil Nazis are trying to recover it for their army. What ensues is the greatest adventure film ever made. (I'm not exaggerating at all)<br/><br/>The movie has so many strong points I don't know where to start, but I'll begin with the obvious: Harrison Ford is the best possible pick for Indiana Jones imaginable. He doesn't just play Indy, he IS Indy. He is both awesome and yet barely able to make it through the movie's many fight scenes. (Well, except the one fight that is played for laughs) You like him so much that you want to see him win. It's because of how he barely does this that you realize, ""This could be me in this scene!"" He brings the right amount of relatablility and awesomeness to the role. Maybe the movie could work with someone else in the role, but it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as awesome.<br/><br/>Everyone else is good too; Karen Allen is excellent in here, (She seems a little stubborn and like a damsel in distress at times, but Willie in Temple of Doom is a hundred times worse) Paul Freeman as Belloq is a fantastic villain (He's almost like Indy; he's an archaeologist looking for the Ark but is just more evil), John Rhys-Davies is pretty entertaining to watch as Sallah, and Denholm Elliot's Marcus Brody (Possibly related to Martin in Jaws) is a good father figure in here (But don't worry, we'll get Sean Connery later).<br/><br/>This movie just looks incredible. The set design is very engrossing, the cinematography is tremendously well shot, and the stunts and other effects are so well integrated you can't tell which is which (Just like Jurassic Park).<br/><br/>The movie also sounds good too. The soundtrack by John Williams is amazing. He really knows how to make iconic themes almost effortlessly (No wonder he's my favorite film composer). And the sound effects are pretty good too.<br/><br/>But finally, we get to the best parts of this movie: The script and action sequences. It is very well written, taking place in a period where the Nazis (The only villain more evil is the devil; wait, I've found a villain for Indy 5!) are going to be part of the story no matter what, and it completely embraces its simple adventurous tone by going all-out in order to make this as entertaining as possible. And boy does it deliver! We get one great action scene, another great one, some exposition that manages to not be boring, more action, more action, some more action, some humor here, a little setup here, action, action, action, humor and action (You know what scene I'm talking about), action, action, action, awesome John Williams theme here, action, a little more action, and a breathtaking climax. (Complete with a shot that takes a page from Citizen Kane's book) So yeah, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the essential action movie, and definitely Steven Spielberg's best film. If for some odd reason you haven't yet seen this, (gasp!) watch it immediately, and if you have, watch it anyway! This is a perfect 10/10, and easily in my top 10 favorite films.<br/><br/>And if you want to know my order of preference for the Indiana Jones movies, here it is: Raiders, Last Crusade, Temple, Kingdom."
"antagonist117","9","0","1","20 February 2014"," One of the first ""modern"" action blockbusters, but with the enduring aura of a classic
","One of the things that makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stand out among ""modern"" action movies, i.e. action movies in the era of summer blockbusters that Lucas helped to create, is the way that it seems to have been transported to us from an earlier time. It is well-known that George Lucas was interested in recreating the feel of 1930s and 1940s adventure and sci-fi serials, not only for Indiana Jones but for Star Wars as well. The Indiana Jones movies, and ""Raiders"" most of all, therefore does not look like a big-budget production. It makes very little obvious use of special effects technology, even less so than Star Wars which had mostly used practical effects such as scale models and puppets. The distinctive Indiana Jones color palette is drab, from the tweedy earth-tones of an archaelogy professor's office to the olives and grays of WWII-era military vehicles to the unadorned off-whites of a desert tent village. The movie's image quality is, by design, ever so slightly dusty and murky. It feels nostalgic and vintage, and I recall it feeling that way even when I first encountered it as a child in the early 1990s. It feels small and unprepossessing, like a secret that very few have uncovered. It is like nothing so much as an old classic newly rediscovered. Perhaps that is also what helps keep it fresh so many years later. To rediscover it now, or ten years ago, or ten years from now, is to be transported not to 1981 but to a mythical version of the 1930s, reimagined here as the last age of globe- trotting adventurers, with a layover travel map a la ""Casablanca,"" and Arabian bazaars and snakes and pith helmets and, of course, those ever- scheming Nazis. It doesn't hurt that the story is rock-solid and moves along at a perfect clip, that the script hits every note it aims for from humorous to mystical to ""epic,"" and that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have great chemistry together (she should have been his partner throughout the trilogy; she radiates confidence and power even when the script tries to limit her to the pot-smashing damsel-in-distress role.) It may seem strange that such a purely entertaining movie, with no whiff of a message and no grand artistic pretensions, would occupy such a prominent place in the history of film, comfortably making both AFI lists of the 100 best American movies and enjoying almost universal critical and popular acclaim. But since you have seen it, as almost everyone of all ages has, you know why it does."

It takes place in Africa, Nepal, Egypt, at sea and in a secret submarine base. It contains trucks, bulldozers, tanks, motorcycles, ships, subs, Pan Am Clippers, and a Nazi flying wing. It has snakes, spiders, booby traps and explosives. The hero is trapped in a snake pit, and the heroine finds herself assaulted by mummies. The weapons range from revolvers and machine guns to machetes and whips. And there is the supernatural, too, as the Ark of the Covenant triggers an eerie heavenly fire that bolts through the bodies of the Nazis. Watch it with someone you know fairly well. There will be times during the film when it will be necessary to grab somebody.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a swashbuckling adventure epic in the tradition of ""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" the James Bond pictures, and all the other multimillion-dollar special-effects extravaganzas.

So then he goes into a cave to find it and find lots of traps along the way, from spike walls, to a giant pit and shooting darts it can be very dangerous but not for Indiana Jones. So he manages to grab the idol and exit the cave, but then people take the idol from him and so he runs off and escapes. He then returns back to his home and then a guy comes in and talks to him about going on another adventure so he sets off to India and battles bad guys with his whip and kicks ass. The movie is over 2 hours long and has lots of action and disturbing scenes at times but is great classic to watch."

","Harrison Ford really puts in a brilliant performance in this movie. No one else could pull off the swashbuckling hero with such poise and confidence. It's like he was born for the role. My favourite part of the whole movie is that opening sequence where he is rescuing a golden idol from a booby-trapped cave - it encapsulates everything I imagine Indiana Jones to be about. Karen Allen also deserves a mention for a great supporting performance as the bolshy heroine Marion Ravenwood.<br/><br/>But despite the classic performances this isn't my favourite India Jones movie. I think it loses its way at times. The scene where Marion puts on a white dress and drinks Belloq under the table is presented as a pivotal moment but doesn't seem to lead to anything. And towards the end of the movie, the scenes on the U-Boat feel disjointed from the rest of the plot. Others will disagree, but overall I prefer Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade.<br/><br/>I don't want to be too harsh, mind. I really do love this movie. There are scenes such as the pit of snakes and the car/tank chase that rank among the best in the Indiana Jones franchise. A very enjoyable viewing."

"Theflyace","10","0","1","4 November 2013"," A Great Rousing Adventure from the Dream Team of Spielberg and Lucas
","Everybody at least knows of or has seen Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is one of those great movies that was supposed to be a throwback to an old adventure for kids, but has become a vital part of our culture. I think the reason why it is better than the old Republic Pictures serials that it is inspired by is that it takes a ""modern"" approach, but is still timeless in how it was executed. And with the geniuses of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas behind the camera, this film reached an incredible level of excellence.<br/><br/>The story is about an archaeologist named Indiana Jones, who has a flair for finding rather rare treasures with supernatural ties. On this particular adventure, he sets out to find the lost Ark of the Covenant. Along the way he joins with an old flame, Marion Ravenwood, who is angry with Indy for doing something to her in the past, but the two rekindle their old flame as the film goes. Indy also has to deal with the Nazis, who are trying to bring the Ark to Hitler for his own truly evil purposes. This thread seems as basic as the serials that they were based on, but the way the characters are set up and they way they play off of one another is brilliant. <br/><br/>The writer for this movie is Lawrence Kasdan, who incorporated many of Steven and George's ideas, and forged them together into a very witty, exciting, and intriguing script. Each character is memorable and is never wasted, unless they are the secondary characters. Just like the old Republic films, there is breathless action and fast paced pacing, but here there is time for the characters to breathe and develop.<br/><br/>Fresh off of Han Solo in Star Wars is Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Instead of being a brash smuggler like Solo was, here is a gruff rugged man who is sensitive and humane, but has just a glimmer of the character of Dobbs from The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Ford is just the natural fit for the character and makes him a fully realized action hero who is not brainless. And like any hero, he has a crippling flaw, a fear of snakes, which presents a great irony when he finally locates the Ark. And on the same level is Karen Allen as Marion. She is really tough and sassy, the perfect tomboy, but somehow presents an elegance that few women characters possess in this kind of genre. She can definitely hold her own in a fight, and gives Indy a perfect lady to fall for, and vice versa in Indy's case.<br/><br/>The villains are pretty good in this film. They don't really act like Nazis very much as guys trying to make names for themselves and do their jobs for their fuhrer. Paul Freeman as Belloq is rather interesting. He is Indy's rival and somewhat equal, who will often times steal Indy's stuff and pass it off as his own discovery. He's the kind of guy who doesn't really like to get his clothes dirty. We have a man named Dietrich who is the senior Nazi officer, who serves only for Hitler and no one else. But then there is Toht, played by forgotten character actor Ronald Lacey. He is really creepy and menacing, but with a great side of humor, like Peter Lorre (which was Spielberg's intention) He is in all black wherever he goes and always wears a coat, which leads to one of the best gags in cinema.<br/><br/>But the movie is very well known for the exciting action sequences. Lucas has a great notion of what should happen, but Spielberg is the true genius of these scenes. Spielberg is the kind of director who knows what he wants to see, which coincides with exactly what the audience wants as they view it. So when something exciting happens like when Indy jumps from a horse onto a moving truck, its done in such a way that it seems much more jaw dropping and stunning even though its perfectly logical in the grammar of an adventure movie.<br/><br/>When Lucas and Spielberg decided to do this film, they would do it the old-fashioned way, quick, dirty, and relatively inexpensive. That's why the movie comes off as very fast-paced and imaginative. But one thing that reels the viewer's mind is that Lucas, the man who transformed special effects in Star Wars, would use ""cheap"" and old special effects. But again, they're done so convincingly that one hardly notices their imperfections, because they seem so logical and necessary. When the Ark is finally opened, it is mysterious and ultimately dooming for those who look upon the power of God, a fantastic display.<br/><br/>The best known aspect of the film is John William's score, which is perfect. It is a rousing score which gets the blood going, and accents key moments of both progression and shock in the scenes its featured in. The ""Raider's March"" is one of the most famous themes in music, mainly because it builds and builds to an exciting payoff, just like the movie's story itself.<br/><br/>This movie, nominated for Best Picture in 1981, was a huge surprise for the producers. It was surprising for an ""audience picture"" to get such recognition, when only few had done so (like Star Wars and Jaws) Even though it didn't win, it's reputation is still extremely strong among movie buffs like me, and even people who just want an escape for two hours out of their lives. There was a lot of passion and collaboration in front of and behind the camera to gives us something special. The dream team succeeded."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","14 October 2013"," One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Of All Time.
","Although Steven Spielberg's Jaws gets the distinction of being the very first blockbuster in cinema history, the blueprint of modern blockbuster filmmaking was brought to life by none other than Spielberg's early 1980s action-adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, which didn't just become one of the greatest examples of its genre but even today remains one of the most enjoyable & entertaining works of this esteemed director's illustrious career.<br/><br/>Set in the year of 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark concerns an archaeologist & adventurer named Indiana Jones who is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant after learning that the Führer is after the same biblical artifact which, according to him, would make his army an invincible force. Indiana's job is to find the artifact before the Nazis get their hand on it but between him & the ark stand his old foe & bands of Nazis.<br/><br/>Opening with an explosive sequence that introduces us to our protagonist & also sets the tone for the rest of the picture, Steven Spielberg's kinetic direction provides a zestful energy to the whole plot & it never really settles down until the end credits start rolling. The pacing is fierce, the action is non-stop, the VFX look slightly dated but doesn't take away much from the film & I have nothing but praise for its superb use of humour.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, the performances by every cast member is pretty good but it's Harrison Ford who ends up stealing the show as his stylish, charismatic & brilliant rendition of Indiana Jones turned this character into one of cinema's most iconic figures. Cinematography also deserves applause for its dynamic energy while John Williams' score is full of adventurous tracks that keeps it fresh throughout the runtime.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a wildly entertaining & ridiculously fun action- adventure which with its amazing set pieces, relentless pace, sly humour, superb visual effects, terrific music & excellent performances delivers a cinema that ingeniously balances its filmmaking aspects on the quality vs quantity graph. Offering a joyous & incredibly satisfying cinematic ride, Raiders of the Lost Ark defines the way blockbusters should be made."

","Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called ""The Ark of the Covenant"" from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it.<br/><br/>The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe.<br/><br/>Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the ""Star Wars"" trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute).<br/><br/>The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie).<br/><br/>A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and ""The Treasure of sierra Madre"" quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece.<br/><br/>10/10"

Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie ""No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle."" (Spielberg, 1981) ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings.

","Being one of the first true adventure films to come out in years, Raiders of the Lost Ark is able to not only redefine the action genre as a whole, but be so well made that no film since it's release has been able to top it. When they stated on the poster that this movie was the return of the great adventure, they weren't kidding. What a lot of people aren't aware of is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created the Indiana Jones movies as a tribute to the classic adventure films and old film serials that came out during the Great Depression and World War II. Such films that were payed tribute to (or ripped off) were ""Secret of the Incas"", ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", ""China"", and ""Gunga Din"". In that regard, it not only does that job, but delivers a timeless movie. I could pop this movie in any day and enjoy it. It never gets old. These movies are about treasure hunting, exotic locations, and great action set pieces. Everything flows perfectly from scene to scene. There's just a perfect balance of drama, humor, action, and romance. It works on every level--<br/><br/>If you're able to let back and not be critical, this is a great experience that will take you back to the past. It's well worth your time and once you see it, you won't get enough of it. <br/><br/>PS: Check out those other classic movies. They're fun to watch too."
"bigverybadtom","10","0","1","21 July 2013"," Escapist Entertainment That Makes No Pretense Otherwise
","This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make ""meaningful"" movies such as ""The Color Purple"" or ""Schindler's List"", with mixed success.<br/><br/>So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures.<br/><br/>Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the ""A-Team"" TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did."
"Al_The_Strange","10","0","2","3 October 2012"," ""An army which carries the Ark before it...is invincible.""
","In the fashion of the old-fashioned serials, where a daring hero gallivants from one pitfall to another before closing with a thrilling cliffhanger, Indiana Jones makes his debut exploring an ancient South American temple. After the iconic hand-off scene, the place explodes around him, he hops through all the booby traps to escape, before being chased by natives! And that's only a prelude; the adventure that follows pits him against all kinds of enemies, and they fight, chase each other, and raid more tombs before reaching a chilling climax. The action is frequent, and must take up nearly half of the film or more, and everything in between is tightly-paced, suspenseful, memorable, funny, dramaticthere is never a dull moment! <br/><br/>The story is great too. Maybe nothing deep or artistic, but the characters are pretty strong and we grow to love them the more we follow them in the movie. The McGuffin-driven quest they go on moves fast and logically, providing a solid platform to showcase the epic action scenes, in addition to the occasional bit of humor, romance, characterization, one or two historical/cultural lessons, and an underlying theme concerning the morality of treasure hunting.<br/><br/>Cinematically, it looks brilliant too. Photography is very strong all the way through, with plenty of interesting angles, steady composition, and interesting lighting effects. The combination of filming, sound design, and authentic locations give the film a natural rough n' gritty appeal that I don't think has been effectively reproduced anywhere else (except the next two sequels). Acting is great; Harrison Ford is perfect as Indy, Karen Allen is perfect as Marion, Paul Freeman makes a good villain (and a good foil for Indy's character), and John Rhys-Davies is lovable. Writing is spot-on. Production value shows a few weaknesses (a few fake-looking sets, old-fashioned special effects), but otherwise has some really strong locales, props, and costumes, and the filmmakers show immaculate attention to detail. Music is classic! <br/><br/>Recommended! <br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
"jose-cruz53","8","0","1","29 September 2012"," Excellent adventure film but not the best ever
","This movie consists of 110 minutes of pure escapist fun. That's the shortest accurate description of it: Its a flawless adventure film, vastly superior to its mediocre sequels (specially the Crystal Skull one a film mediocre par-excellence).<br/><br/>The film takes place in the late 1930′s and opens with Indiana Jones, a professor of archaeology which also does ""freelance work"" by robing ancient sites of its most valuable possessions, captures an invaluable Inca gold statuette. Later the film progresses to the main plot: the Nazis appear to have discovered the general location of the Lost Ark, which is said to house the actual 10 commandments. The film then progresses around the conflict of finding and possessing the Ark.<br/><br/>So, if the film is flawless why not give a perfect score? Because, although it is excellent, the film does not reach greatness to the point of really making me say: ""what a f*cking great film"", after seeing it. Its perfect entertainment, but it is not the greatest adventure film ever made (to me, Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is the greatest adventure film ever made, superior to this one in nearly every respect)."
"brunowangtaiwan","10","0","1","18 September 2012"," Designed For The Big Screen
","OK, so I admit I may be a little late to the party with this - maybe some of you have seen it already...<br/><br/>There's only one thing wrong with watching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and that's knowing you'll never have the chance to see it for the first time again. Bruno Wang is too young to have seen ""Raiders"" when it was originally released, but when I did see it as a kid in Taiwan, it was such an amazing experience that I was totally blown away by it, even though it was just on TV. This is not the film you want to see on a 27"" screen - but that was my only option for a long time.<br/><br/>Happily now, 31 years after the fact, ""Raiders"" is getting a limited and highly successful run in theatres in a remastered edition in glorious 2D, and Bruno Wang finally had the chance to see it on a big screen, as it deserves to be seen. I'm not sure there are too many folks out there who don't know this film intimately - even among kids, it seems to be regarded as a classic - but it's worth repeating what a truly great movie it is. A collaboration of three huge names - Lucas, Spielberg, Kasdan - ""Raiders"" was conceived as a tribute to a style of film that George Lucas loved as a child, and wasn't seeing from anyone else. While Spielberg directed (as with all the Indy films) and Kasdan wrote the screenplay, anything ""Indiana Jones"" will always be first and foremost a Lucas baby, with all the positives and negatives that implies.Raiders<br/><br/>It's interesting that as with the ""Star Wars"" films, the very best one was written by Lawrence Kasdan - here, the first, and of course with ""Star Wars"" the second, ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I think we can say pretty conclusively now that George Lucas, while he may be terrific at coming up with big story concepts, isn't especially gifted at the details - petty stuff like dialogue and character development. Spielberg is always going to deliver slick, good-looking action films - that's a constant - and what we see in ""Raiders"" is a kind of perfect storm where the talents of all three men are on full display. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" represents a high point which the series would never match in the succeeding three films.<br/><br/>In terms of the new print being shown in theatres, it looks great - but the movie looked pretty damn good even in 1981, so that shouldn't be a huge surprise. There's nothing too flashy - no extended new footage, or 3D, or such - and you can see the age showing at times. But it really doesn't matter much, because ""Raiders"" also represents an era before CGI changed the way chase scenes and big set pieces were filmed - it's a movie of stuntmen and real cameras, and real actors doing amazing things. And in that sense, three decades old or not, ""Raiders"" has a degree of realism that big action films today simply can't match.<br/><br/>A couple of final thoughts. First, it shouldn't be forgotten that ""Raiders"" is a great film and not just a great-looking film because of the script and the characters. It's damn funny, and there are indelible performances across the board, obviously starting with Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, but also the amazing John Rhys-Davies (what a career he's had), Paul Freeman, Denholm Elliot and even a very young Alfred Molina in the opening set piece. Also, it's truly remarkable to think that ""Raiders"" is only 110 minutes long. In an era of bloated three-hour ""blockbusters"", Bruno Wang feels a film like ""Raiders"" that doesn't waste a second is to be treasured - it's phenomenal how much action and drama is crammed into less than two hours. It's a breathless, exhilarating experience - and all the more so on the big screen, as it was intended to be seen."

","When I first saw it in the early 80's, I was exhilarated because here was a film that was non-stop adventure, went to exotic places, some of which had always been poorly replicated on 40's and 50's studio sets. This time, I think, we were treated to location shooting, with state of the arts special effects, and at the helm, Steven Spielberg, made sure we got enough thrills for a lifetime.<br/><br/>Everyone knows how Indiana Jones jumps from adventure to adventure on his quest for the mythical Ark of the Covenant, which is possible a source of unmeasurable, destructive power in the wrong hands. So, Indy searches for different parts of the puzzle from Asia to Africa, and we're eventually treated to a fitting and spectacular display of the Ark's powers.<br/><br/>""Raiders"" works because of its witty and resourceful script, the great performances by Ford and the rest of the cast, and a creative team that manages to recreate long gone eras with much attention to detail. There's more to praise: John Williams' now legendary score, the snappy editing, and its cinematography.<br/><br/>Then there's that scene in the warehouse...

"Bruce722","6","0","5","31 August 2012"," Overrated.
","This movie was just about what I expected in some ways but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype in others. First with the good stuff, it was exactly what I thought in terms of actions sequences, whip cracks, and archaeological hunts. Those things were the strong elements of the film in my opinion. There were also plenty of funny scenes and the effects, while terrible in today's standards, were pretty darn good for a 30+ year-old film. The reason this movie rated so low, however, is for the few negative parts. Things like the fact that the Indiana Jones character might be the dumbest protagonist in action film history for example. Or the corny scenes that mar so many films of that era. I honestly don't know what people were thinking back then to enjoy such tomfoolery. The other things that hurt the film weren't as major. The mystical/supernatural element was unfortunate but that's more of a personal thing. I tend to zone out when ridiculous stuff comes on the screen in supposedly realistic settings. The acting also wasn't great but it wasn't all that bad either. I was disappointing though in the lack of charisma from Harrison Ford during the movie. The same guy who managed to turn a douche bag smuggler in the Star Wars saga into a fan favorite didn't have much opportunity to do the same here. I mainly blame the writing and directing. Still, the movie was enjoyable and I look forward to seeing the next two being that I've heard the series gets substantially better after the first one."

","I remember seeing a preview for this in the theatre. And when the big ball rolled down, two middle-aged men began laughing. But at it, not with it. Bet they are not laughing now, considering how famous it's become. I like this movie. In fact, I'm watching it as I type. I certainly think that it is the best out of the four. It has a rawness about it, and a lovely lack of CGI of course, it being 1981. In reading the, 'reviews', I noticed a lot of comments about CGI. But here's the thing. That department is so well established in film studios now, that it would almost be disrespectful not to include them in the 'family of film-makers'. This is on the same principle as writing in scenes that involve snow and rain. It passes the money around and keeps people employed. That's why many films have CGI. I think they have their place, but come on guys. Put creativity first, not finance. The trouble is, it's all getting cheaper to do and solves big production problems. Back to the film. Yes, never a dull moment, plenty of humour, great music and high adventure. It's a film, guys. Get over yourselves, you critics. There are no black holes here. Dr Jones obeys the rules of the universe. No deus ex machina here! Anybody notice how perfect the scene in Nepal was? So well planned and choreographed. As was the plane blowing up sequence. Not to mention the lorry sequence! The film does not require me to think. Perfect viewing for the end of the day and a glass of wine!"

","Ever since I was a kid, I had loved movies. And one of the most influential movies for me were the Indiana Jones movies, my favorite being Raiders of the Lost Ark, which I consider my favorite movie of all time. This is how you do a blockbuster: action packed, fast paced, tougue in cheek, romantic, and heaps of fun. Harrison Ford is the perfect action hero. He's tough, vulnerable, funny, bad-ass, and extremely likable. The moment he comes on screen, you fall in love with that character. Spielberg directs the movie perfectly, it feels exactly like an old school adventure serial, and has the same energy and pure spirit. The action scenes are phenomenal, some of the best ever filmed. Not only are they intense, but there's little to no CG. Lastly, I'll mention the iconic score by John Williams, my favorite movie score of all time. It's my favorite movie of all time, what else do I need to say? 10/10."

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" follows Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, an archaeologist, played by Harrison Ford in his quest for relics or hidden treasure. Jones adventures in the movie are extensive. We see him in the jungles of South America, a college class room, Nepal, Egypt, and a secret Nazi controlled island. There is a fellow archaeologist Dr. Rene Belloq or Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is Jones enemy. Belloq and Jones race to find the Ark of the Covenant. Belloq enlist the help of the Nazis. Jones enlists the help of Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, who is an ex-girlfriend. Jones also enlist the help of a friend Sallah played by John Rhys-Davies. Belloq and the Nazis plan to use the Ark for evil and world domination. Jones, Marion, And Sallah are out to stop Belloq and the Nazis. The theme of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is good vs. evil. Jones, Marion, and Sallah play the role of the good guys while Belloq and the Nazis are the bad guys. Bellog role as evil or bad guy is reinforced by his willingness to stop at nothing to get what he wants, the statue, the ark, and Marion. Once the mention of the Nazi army and Hitler are mentioned we know they are the bad guys. This is based symbolism Nazis and Hitler. These words automatically invoke the thought of evil. Belloq and the Nazis are searching for the ark to use its power to rule the world. There is a line in the movie ""No army that carried the ark has ever been defeated in battle."" (Spielberg, 1981) ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" uses sound to enhance the theme and settings. During action scenes in the movie when Jones is about to do something exceptional we here the same musical score. This score has become symbolic away from the movie and has been used in many situations in TV and film to stir the same feeling in the audience. The movie also uses a visible and invisible sound. An example of invisible sounds is in in Nepal when Marion is introduced. We here the wind blowing outside and this gives the impression of a blizzard outside. The best example of visible sound is when Marion and Jones are trying to escape the pit before the torches run out. We see Jones pushing a stone statue over to break down a wall. We here the grinding of stone and it give us an impression of a heavy stone statue. When in reality it was a prop make of fiberglass, wood, and wire. **Spoiler Alert**<br/><br/>At the end of the movie when the Belloq convinces the Nazis to open the ark before taking it to Berlin shows the Belloq's greediness for power. When the ark is open at first we are lead to believe that nothing is in the ark. However, when things start to flow out of the ark and swirl around. We find the contents are mystical. Jones realizes what is happening and tells Marion to close her eyes. The Nazis and Belloq are destroyed by God for their arrogance and pride. Marion and Jones are able to survive because they were humbled."

","Indiana Jones represented the return of the film action hero, a follow up to our original, Star Wars. Raiders is certainly more tangible in its' time period and mission and with every globe- spanning scene and perilous escape grew more legendary. Harrison Ford's coolness and boyish charm carry us past the missing logic of one character being able to challenge a Nazi Army, but that's what legends are made of, right? Karen Allen, as the burned love interest, added grit and and a rooting interest. Spielberg understands this genre's audience best and delivers 100%. Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady (or an audience) a good time. """

","I was at Disneyland the other day, and after riding the Indiana Jones ride, I had to watch this trilogy over again!! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the first movie in the Indiana Jones trilogy and it's also the best. It stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist who sets off to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments. He teams up with his ex-girlfriend, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and he dodges bullets, punches, Nazis and his arch-rival, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) who is working with the the Nazis to find the ark. There are some pretty fantastic scenes in this movie, the beginning with the boulder, the plane-fight sequence and also the truck chase but I think the scene most connected with this movie is the end. Awesome movie and definitely one of the best to ever make it on film.<br/><br/>Btw, the boulder is at the Disney ride too!"

","I've seen this film countless times and I'm always waiting for that great revelation which jumps at me and screams AMAAAAZING FILM!!! Alas that has yet to happen. Oh it's an enjoyable romp but I'm always teetering between a 9/10 and a 10/10. I guess 9.5/10 is the ideal score for it. And is it crazy that I find UNDER SIEGE 2 more entertaining than this film? Crazy, I know. But anyhoo Harrison Ford is fantastic here and Karen Allen is equally amazing - those two have incredible chemistry! The supporting cast is also great - heck, Paul Freeman eats a fly and then even lets his head explode - what a trooper! Ronald Lacey's face-melt still registers after all these years as well. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah is a great ally - ""Asps. Very Dangerous. You go first"". The action scenes are all great as well. But the real star here is John Williams - you just can't tire of listening to his ""Raiders March"" and ""Map Room"" - music of the gods if you ask me. And yet it's still LAST CRUSADE that is the really amazing Indy film for me. Ford and Connery. Indy and Bond together. Enough said. But RAIDERS is solid in its own right. Just not quite on the level of CRUSADE."

","After many years I watched this movie again on cable. I saw it the first time at the theater with my friends. It was a great blockbuster and everybody talked about the new Indiana Jones. This one is no doubt on of the best of the series. I mean especially the chase scenes in Egypt were well executed with charm and humor. Therefore some dialog sequences were unnecessary too long and stopped the dynamic pace. The story with the Nazi and the chase of the treasure was well mixed. Some special effects looked cartooning but didn't disturb at all. The technology was not on nowadays standard. Harrison Ford gave an original character to Indy Jones. Ford's performance will never be replaced by another actor. This franchise shows that it can still compete with other adventure series such as National Treasure. Final vote: 7/10."

","A truly great Movie. Has it all and should be in IMDb's top 3. Flawless direction, brilliant characterizations, and unbelievable score. something for everyone in this great classic: thrills, chills, action, adventure, romance and comedy, all of which is top-notch in every department, and all in one dense, exhilarating two hour experience. Ford's subtle performance isn't the only understated quality that makes Raiders such a different kind of action flick. It's also incredibly funny throughout, often side-splittingly hilarious. There is a droll sense of humor that underlies most scenes, so small, it's almost imperceptible, but you'll find yourself laughing more often than most comedies, even the classics. The humor is never obvious, almost seeming unscripted (many of the film's biggest laughs are ad-libbed), but what makes everything so humorous is that, even though the cast is colorful and somewhat grandiose, they are very well-rounded in surprisingly complex detail."

I have seen this movie several times and it never gets old and never fails to excite you and entertain you. ""Raiders"" is a timeless classic filled with gunfights,fistfights, car chases, and a lot of other extremely cool stuff. The story is very compelling spanning from south America, to Nepal, to Egypt and has very memorable characters like the iconic Jones and the Nazi dude who's name i cant recall. With all the generic action movies these days it is really refreshing to look back on the movie that invented it all.

"antonjsw1","10","0","1","2 October 2010"," Exhilarating movie that is still fresh 30 years on!
","This is a film that despite being made nearly 30 years ago, hasn't aged and is still far more entertaining that most of the big budget tent pole movies being churned out today. Credit has to go to creators George Lucas and Larry Kasdan, but the real kudos have to go to Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford for creating an new iconic action hero, and to holding the viewer spellbound with a exciting, amusing and emotionally involving movie, while at the same time paying homage to the Republic serials of the thirties, and elevating the action movie making spectacle much higher than the Bond movie franchise, which was the major action movie brand at the time. <br/><br/>The plot moves quickly, thanks to a sharp and witty script by Larry Kasdan, based upon ideas from Lucas, Kasdan, film-maker Philip Kaufman, and Spielberg himself. The film's opening sequence is mirrors the Bond pre-credits sequence, with the viewer thrown straight into an action/thriller sequence with little explanation, followed by a dialogue driven sequence to flesh out the plot. It works extremely well and involves the viewer in the story very quickly. Harrison Ford understands the role perfectly, and the character having moments of fallibility and things going wrong, and having to adapt to the ebbing of success and failure for the character in the story is fun to watch. Ford doesn't play to the character too broadly, and the Indiana Jones character is more fleshed out than Han Solo in Star Wars Episodes IV to VI. Gravitas is provided by an excellent performance by the late Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody, and a strong performance by John Rhys Davies as Salah. Most of the other parts are very theatrical in nature and are clearly driven by Spielberg's and Lucas's view to have a performance style similar to the Saturday matinée serials of the 1930s, and while work well within the context of the film, weren't memorable. <br/><br/>Spielberg as the director is on top form here, and for me is still his second best action/adventure film (after Jurassic Park). He understands what is needed for an entertaining and enthralling story, and keeps the interest and suspense levels high throughout the film. No scene or sequence is wasteful and everything you see, no matter how spectacular, character based, funny or frightening is there to serve the story and move it along very briskly. Spielberg orchestrates the action sequences with style, humour and panache, but most notably emotional involvement. He gets the audience to follow the character(s) within the action sequence, rather than just show an action sequence for the technical achievement's sake. The stunt-work is still impressive by today's standards, with able support from George Lucas and Michael Moore as the film's 2nd unit directors. Spielberg's editor Michael Kahn edits the footage perfectly to produce and wonderfully entertaining movie, and deservedly won an Oscar for his work. Spielberg's collaboration with veteran photographer Douglas Slocombe was outstanding and gave the film a stylish yet real feel, and they would work together on the subsequent two sequels.<br/><br/>The film is also first rate in other technical areas, that also serve to highlight the excellent story and support Spielberg's outstanding directing. Star Wars alumni Norman Reynolds, together with his art direction team won an academy award for the production design. ILM veterans Richard Edlund, Bruce Nicholson and Joe Johnston all won Oscars for the near seamless blend of visual effects into the live action. Richard Edlund had already won Oscars for his work on Star Episodes IV and V would go on to win again for Episode VI, before heading up a highly successful visual effects company (Entertainment Effects Group, which became known later as BOSS film) and overseeing fx a work on a series of high profile films including Ghostbusters, 2010, Die Hard. Air Force One and Charlie Wilson's War. Bruce Nicholson was responsible for the excellent compositing of the visual effects, and has a very successful career in this field, working on many high profile films, including the Matrix and Spiderman sequels. Joe Johnston went on a very successful career as a film director of films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids! Jurassic Park III and more recently, the Wolfman. Kit West was responsible for the mechanical effects on the film, and has worked on a large body of films since, including Stargate and the Bourne Supremacy. The sound team of Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, Roy Charman, Ben Burtt and Richard Anderson and did outstanding work and deservedly took home Oscar accolades.<br/><br/>Spielberg already had developed a very successful collaboration with composer John Williams, and it was this experience that led to George Lucas working with Williams on the Star Wars films. Williams continues this tradition of old fashioned, rousing scores with another outstanding score. The Raiders March has become almost as iconic as Star Wars in the movie history and popular culture. The music works brilliantly throughout the film, enhancing it wonderfully, and building brilliantly to a superb climax and a gentle but mysterious coda. It is a key part of making this film one of the best action/adventure films ever.<br/><br/>Concluding, congratulations must go to Mr Spielberg for delivering a remarkable and piece of all out escapist entertainment, that has stood the test of time remarkably well, and has never been bettered by any of the sequels, even though Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes very close."

Groundbreaking picture; a roller coaster ride of a movie, with premium action sequences—but it fails to give the viewer any room to breathe. Ford is absolutely wonderful and irreplaceable as Dr. Jones, but neither Allen or her character Marion Ravenwood can earn the same keep as the main character. While the film succeeds in fun and thrilling entertainment, there's no excuse for the action in your climatic sequence to be far more inferior than the nail-biting close-calls that preceded it.

"chrisart7","10","0","1","25 March 2010"," filmic inspirations for ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""
","It's an action-adventure classic, as most know, but what follows may be regarded as SPOILERS to those who haven't yet seen this remarkable roller-coaster ride of a film. In sharing the following paragraphs of information, please do not take this as a denigration of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" It was and is a superb motion picture.<br/><br/>Spielberg, Lucas, and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan were obviously well-acquainted with many, many Hollywood films of decades past when they and the rest of the creative team put ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" together, as it really is, in many ways, a collage of other movies.<br/><br/>The entire opening sequence was borrowed from the 1973 film ""Papillon"" starring Steve McQueen. McQueen even wears a similar open shirt and fedora when approaching a leper colony settlement amid a South American jungle in one scene, and is subsequently pursued by natives with blowguns in a following scene (sound familiar?). McQueen encounters a Hispanic man who helps him along the way, only to be impaled on a wooden-barbed booby trap (just like Satipo/Alfred Molina in the opening of ""Raiders""). Even John Williams' score in that pursuit sequence sounds like Jerry Goldsmith's score in ""Papillon."" When Indy travels to Nepal we see the map with a red line running along it. This device was used in many films of Hollywood's golden age, notably ""Casablanca"" (1942). The Nazi character in black civilian clothes was modelled, to some degree, after Peter Lorre (who also co-starred in ""Casablanca""), and when Indy and Marion leave Nepal in a DC-3(or 2?) with Chinese characters written on its side, flying over Himalayan mountains, it is a clear nod to a similar scene in Frank Capra's 1937 ""Lost Horizon"" film.<br/><br/>Once in Egypt, Marion is pursued by locals working for the Nazis, and hides in one basket amid many. This is an homage to a similar scene featuring Sabu in the 1940 Korda film ""Thief of Bagdad."" After Marion's (presumed) death, Indy sits despondently at a table with liquor bottle in hand (an intentional remake of a scene with Humphrey Bogart from ""Casablanca""). When a native's monkey emulates (and mocks) the Nazi's 'Sieg heil' hand gesture it is a similar humorous device used by a monkey tipping his hat to the Queen in the Errol Flynn-starring film ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940).<br/><br/>When Indy (and later Marion) is lowered into a pit filled with ancient sarcophagi and treasures (and snakes), facing a king cobra, it is mirroring a scene with Sabu in a pit filled with ancient Indian treasures and a king cobra in the 1942 Korda film ""The Jungle Book."" Much of Indy's derring do and fighting with Egyptians who are in league with the Nazis is derived from the type of antics seen in ""Gunga Din"" (1939) starring Cary Grant, Victor McLagen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as British sergeants in colonial India.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones' look (the fedora, leather jacket, unshaved face, etc.) was chiefly taken from that of Charlton Heston's character in ""Secret of the Incas"" (1954), and there is a scene in that film where Heston discovers the location of a treasure by the passage of light through on object, much like Indiana Jones' use of the staff in the well of souls to find the ark's location.<br/><br/>When Indy is dragged by his bullwhip on a dusty road by the Nazi's lorry (truck) the scene recalls men being dragged by ropes behind camels in the 1939 Korda film ""The Four Feathers."" The scene with the ark lid spinning around what is supposed to be a heavenly tornado of sorts is a direct allusion to Dorothy's house spinning around in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939).<br/><br/>The finale with the large room of boxes, one containing the ark, is a reference to the finale of Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) showing the title character's vast, posthumous holdings."
"jendre01","10","0","1","15 March 2010"," My Review of The Raiders of the Lost Ark
","Film: Raiders of the Lost Ark: Indiana Jones Actors/Actress: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and Paul Freeman Release Date: June 12, 1981<br/><br/>The Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastically imaginative film full of adventure and suspense as the theme roars in each scene, the good guy versus his arch enemy evil itself. Harrison Ford plays as the handsome archaeological professor, Indiana Jones, who finds himself in extraordinary circumstances beating indomitable odds. The Raiders of the Lost Ark being the first Indiana Jones film in the quadrilogy depicts Indiana as a bright and naive man of science. Greatly intrigued by the biblical history of an artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, Indiana Jones sets forth on a quest to retrieve the artifact in the hopes of divulging the originality of the 10 Commandments. Along the way Indiana is reunited with his once love the ravishing Marion Ravenwood, played by Karen Allen, and the two fight their way to the Ark as they dodge and mortify Indiana's rival, the deceitful Renee Belloq played by Paul Freeman, who is grouped with a faction of Nazis. After many struggles to regain possession of the Ark, the overzealous Renee attempts to test the power of the Ark once it is in his control and results in the supernatural demise of Renee and his fleet of Nazis. Finally rid of their opponents, Indiana and Marion are able to secure the Ark into the hands of the top secret section of the United States government, only to have the Ark placed in a classified government warehouse to hopefully never be compromised again. <br/><br/>The theme of Indiana Jones is one seen many times in many action films; he is the hero in the fight of good versus evil. Indiana is a very powerful hero in the film. He is intelligent, wise and, knows so much of the world. Indiana is a man of science and his actions are always based on reason. It helps that Indiana's stud like looks makes him a man that other men admire and women adore. What really makes Indiana the hero is his uncompromising desire to restore order and fight evil no matter the cost. As seen in the film, Indiana risks his life numerous times in order to gain possession of the Ark. He strives to gain control of the Ark but it is not for himself. All great heroes do not feel that they need more power that is the role of the villain. It is the hero in the films that believe justice is the key to a civilized world and thus the hero helps restore order to the government. Just as seen in the film, Indiana presents the Ark to the government in hopes that it will be studied by the brightest minds. However, like all good heroes, Indiana wants to believe purity in his government but he has his doubts, which are proved justified at the end of the film when the Ark is simply tucked away, never to be spoken of again.<br/><br/>Two very powerful chosen techniques in the film were lighting and music. The lighting was very important in the film because it caused the audience to feel anxious and drawn into the moment. There are several scenes when the lighting is simply a warm yellow glow that reveals the characters faces in somewhat serious moments. The audience is focusing on just the faces of the characters and it is then that the audience is almost waiting for a cue, a reaction from the characters to know what is going to happen next. I believe that the filmmakers chose to use a warm yellow lighting instead of a more white or blue light because the yellow gives a warm but ominous tone. A lot of the scenes the only light in the room is suppose to be from torches of fire, so it is only proper to use yellow lighting. Also many times it looks as if the lighting is coming from above the characters heads but also on an angle giving a small sliver of the characters faces a shadow on the side. I believe this gives the characters more of individual presences and sort of announces their possible thoughts by just focusing on the reactions on their faces. <br/><br/>The other powerful technique as stated before is music. The music chosen in the film is sometimes upbeat and worthy of being a theme song for a hero. At other moments the music is slow and creepy. The music really seemed to help set the mood for the audience. The faster that the beat of the music boomed the fast the heart of the audience beat and the speed of Indiana's feet seemed to correspond as well. The slower pulsing music slowed down the hearts of the audience and usually the footsteps of the characters as well. Also the height of the volume varied with the music. The more adventurous parts had louder music, it almost made me want to get up and start running. The scenes that required quiet and sly feet, the music was soft and disturbing. All in all, the music is one that the audience can probably still hear in their head long after the movie is over. I cannot imagine anyone thinking of the great hero Indiana Jones and not hearing the delightful theme song carried in his films as he fights evil for the sake of the good."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","0","1","1 March 2010"," it's just sheer, nonstop high-quality if implausible entertainment from one of the best directors that we have today
","There are very few moments in Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" that is plausible or that could be taken for credible if you wanted to give the illusion that this may happen in real life. But there is hardly a single moment in this movie that is not adrenaline-stimulating in its excitement. Spielberg willingly throws logic out the window in favor of creating something that is just old-fashioned, nonstop nostalgic entertaining fun and he does it very well and with that pure craftsmanship that has made him one of the really good directors of contemporary times. It is the start of the Indiana Jones series and hailed as the best of the bunch. It's certainly one of the most stimulating movies ever made.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stars Harrison Ford, just recently having shot to fame as Han Solo in the Star Wars movies, as an adventurer in World War II who stumbles upon the secret that the Nazis have discovered a city in which the famous Ark of the Covenant may be located. Since the Ark is described as being a source of indescribable power, Jones is hired to retrieve it before Hitler does. Along the way, he meets up with an old flame wonderfully played by Karen Allen and an Arabic friend (John Rhys-Davies) who together work to try and uncover the Ark, battling everything from Nazis to venomous snakes to booby traps along the way.<br/><br/>It's not the credibility of the movie, but the energy and stimulation that it uses with such great craftsmanship and enthusiasm that makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" one of the most thoroughly enjoyable movies ever made. On top of that, it is equipped with a very solid screenplay of wise dialogue and interesting characters. Harrison Ford is excellent as Indiana Jones, obviously modeled after Frank Buck and other real-life adventurers and the supporting performances by Rhys-Davies, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, and the others are fabulous. Who can forget Ronald Lacey walking into Karen Allen's pub hissing in his Peter Lorre-like voice ""Good evening, Fraulein."" And who can forget iconic scenes such as Harrison Ford running through a cave with a giant boulder hot on his heels? ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is nonstop fun and that's why it has become a classic. Is it what I would call motion picture art? No. But is it a great movie? You bet it is. It is proof for all that credibility CAN be thrown out the window and still have a movie with a lot to show for itself. But it takes a certain genius that its imitators do not seem to show. And on top that, it takes a great director. And, in my opinion at least, Steven Spielberg most certainly qualifies."

","'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' is yet another example of those movies that are better the second time you watch them.When I first watched it, I ended up liking it enough to give it a decent 7 out of 10.Just an hour ago, I finished watching it a second time and I can honestly say that it was way better than the first viewing.Harrison Ford does an Oscar worthy job as Indiana Jones and I don't think that there will ever be an Indy like Mr. Ford.I was also surprised at how well the action sequences were handled.The movie was made in 1981, yet the chase sequences manage to capture you and don't let go.But I mostly thank Steven Spielburg for giving us this marvelous movie and a powerful quadrilogy.What's even better is that the quadrilogy is about to turn into a quantrilogy for there will be a 5th Indiana Jones movie and hopefully Harrison will come back as Dr. Jones.I just wonder how Mr. Spielburg is able to come up with these brilliant ideas and turn them into brilliant movies."
"Electrified_Voltage","10","0","1","30 October 2009"," A great example of how action movies should be made!
","I'm sure you're aware of the immense popularity of this first installment in the Indiana Jones series, created and co-written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spielberg, two very accomplished filmmakers. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was released five years before I was born, and even though it made movie history (like so many other classics I've yet to see), it took me 23 years to finally get around to watching it. Previously, I had seen the parody of it at the beginning of ""UHF"", but it's been a few years since I first saw that, and I've finally seen the source. I was fully aware of this 1981 blockbuster's reputation before watching it, which gave me high expectations, and in the end, I certainly wasn't left puzzled by its popularity! <br/><br/>In 1936, an archaeologist named Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, Jr. braves through South American jungle in search of an artifact called the Golden Idol. He finds it in an ancient temple, where he narrowly avoids death on his way out! As soon as he makes it back outside, he finds himself surrounded, and is forced to give the Idol to his old foe, René Belloq. Indiana Jones then runs as the native tribe, commanded by Belloq, chase after him, and the archaeologist manages to escape in a seaplane. Back in the United States, Indiana is soon approached by U.S. Army Intelligence officers, who tell him of Nazi archaeological activity near Cairo, Egypt! Jones believes this is the location of the Ark of the Covenant, a chest carrying the Ten Commandments. This Ark is believed to be very powerful, and Indy must go and find it before it falls into the hands of the Nazis! His mission takes him to Nepal to recruit Marion Ravenwood. Together, they go to Cairo and face many deadly enemies as they attempt to make it to the Ark before the Nazis do! <br/><br/>The first part of the film, taking place in South America, is delightfully haunting and suspenseful, especially while our hero is in the temple (this is the part that was parodied in ""UHF""). That is the first of many great action sequences in the movie! It is followed by more, in Nepal and then in Egypt, as Indiana Jones fights his enemies on his great adventure! In addition to the action and adventure, there's some humour, in such scenes as Indy finding a snake on the seaplane while leaving South America. Harrison Ford is charismatic in the starring role, playing a tough, cool guy, and the acting and dialogue in general are impressive. There's really not much to complain about with this film, except maybe that it's a little overlong. However, this doesn't start to show until the last half hour or so, and there are more film highlights towards the end. I'm sure it still would have been hard for me to stop watching by this point.<br/><br/>With classic movies like this, there's probably not really anything I could say that hasn't already been said before. Nonetheless, I've given my opinion on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the first and most popular Indiana Jones flick, and it seems to basically go along with the film's general reception in the past 28 years. As so many others have probably pointed out, don't expect a lot of depth in this classic George Lucas/Steven Spielberg collaboration, but I guess it doesn't have to have that in order to be tremendously entertaining. It was a great accomplishment without a lot to dislike, and its popularity could continue for generations to come! As with any film, no matter how widely praised, this one obviously can't appeal to all viewers and is considered by some to be vastly overrated, but if you really like action and suspense, I highly doubt you will be disappointed."

","The beginning of the myth, of the legend of that Indian Jones. Worth seeing again today and funny like hell, except if you are afraid of snakes or spiders. Steven Spielberg and his friend George Lucas are obsessed by Hitler and the Nazis. They situate the film in 1936, In Egypt where the Germans are looking for the Lost Ark of the Temple of Jerusalem. Indiana Jones is not only an adventurer, sorry a university professor turned adventurer during his vacation, but he is also the good guy who is fulfilling a quasi-divine mission, that of saving a Jewish mythical artifact from the hands of the Nazis because it is too valuable to let it rot in bad hands, but also because it is said it may give eternal life to the person who would control it. With that in mind and with a little bit of romanticism and sentimentalism he is able to complete the mission, to destroy a few German Nazis along with it and to sow the seed that will produce the Junior who will take over four films later to assume the continuation of the myth in the 21st century. Of course what is essential and unique in this film is the action, a perfectly gratuitous action that is shown only for our pleasure and in no way for our reflection or moral improvement. And it works perfectly well along that line. Still quite enjoyable today nearly thirty years later. A student recently pretended that good special effects were not common in that period and before. This film proves he is wrong. Special effects were maybe less technical, certainly less computerized than today, but they were just as creative and inventive as today, with a lot less technical means, hence with a lot more sweat and grey matter.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

It is nearly thirty years since it was made and it is as fresh now as it was then. There is so much action in this film it is like the highlights of three action films all seamlessly edited together. For me it is just under two hours of sheer joy and you will experience every other emotion possible during this time. I am not that interested in historical accuracy, politics or continuity problems and I don't think anybody should waste their time looking for or dwelling on them. Just sit back and let the film take you away to a place where you can lose yourself for a time and be superbly entertained by a great film.

","In 1981, executive producer/co-creator George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, longtime friends and the men responsible for the two biggest hits of all time up to that point (Star Wars and Jaws), teamed up to give the world Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first (and by a considerable margin the best) of four films following the adventures of Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, and in the process they introduced to the world both a character and a series of films that changed not just cinema, but worldwide pop culture.<br/><br/>It's 1936. The one and only Harrison Ford breathes life into the arrogant but lovable Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones, a man who by day is a boring college archaeology professor, but by night scours the Earth in search of priceless ancient artifacts not for personal gain, but so they can be restored and stored in museums for future generations. In this particular adventure, Dr. Jones travels to Egypt to capture the famed Ark of the Covenant, an ancient chest said to contain the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed. The problem is the Nazis are also after it, having learned that any army that wields it is invincible. Along the way our hero is reunited in a Nepalese bar with his feisty ex-flame Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and doges all sorts of booby traps and life-threatening situations in his quest to retrieve the Ark before the Nazis and his archaeological rival Dr. René Belloq get their hands on it. Our hero is no Superman though, as he gets beaten and bashed up at every time, while Marion is no token damsel in distress either, but rather a tough, independent woman who (most of the time) doesn't need Indy at all.<br/><br/>Like all the best movies ever made, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a series of awesome scenes strung together by a perfect narrative: Indy finding the basket of snakes in the back seat of the plane with him; Indy in the pyramid finding the location of the Ark by using the staff and the medallion; having to face his fear of snakes whilst being trapped in Egyptian asp-filled Well of Souls; the truck chase; dodging bandits in a Cairo market; the fight with the Arab swordsman (which was originally supposed to be a much longer sequence, but Ford was suffering from dysentery on the day and ask Spielberg if he could ""just shoot the guy""), and my personal favourite, Indy dodging the giant rolling boulder after retrieving the golden idol. With this masterpiece Spielberg and Lucas raised the bar for the action-adventure film-making so high that it still has not been matched.<br/><br/>Yes, E.T. made more money and Schindler's List (which I must confess is barely superior for me) and Saving Private Ryan earned him his well-deserved and long overdue recognition from AMPAS, but Raiders of the Lost Ark remains Spielberg's most unabashedly fun piece of escapist entertainment, one which still serves as an inspiration for countless filmmakers and writers alike (most clearly evident in Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation, a remake Spielberg apparently enjoyed which was made in the '80s by three kids whose lives the original changed.) The quintessential action-adventure movie of all time."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","11 March 2009"," Introducing Indiana Jones, archaeologist-adventurer extraordinaire
","Steven Spielberg's classic adventure film ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" hardly requires introduction. Harrison Ford stars in what is perhaps his signature role, that of rugged archaeologist Indiana Jones. Here the U.S. government recruits him to track down the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can get their hands on it. Thus begins the first of (to date) four films based on the adventures of Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>The script, written by Lawrence Kasdan from a story by George Lucas & Philip Kaufman, is jam-packed with action & adventure. There are numerous classic scenes, though I think that the characterization & humour is not quite as sharp here as it would become later on. All in all, the story is a rousing, old-fashioned adventure yarn recapturing the spirit of a bygone era.<br/><br/>The cast, while not exactly stocked with A-list names, proves to be well-assembled. Harrison Ford is ideal as Indiana Jones; one can hardly imagine anyone else playing the character. Karen Allen fares well as Jones's love interest but I think that the most memorable supporting performances come from the likes of John Rhys-Davies, Paul Freeman & Ronald Lacey.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is well handled as always but I'm not completely sold on Douglas Slocombe's sometimes overly dark cinematography. The score, on the other hand, ranks as one of John Williams's best, which means that it is very good indeed. ""The Raider's March"" is one of the most instantly recognizable themes in all of film and ""Marion's Theme"" is quite memorable as well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the Indiana Jones films (especially this one) are essential viewing for any film fan. Start here and continue on to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and (my favourite) ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade""."

","Raiders of the Lost Ark is the greatest action/adventure movie ever made. In many ways, the film actually transcends both these genres and stands as a work of art.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's mastery at creating spellbinding set pieces and action sequences is on full display. The entire opening, complete with the ""Idol swap"" and the giant rolling boulder, has never been equaled in terms of sheer excitement and execution. The same can be said about many of the sequences. The chase through the desert is the greatest car chase ever filmed, and the ending (with melting Nazis) is a brilliant, unforgettable villain death scene. Raiders proves that the quality/realism of a film's special effects aren't all that important - it's how you use them.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford gives a legendary performance as Indy, Karen Allen has never been better as his love interest Marion (she is one of the toughest, wittiest female characters in the movies), and Denholm Eliot and John Rhys-Davies are wonderfully colorful in their key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Just like Jaws, if Raiders of the Lost Ark had fallen into the hands of any director other than Steven Spielberg, it would have been nothing more than a cheap B-movie. But because Spielberg was at the helm, Raiders is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>Oh... and once you hear John Williams' music, i will remain in your head forever."

","I have seen the introduction to this film what feels like 100 times but it still amazes me and keeps me interested, not revealing Indiana Jones keeps the audience hooked waiting for the mysterious person to be identified and when he is no one is disappointed. The journey through the cave to get the treasure at the end shows Indiana's character and in moments the audience seems to know him and trust him as the hero. The journey through the cave is kept so calm and eerie that the audience is kept on the edges of there seats waiting for the action to begin, as is typically expected of a Spielberg film, and it doesn't disappoint, in a few seconds Indiana is dodging darts, nearly falling down deep pits and running away from a large boulder. By the time Indiana is leaving in the plane everyone knows his character down to his dislike of snakes, and they know action is on the way in this film which it is. Spielberg movies often are full of action and the dramatic which this movie is filled with the most classic being the beginning scene, this is pretty much the beginning of this and it's success shows as nearly everyone in the movie world knows about Indiana Jones."

","Was wrong. This movie is not all about whips, convincing an evil villain into joining them and then whipping them in the face, (I'm not even sure if it has that.) This movie has your typical 1981 comedy, such as the woman screaming, ""Indieee! Come save me!"" The movie is basically about Indiana Jones searching for the raiders of the lost ark, some sort of object that is supposed to be a gateway to God and has unbelievable powers beyond our understanding, (think of an alien civilization) but unlike an alien civilization, people actually believe Indiana Jones, knows about it's existence and there's no one laughing and making Indiana Jones go around the country to prove himself, or else this movie would suck. It would be awful. (or still good, actually) but Indiana Jones is asked to find it because people are willing to pay for it, but the Nazis also want it, so he has some trouble. He has some competition.<br/><br/>Great movie. I never knew a lot from the South Park episode was actually in this movie (not a lot lot, but they made fun of some big scenes) but that's not the reason I decided to watch this. You should watch it, it's very interesting. Like I said, not the whips thing like you saw on Youtube, so don't worry. It's actually great. I'm going to watch the next one right now."

","This was the most popular film in the summer of 1981, and played to packed audiences. It must have resonated with people's emotions as an action film unlike many others. It starts with an adventure - an explorer travels to a savage society in order to steal their wealth (for scientific knowledge of course). He fails when another adventurer expropriates his winnings, but survives to return to his teaching job at a university. The film shows him traveling in a flying Clipper from the 1930s, but not on a railroad. It is a good action film, as long as you don't question some of the scenes. Could Nazi Germany have military forces in 1936 Egypt? Could German Schmeisser sub-machine guns be found in 1936 Nepal? I don't believe so. I suspect these scenes were copied from the 1940 serials that entertained moviegoers. ""Indiana Jones"" will entertain you as an action adventure story with a multitude of clichés from long-forgotten films. Sliding under the truck recalls Yakima Canute's famous stunt. Some scenes seem far-fetched to me (when you think about it). Could Indiana Jones on a horse overtake a convoy of trucks? The theme music came from the 1948 film ""Don Juan"" starring Errol Flynn (rarely seen on TV). The chase through the maze of streets reminds me of 1940 cartoons. Other scenes may be derived from other old movies (the truck knocking down scaffolding from ""Abbot & Costello Meet the Keystone Kops""). A few sequels were made, but it failed to be translated into a television series. Just like ""Jaws""."

From the director of ""Jaws"" and the creator of ""Star Wars"" comes the adventure film that all others in its genre are held up to, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". After twenty-three years and counting, I can honestly say that the film has yet to be outmatched (sure there have been good action/adventure films since ""Raiders"", including its own sequels, but I haven't seen a film that has had an indeliable, definitive impact that ""Raiders"" has left in a long time, possibly since the original ""Star Wars"") Hired by the U.S. Government, archaeologist/adventurer, Indiana Jones is on a race against evil to retrieve the lost Ark of The Covenent, the chest that contains the original stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. The ones that Moses brought down from Mount Harab and smashed. When was the last time YOU went to Sunday School!? Along the way Indiana meets up with an ex-girlfriend of his, Marion Ravenwood, outraces and dukes it out with legions of Nazis, and has plenty of close calls including a truck chase, The Well of Souls and its snakes (& Indiana's deathly phobia of them), a slugfest with a mechanic and his flying wing, and the opening of the Ark itself (lets just say GOD isn't to happy when mortals decide to open the Ark & sift through its contents). An absolute modern-day classic. Why? ""Raiders""' opening, from the Paramount logo to the natives chasing Dr. Jones, the bar fight, the basket chase, The Well of Souls, the truck chase (that alone gets 5 stars), the opening of The Ark in all its glory, John Williams' Oscar nominated score, I could go on all day long, but, you get the drift. What gives the film its drive (and where the sequels fail) is the urgency & danger of retrieving the Ark and the competitiveness between Indiana Jones and the Frenchman, Renee Belloq (the film imposes, early on, that these two have been competitors since there college days). I got this on cassette for Xmas 1984 and I burnt the tape out. Thank God for DVD. Nominated for 8 Oscars including Best Picture, Director (Steven Spielberg), Original Score and winning 4 of those awards including Best Sound & Visual Effects. The American Film Institute ranks ""Raiders"" as one of the top 100 films of all-time and Indiana Jones as one of the top cinematic heroes second only to Atticus Finch from ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". The truck chase wasn't directed by Spielberg (he did the close-ups afterwards), but was helned by second unit director, Norman Reynolds. Tom Selleck was originally cast to play Jones but had to back out due to contractual agreements with Universal and CBS for ""Magnum P.I."" (I think it would have been a different film. I saw a ""Raiders"" screen test with him and Sean Young and he came off very obnoxious). Danny DeVito was offered the role for Sallah but declined due to scheduling conflicts with ""Taxi"". The scene where the Nazi officer was supposed to shoot Sallah was filmed but couldn't be used, because of black smoke from burning tires in one take, and in another actor John-Rhyes Davies getting sick and filling his jallaba (and he didn't care one bit). ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one truly great adventure worth taking over & over again. No matter what George Lucas calls it."

","The euphoria that Raiders of the Lost Ark created at the time it was released is well known. A lot of people claim that it has influenced many film-makers over the years who made action-adventure films. But I think that Raiders of the Lost Ark is not placed in context most of the times. The truth is, this film did not invent the action-adventure genre. Now, with special effects tools becoming more advanced by the day, the action-adventure films are more spectacular than ever before. So where does all this leave Raiders? The answer to this question may differ with people.<br/><br/>To the many who saw Raiders when they were young, I guess it is to them what Jurassic Park (I saw it when I was 14) is to me. It is probably the most fun they ever had watching a film. But that's it. Raiders of the Lost Ark is nothing more than that - a fun film, which now looks dated. It is one of those 'American Classics' that I fail to understand the hype about.<br/><br/>Spielberg can mold a film like clay. He can and has created edge-of-the-seat films. But sometimes I wonder that when all those people, who saw his films when they first came out, go away and are not there to talk about it, will the next generations still find his films so thrilling? The action-adventure genre is like alcohol, you want it more potent with time. There lies the biggest threat for all action-adventure films; even if it is from Spielberg.<br/><br/>I liked Kingdom of the Crystal Skull more than Raiders of the Lost Ark."

"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","0","1","22 May 2008"," One of the best movies ever made!
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect example of how to absolutely nail the action-adventure genre. It hardly ever lets up with its unbeatably exceptional action sequences, and is jam-packed with absolutely awe-inspiring, edge-of-your-seat moments. However, the best thing about this classic movie is that it is bolstered by a excellent script, perfect performances (especially from Harrison Ford in his most iconic role) and flawless direction from Master Steven Spielberg, which ensure that the movie is incredibly smart and absolute perfection even in the moments when there isn't a delicious slice of action to devour. It goes without saying that this is right at the top in the pantheon of action-adventure movies, and that it is also one of the best pieces of cinematic brilliance ever invented.<br/><br/>Raiders wouldn't be a pinnacle of the action genre without its undeniably iconic and incredibly thrilling action sequences. The opening sequence is one of the most memorable movie openings that I have ever seen, throwing the viewer from thrill to beautiful thrill with breathless precision. The level of excitement never flags throughout this film, with expert editing ensuring that the next magnificently executed action set-piece is just around the corner. Also, there are some truly spine-tingling moments of tension which are perfectly staged. The sequence in a snake-filled chamber is one prime example, and is absolutely splendid to watch, throwing some truly scary surprises at the audience which I utterly cherished. <br/><br/>However, this film wouldn't be anywhere close to the classic that it is without the top-notch performances, script and direction. Also, it probably wouldn't be as well-known around the world as it is today without the iconic character of Indiana Jones. As portrayed by Harrison Ford, Dr. Jones is one of the most popular action-adventure heroes that there ever was, and it is tremendously easy to see why. Ford's performance is thrilling, hilarious and vulnerable. He creates a character who is charismatic, powerful and, most importantly of all, human. This isn't a perfect guy. He isn't invincible in a fight, and he has flaws. These flaws make him a character who is easier to relate to than the majority of action heroes, and lead to a much more poignant impact on the audience. Ford grips the audience from the very beginning of the film, and never lets go. This is his film, and despite the very best efforts of the surrounding cast, his performance is the one which is most memorable and most adored by me.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the supporting cast are bad. On the contrary, they are absolutely superb. As Indy's love interest, Karen Allen exhibits huge amounts of grit, wit and likability. This isn't a girl that you can push around. She's refreshingly good in a fight, and she doesn't always need to rely on Dr. Jones to save her. Of course, there are moments when she does need to be saved by Indy, but Allen never lets her character become annoying, finding the perfect balance between panic and strength. Allen plays the character perfectly, and both she and Ford ooze chemistry in their on-screen relationship. <br/><br/>The villains in this film are also brilliantly played. As Indy's archaeologist nemesis, Paul Freeman delivers a performance full of disarming charm, menace and surprising humanity. The moment when Freeman's Belloq tries to save Allen's Marion from falling into the snake pit shows that he isn't your typical, black-or-white bad guy, which, coupled with Freeman's magnetic performance, makes him all the more compelling to watch. Also, Ronald Lacey is spectacularly nasty as Nazi Major Arnold Toht, crafting a character who is spine-tingling in his malice. Lacey is brilliantly despicable, with a voice which is silkily terrifying. This is how an all-out villain should be played, calm, chilling and without restraint. The audience is left waiting with bated breath for his comeuppance, which is a masterpiece of technical invention and pure audience satisfaction.<br/><br/>John Rhys-Davies gives a charming and funny performance as Sallah, Indy's sidekick. His performance is enthusiastic, intelligent and immensely enjoyable to watch, especially in his scenes with Ford, who has chemistry with every cast member in this film. As Marcus Brody, Indy's colleague and friend, Denholm Elliott only has a couple of scenes, but he shows that there is a great potential for wit and energy from this character. He gets more of a chance to utilise that potential in the third Indiana Jones film, The Last Crusade.<br/><br/>The film's crew are also absolutely perfect with the material. The film's script is witty, action-packed, intelligent and often hilarious, crafting a brilliant story which never runs low on energy or a deep care and affection for its characters. Michael Kahn superbly edits the film so that it never seems too long until another rip-roaring action set-piece bursts onto the screen, whilst John Williams adds another iconic score to his fantastic resume. The stunts on display are brilliant, especially in the perfectly executed truck chase, whereas presiding over the whole affair with joyous and electrifying direction is Spielberg himself. The 'Berg proves immensely capable of crafting a relentlessly engaging action movie, and it is his obvious love for the characters and story which propels the film to classic status.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film which should not be known as anything other than a classic, and one of the best, if not the best action-adventure movies ever made. I am going to see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull tomorrow, and whilst I have every confidence that it is going to be at least a worthy continuation of the series, I have never thought that it will reach the heights of Raiders. There are some films which just can't be challenged, and this is one of them."

","Superlatives fail. What to say? Paragon? Pinnacle? Zenith? I surrender. This review isn't meant to convince anyone that Raiders is a good movie, or a great movie, or an immortal movie in film history, b/c I believe that to be an established fact. Twenty-seven years after I first saw it on the big screen in Murray, KY, in the summer of 1981, it has lost nothing of its greatness. This is a review about WHY it is SO GREAT. Why it defined the summer blockbuster forever after, why it spawned so many (inferior) wanna-be franchises, why even its own sequels, done by the same creative team, don't measure up and can't measure up. Don't get me wrong - they are wonderful films, enormous fun and far superior to anything else made in the same vein. But Raiders stands alone, the Everest of summer action adventure. Why? <br/><br/>#1 - THE DIRECTOR One of the best directors in film history. Spielberg, a lover of classic Hollywood films, was the perfect director for this project. He's also a director who could go toe to toe with Wyler, Hitchcock, Lang, etc.<br/><br/>#2 - THE ACTORS The casting of actors who were virtual throwbacks to golden age Hollywood stars. Ford/Bogart, Allen/Bacall, Freeman/Rathbone and Lacey/Lorre were perfect fits and brought more to the table than just their performances, by evoking the greats of yesteryear.<br/><br/>#3 - THE STUNTS The celebration of serials. The legacy of Republic serials and their amazing stunt team (Yakima Cannutt, etc.) is homaged like nowhere else in Raiders. The idea to take B-movie serial pacing and cliffhanger stuntwork and make an A movie out of it was genius. Thank you, George. Indeed, one reason for Raiders' greatness is that it took all the best bits and left little for any of the other films. Swing over pit, collapsing temple, boulder tunnel, automatic spikes and darts, (that's just the first five minutes), burning building, fistfight with multiple opponents, poison, snake pit, fight around propellers, horse to truck transfer with Cannutt's signature travel under the wagon -- any of the great serial cliffhanger death traps not done here were done in the second film. What's left? <br/><br/>#4 - THE MACGUFFIN The Ark of the Covenant is THE BEST MacGuffin in adventure film history. Better than the Maltese Falcon, better than the Holy Grail, better than anything. Thank you, Philip Kaufman. I hope you got paid a lot for giving George the idea. No one had done it before, and I don't think anyone will be able to do it again. Let's face it, the Maltese Falcon is just a valuable statue. The Holy Grail is a medieval legend that doesn't even appear in the Bible. But the ARK - it's got the bona fides.<br/><br/>#5 - THE SCRIPT The character development, dialogue, pacing -- everything is spot on. Beautifully laid out by another creative artist who understands and loves classic Hollywood -- Lawrence Kasdan. He did his best work here, and it shows. Keeping it a period piece set in the 1930s with Nazis for villains only makes it work even better. The flavor is just right. Note for those writing scripts: Larry has shown you the way. More than three good guys is TOO MANY. We don't have time or emotional energy to invest in more than Indy, Marion and Sallah. (Tolkein split up the Fellowship for the same reason.) ""More characters"" is not the answer.<br/><br/>#6 - THE EFFECTS Old school photographic effects combined with practical effects. It's still the way to go. We don't like digital. If we want that, we'll go play a video game. Practical effects look fake 10% of the time and digital effects look fake 90% of the time. You do the math. Digital is good for solving the same problems mattes and rear projection used to solve. It's good for erasing C stands and stunt safety wires. Not for creating characters. You need actors for that. This is why the Hulk movies have flopped. It's why Gollum succeeded - b/c so much of Gollum was Andy Serkis. The effects in Raiders are old school taken to a new level of excellence. There is sweat involved, and not sweating over a mouse and keyboard.<br/><br/>#7 - THE WRINKLES Raiders was shot quick and dirty. Sometimes, as a result, there are continuity errors. You can see the phone pole sticking out of the bottom of the truck. Marion's shots with the headpiece don't match. If the Staff of Ra is five feet tall, Indy is three and a half feet tall. AND I LOVE IT. Here's why - It's a real movie made by real artists. When a movie is so over-produced and tinkered with that it feels plastic, I hate it. I'm the same way with music. Here comes a guitar solo, but actually it's been built up in seven layers in the studio, each one with a different filter. At this point we're so far away from the guy and the guitar, I don't have a sense of who he is or what his art is about. Unlike a lot of later films, Raiders wasn't made in a Petrie dish. And that makes it fun. Thank God.<br/><br/>For these and other reasons, I hold this movie to be one of the top ten Greatest of All Time. Not even the people who made it knew it would be what it turned out to be. That doesn't mean we should give up on action/adventure films, b/c they just aren't going to get any better. It just means we have a high standard, and hooray for those movies that come close to it. And when we experience the disappointment of the ones that try and fail, remember -- --we'll always have Tanis."
"vovazhd","10","0","1","18 May 2008"," The ultimate adventure film
","Like many people, I grew up with Indiana Jones. The series was shown repeatedly on television and I could never resist watching it. For a casual viewer, few films are more entertaining. It has been several years since then and I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark again. This time I was able to make some observations about what makes it so great.<br/><br/>The acting is flawless. I'm tempted to say that Indiana Jones was Harrison Ford's career defining role. He is incredibly charismatic, honest, and iconic. There is not a single scene where he feels out of character. His heroic appearances always draw me straight into the film. His witty comments add a lot to the character. The rest of the cast almost matches Ford's quality. Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen) makes a realistic and lively companion, often in extreme contrast to Indy's style. This makes for some intriguing development between them. Sallah (played by John Rhys-Davies) makes another good companion, although he is a bit one-dimensional. The villains are some of the most creative around. Dr. Rene Belloq (played by Paul Freeman) serves as the perfect nemesis. Although he claims to have a lot in common with Indy, some key characteristics are reversed (such as his ignorance of others). In addition, Major Arnold Toht is another unforgettable villain.<br/><br/>The plot is very good. There are relatively few plot holes compared to other films that try to do as much. The events are unpredictable for the first time watching (well, except for Indy always escaping safely). The film alternates between riveting action sequences and slower plot development parts. This leads to some interesting pacing, which in my opinion is a success. The music score is varied enough to cover the entire range of situations while staying true to the adventure theme.<br/><br/>The action is amazing. Everything is timed perfectly and executed with minimal inconsistencies. The film avoids simple punching or shooting action. Instead, it explores creative ways to maximize use of the surrounding environment. The climactic truck-chase scene is one of the best action sequences ever filmed.<br/><br/>There are definitely some (but not many) better films, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most accessible classics around. You don't need to understand symbolism, art, history, or filming technique to appreciate it. I can't think of a more complete adventure film. It also ranks among the best action films. It has a place in my personal top 10 favorite films. If you haven't seen Raiders of the Lost Ark yet, then find some friends and check it out. You are in need of a true adventure."
"oneloveall","7","0","1","18 May 2008"," The new action prototype
","Although this movie is (rightfully) credited with taking the action-adventure genre into bold new territory, following all the film's well-placed elements just might have taken away from the overall adventure.<br/><br/>Yes, this does seem like the most mature of the three, with a plot that respects it's characters and history as much as the exotic action and intrigue. But in turn, this may hamper the pacing of the film, feeling less of a unified, far-off adventure then a series of wonderful and imaginative set-pieces set to aid the acquisition of the Ark.<br/><br/>Obviously, being the first installment in this legendary series has not lost it's significance, as fans clearly cherish this one above the others. It very well may have more soul then the later two, but as a pure immersive adventurer, suffers from some first-time tweaking."
"bobsgrock","10","0","1","11 May 2008"," The greatest adventure on film.
","So much more than just an action film, Raiders of the Lost Ark set the standard for any film that required action sequences of any kind. Harrison Ford gives us another iconic character that we can relate to and admire as he faces trial after trial. The supporting cast is very good as well, and the script is full of suspense as it keeps us guessing until the end. Of course the most important part of this film is the direction, and it is here that Spielberg does one of his very best jobs in this reviewer's opinion. What Spielberg does so well is tell the story and set the tone, then let us decide with our own emotions of how to react. Combined with yet another immortal John Williams' score and wonderful photography, it is universally considered to be the greatest adventure on film. It still is."

"Transient-Orca","10","0","1","10 May 2008"," A timeless classic.
","I never really watched Indiana Jones as a kid. I always saw bits and pieces when it was on TV and my Grandmother or mother watched it (big fans by the way). When I watched Rugrats as a small child, they re-enacted the whole beginning nearly. I always saw people impressioning the nervous switching of two objects, one valuable one not. I knew the music, I knew the title, I had an idea of who he was. But what was the big fuss? I mean as far as I knew it was just some treasure hunter.<br/><br/>But it wasn't until later that I started to like the idea. Then I heard they were making a fourth, and decided I needed to see them for myself. So my mom, bought every one for me. ""You'll love them!"" she said. I sat down and watched the Raiders of the Lost Ark, right after school ended, and was at the edge of my seat the whole way. I realized ""this is what all the fuss is about!"". I was hooked from then on. He wasn't just some treasure hunter, he was more dynamic than that. He seemed like the average person, who happened to be in WAY over his head, and still found a way to get out.<br/><br/>I always told myself that the movies I want my kids to see were Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, and now Indiana Jones. I have not met a person yet, who does not like Indiana Jones, he is either very much liked, or Loved to death. And the one person who said he didn;t like Indiana Jones, suddenly realized, he had been watching an Indiana Jones movie his whole life, but it was recorded on an unlabeled tape, so he never knew what it was called. (He later said ""I NEED TO BY THE WHOLE TRILOGY!!) Even my one friend who I was sure would be one of those who didn't like the movie, jumped up and down in excitement with the mere mention of the fourth.<br/><br/>I wish to not explain the movie, the whole excitement is being surprised by this movie. But one thing I would like to say is that I encourage anyone who grew up with this movie to sit down their kids (or grandkids) and have them watch it. If you have one of those kids who does not like older movies because of the lack of fancy computerized special effects, then simply let them know they have no idea what they are missing. I miss the days where they used real actors, with real explosions, and real danger, just more realism. I look at movies today and see great special effects, great editing, wonderful music, but barely a heart. It is movies like Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark that make me wish I was teenager when my mom was, because her times have seen more great movies then I will ever dream of. I can only pray that my kids, and my grandkids will look back at this and love it as much if not more than my mom, and I do."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","1","9 May 2008"," The best adventure movie of all time. One of my favorite movies of all time.
","My Take: Definitely the very best adventure the movie business has to offer. <br/><br/>The INDIANA JONES series may just be one of the best franchises in the history of cinema, and it seems pretty hard even to make a sequel that won't fall short of the predecessor. The INDIANA JONES series has everything that I like about the movies. Action, adventure, thrills, romance, and simply fun. And the first film, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, is the best place to start. The great thing about RAIDERS is that it isn't content with one great scene. It's ready and willing to throw in as much beginnings and endings as far as it can. The film moves from one locale after another, giving the characters much more to do. To a lesser film that tries hard, it's overstaying ones welcome. To a great film with a great screenplay (written by Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan), its terrific entertainment.<br/><br/>The film opens with our dashing hero, the ever-daring Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford at best), going on a trek through the rugged and muddy South American rain forest, off to find a priceless idol hidden inside temple ruins, surrounded by a bevy of booby traps. After surviving the ordeal and getting his loot, Indy's little artifact falls in the hands of his fortune-hungry foe Dr. Belloq (Paul Freeman), ending with Indy escaping a chase with Belloq's native allies through a plane, where Indy comes across his worst enemy: the pilot's pet python. ""I hat snakes!"" bellows Indy, and who knew such an action hero would admit his fear. Makes me want to admit my complete despise of cockroaches.<br/><br/>But this is just the first act, what follows include Indy's confrontation with Sherpas in the Alps, a trek that turns to a chase though Egyptian desert, but not without getting Indy trapped in a pit of snakes. The finale is always the time where the baddies get their just desserts, but that's just part of the charms of these kind of movies. It brings back the pure ""cheer for the heroes"" entertainment. And since this movie is filled with very interesting and memorable characters, the experience is more relevant. The fun of Saturday-matinées are wonderfully relieved thanks to such expert handling by director Steven Spielberg and the breathtaking special effects work by George Lucas' ILM which still holds up pretty well.<br/><br/>There's no further a do I can give about how great this film is. For all I know, you've seen it more times than I have (and I've seen it numerous times) and liked it as much as I did, if not more. Its worth buying the DVD set which includes the two films in the series, INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, both still stand out as pure classic cinema. Comparisons (especially with the 2nd one) are overrated. One film in the series is just as good as the other. RAIDERS is the most original of the three, but the other sequels are less sequels, and sprout out much original ideas on their own.<br/><br/>There's nothing really more I can say about this great films. My endless praises would just be the same thing that the last guy said about this movie. We know it's such a classic as other classics considered as the ""Great Movie-going Experience."" Like Lucas' other work on pure ""fun at the movies"" fantasy STAR WARS, RAIDERS has earned its place in classic cinema.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is simply the classic adventure film. You have your charming, smart, brave, witty and unforgiving hero in Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. There's history, mystery, traps, explosions, fighting, damsels in distress and...snakes. ""Raiders"" has it all and it shows the collaborative genius of two of the greatest modern day cinematic storytellers: Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.<br/><br/>The film begins on an artifact hunt in South America in 1936 as we follow Indiana into a hidden temple with a treasure hidden inside. Normally, this scene in a film would just detract from getting toward the actual plot, but this scene not only introduces us to our hero and his fearless ways, it also happens to be incredibly memorable in how clever the actions is and the traps are. You watch it and you feel like you've seen it a million times before, but that's because you have (since 1981). ""Raiders"" has influenced Hollywood that much. Granted it does borrow on previous concepts, but that's always what making a hit entails.<br/><br/>Eventually we see Professor Jones and learn about the Nazi's pursuit of the Ark of the Covenant, the ark that held the Ten Commandments and disappeared thousands of years ago from the first Hebrew temple. Jones gets paid to stop them. After a pit stop in Nepal to pick up an essential artifact for uncovering the Ark, he ends up picking up an old flame (Karen Allen) who immediately becomes the stereotypical leading lady. When they arrive in Cairo, the search begins, which action and mayhem along the way.<br/><br/>Ford simply makes these movies. Why else would Indiana Jones have been attached to the beginning of the names of the following films? He simply is one of the best one-liner deliverers in Hollywood history. Jones is a complicated character and Ford fuels that while also making him the cunning hero everyone wants to see.<br/><br/>While the ending of the film is okay, it's all the cool action along the way that makes it a 1 hr. and 55 minute thrill ride that you can't help but love. It was simply was the Daniel Boone of adventure films and in how much it has inspired other adventure films, it has accumulated its own timeless value and gotten better because of them."

"Robert_duder","8","0","1","23 February 2008"," An action classic that set the bar for adventure films--maybe too high?
","Did anyone know when they released Raiders of the Lost Ark that they were making history? I don't think they did. I'm told by my film making student brother that Spielberg and George Lucas made this with a certain amount of 'camp' in mind to pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 1940's which they pull off brilliantly. The budget on Raiders of The Lost Ark was eighteen million dollars, which was no paltry sum almost 30 years ago but it was far from being a big budget picture which went on to gross over 200 million dollars domestically. As brilliant as the film is for adventure I owe the success to ONE man and that IS Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford but more on that in a moment. I don't believe they knew they were making adventure genre history when they made this. First of all it wasn't Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark...he wasn't the focal point of the film. It was about the snakes and boulders and exotic locations, and wise cracks, and romance and just everything about it oozes 1940 classic cinema and people loved it. It is very unique and as a kid it blew me away and kept me riveted. I ALWAYS wanted to be Indiana Jones...ALWAYS. Watching it again years later I admit it didn't quite capture me in the same way but you can't dispute it's brilliance and effect on cinematic history.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford was probably one of the biggest stars in the world. Coming out of Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back it only made sense for Lucas and Spielberg to bring him on this project and he created one of the world's most recognizable and kick ass heroes that he will forever be known for. Ford is hilarious, and smart, and brilliant, and fast and an action hero like none other. His Indiana Jones is probably one of my favorite film characters of all time. He made this film and took an adventure film and made it a whole new genre...the Indiana Jones film. That sly smile and almost clumsy but always suave way makes him amazing. One thing that always rubbed me wrong about the Indiana Jones films was I am never a fan of his women and Karen Allen is really no exception. Her performance is okay but she just doesn't mesh well with Ford and she has to. Her sarcastic, feisty character just annoys more than anything. You don't believe a romance between them and you don't really want her saved. Paul Freeman is devilish and wicked as the villain of the film trying everything he can to kill Jones and make off with the ark for Hitler himself. His end in the film is one of the most memorable and gruesome in my mind. The brilliant and versatile supporting cast all play to one end and that is to lift up the character of Dr. Indiana Jones and that is perfect because Ford could carry this film or any other all the way through. John Rhys-Davies (an amazing character actor and does terrific as the sidekick), and Denholm Elliott, who I always loved as Jones' faithful friend in all three films.<br/><br/>Spielberg is the master of directing...he IS directing and Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of what he can do with a story and a great character. I mean this film created historical cinematic moments that will be remembered for ever. Indiana Jones, his whip, the boulder chasing him, switching the statue for the bag of sand, snakes...he hates snakes...everything about this film is classic. As an adult you might find it a little campy, almost a mocking tone to it but I don't think that's the intention. I think it was simply meant to represent a different time and genre and it succeeds in a big way. A film that everyone MUST MUST MUST see even if it isn't a HUGE 10/10 for me...I do give it all it's honor for being what it is. 8.5/10"
"departed07","10","0","1","12 February 2008"," A film that can be seen over and over again
","Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" plays something like an anthology series filled with adventure, dazzle, romance and thrills that it reminds me (forgive me, I'm excited) of the Nickelodeon show ""Are you afraid of the Dark?"" where every Saturday night as a child, an episode would scare the hell out of people wanting more for next week. That's what Raiders of the Lost Ark does from the first minute we hear the crack whip knocking down a weapon.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is a monument of 80's cinema where not only does Spielberg like to keep his audience riveted from his early days of ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" but introduces us a character filled with human emotions. And that character is Indiana Jones. The hero is an archaeologist professor where on his spare time he goes looking for artifacts out of the States and gets out beaten by his arch rival (played by Paul Freeman).<br/><br/>In this epic before the two sequels launched, Indiana Jones finds out that the actual ten commandments exist somewhere in Cairo, Egypt where it's just a matter of time before his rival and his team of Nazi's get a hold of the artifacts and use it for Hitler's domain where if the leader opens the Lost Ark, he would be able to have God on his side and control the world. Before going to Egypt, Indiana meets up with an old flame, Marian (Karen Allen), who has the medallion that can lead everybody to the ark. After the first attack, Marian and Indiana become partners in search of the artifact.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is not only an achievement in film, but in music as well. Steven Spielberg's music conductor John Williams puts the heart and soul of this movie using a mixture of thunderous and exciting adventure that it makes you want to rewind just to hear the music itself. I also laud the early special effects from the famous boulder ball chase to the climatic scene where even though most people would rather prefer the animals in Jurassic Park and today's technology, back then the people at least try to make some of the bad-ass special effects where they even won Oscars.<br/><br/>The first movie stands as the heart and soul of adventure where later we would have inspirations from Tomb Raider to Relic Hunter.<br/><br/>This is an 80's movie to treasure!"

","Get ready for the greatest adventure to ever hit my TV. Unfortunately I wasn't around back then to see it in cinemas but I bet it was awesome. I had never seen an Indiana Jones film but I liked the look of the newest Indiana Jones "" The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". So I borrowed the first three. I am glad I did. I recommend you do the same!! I thought it would be a boring. But it isn't. There isn't a minute that goes by when there isn't something exciting going on. This is adventure at its best.<br/><br/>Now as a teenage girl living in today's movies with the amazing special effects and where they do anything. Some would think how could someone like her like a movie that was made in the 80's and that has such dated special effects. Well I loved the special effects. Sure they were terrible by today's standards but they made me laugh and I wouldn't have them any other way. This is what classic's are made of ladies and gentlemen.<br/><br/>My favorite Spielberg movie. It rises above all of his movies. It beats War of the worlds no question and bites Jaws head off. It even rises above Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's list. It is up there with Jurassic Park and The Lost world and ET.<br/><br/>The acting is just so easy. It didn't even seem like the actors were trying. It just worked so well. Harrison Ford was just so good. He owns the role of Indiana Jones like Bruce Willis owns the role of John McClane. Karen Allen who played Marion Ravenwood was great also.<br/><br/>I give the highest possible recommendation I can.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jd8000","10","0","1","3 February 2008"," Among the greatest movies of all time
","When I was eight, I watched an Indiana Jones movie for the first time. It was the Temple of Doom, and, being young, I loved it. I went to the library and took out Raiders of the Lost Ark. This one was a good ten times better. Since then, I have watched the movie countless times. I would say it is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>A great thing about Raiders is the fact that it does not start out slow. From the minute you see Indy walking through the jungle in the opening scene, you know, oh yeah, this is it. No matter how unrealistically round that boulder is, you still watch in anticipation as Indiana Jones runs for dear life. It gets even better in the bar fight scene, where we get our first real glimpse at the bad guys. The movie continues with these great action-packed scenes, moving at exactly the right pace. There's even some comic relief thrown in. I remember laughing when the assassin pulled out a sword, did some fancy tricks with it and lunged at Indy...who shot him with his gun. The special effects don't matter at all, besides, with the current remastered versions, there's nothing at all to worry about.<br/><br/>Indiana Jones is a very believable character. He feels pain just like any other human, and is not invincible. You also care about Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood. You want the good guys to win. Raiders of the Lost Ark shows us all that sometimes the mere scientists can beat a whole Nazi army to save the Ark of the Covenant. People who despise the Nazis can enjoy seeing them get their asses kicked by an archaeologist with a bullwhip. I advise all of you to see this movie. It is a classic."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","10","0","1","30 January 2008"," Excellent Action/Adventure movie
","I'm writing this review just four months before the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I'm thinking about what exactly made Raiders so memorable. It's a throwback to action serials from the 1930's, and it has a certain timeless feel, something that most 80's movies don't have. But a lot of credit has to go to Harrison Ford for portraying a flawed hero who got by by the skin of his teeth. He also has Ophidiophobia, a fear of snakes, which makes the snake pit scene all the more suspenseful yet humorous at the same time. Indiana Jones has become one of the most iconic film heroes of our time. There's always something appealing about treasure hunters, I guess because we want to be them, but the kind of treasures Indiana Jones goes after are more rare than just treasure chests filled with gold. One of the reasons Raiders works better than its sequels is its treasure hunt plot. It drives the story completely and is not obscured by any other element. The Ark of the Covenant is surrounded by an aura of mystery and danger that the other artifacts didn't have. The actual hunt for the Ark is fascinating too. The map room scene is one of my favorite sequences in the film. <br/><br/>A lot of credit has to go to the supporting cast. Karen Allen portrays Marion Ravenwood, an old girlfriend from Indy's past. Even though her character is uneven (she goes from tough tomboy to damsel in distress a lot), she is still the strongest love interest in the series. She had a personality that was compatible with Jones, and the love story in Raiders is really the only believable one in the series. Sallah, played by John Rhys Davies, is just a really funny character. ""Asps. Very dangerous. You go first."" Paul Freeman is Jones' main rival, Belloq, who does not really emerge as a particularly memorable character but he still delivers a fine performance. Ronald Lacey's character Toht is probably the most memorable villain in Raiders, because he's just so creepy.<br/><br/>The action of course is top notch. I love the old fashioned sound effects, especially the guns, the explosions, the punching sounds, and of course, the whip! Everybody remembers the giant boulder sequence, but there are plenty of other scenes that are even more exciting. The truck chase is the best action sequence in the film. Indy hijacks the truck with the Ark in a scene reminiscent of the finale of Stagecoach and has to fight off all of the Nazi escorts. The Ark has an excellent payoff scene too. After hearing so much about the Ark's power, we are shown just what it can do in a jaw dropping moment that almost earned the movie an R rating. <br/><br/>This movie was almost not made at all, even with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' names attached to the project. Spielberg had just made 1941, probably his biggest flop, but I still find it amazing that the script was turned down by so many studios. Michael Eisner from Paramount recognized the movie's brilliance and said OK. Star Wars made Harrison Ford a bankable actor, but Raiders of the Lost Ark solidified his image as an action mega star. Indiana Jones is the character he is most identified with. Just think, Tom Selleck was nearly cast in the role. I wonder if the character would have been as memorable with him. <br/><br/>One last comment: Thank you John Williams for giving us another classic theme, the Raiders March!"
"scott-sw","10","0","1","30 January 2008"," Greatest action movie ever
","Raiders of the Lost Ark just may be the greatest action movie ever. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an Archaeologist and adventurer who is asked by the U.S. to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. He enlists the help of Marian (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). This leads him on the greatest adventure of intrigue, mystery, and action reminiscent of the Saturday Morning Serials. My only gripes were that the heavies were not that interesting. His archaeologist rival, Belloq, is uninspired and boring. The lead Nazi Generals, are also boring. Of course, the audience will automatically hate them simply because they are Nazis. Their actions are not really vicious. Probably what really sets this movie apart is the believability. Despite Ford becoming a one-man army, he shows his weakness. In one scene, Ford recovers the Ark from the Nazis by catching up with them, swerving to get them out of the truck, beating up the two in the front, and riding underneath the truck to survive. Almost immediately after, he is on a ship and is in so much pain he can barely get his shirt off. We get to see scars on his hand from the fighting. Indiana Jones is human. Raiders works because the story holds up, the humor holds up, and so do the leads. Indiana Jones it the part Ford was born to play, and Allen gives Marian great strength. Finally, the action is unrelenting, and serves the story well. This is the greatest. I will never get tired of watching it."

","This is one of the most entertaining films ever made! Despite the exaggerated nature of most of the events in the story, the viewer will be mesmerized by the adventures (and sometimes misadventures) of this heroic archaeologist. Every scene is thoroughly entertaining and the viewer is never left feeling bored by the development of the plot. The cinematography is great and the special effects are top rate for a film of the early 1980s. The nature of the Indiana Jones films is such that they have a tremendous appeal to people of all ages, from the very young to the very old. Very few films can claim a multi-generational audience these days."

","Indiana Jones and the raiders of the lost ark is one of the greatest movies ever. I saw this movie when I was only 8 years old, but watching it again a couple of weeks ago, really showed me what great movie is is. One of my favorite things about Raiders of the lost ark, is the music. Oh my god!!, John Williams was at his best for this one as well as for the other movies he scored (Star Wars, Jaws, E.T., ecc.....). Loosing the Best Picture Oscar to Chariots of Fire was really unfair. The acting was great, Harrison Ford played his part wonderfully and so did Karen Allen. I can't wait to see the new Indiana Jones movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull when it comes out in May. In conclusion the Indiana Jones saga is one of the best ever done, before Star Wars of course, anyway I think that this movie is one of the greatest of all time."

","The 1980s were a dark time for cinema -- they didn't give us much to remember them by, unless you have a love of stuffy British dramas. However, the 80s DID do two things very well: adult-oriented comedies and adventure movies.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is THE ultimate adventure movie. There had never been one quite like it and I don't think there ever will be one to match it, not even its sequels. This was a case of everything working just right. Steven Spielberg is at the top of his craft when in playful mode like this; Harrison Ford, though you'd never know it from his wooden persona today, made a perfect Indiana Jones (I can't imagine anyone else playing him); Karen Allen was able to convince you that she could be a damsel in distress one minute and then take you out back and kick the crap out of you the next; and John Williams contributed one of his best and most memorable scores. The film simply races from one dazzling set piece to the next, and the joy is in seeing just how much more over the top the film can get with each passing minute.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"jeremy3","10","0","1","25 December 2007"," One of the great adventure films.
","Most of the great adventure films were made a long time prior to 1981 - i.e. - North By Northwest, The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre, and African Queen. This film began the whole modern era of adventure films. This was the great pairing of the minds of Spielberg and Lucas, and it worked. There is greatness in so much of this film. The plot just keeps going and going. There is no time for boredom. There are great characters. There is the gestapo character. There is the crazy French archaeologist. There is the Egyptian friend and archaeologist. And, then there is Indiana Jones. I sense a great deal of mockery and parody within the film as well. There is the scene where Indiana Jones shoots the knife master, instead of fighting him. Allegedly, Ford had a bad stomach ache that day. By cutting out the fight scene, they unwittingly had one of the funniest scenes ever captured on camera. There was the silliness and bureaucracy of governments, who were afraid of the power of the ark, but also intrigued. It was the mixture of adventure, parody, and humor that really makes this one of the greatest adventure films. Indiana Jones definitely was the first modern adventure movie. I don't think that any adventure movie since cannot consider Indy to be anything other than the genesis of all adventure films within the last three decades."
"Ibuk","9","0","1","29 October 2007"," Raiders of the last ark-
","Harrison Ford has starred in two of my favourite movie franchises- Star Wars and the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford will be mostly remembered for two roles, the first being Han Solo the second being Indiana Jones. Right from the moment go, where Indiana Jones is chased by a boulder you know you are in a rollicking adventure. The movie is basically a barrage of stunts put together beautifully. Denholm Eliott provides fantastic support as his sidekick Marcus. This was easily the best in the trilogy, apparently there are talks of another sequel in the making but don't hold me to it. Harrison Ford after Star Wars you have me proud again."

","America entered a conservative period after the Iranian hostage crisis. Ronald Reagan became president, and Raiders of the Lost Ark became the big movie. It was set in 1936, a throwback to the serials and politics of that day. Harrison Ford is archaeologist Indiana Jones. The Jones character is a fedora-wearing, bull whip-slinging, adventurer who fights Nazis while traveling the world in search of ancient treasures. The Ark is the chest which held the Ten Commandments. The Nazis want it because legend has it that any army which possesses the Ark will be invincible. Indy's comedic instincts save the movie. The scene where he shoots the sword-wielding Arab is funny and unexpected. The close calls, narrow escapes and nonstop action is mind-numbing. The face melting is a bit much. I wanted to shut my eyes like Karen Allen."

"keesha45","10","0","1","5 August 2007"," ""I'm missing you already""
","Sallah wasn't the only one who was saddened to say goodbye to Indiana Jones. At the end of this showing at the Garland Theatre, we all had to bid him a reluctant adieu. Anybody that hates snakes, Nazis and unscrupulous treasure hunters is a hero to be admired. This was the first film in the saga of Indiana Jones, and what a character he was and will be again, if the fourth film in the series makes it to the big screen next year. It would be hard to top this first one, although the third picture had some more character development than the others and Sean Connery nearly stole the flick from Ford in one of Connery's most memorable roles since playing James Bond. Let's hope he will appear in the next one in a flashback, since he was killed off in his last appearance. There's little I can add to the hundreds of user comments posted here already. But I will say that we can all thank MAGNUM P.I. for RAIDERS' success. Had Tom Selleck been able to leave MAGNUM and play the Indiana Jones role as Lucas and Spielberg apparently wanted, he, not Ford, would have been the face of the franchise. I can't see anyone but Harrison Ford playing Indy. Perhaps Selleck could have had the kind of career that Ford enjoyed after playing Indy, but I doubt it. Selleck never got such a plum role offered again and the casting decision of Ford for Selleck makes for a terrific what-if scenario had it gone the other way. It's probably my second favorite what-if Hollywood story. Number one on my list goes back to 1968 when a series called STAR TREK was cancelled because the NBC network thought it was too cerebral and too expensive to produce, so they put ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN in the show's time slot. When STAR TREK was cancelled, it became the Cinderella that was rejected by the evil network, that became a hit in syndication and went on to spawn a series of successful movies and TV series as no other TV series has done before or since. If the fans had gotten their fill of STAR TREK after a few more seasons on the network, would it have gained the impetus to take off like it did with later movies and TV sequels? I think not. And neither would it be the same RAIDERS trilogy without Harrison Ford. Dale Roloff"

","I have recently re-watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, after seeing it many times on television in my childhood, but watching it now for the first time in years (and certainly the first time since I have become a big film fan) it is obvious just how superb this film really is.<br/><br/>My enjoyment has been dampened slightly due to having seen it many times before (and seeing no end of parodies and homages to many of the key scenes over and over again in television programmes such as The Simpsons and Family Guy) but now I can appreciate the wonderful cinematography, the fantastically low-key lighting and brilliant acting by Ford to create a very tree-dimensional character in Indy. I was also astonished at just how many of the key moments from this film have gone down in cinema history and are imprinted on the minds of audiences everywhere. Even if they haven't seen the film many people will still be aware of scenes such as the fantastic opening (with Indy navigating through a trap-filled cave and narrowly escaping from a giant boulder), so I think it says a lot about a film when it has so many moments that have gone on to become so famous. Apart from the possible expectations of Star Wars and The Godfather, I can't think of any other films that achieve this memorability so well. My personal favourite moments from the film, as well as the opening scene which I have already mentioned, have got to include the hilarious moment when a swordsman challenges Indy, showing off his sword skills only for our hero to casually shoot him and continue on his way. Another fantastic moment is the plane fight, where Indiana is fighting a large henchman resulting in the man getting quite brutally killed in the propeller of an aeroplane. Not to mention the glorious melting faces of the villains at the end of the film when the ark is opened.. Despite my positively glowing account of the film so far, it's not without its faults. The film is so well known by now that it has admittedly lost a lot of the original sparkle (which is similarly true for the Star Wars trilogy) and also some of the special effects and matte backgrounds don't always convince...but these things are expected as they are due to age. Despite these small niggles, Raiders of the Lost Ark is pure cinema, a funny, engaging exciting adventure that is full of charm. If you've been living in a cave the last 25 years and haven't seen this film, then you need to. NOW!"

","This is about the only Spielberg film I like (besides Jaws.) Raiders of the Lost Ark is a lot of fun. The most enjoyable scene is the famous stunt involving Indiana Jones and the moving trucks. The bowling ball of stone that rolls through the cave is also a great scene. I also liked the ending because it was fairly creepy. Harrison Ford is at his best and is a perfect hero. The film works because Spielberg, who is prone to sappiness, does not try to do anything in this film except entertain. There is no message, no sappy music, no drenching the audience with syrupy sentimentality. Just a lot of chases and Rube Goldberg film contrivances. Unlike most other Spielberg films which I regularly dis, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a very enjoyable action film."

As an actor he's not particularly expressive, but as an action hero with presence he does just nicely. But he's one of the main commendable things I could find with this film.<br/><br/>As a big grand spectacle it may be something, but it doesn't develop the most engaging characters or story to go along with it as we just sort of 'open up in the action', with Ford and some cohorts on their first big grand adventure.

Since then I have watched and read many Greatest Films polls over the years and Indiana Jones or at least Raiders of The Lost Ark were on all of them and just couldn't understand it. I hated these movies.<br/><br/>Then about a month ago I was bored in the house, nothing to do channel surfing and I came across a film, I didn't no what it was but saw Alfred Molina (Doc OCK in Spider-Man 2) and thought I would give it a chance, when suddenly Molinas accomplice tried to shot the man, faced covered, in front of them, the man expertly used a whipped to disarm the man, he stepped forward to reveal, Harrison Ford! Dam, I thought it's Indiana Jones, with nothing else on I forced myself to keep watching. As I watched Indiana Jones had achieved his goal avoided arrows, been betrayed, lost his prize, nearly been trapped, nearly fell to his death, got his prize back, avoided a rolling boulder, had his prize stolen again, been chased by a tribe of (I think) South Americans, got in a plane, flew of to safety and found a snake in his seat. Sounds like a great film doesn't it, however, the film proper hadn't even started yet, this all happened inside the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>The story itself is starts as Indiana Jones is approached by the US Government to find the Lost Ark of Covenant, the original stone tablets given to Moses by God bearing the Ten Comandments. They have received information that Hitler(who shows up in the third film) has hired Belloq a rival archaeologist, who also stole from Indiana Jones (gotta love that name) previously. accepting the challenge he goes in search of his old teacher looking for an artifact and meets a former love. The real adventure begins here as Indiana Jones risks life and limb to find the Ark before the Nazis do.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford Raiders of the Lost Ark is a masterpiece filled with humour, romance, suspense and of course action. The only thing i would change about this film is its release date so that i could go and see it for the first time on the big screen."

","If you were to watch only one adventure film in your lifetime, then this is it. Big call I know, but this really is the best Spielberg has given us.<br/><br/>And what a thrilling ride it is. From the opening set piece involving the lead stealing an idol from a rain forest, which is an absolute corker, to the amazing finale, this is a non-stop action bonanza that never gets tired.<br/><br/>The characters are also a lot of fun, with Harrision Ford playing the Wise-cracking archaeologist much like his his most renowned role, and his just as capable girlfriend being the highlights.<br/><br/>As always, John William's creates an instantly recognizable score to match the visuals, resulting in a package that always entertains.

","""If adventure has a name, it must be ________________"". Who can't finish this sentence without saying 'Indiana Jones'? Raiders of the Lost Ark must be, without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made in movie history. Right up there with Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Casablanca, and Suparman, this film marked a milestone in film history. Creater George Lucas came up with the idea of a ""globe-trotting archaeologist"" long before he came up with the Star Wars story. However, when coming up with the story of the space adventure, Lucas shelved the idea of this adventurer for a later time. During the opening weekend of Star Wars, Lucas and fellow friend and movie director Steven Spielberg were sitting on a beach in Hawaii, talking about what each of them will do in their future. Spielberg commented ""I've always wanted to direct a James Bond film,"" and Lucas quickly commented - ""Nah, forget him, I have something better. It's called Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Then and there, Lucas told Spielberg all about the idea of an adventurer who was more like a grave-robber than scientist, who went all over the world embarking on adventures while finding wonderous treasures. Spielberg was in love with this idea for a film, and said on the spot 'Let's do it."" Spielberg agreed to direct it, while Lucas would produce and overlook the project. George got the name Indiana from his dog (who also gave inspiration for Chewbacca in Star Wars). Originally, the main hero was going to be named 'Indiana Smith,' but Spielberg said he didn't like it that much. Lucas than said, ""Okay, how about Indiana Jones?"" Spielberg simply said "".....okay"".<br/><br/>After getting Paramount to fund the project, and hiring screenplay writer Lawrence Kasdan, it was time to find the one to fill the boots of Indiana Jones. Many actors were tested, but the one who had been chosen to play Dr. Jones, was Tom Selleck. Howeverm due to a contract with him and CBS (to make Magnum P.I) Selleck was forced to leave the project, and now Lucas and Spielberg had to find another person who would fit the part. ""How about Harisson Ford?"" Spielberg suggested. Lucas objected, because Ford was already in his Star Wars film(s). However, after having an audition, Lucas finally agreed to use Ford.<br/><br/>After finding the actor, now it was time to make the character's apparel. The main things that people will remember from Indiana Jones are the fedora, whip, and jacket. Those are truly the icons of Indiana Jones. Deborah Nadoolman put together an outfit which most suited Indiana Jones, including Harisson Ford. She set out to make a costume that would be remembered. If Indy were in silhouette, you'd know who it was instantly. Alright, so we got actors (including Karen Allen as the feisty Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freenan as rival Rene Belloq; Denholm Elliot as the good-hearted Marcus Brody; John Rhys-Davies as Indy's Arabic friend Sallah; and Ronald Lacy as the slimy Nazi-Major Toht.), script, costume, director, and money, so that leaves actuall making the film. Shooting was done like the old adventure serials seen on TV every Saturday morning (which Lucas got inspiration from): quick and dirty. Even though Ford did many of his own stunts (like running from the enormous rolling boulder in the famous scene), stunt men were required to do stunts such as going under a truck, and hanging onto a falling statue. The most grueling shooting was during the shooting of the Cairo Market Place scenes. Ford, who had a bad case of diarrhea, was frantic to get off the set, and move on. You know the famous scene when Indy shoots the Cairo Swordsmen? Well, originally, there was a long fight scene involved, and the actor playing the swordsman had practiced a very long time twirling the sword right just for shooting. However, Ford couldn't stand the heat, so he just said ""How about we just shoot the bastard?"" Spielberg chuckled and said ""Okay!"". The score of the film was made by John Williams, who had worked on Jaws and Star Wars previously. John Williams is well known for making themes that people can hum to, and he did not fall short with Indy's theme, the ""Raiders March,"" which has become an American icon in itself.<br/><br/>Will Indiana Jones IV happen? Who knows. What we do know, is that even if the Indiana Jones franchise doesn't continue in film, it will continue to live on in fans, and people who enjoy great films. See Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, and Last Crusade, to experience true movie magic. Afterall these are the films that created the legend of the man, and the man, who became a legend."

","Although, I have no personal liking for fiction and fantasy but Steven Speilsberg has injected such an entertaining thrill into this robustly full action adventure story that one can hardly stop from applauding this movie, which also happens to be the pioneer in its genre.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is a good choice for the lead role and he has beautifully performed the strikingly adventurous and heroic scenes that exude brazen excitement during the rapid flow of amazingly stunning events. To be just, I consider 10 points for Ford and 10 for Spielberg.<br/><br/>Spielberg is a master director when picturing fiction, fantasy, adventure and extra-terrestrial scenes, may it be those of animals and landscape long lost in the infinite hole of time, as in Jurassic Park. But the talent, I amiss in this great director is the morally strong depiction of human values and at times fierce focus of sentimental emotional expression that happened to be the bottom line of another great but erstwhile director called William Wylers. A matching replacement of Wyler's moving and touching scenes is yet to be witnessed by the audience."

","The first time I saw ""Raiders,"" I waited until it had been out a couple of months and school was back in session (a combination of factors which will probably never happen again, because it seems that distributors now pull movies out of the theaters 3 weeks after they're released, or the day there's a 2% drop in attendance, whichever comes first), went to a REAL movie theater, the kind with a Cinerama screen (which no longer exist), plopped myself down squarely in the center of the theater, and let the film carry me away. It may've been the best movie-going experience of my life. Other than an ending which I felt did not live up to the rest of the film, I loved the whole thing. <br/><br/>My favorite short scene is the fight with the giant in Cairo. Dozens, maybe hundreds of times in my life I have screamed at TV or movie screens when a protagonist throws down a perfectly functional weapon to fight the immense bad guy with his bare hands. When Dr. Jones drew his .45 and popped Goliath, I screamed with joy and almost fell off my seat laughing. Thank you for a hero with brains!!!<br/><br/>This is an all-time great adventure film. I also am very fond of ""Last Crusade,"" but ""Raiders"" is the mother of them all -- including endless rip-offs, unfortunately -- and a must-see for any movie fan."
"rosepink6133","10","0","1","14 March 2005"," One of the 10 best adventure films of all time
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film that elevates the standard for action -adventure films. Spielberg excels at bringing us to the edge of our seat while making us laugh at the same time. The stunts are so unbelievable and surreal, they seem animated. Throw in some strong character development and you have a recipe for success. The movie envelops itself in exotic, mystical settings, and if you're like most people and have phobias about snakes and spiders then hang on for the ride of your life. Our hero does pause for a romantic interlude but instead of slowing down the pace it actually adds another dimension to the story by giving Indiana Jones a softer more human side. Bravo for a winning genre that will hopefully continue to please moviegoers for some time to come."

I'm still wondering which of the Indy movies is best. If you're a sucker for whip-cracking detailed hot action, watch this. Trust me, you'll like it. I recall a few scary parts, such as screaming skeletons and decayed bodies, people having the skin and color and blood and flesh ripped off of them by the power of God arising from the Ark of the Covenant, and a certain fight I thought would be graphic.<br/><br/>Overall, and sorry to be so specific, if you're squeamish, you probably won't be a giant fan, but if you can handle this type of thing, you'll love it."
"RNMorton","9","0","1","19 February 2005"," The best of its kind
","Spielberg's homage to mid-century serial actioners comes off flawlessly, marred only by the characteristic excessive Spielberg gore. Ford is a whip-toting archaeology professor not afraid to leave the classroom in search of artifacts. The Feds talk him into going for the Ark of the Covenant just when the Nazis are headed in the same direction. When the twain meet Ford is short on firepower but long on chutzpah and guile. A spunky Allen comes along for the ride as a once and possibly future romantic interest. Loads of action, top-notch production values, a fair share of comic relief, and very good supporting cast including Freeman as unscrupulous rival and Rhys-Davies as helpful Arab. At the time this seemed like the first of a new breed of movie, looking back this one stands alone as the only one that really worked. Followed by the unwatchable Temple of Doom and the cult classic Lost Crusade (a cult I haven't joined)."
"tomimt","9","0","1","28 January 2005"," Fun adventure
","Great adventurous fun. That's a good phrase to describe 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.<br/><br/>You can see it straight from the beginning, that Geroge Lucas had his hands in the making of the movie. The basic storyline has so many similarities with 'Star Wars' . High speed adventures, characters getting in trouble, comedic sidekicks. But there similarities end, world wise I mean. ROTLA is based in late 30ies and obviously 'Star Wars' is not. oh, and director of this movie, like every Indiana Jones flick, is Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Shortly put, plot is this: Nazi's are looking religious artifact, and now they have their keen little eye on the ark of the covenant. That must be stopped, so U.S. government hires Indiana Jones to find the ark before Nazi's do. so twist and turns and adventure and couple of fights in they way. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford is extremely credible as Henry Jones, a professor of archeology by day and adventurous relic hunter by, well every time he's not in front of his class.<br/><br/>Karen Allen plays Marion Ravenwood, an old girlfriend of Indy's, now living in Nepal, running a small tavern.<br/><br/>Davies Rhys Jones does good, fun part as a more comedic Egyptian digger, who helps Indy in the search of the ark.<br/><br/>And lastly Paul Freeman (Belloq) and Ronald Lacy (Major Toht), the two bad guys of the plot, bot seeking the ark for Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>So, if you like fun adventure, this one is for you.

Unless Indiana Jones was much younger in the movie, Harrison Ford could easily play the role if he put his old bones to the test.

This is the type of movie where the adventure never stops.<br/><br/>In the opening scene we see Indiana in South America. In that scene we see him escape a collapsing tomb, jump across a ditch, get shot at by arrows, get chased by a giant bolder, and then have a bunch of local natives chase him to his plane as he makes a narrow escape. That was only the opening scene. Later on in the movie we see him in a shootout in a bar in Mongolia, getting attacked by ninjas in Cairo, and several other perils such as a pit full of cobras, an airplane landing strip getting ready to explode, an exciting car chase, and so much more in his daring quest to find the ark of the covenant. Along with him are his friends Marion(Karen Allen) and Sallah(Lord Of The Rings's John Rhyse-Davies).<br/><br/>Raiders Of The Lost Ark is the ultimate in genre defining action and has been copied many times, but has never been bettered."

If you haven't, then where have you been for the last twenty years? It's got everything you go to see a film for: heroes you're rooting for through every chase and fight scene, villains you absolutely love to hate (the Nazi leader played by Ronald Lacey is particularly slimy), adrenaline-pumping edge-of-your-seat set pieces right from the word go, jokes that rarely lose their dry sense of (albeit occasionally clichÃ©d) humour, and a quite literally heart-stopping climax. I'm studying this film as my genre and narrative coursework for Film Studies and can safely say that I never get tired of watching it no matter what mood I'm in. Plus there's something about Harrison Ford in that fedora that's undeniably attractive..."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","2","13 January 2005"," Even the MPAA ratings board loved it
","I bring up the ratings board because, like the two films that followed it, Raiders of the Lost Ark seems to have been granted almost unprecedented leniency in the rating. People get shot, stabbed, poisoned, murdered, blended up by airplane propellers, a head explodes, another head has the skin melted off of it like candle wax, there are corpses and all manner of other horrible things, and yet the movie gets a PG rating. I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade one after the other yesterday, and early on found myself wondering what it was about The Last Crusade that earned it a PG-13 rating when both movies before it were shockingly violent and bloody for PG films.<br/><br/>Our introduction to Indiana Jones is much like most of the time that we spend with him, a nonstop roller coaster ride of adventure, where one thrilling situation leads right into the next. He is sort of what every kid fantasizes that adult life is really like, a constant adventure punctuated only by the times when he has to teach class, pretending to be a normal working adult and hiding the fact that he's a world-traveler who constantly risks life and limb in order to get precious artifacts into museums where they belong. This is the kind of thing that makes you want to be an archaeologist.<br/><br/>The movies all take us to exotic locations and immerse us completely in thrilling adventure, as Jones gets himself into one dangerous situation after another in search of ancient historical artifacts. It's surprising that it wasn't until the third film that he goes after the Holy Grail, but each film starts off with scenes of adventure that rival even the best opening action sequences from any of the James Bond films.<br/><br/>The Ark of the Covenant represents everything that Jones got into archeology for in the first place, as he mentions early in the film, and he has to race against time in order to obtain it before it falls into the hands of the Nazis. The film displays exactly the right amount of comic relief to counteract the viciousness of Jones' pursuers who, as we know, are not above torturing and killing in order to get what they want. The characters in the movie are wonderful, with Karen Allen portraying Marion Ravenwood, Jones' ex-girlfriend who ends up his partner on his quest for the Ark and, my favorite, John Rhys-Davies as another helper along the way. Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Rhys-Davies when they're all in the desert, at the site in which the Ark supposedly rests.<br/><br/>Speaking of the best scenes, some of them are not the ones that take place when Jones first arrives in Nepal. The fight scenes that take place when he and Marion get separated in the marketplace are heavily over-rehearsed and completely unconvincing, but I'm still willing to accept them because the scene as a whole is so much fun. The scene where Jones casually shoots the swordsman in front of the crowd has been one of my favorite scenes in the movie since I was a kid, although when I watched it yesterday I noticed that every single extra in the scene reacts wrongly except for a single person. One person immediately turns and runs terrified into the crowd away from the shooting, while everyone else throws their hands into the air and dances around as though they're celebrating. I hope someone found that one extra and offered sufficient congratulations.<br/><br/>The movie is set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany under the control of Hitler, who wants the Ark recovered for himself at all costs, so it's Indiana Jones and his two partners trying to recover the Ark and survive the onslaught of all of Germany's military might. The movie is put together in the same manner as the old Saturday adventure serials, this time with bigger adventure and more danger.<br/><br/>(spoilers for all three films ahead!) What I especially respect about the movies is that they avoid going too far. It's a difficult line that they walk, too, because you can't have a movie like this that delves too deep into the meaning and existence of a lot of the things that Jones searches for without risking failure. Many adventure films seek certain things that, if they are shown, will immediately look fake (like the aliens in Mission to Mars), and if they're not shown they risk failure by giving the feeling of leading the audience on without payoff at the end. All three (thus far) Indiana Jones films ultimately end up with Jones' failure to obtain the artifacts that he is seeking, but he has still been successful in his missions. It's not an easy thing to accomplish in any story, but these movies are more concerned with the thrill of the chase and the knowledge of when success has truly been achieved rather than getting too close to the objects at hand. Bravo."

In all, it was much better the second time around.<br/><br/>Since the film involves Nazis and Hitler, I feel a connection through Ford's character. I love that the story shows the Nazi's as they really were. They were greedy and blood thirsty murderers, trying to take over the world. All they needed in this film, was Moses' ark of the covenant.<br/><br/>I am really happy that it turned out the way it did, and the Nazi's lost. That is great.

You couldn't miss it if you tried.<br/><br/>Some movies are carried by the story, by the acting, by the setting, by the star power, etc. ""RotLA"" is not carried by one of these, but all of them, making it more than just a good movie. Start with the search for the Ark of the Covenant and the history between Indy and Marion, combine it with the unbelievable performances of this talented cast, add Harrison Ford's box office appeal, throw in a dash of Spielberg/Lucas, and serve it up in places like Cairo and South America. That's the recipe for one of the greatest movies in history.<br/><br/>The beginning of this brilliant film (Indy in South America looking for the idol and ultimately being chased by a boulder) provides one of the greatest images in movie history...and it all happens in the first 20 minutes!! The fact that the movie gets better from there says it all.<br/><br/>To be honest, I think this movie being rated #17 overall (as of 1/11/05) is somewhat of an injustice.

But I still would would not rank it as one of my favorites. It remains a movie who's fierce beauty and power I can appreciate and have a healthy respect for while not having any strong desire to see it again-though I am glad I saw it at least once. I can appreciate this film's high rank on IMDb and understand it, if I was to cite 1 reason why I did not fall in love with Raiders, it's simply because it's just not my genre. I would estimate if I had to pick a movie that was known to be one of the best that did not appeal to me and that I did not really get into all that much, while still admiring many of it's aspects Raiders would be that movie.

The film races across the globe via many excellent set pieces as Jones takes on various bad guys, booby traps and carnivorous animals.

When the site of the Covenant is found, Jones realises he and the Nazi's may have got more than they bargained for.<br/><br/>Featuring some of the most famous scenes in movie history- the boulder scene, and the opening of the arc being two. Every performance is worthy of respect, with Ford ensuring Jones became one of Cinema's most loved heroes. Allen is excellent in a strong role, as are the various bad guys. The effects are still good, but it is the stunts and action juxtaposed with moments of humour which mark the film as a true classic.

","Raiders Of The Lost Ark is now generally regarded as one of the greatest adventure movies ever made,and for the most part,they'll right.Steven Spielberg and George Lucas succeeded in ressurrecting the style of 30s/40s serials for an 80s audience,keeping all the elements one half-remembers from viewing 'cliffhangers'as a kid on TV or just EXPECTS from a great adventure yarn,such as hidden treasure,lost tombs,fights,nasty creatures such as snakes and spiders,evil villains,they put 'em all in there,and than always remembering not to take it TOO seriously.Infact the film's tone is almost perfect,it seems constantly aware of it's own ludicrousness but never becomes camp.<br/><br/>It can possibly be said of Raiders that the long opening sequence,as our hero encounters one peril after another in a Peruvian tomb,is so great,it so captures the spirit of pure adventure,that the rest of the film never quite reaches it's giddy heights.It also shows Spielberg's skill as a director[and Lawrence Kasdan's writing]in introducing and sketching out the personality of our hero,Indiana Jones while all this action takes place.After this the film certainly goes down a notch or to-two brief fights in Tibet and Egypt are all we have in terms of thrills until just after half way when we have a brilliantly sustained passage of non-stop action climaxing in a truck chase sequence which is one of the best sequences of it's kind ever.Oddly however the climax features not some more Indy action but the Wrath of God,an original but not completley satisfying touch,with Indy pretty much redundant.This final scene also takes the film uneasily into horror territory,an area occasionally strayed onto by the film,which perhaps jars with many of the other elements of the film[while the first sequel,Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom,saw it's dark aspects become far more neccessary to it's overall feel and story].<br/><br/>Set against some of today's action/adventure films,Raiders does seem a little slow,with perhaps not quite enough action setpieces,but it still holds up with it's sharp writing and charcterisation,particularly with Karen Allen's spunky heroine and ofcourse Indy himself,who really has a dark edge to him and is a milliom miles away from the clean-cut heroes of the serials,as is some surprisingly strong and reallistic violence,almost completely different to that in ,say,Star Wars. It's impossible now to imagine anyone but Harrison Ford playing Indiana.Ofcourse John William's score deserves a great deal of credit,not only for it's famous main theme but the many other ways it backs up and enhances the film,an examplery adventure score.<br/><br/>Raiders will probably never seem as thrilling as it must have seemed when it first came out,and in some ways the sequels now hold up better.Nevertheless,it's still a great ride."

Especially the snakes and spiders and the Nazis melting away. I had a glutton for punishment, especially since I begged my dad in 1979 to take me to see ALIEN because I thought it would be like STAR WARS. I was wrong and wound up sleeping in my parents bed for about four weeks. <br/><br/>This was a good filler movie to keep me occupied for the three LONG years between THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI. I remember my dad got this movie for us on Beta and we would watch it all the time. This movie brings back a lot of childhood memories for me, as does the STAR WARS trilogy. <br/><br/>Looking back now, some 22 years later, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK remains one of my top 10 favorite films, just as Harrison Ford remains one of my favorite actors.

","Indian Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark<br/><br/>
Steven Speilberg's blockbuster extravaganza of yesteryear is a culmination of non-stop action glory thanks to co-producer George Lucas.  It is safe to say that the creditability of these two filmmakers isn't questioned, and if anyone could back that it would be Harrison Ford whom owes a lifetime of success to both of them.  `Raiders of the Lost Ark' makes Ford an American icon.  Ford plays a young tough yet vulnerable archaeologist/adventurer known as Indian Jones.  Of course it is characteristic of Lucas to use this film as a stepping stone for an epic trilogy.  The film has all the right elements, Lucas and Speilberg, and a foreshadowing of the development of Dreamworks. Indy is out to stop the Nazis from obtaining the mythological Lost Ark of the Covenant (a treasure chest enshrining the original ten commandments). Historical relevance of the Third Reich encourages audience members to delegate interest an support for the hero, Indian Jones.  Fast-paced, quick moving and heart-stopping stunts galore fill the screen, including one of the greatest filmed action sequences; Jones taking on a German truck and a gaggle of soldiers trying to stop him. The picture is fun, frenetic, and suspenseful with a tough of rogue humor contribute to elevating the movie into the pantheon of great films. Perhaps the most memorable and distinctive feature are the action sequences.  Even to this day the film still resonates with cool action sequences that were well ahead of its time.  Adventures couldn't be more fun and realistic, when comparing `Raiders of the Lost Ark' to the many other action films since. With the combination of terrific direction, an all American heroic icon, and the destruction of evil Nazi's it is no wonder this film is highly acclaimed as one of the best action films ever made."

","The ultimate peak of the adventure film, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie so masterfully-crafted that a type of magic seems to shine out from every frame. Steven Spielberg, one of the most talented directors of all time, has also given us some of the other greatest American movies ever made, from Jaws to Schindler's List, and in Raiders of the Lost Ark he shows us the film-making edge that has made him so extremely successful.<br/><br/>Raiders follows the exploits of Indiana Jones, part time archeology professor, full time fedora-wearing, pistol-slinging, whip-cracking adventurer. Set in the late 1930s, Jones is hired to track down the Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a chest in which the mythical Ten Commandments sent down by God are said to have been kept. The Nazis are after it too, their expedition led by the villainous Belloq, Indiana's career-long nemesis.<br/><br/>Everything about Raiders of the Lost Ark clicks in place with complete perfection. The script is fantastic and Spielberg's direction is flawless, a style which has influenced countless other movies since. The action sequences are heart-thumpingly exciting and full of edge-of-your-seat, such as the brilliant famous opening scene which introduces us to Indiana as he attempts to uncover a golden tribal idol.<br/><br/>The performances are all beyond excellence here as well. Harrison Ford creates one of the cinema's most memorable characters in the heroic Indiana Jones, a rugged warrior of the arts who all women love and who all men want to be. The beautiful Karen Allen is excellent as well as the two-fisted Marion Ravenwood, and Paul Freeman lends a smug sense of devilish satisfaction to each word he speaks. Other great performances include John Rhys-Davies as Jones' friend Sallah and Ronald Lacey as the cold, menacing Toht.<br/><br/>Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best movie experiences a film fan can ever have, and it deserves its place among the best ever.<br/><br/>I give Raiders a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to any and all fans of film in general"

This wonderfully comical, old fashioned adventure film is still (20 years later) one of the most exciting, adrenalizing, thrill rides ever crafted for the screen.  Easily watchable any time any day, I frequently return to it if I am in need of a surefire smile.  For some reason I have always found myself fonder of The Indiana Jones trilogy than I have Star Wars.  Both films feature eye popping stunts and special effects, entertaining sympathetic characters and old fashioned acts of courage.  But the Indy trilogy has always hit a nerve with me. Directed by the grand master entertainer Steven Spielberg, RAIDERS manages to take every man's most potent childhood fantasies and put them magically on the screen.  The opening with the giant boulder, the room full of snakes, the remarkable chase sequence on the truck.  If I had to make a list of films that most entertain me every time I see them, Raiders would be at the top.  Phenomenal filmmaking that introduced to the world the now legendary character of Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford is the perfect everyman, and he leaves an indelible impression in the role."

No doubt it is one of the Top 10 themes of all time.<br/><br/>Some great artistic shots: predominantly during the action scenes. Thankfully the movie begins and ends on good notes (I dig the ending with the Ark in the warehouse).<br/><br/>Harrison Ford: Honestly, who else could have improvised like he could or done the cavalier, rugged Indy attitude as good as him.<br/><br/>Whatever additions Lawrence Kasdan made to the script: I will be honest, Lucas, like Cameron, can't write worth his weight in sand.  This is all too heavily proved in Return of the Jedi and the new Star Wars movies.<br/><br/>Cons: Vapid Plot.  People say if you take out the 'action' in Saving Private Ryan then you have no movie and just a bunch of talking.  Sadly, if you take out the action in Raiders, you have nothing but Ford in a tacky suit and some really bad dialogue.<br/><br/>The Mummy Scene: Every time I see it I just wonder ""What was Spielberg thinking when he included that?""  He builds up all this promise of zombie ghouls--then Indy comes by and briskly carries Marion off like nothing had happened.

And much of the character exposition (except for Indy explaining the Ark to the audience) fairly stinks, thankfully Spielberg throws in the action to keep us from turning this off.<br/><br/>Overall, a rather overrated flick that is still enjoyable to varying degrees.

The issue at stake here is rooted in the question of why we watch movies: art? entertainment?<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that, on it's own merits, I'd put Raiders of the Lost Ark up against three hours of rain-soaked streets, blank b/w expressions and lingering half-truths any day!"

","""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a wild and crazy thrill ride which deals with an archaeologist (Harrison Ford) who is trying to keep the ark of the covenant from the Nazis just before the start of World War II.  The screenplay is greatly under-rated, Spielberg's direction has rarely been better or more creative, and of course Harrison Ford solidified his celebrity with this his greatest role.  5 out of 5 stars."

","This is the first of the popular series. A great film but I feel it is the weakest of the trilogy. The action is great but not as good as the prequel's and sequel's action. Steven Spielberg received his second Academy Award nomination for Best Directing, for good reason, he does a phenomenal job. The story is pretty good, incorporating action and a little bit of comedy and drama. Harrison Ford does a good job at acting, as always. The music is terrific, introducing the famous Indiana Jones theme. The special effects are good, especially for this area. All and all a pretty good film."

","I'm a big fan of Lucas' and Spielberg's works and this is without a doubt their best work to date. From the banter between Indy & Marrion to the action sequences to the whole history behind the Ark make this a truly incredible film.<br/><br/>The chase scene that starts when Indy steals the horse then chases down the Nazi envoy and eventually steals back the Ark is in my opinion THE BEST ACTION SEQUENCE EVER!!! (And I've seen quite a few action movies)<br/><br/>This is a film that I can watch time and time again and never get tired of. From the acting to the action to the special effects I really can't find a flaw with this movie. On a scale of 10 I'd give it 11."
