"aboriginee","10","646","789","23 June 2000"," The best character film of all time.
","Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry."
"jamie-109","10","476","581","17 February 2000"," Heat is truly epic, absolutely breathtaking
","One of the most amazing things about Heat is the scale of the film; it is nearly three hours long and packed to bursting with mind-blowing visuals. It seems one of Michael Mann's main priorities was to make a film with a dreamlike feel to it, to portray LA as a dusty oil-painting on which complex characters could play out their lives. One of the main themes is the similarity of the career criminal and the street-wise cop. It is fascinating to find yourself really feeling for DeNiro's tragic bank-robber, a man of philosophical merit who realises he's stuck in a life of crime he doesn't want to lead. Pacino's cop is less easy to sympathise with, but he too leads an in-escapable life of guns and crime. What really stands out is the climax. On the whole, Heat has to be the best cops n' robbers film ever made, indeed, one of the best films. An epic, wonderful, sad, adrenaline-fuelled exercise in scale and grandeur."
"LeightWinst","10","414","521","30 November 2004"," Masterful on all counts
","For some reason I cannot stop thinking about this film lately.<br/><br/>You know that feeling of having seen it about 3 or 4 times in the last 12 months is not enough? That's what I feel at the moment.<br/><br/>I rate it as Mann's best. It's his most kinetic,vibrant(for a film mostly shot in steely blue),agonising,stirring,brash,violent and brilliance in such a simple story. <br/><br/>What games did you play as a young kid? Cops and robbers.Good guy.Bad guy.<br/><br/>We all know De Niro and Pacino could have been either main part,but can you imagine it any other way round. Pacino doing ice cool calm? De Niro the manic outbursts,arms flailing? It wouldn't work. We know these men now.We know neither will stop at what they do.And yet there is no way either would stop the other.Unless they had too. Which leads us too the characters. All of them.<br/><br/>This is an extended family where you feel you know all of them without knowing anything at all. The cops are similar to the robbers and vice-versa. Perhaps Mann is telling us were all the same.Except in what we do.Every speaking part holds substance in this movie, and the support cast is astonishing when you actually read the caliber of who appeared in this film.Tom Sizmore, Val Kilmer,Ashley Judd,Ted Levine,Wes Studi,Hank Azaria,William Fitchner,Henry Rollins,Dennis Haysbert,Tom Noonan. And Natalie Portman, for chrissake! Try getting that cast again.<br/><br/>A real 10/10 film. And that Moby song at the end(God moving over the face of waters) gets me every time."
"ivo-cobra8","10","124","152","7 December 2017"," Action masterpiece Michael Mann, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's best favorite heist movie of all time
","A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent! <br/><br/>This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral. <br/><br/>This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.<br/><br/>Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD's Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro). <br/><br/>Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the ""High Incident Bandits"" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout). <br/><br/>Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley's crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn't let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi's men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me. <br/><br/>Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn't like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage). <br/><br/>The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout's I love it. <br/><br/>The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie. <br/><br/>The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life's like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters. <br/><br/>Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass."
"mkrusc","Null","298","378","19 January 2001"," Mann's crime drama delivers
","'Heat,' a film of epic proportions on a common placed scale, provides all the essentials of a great crime drama and then some.  With a fascinating storyline, involving characters, and Mann's sometimes poetic, sometimes gritty directing, 'Heat' is arguably one of the best crime dramas.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most unique feature of this movie is its manifold storyline, which focuses primarily on the main characters: Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley.  Because of this complex storyline, it almost seems as if one is watching two movies, with one about each of the two characters.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal.  Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter is falling apart, and, as wife Justine says, he lives his life more among the ""remnants of dead people.""  A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small).  His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with Eady, his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him.  The tensions build as Mann shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.  When the two storylines do meet (at different points in the movie), the result is--for lack of a better word--epic.  To say that these two major storylines are the only strong ones of the movie would do injustice to the many others (following Chris and his wife, for example); but to say that they are the driving force of the movie, to say that they are responsible for transforming a typical cops-and-robbers story is the best explanation.<br/><br/>In addition, the characters in this movie undoubtedly make it so successful. This cast comes as close as possible to being ensemble with two such huge main characters.  And the cast is one of the best, at that.  DeNiro. Little more needs to be said.  Ever the master, his character, McCauley, can be on the one hand a ruthless robber and cold-hearted killer, on the other a warm friend and tender lover.  And, despite his life of crime, McCauley's human side shows through.  He will not kill unless he must, as seen through his anger at Waingro and bank heist.  His warmer side shows through his relationships with his friends and girlfriend Eady.  Pacino.  Equally without need of praise.  As always, he delivers an intense performance, here as Hanna, a workaholic obsessed with catching his man, while also fighting a losing battle to save his personal relationships.  He may seem just the harsh cop, but he cares about every man under his command, about his stepdaughter, and, yes, even about McCauley.  Through Hanna, Pacino shows just how torn such a man can be.  Hanna demonstrates both coldness and compassion, both anger and sensitivity.  Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere.  Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose flaws prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives.  Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who, despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film.  Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions).  Each does excellent work. And equally fine are Diane Venora, as Justine, and Natalie Portman, as Justine's daughter Lauren.  As Venora is strong opposite Pacino, so Amy Brenneman, Eady, is an equally strong opposite of DeNiro.  In a cast so full of big names, it is so rewarding to see everyone come together to make the characters each have their own place in the film.<br/><br/>And Michael Mann's direction of the movie keeps the film moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama.  He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly.  He also switches between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost.  Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous.  Action scenes are handles crisply but grittily. The gunshots are loud, the blood is abundant, but Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment.  He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic.  The action never becomes more important than the drama. Mann is also responsible for what is perhaps the greatest robbery scene ever.  Here, his more gritty sense of style is what makes this scene so believable.  And, despite the enormous cast, Mann was still able to keep his agenda clear, and orchestrate so much talent into a coherent movie. Michael Mann deserves credit for both his vision and ability to express it.<br/><br/>Because of these and other well done aspects, 'Heat' is one of the most powerful crime dramas ever made."
"emsaldanha","Null","144","181","27 February 2000"," A stylish masterwork worthy of the talent involved
","I am always wary of films boasting of star-studded casts and big-name, behind-the-camera talent. So, I approached ""Heat"" with some trepidation...of course, I'm a big fan of DeNiro and Pacino (even as he has declined into one-note, manic performances in the 90's) and I feel that Michael Mann is one of the most underrated directors in Tinseltown (one need only view ""Manhunter"" to view his genius in pacing a crime thriller). Given the incredible supporting cast, this production set high standards for itself. I must report that it did not disappoint. Given that the running time is almost three hours and Mann has the task of balancing two significant storylines (DeNiro's and Pacino's), the film is a stunningly linear examination of life on both sides of the law. The viewer sees sacrifices made and relationships lost in both arenas without the usual emotional push to root for one side against the other. The visceral thrill of watching Pacino and DeNiro emote together was one of the film's marketing points; though they have two brief scenes together, it is a unique thrill to see these two modern icons of cinema play off one another. While it is clear that either of these two has the star power to carry a film singlehandedly, the experience of watching the cop and robber suffer through their diametrically opposed, yet parallel lives is fascinating. I'm sure that fans of the films will remember, in the years to come, the diner scene between the two as fondly as some hold the pairing of Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea in ""Ride The High Country"".<br/><br/>Those who criticized the film at the time of its release found particular fault with the climax. They cynically deemed the clasping of hands between the two opponents as a overly sentimental gesture. While it is sentimental, the scene is a neat capsulation of their relationship, however unexplored, throughout the film. They have acted as the hunter and his prey; yet, they finally realize that they are kindred spirits - dedicated men who put their chosen profession above all else in their lives. They are aware of the opportunities for ""normalcy"" they have sacrificed for their obsessions (I love DeNiro's line in the diner on what's normal) and hold each other in high regard because they share the same pain and isolation. I think ""Heat"" has a beautiful ending, enhanced by Moby's elegiac ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters""<br/><br/>I don't put much stock in the Academy Awards in terms of evaluating a film's worth, but it was a true disgrace that ""Braveheart"" was chosen Best Picture in 1995. ""Heat"" was not even nominated! Hopefully, the Academy voters will right this error with Mann's equally powerful ""Insider"" at this year's ceremonies.<br/><br/>Don't be scared off by ""Heat""'s running time or by criticism that its too indulgent in its character studies. It is precisely the film's attention to developing its characters that sets it apart from every other by-the-numbers Hollywood crime film of this era and makes ""Heat"" a classic."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","182","232","15 February 2006"," One Of The Best Crime Films Ever
","I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn't make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!<br/><br/>This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn't disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I've heard it. It was such a ""landmark"" scene that It's even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.<br/><br/>As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn't just Pacino and De Niro. It's Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. <br/><br/>Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn't overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can't have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that's nitpicking considering the film as a whole.<br/><br/>This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing."
"Peres-2","10","205","268","13 January 1999"," Pacino and De Niro together... simply great !
","Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have the same opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally. Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro. A must see !"
"stickman-6","10","240","316","3 January 2000"," Heat is a masterpiece
","In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out.  But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  ""Heat"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"". From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) ""Heat"" grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece."
"brendan_sutch","10","189","254","24 May 2000"," One of the best Cops and Robbers movies ever.
","Heat is a masterful cops and robbers tale that shows both sides of the law in exquisite detail.  Strong performances by Pacino and DeNiro (the scene of them sitting across the table from each other is possibly 5 of the most memorable minutes in film history).  Excellent cinematography and perhaps the best gunfight (if not, one of the most intense) since Hard Boiled. More than worth the 3 or so hours."
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","8","8","15 December 2019"," Michael Mann's the best 90's action crime saga masterpiece flick - my personal favorite movie of all time
","To me one of the best action crime saga masterpiece movie of the 90's by Michael Mann. I love this movie to death! It is my personal favorite action movie of all time. To me this is one of the best movies of all time!!!! You have great cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Dennis Haysbert, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Kevin Gage, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Jon Voight and Jerry Trimble. You have two great actors square off at each other Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Heat (1995) is a great film, it is a kick-ass action crime drama movie. It is a great crime EPIC drama has action and thriller elements.<br/><br/>The movie is 3 hrs long, but is not boring goes fast around. Heat is a remake by Mann of an unproduced television series he had worked on, the pilot of which was released as the TV movie L.A. Takedown in 1989. I saw L.A. Takedown on VHS played by actor Scott Plank in the role as Vincent Hanna. Sadly Scott Plank past away in 2002 and he is no longer with us anymore. He was in Melrose Place Season 5 and 6. The actor is really missed. In my opinion Heat is much better movie than L.A. Takedown with a better cast. Great story, great plot.<br/><br/>A brilliant L.A. cop (Al Pacino) following the trail a deadly armed roberry to a crew headed by an equally briliant master thief (Robert De Niro). Al Pacino has this crew: Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine and Jerry Trimble. Robert De Niro has his crew: Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Jon Voight and Tom Noonan. Great cast of actors that i know.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is one of the greatest directors ever. I did not like Miami Vice movie, I loved the series. In this movie it is a cop looking for a criminal. I love Collateral (2004) I have not seen that film in a long time, but I love it. Manhunter I enjoy I would say it is better than Red Dragon. I love Heat to death I love that Michael Mann produced Miami Vice (1984 -1989) one of my favorite TV shows. My favorite Michael Mann movies are Heat and Collateral they are my favorite movies of all time. Collateral I watched during my sophmore year on DVD with my friends. I have both of the movies on Blu-ray discs. This is a heist movie it belongs there with Point Break (1991) one of the best heist movies of all time I love and enjoy both of the version movies. Heat to me is much better than Point Break, much better executed.<br/><br/>I love Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective he was a great character cop. Al Pacino's best performance for me. I love the character, he saved daughter of his girlfriend when she slit her wrist. I love his line because She Has a Great Ass!!! Or Don't waste my time! I love his vision, he was a tough marine. He take down McCauley's crew. He killed and shot two members of the crew. I prefer Al Pacino's character more than Robert De Niro's character. I always rooted for the good guys I have rooted for Vincent Hanna beacuse he is a good guy I am always be the good guy the boy scout. I love how Hanna was huging this mom when her daugther was killed by Weingro (Gage). It is great acting performance from Al Pacino.<br/><br/>I love Robert De Niro's performance a professional thief Neil McCauley. He was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. I love De Niro's acting performance I don't root for him but I love De Niro in this movie and this film to death!!!<br/><br/>I love Kevin Gage as Weingro I love his character I love actor Kevin Gage. I read on trivia that he went in prison in 2003 and most of his inmates called him Weingro he was respected in prison. I love Val Kilmer his best performance. Ashley Judd was great. Jon Voight is in here as De Niro's acomplice. Jerry Trimble was also cast in this movie as one of the detectives in Hanna's team. Tom Noonan has a little scene in here, with a beared he was helping McCauley. Reminds on my dad with that beard ha ha. Tom Sizemore's best performance as Micheal Cherito I love his character.<br/><br/>I love the shootut bank robbery heist. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) pulls out an FN FNC-80 assault rifle during the shootout on Flower Street, and uses it to kill Cheritto when Cheritto - who is firing at Drucker and several other cops - grabs a little girl as a human shield. I love when McCauley's crew a firing on cops you see Hanna and McCauley firing at each other. Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) fires at cops, Val Kilmer's reload was so fast and smooth that this clip was used in U.S. Marine Corps training videos, to show new recruits how it should be done in combat. I love the shootout it is my favorite action scene. I love the finale Vincent Hanna chases down McCauley with a shootgun on the tarmac at LAX. They shoot eachother with their guns but Hanna sees McCauley's shadow and shoots him. I love the finale.I love the music score by Elliot Goldenthal great score well done.<br/><br/>I really love the bank heist to me it was realistic it was no fantasy. The acting the story it was realistic. It is how is normal life and I just really miss 90's movies like how they are done. Heat (1995) deserves to be called a mesterpiece on the best action crime drama movie sof all time. I like the love story between McCauley and Amy Brenneman as Eady I think the actress did great.<br/><br/>Heat (1995) to me is one of the best kick-ass action movie sof all time, it is my personale favorite action film of all time with Point Break (1991). It is a great film, it is entertaning. This movie deserves an oscar they both deserves an oscar. To me it is better than all Three Godfathter movies. God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters by Moby is a great music song, great look, solid performances it is a cop and criminal movie that is wonderful done."
"suchalad","10","12","13","1 September 2019"," 8.2? You guys are joking right?
","People have no idea how to appreciate moves like this anymore. Yes, the pace is slower........... that's the point........ It's an enthralling movie that sucks you in, and then builds, and builds, and builds, to deliver one of the most epic payoffs in cinematic history.<br/><br/>But of course people can't handle this story structure anymore. Human attention span continues to dwindle. It doesn't matter if a movie is great, it doesn't matter what masterpiece you craft, if the movie is longer than 2h30 and doesn't have an action scene every 10 minutes, then you've lost the audience.<br/><br/>And It's not just the frequency of action, It's the type. Forget anything with a sense of aura and beauty, even the action scenes themselves have to be fast paced, explosions all over the screen, with speedy moving shots that each last half a second, to the point where you actually struggle to even keep up with what's happening, not that anyone cares, because as long as the screen is bright enough and there are enough moving objects, your audience is stimulated.<br/><br/>Is it absolutely perfect? no
is it better than 8.2? yessss"
"eddieknocker","10","200","281","17 January 2005"," One of the best films of the 90's
","I am assuming I am commenting on this film for those who have not seen this film and for those people I pity you. Its a crime thriller. Won't describe the story as its not particularly original and not the best thing about this film. You've got Pacino and Deniro on screen in a film for the first and possibly last time which should be recommendation enough. You've also got director Michael Mann at the top of his game. An awesome supporting cast firing on all cylinders. Arguably the best ""shoot-out"" in any film - ever. What more do you want???<br/><br/>It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example, the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a ""grill"" working for a nasty, exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film.<br/><br/>Mann who started his career on Miami Vice almost seems to be taking a trip back to the eighties with the soundtrack and styling of the film - almost but not quite. <br/><br/>If you still don't want to see the film after this then what the hell's wrong with you?! Sit back and enjoy. Also - no. 247 in the top 250?? Whats up with that???"

I can't remember the last time I saw a crime thriller this good, so I guess sthey just don't make them like this anymore, sadly...The writing, the characters, the directing, the acting, the action, the drama, the suspense, the music...It's all so good, I have to say this is probably one of the best movies in the genre that I've seen.

","Micheal Manns'(director of 'The Insider', and 'Manhunter') smooth, straightforward direction is studded with brilliant and very memorable cinematic gems in 'Heat',  A bullet riddled drama with, yes , Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in their first on screen meeting.<br/><br/>What do you want to hear about 'Heat'.  Is it DeNiro's best performance? No. Is it Pacino's best performance? I'd be lying if I said it was.   Do the performances improve the story? Absolutely.   Mann has written (he wrote it as well) a complex and exciting two-sided story that develops the hunter Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and the hunted Neil McCauley (De Niro)  separately throughout much of the film.  Underneath a hail of bullets Mann is able to paint both lead characters with the same brush by delving into the similarly tragic and chaotic personal lives of Hanna and McCauley, allowing for the final epic scene, which would have been too pretentious if it were not for the excellent performances of Pacino and De Niro.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Not having seen this movie is akin to idiocy for anyone claiming to be a fan of movies.   9 out of 10"

","'Heat' is probably the most stylish realistic action movies of all times. It has been rare throughout cinematic history to get action film that emphasizes the substance as much as pure style. The film's story is so perfectly balanced that it makes the viewers question their morality. Thanks to the superb performances by two of the greatest actors in film, and their charisma along with their on-screen chemistry, it is easy to sympathize with both of them. You just want to Robert DeNiro's Neil get away as much as you want Al Pacino's Vincent to catch him. And what a fantastic group of actors both leads got on their side. It is simply pleasuring to watch such a rich supporting cast. Everything in 'Heat' is in epic proportions, and so is the length of the movie, but it is so masterfully paced that you almost don't notice how three hours are passing. Magnificent and exciting action sequences alternate with moody and emotional quiet scenes. I have to say that when people talk about 'Heat' they usually forget one of the main stars. And this, of course, is the city of Los Angeles."

This is an epic film that holds up even today. They don't make films like this anymore. One person said that De Niro acted out of character when he decided to fo after Waingro at the end. This person missed the point entirely. The point was that the each time he deviated from his ""Have no attachments that you cannot walk away from if you spot the Heat around the corner,"" things went bad for him. That was why he lived by that rule. When he deviated from it, he lost. That's why he finally lost to Pacino in the end. Also many on here who complain the film is too long also did not get it.

This is the best crime movie ever made. And, since my first viewing over 5 years ago, I have seen it a countless number of times. After all of these viewings I can only say that this is my favorite film to watch and therefore the best film I have ever seen. I will not divulge into plot because the expanse and depth of the films story, I could not do justice with a shorthand overview of its plot. This film is not about its plot, it is about its characters and what they feel. Michael Mann is my favorite filmmaker, his list of credits, admittedly, doesn't strike many people as the resume of the greatest living director, but when you watch those films you can see the gift this man possesses at telling a story and making us feel for his characters. There are three scenes in this movie that had me so drawn in, I still think about them often. One is the films first scene, Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing electronic score captivates us in the first shots of the train carrying Neal McCauley (Robert DeNiro)and leave me, and the audience wanting more. The third comes toward the end as McCauley and his boss Nate (a wonderful Jon Voigt) exchange their last words as Neal is planning on leaving the country the words the choose and attitudes they strike almost had me in tears. These are two hard men and this is far as they will go with their heartfelt goodbyes. The films last scene I will not give a description to as not to ruin the plot for you. I contains the best (almost) wordless exchange I've ever seen in a film. The music swells and Mann allows us to linger on the last shot. It brought me to tears, and still does. This is the best film I've ever seen. I doubt you will see it that way, but trust me you will love it."
"mbatelaan","10","34","54","7 February 2006"," Do you figure this is the right thing to do?
","Why is Heat such a great movie? Is it because of the breathtaking amalgamation of story, music, image, action and acting that makes every scene worth watching over and over again? The authenticity of the world of cops and robbers he portrays? The acting of Pacino and De Niro? I have watched the movie at least twenty times. So have many others on the forum. Why the fascination?<br/><br/>You can look at a masterwork by Rembrandt or Michelangelo endlessly and enjoy the beauty, the figures, the colors, the lightÂ… And many of us do. But once you 'get' what the work of art is all about, once you connect it to the great themes in life, one's own life, it becomes deeply touching. Often what it's all about is deeply buried in layers upon layers of craftsmanship and sheer beauty. One becomes fascinated, one feels strong emotions, but one has to dig deep to explain why. The greater the mastery of the artist, the deeper one has to dig. The richer the treasures deep beneath the surface. So Michael Mann's mastery, for all its perfection, is only underpinning something of a higher order.<br/><br/>In fact Heat has exactly the same essence as Ali, The Insider, Last of the Mohicans, Collateral and Thief. These movies, although superficially very different, are really quite similar in their core. They are all about making life-changing choices between different loyalties. Ultimate dilemmas. Heat is the most complex of all these movies in this respect and therefore in my opinion the greatest.<br/><br/>What makes Mann's characters so fascinating? They rise to the occasion when facing 'heat': extremely adverse and often violent circumstances. They all face dilemmas, life-changing choices. They need to do the right thing, no matter how slim the chance of success, knowing they have to give up something else which is a good thing too. <br/><br/>Vincent Hanna is not simply a workaholic. He gives up life as most of us know it (marriage, caring for his stepdaughter, 'barbeques and ballgames') because he knows he is such a gifted policeman that he can put away criminals behind bars, who will otherwise keep on killing the innocent people that haunt him in his dreams. But he can only defeat his adversaries if he is dedicated at the moments of truth. And he suffers for his dedication in all other realms of life. <br/><br/>Neil McCauley forgoes normal life as well to be a perfect criminal and never be returned to jail, but starts feeling the cost of that only after falling in love, against his principles. He knows he can only stay out of jail when not attached to anyone or anything. (Therefore his home isn't even furnished.) To him that is the right thing to do. See, the values of Mann's characters are not necessarily 'right' or absolute values. Criminals have values too and their dilemmas can be just as difficult. After falling in love he feels a dilemma. And becomes much more human, albeit on the other side of the law.<br/><br/>Why are some of the truly evil characters in Mann's movies so utterly evil? Because they are dedicated, but don't see the dilemma. They have chosen for their own ego, and pursue at any cost whatever drive they have, usually power and money (Van Zant, Insider's Thomas Sandefur, Thief's Leo), but alternatively perverse violence (Waingro) or revenge (Mohicans' Magua). They, directly or indirectly provide the 'heat' that make the more sympathetic characters have to choose whatever they think is 'the right thing'.<br/><br/>Heat is stuffed with life-changing choices. Once you pay attention, it seems as if almost every other line in the movie has a question mark attached to it. 'Check, charge or cash?', are the first words in the movie. Not exactly life changing, OK, but a hint of all the choices to come . 'You taking me to breakfast?' follows shortly afterward. Less trivial. Then, every character is faced with choices between loyalties. <br/><br/>All the most memorable moments in the film are about choices. Often very complex dilemmas. Charlene Shiherlis first chooses to betray her husband Chris to secure her son's future, but then when given the chance saves Chris's ass at the cost of probably never seeing him again. Neil drives through the tunnel with Eady on his way to freedom and ponders the idea to return and kill Waingro. De Niro's face shows the dilemma between loyalty one: getting away with his love, and loyalty two: revenge for Waingro's actions which have devastated his crew, with Chris wounded and on the run, Michael killed by Hanna in the shootout, Trejo tortured and mortally wounded (being subsequently put out of his misery by Neil himself) and Trejo's wife Anna violated and murdered. Neil simply cannot walk away from that. He calculates he can avenge his crew and get away afterward. But we later learn the presence of Eady at the hotel where Waingro is finished off, puts Hanna on Neil's tail for the final confrontation.<br/><br/>In short, Mann's movies teach us: doing the right thing isn't straightforward. The choices in life aren't obvious.To do the right thing, you will have to give up what is good too and feel great loss. Doing the right thing doesn't result in a happy ending. You will feel vindicated at best. You may even die in the process.<br/><br/>'I told you I was never going back'."

"CinefanR","5","84","150","8 May 2012"," So much for realism (and logic)...
","I remember seeing this in my childhood and being extremely impressed with it. Some scenes have stayed with me all this time. However, revisiting ""Heat"" 17 years later was a disappointment. The story looks far fetched and riddled with clichés and improbabilities.<br/><br/>The main problem is with the selling point, which is of course the ""Al Pacino- De Niro relationship"". Here's the problem: no cop who does this job out of conviction could possibly respect/admire a criminal, especially one who has killed other police officers. So the ending is absurd and downright ludicrous. The famous coffee-shop scene that Pacino and De Niro share is ridiculous and pointless, entirely made for us, the viewers. At the public request, we present you Pacino and De Niro, face to face! The clash of the titans! <br/><br/>Not only there is no way in hell that a committed policeman would casually sit and chat with a criminal over coffee, but what they have to say is so silly – sharing thoughts about their messed-up private lives? Pacino trying to talk De Niro out of the bank robbery business? Seriously? Such a lame excuse to deliver the much anticipated De Niro- Pacino ""moment""... The writing is terrible in this scene, as De Niro is also restating something he'd said earlier, therefore diminishing the impact of that line. Another example of bad writing and poor characterization is a scene where Jon Voight warns De Niro about Pacino's tenacity.<br/><br/>The constant shift to everybody's private lives was annoying and turned the whole thing into a crime-opera cheesefest. How many times have we seen the ""frustrated cop's wife"" act? And who cares about the bank robber's problems with his beloved wife, whom he occasionally cheats on? Oh, yeah, bank robbers are capable of love too. Touching! Talking about unlikelihood, De Niro's ""romance"" was laughable, and so was the transformation of an innocent librarian into an accessory to murder. The way Amy Brenneman switches from horror at what De Niro did to the ""Oh, well, he's cute anyway"" is hysterical. Moral relativism is an interesting topic for sure, but not here. There are moments that we're supposed to find moving, like the miscast Ashley Judd shedding a tear on the balcony or the cop hero Pacino holding hands with a criminal... What a joke.<br/><br/>The movie does contain some entertaining moments (although highly improbable), like the robbery scene. There's no way the Police would get into a shootout like that with so many civilians around. The suicide attempt scene is unnecessary and forced, and there are other flaws and extremely far-fetched/illogical scenes throughout, like DeNiro & the gang gracefully passing through police check-points without even wearing a disguise, just hours after the bloody robbery.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is fairly entertaining only if you can ignore its inconsistencies and plot holes. The more I watch, the more I find it insulting to one's intelligence. I know it's ""just a movie"", but come on... it's a 3-hour movie, and such an amount of implausible developments make suspension of disbelief pretty hard. I swear, if Pacino had shed a tear in the end, I would have rated ""Heat"" with 10 stars and put it on my all time favorite ""so bad they're good"" list."

","What makes ""Heat"" such a unique crime film is that it is both a gangster and a cop picture, which means that it spans an equal amount of time in both sides of the law and still manages to be original and compelling when they go toe-to-toe. <br/><br/>This is a film that is obviously addressed to viewers who are familiar enough with heists, shootouts and police procedural to believe they've seen them all, but Michael Mann made a 180-minute script, as methodic, intelligent and articulate as its characters. And speaking of characters, they're not defined by some narrative status, sure, the criminals are the bad guys and the cop the heroes, but the film mainly shows them as men, with lives, wives, girlfriends, motives and weaknesses, and it takes all the time needed to do it in the most absorbing way. After all, you don't just make a character-driven picture about five or six people in ninety minutes. Now, let's get deeper in the film.<br/><br/>Generally, in cop movies like the 'Dirty Harry' films, you have the central protagonist and the 'charismatic' villain. Gangster movies are centered on a specific operation and the gangsters' personalities generally undermine the outcome. ""Heat"" works on these two levels but with one pivotal difference: the cop and the bandit are not portrayed in a way that would influence our empathy. The cop, Vincent Hanna, is a tormented guy who can't handle his third wife and depressed stepdaughter, and Neil McCauley is a solitary criminal who lives by a code. His golden rule is not to depend on something he can't get rid of in less than 30 seconds. Did I mention that Al Pacino and De Niro play these guys? <br/><br/>Of course, everyone knows but does it matter? These two actors are my all-time favorite, but the story is so engaging and well-written that I'm sure any other actors would have made it work. ""Heat"" is so good that even the Pacino-De Niro pairing (the first since ""The Godfather Part II"") almost feels like a publicity stunt, as if the film needed that little kick. Well, I'm glad they picked these two actors, and their confrontation in the coffee scene, halfway through the film is a highlight and the best illustration of the film's central theme: men who live for their job and don't know whether they enjoy the action or they're entrapped in the impossibility to live a 'normal' life because of their jobs. They have more in common than they think, and they're both atypical even within their crew.<br/><br/>Still, from the way the conversation ends, we know their worlds tightly interact but don't mix. There will be a confrontation sooner or later. The film doesn't sugarcoat the criminal doings, nor does it ridicule the cops and that's important. The character of De Niro outshines the others because of his no-nonsense professionalism, beautifully echoed by the more volatile and dangerous personality of the villain within the villains, played by a convincing Kevin Gage. Now, that Waingro is a creepy criminal who adds his little spice to the film, and whenever he's is on the screen, you know there's trouble coming. He's a disturbing human being but crucial to the film, we know McCauley is on the wrong side of the law, still, he's closer to Hana than to Waingro.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is a patient and serious epic-scale crime drama that borrows many elements from a director I admire: Jean-Pierre Melville. There's a Samurai-like quality in McCauley and maybe a little something from Lino Ventura, physically. Here is a tough guy dedicated to his job, and nothing else, which means no girls but if he finds the right one, he might change his mind, for better or worse. ""Heat"" is about many men who end up acting according to their nature, even if it implies a price. And while the main focus is on Pacino and De Niro, it would be unfair to ignore Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Natalie Portman who seemed to have gained in maturity ever since ""Leon"". If Melville inspires Mann, he distances himself by giving a more substantial role to the women, the film features many domestic scenes and marital arguments and overall, the women are not just used like props to their men's macho appeal.<br/><br/>But I make the film sound like some existential journey while it also a school-case of thrilling action sequences and a bank robbery providing the most spectacular shootout you'll ever see, it is long but you never feel anything happening there gratuitous, from the first moment where they enter the bank, the way they handle the robbery and leave the car, you almost feel sorry for the cops' arrival, not because you root for the criminals, but because the real chaos and loss of lives result from the shootout. And some deaths come as unexpected and shocking but they're here to show how random and cruel life is, after all, the whole chain of events started with a miscast criminal, who was lucky enough to escape from his execution. Karma is also an important character in the film.<br/><br/>So we have one of the greatest shootouts of cinema's history, one of the most elaborate criminal operations and equally gripping police investigation, an intelligent drama about men ruling their lives according to what they do the best and we don't necessarily enjoy what we do the best. And we have a director who seems to have embraced the professionalism of his characters to make his personal masterpiece, perhaps the ultimate cop/gangster picture and it's only fitting that the film confronts the actors who played more gangsters and cops than any others. <br/><br/>And if ""Heat"" is a inspired by classic Melville film-noir crime flicks, Christopher Nolan admitted to have borrowed elements from ""Heat"" to make ""The Dark Knight"". See, the torch was passed and ""Heat"" is now a milestone."
"bayou_hannibal","6","80","146","30 May 2012"," An okay movie. Would have been better 60 minutes shorter with half the characters
","Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.<br/><br/>While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some ""tough guy"" porn will find plenty of it here.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.<br/><br/>There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.<br/><br/>One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a ""realistic"" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the ""realistic"" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.<br/><br/>I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas."
"tieman64","Null","22","36","17 June 2009"," Gangster Movies: Part 2
","The flaw of all gangster movies, at least those acknowledged as ""classics"" (Godfather trilogy, Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino, White Heat, Once Upon A Time In America etc), is how obvious and predictable their narrative progressions are. We get the rise, the joyous ecstasy of crime and the obvious monetary rewards, and the fall, that period where the world violently collapses around the criminal. With the scripts all so loosely similar, it just becomes a game of dress up. Of who has the best period details, acting and set design.<br/><br/>Released the same year as Scorsese's ""Casino"", Michael Mann's ""Heat"" positions itself as one of the first ""neo liberal"" gangster movies, all the others still caught in the old framework of mafia patriarchy, family values, loyalty, honour, total adherence to a distinctive creed, blood lines and tribalism. ""Heat"", in comparison, completely breaks away from these old-fashioned ways. In Mann's film, everyone is an individual in the most extreme sense. The gang is no longer a gang, but a crew of ""independent professionals"" who just come together for a specific job and then split. In this world, families and friends are non-existent or total charades.<br/><br/>While Don Corleone hid like a king behind his armed guards and giant fences, Mann's gangsters are trapped in a state of perpetual mobility. Like a group of shareholders, they are held together only by the prospect of future revenue. Their arrangement is temporary, pragmatic and lateral. They know that they are interchangeable parts in a larger machine, that there are no guarantees and that nothing lasts. Compared to this, the gangsters of ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Godfather"" seem like stagnated sentimentalists, nostalgically trapped in dying communities. While The Corleone's fight over territory and family honour, Mann's guys are only interested in Capital. As DeNiro yells during a bank heist, ""We're here for the bank's money, not your money!""<br/><br/>Tellingly, the DeNiro character's creed is one of ""zero loyalty"". He has a 30-second rule of walking away from anyone, however close he may be emotionally or romantically. The message of the film is thus double edged. It isn't just that the film's final resolution is that ""justice prevails"" and the bad guys are put away; rather, it is that those who fall, who get caught, are those who failed to live up to the modern creed, which is actually repeated twice in the film: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" In other words, late capitalism and attachment do not mix.<br/><br/>So in this sense, a film like ""Heat"", though otherwise entirely predictable, essentially a bunch of little boys engaging in idiot machismo one-upmanship posturing (Pacino's obsessive-compulsive manic cop vs DeNiro's cool sociopathic dedication, etc), nevertheless was one of the first films to manifest a fundamental social change. A series like ""The Wire"" then takes all of this much further, with its attempt to consciously map out the vast and unrepresentable complexity of contemporary neo-liberal capitalism. (In fact, a series like ""The Wire"", with its sheer scope, complexity and writing credentials, renders ALL gangster and crime movies irrelevant to any serious viewer.)<br/><br/>And so today's gangsters are all ""entrepreneurs"", all so called ""self-made individuals"", the ""self-employed Petite bourgeoisie"", radically without any social links, even down to the kid selling crack to his buddies. This is all a million light years from the long obsolete world of ""The Godfather"", ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"". While those elegiac films are about moments that had long passed, Mann's is distinctively modern. This is a film about the 90s. This is a Los Angeles of polished chrome, designer kitchens, featureless freeways, fluorescent bulbs and late night diners. All the colours, sounds, aromas and cultural quirks of Coppola and Scorsese have been torn out, painted over, re-fitted and re-modelled. Mann's LA is a world without landmarks. A vast urban sprawl, all traces of Old Europe replaced by business franchises, multiplexes and multinational coffee shops. While Coppola's film centred around a family called the ""Corleone's"", their name itself a reference to the village in which they originated, Mann's criminals have bland names like ""Neil"". They are without history, culture or family ties. In a brilliant touch, Mann even has De Niro reading a book on metals when he first meets his love interest. The guy is a piece of cold, polished steel in a world that is likewise.<br/><br/>Rather than a ""rise/fall"" structure we also get something a bit different. These criminals get no joy from their profession. Trapped in a world of paranoia, Mann's aesthetic is one of flat glass panes and expansive windows, his criminals always fearing exposure. For Mann, crime becomes a means of escape from the world in its entirety. Crime is total disconnection from both family, society and man, his criminals all looking to amass enough wealth to escape to some idyllic island on the horizon.<br/><br/>But it's Mann's style itself that seduces us. This style, which I call ""Armani decorum"", owes much to Mann's fondness for such painters and architects as David Hockney, Alex Colville, Edward Hopper and Ed Ruscha (Alex Colville's ""Pacific"" is visually quoted in one shot). Mann's thus trades the ""old noir"" look for 1950's modernism, block colours, expansive glass panes, geometric divisions and contemporary, linear houses. His frame is divided into flat surfaces, characters are dressed in pastels, scenes are assigned panels of light and buildings are relentlessly modernist, with fluorescent bulbs and geometrical, flat surfaces. Couple this with his unique choice in music (minimalist, industrial and techno) and you have a very sexy aesthetic.<br/><br/>8.9/10 – Dismissed upon release, ""Heat"" achieved ""classic"" status a few years later due to young film buffs. As the star status of De Niro and Pacino fades, and films like ""Dark Knight"" rip off its style, the film seems to be on another downward spiral.<br/><br/>Worth several viewings."

"waigo7","10","3","3","26 July 2018"," Best Heist Movie in my opinion
","This review includes some soft spoilers about the relationships between the characters and some detailed explanation of the synopsis. It is more focused on my sentimental impressions and I do not think it spoils any fun you will possibly have by watching this film.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
It's been 4 years since I watched it so i may not remember the vivid details but i clearly remember De Niro's stoic appearence; Sizemore,why can't we see him anymore?; Val Kilmer's 15 minute period of handsomeness in some time 90s and that neo-Nazi Waingro.
It was one of the movies that showed a well-thought action which was fairly new in Hollywood. Actually, action widely meant trade of blows between the protagonist and any henchmen until script demands to continue in that era until there were some attempts to be more detailed like Top Gun with the flight sequences and unfortunately i cannot think of any other example right now. The heist scenes were detailed, organized, and easy to follow to entertain and enjoy them. I like to watch complex and planned things portrayed realistically and any film that manages to do that will be loved and maybe be fanboyed by me.
Wasn't exactly a fan of Al Pacino's overacting but loved the dynamic between him and De Niro. That was the only thing i may criticise but not enough to drop a point.
As i told before loved De Niro's stoic appearance and loved his relationship with the woman. It was beautiful and moving in a film with cold-hearted nature.
Many told it was one of the influences of Dark Knight in its portrayal of heists and in its no-nonsense, never even grinning manner(except Joker). It is a great film to be taken example.
In conclusion, do not be afraid of its running time and watch some skills of this wonderful cast and Michael Mann."

"Brogan","10","9","13","16 December 2000"," A Masterpiece.
","Five years ago to this date, I was pretty tired from working all day at my job at the cinema.  However, I did manage to stay awake for a almost three hour epic that blew my mind away and saw a different way to look at the cinema.  Before this film, the director Michael Mann, has shown the life of crime in THIEF, terror in THE KEEP, suspense in MANHUNTER, and a historical epic with LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  But Mann's film were going on a upswing, and with HEAT, Mann reached peak level. This is a film that will go down in history.  Granted, it's not as much as a classic as SCHINDLER'S LIST and GOODFELLAS.  But HEAT will give future generations a example of what the world and life style was like in the 1990's.  Where NASHVILLE is for the 70's, and film by John Hughes is for the 80's, HEAT is for the 90's.<br/><br/>While living in central Los Angeles for over three months, the images and scenes from HEAT couldn't leave my mind.  Mann did a fabulous job by shooting the film on the actual streets of L.A.  The film shows the dark and gritty world where we are use to the palm trees and beaches.  Mann's L.A. has some fancy art deco buildings mixed in with decaying buildings.  The streets of Koreatown where all the signs are in Korean, the run down coffee shop that is hidden among giant skyscrapers. If anyone wants to know what L.A. really looks like, this is the perfect film that shows the viewer the real world of L.A. There's the brilliant plot.  Some would say that it's a remake of Mann's eariler work, L.A. TAKEDOWN. But Mann took a simple story and turned it into a epic, and that is exactly what HEAT is, a epic.  Multiple characters, multiple stories, different conflicts and situations and adding a blend of fantastic action into it.  I love the way the characters and story works.  Al Pacino playing Vincent Hannah, the lead detective who is tracking down a group of professional thiefs led by Neil McCauley played by Robert DeNiro.  Unlike any other crime-action film that I have seen, HEAT has both the police officers and criminals being highly intelligent!  No bad doughnut jokes, no bumbling crooks, no ""I'm getting too old for this"" lines, etc.  The thieves use clever plans to stage and work out a robbery, while the officers use clever actions to identify and gather evidence of the criminals. The look by Dante Spinotti is beautiful.  The L.A. skyline with his famous tint shade of blue makes L.A. look like a million stars in the sky. His shots of the empty apartment that McCauley owes with the Pacific Ocean in the background.  The music by Elliot Goldenthal is also fantastic, it has a techno beat that adds to the suspense and excitement that the film is showing.  But it's the score by famous artist Moby that rises above the rest of the film's music.  With Hannah speeding down Interstate 5 while ""New Dawn Fades"" is blasting on the soundtrack, and the magical and beautiful ""God Moving Over the Face of Waters"" being played at the ending credits.  Moby was quoted recently that ""God Moving"" is his favourite song that he has composed, he says that it brings tears to his eyes whenever he hears it. While I listen to it, the song gives me goosebumps and I can not think of the blue Pacific Ocean with the lights from the L.A. coast. And should I mention the acting, which is the best casting in the history of film.  Not only do you have two of the best actors working right now, DeNiro and Pacino, but here is a small list of who else is in this classic:  Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Dennis Haysbert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Henry Rollins, and Natalie Portman.  If you're going to have two fantastic actors in the lead roles, then you need to have a strong supportive cast with them, and that is what Mann does.  But it's Pacino's and DeNiro's performances are the strong stand-outs.  The scene where Hannah and McCauley are sitting down at a table in a coffee shop is of equal rank as Moses parting the Red Sea in TEN COMMANDMENTS.  Or Indiana Jones running away from the giant boulder in RAIDERS. Yes, these are bold statements to say, but if you have ever been to Los Angeles, you would understand.  And I don't mean the tourist city of Anaheim, I mean the real streets of L.A.  COLORS and BOYZ N' THE HOOD do show a pretty realistic L.A., but it's HEAT that shows the real Los Angeles. This is a film that when you first see it, it's good, but the more you watch it, the more you love it.  That is why I an not going to say to just see this film, but you should buy this film!  Believe me, for the last four years, I've been buying this movie on video or DVD for friends of mine. It's become my own personal chain letter, and every time I give them the movie, they come back telling me they loved it.  Please do yourself a favour, and see this film that is the ultimate image of the last decade of the 20th century. ***** (one of the top 10 films of all time!!!!)"

","This is my first review I have ever written on IMDb.

Because of this: 1. Acting - Stellar cast, most of them at the height of their careers. 2. Plot - Great story, plot holes are just for the nitpickers or the haters; 3. Cinematography - Probably some of the best heist scenes and a city at night ever shot on film. 4. Characters - Not all of them, but the main characters are well developed and you understand their motivation, their actions, their thoughts. This movie will not let you down. Perfect to watch in any situation."
"staven600","10","10","15","22 January 2016"," Terrific, classic
","I used to love this film for the action sequences and that beautiful blue-tinted cinematography, Los Angeles looking as clear and smooth as the ocean Neil looks out on in reflection. De Niro and Pacino fully inhabit characters that are two sides of a coin, Neil (De Niro) an introverted loner and a professional thief in charge of a crew, and Vincent (Pacino) a disillusioned cop who finds a connection with Neil, who he likes and considers a star, reflecting his own professional, no- nonsense approach, a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dreary career in which he must expose himself to all kinds of horror and sickness which he goes into great detail describing in order to stop his partner from complaining about relationship problems. Pacino has some of the best and funniest line in the whole film. It was a stroke of brilliance to have both De Niro and Pacino play characters perfectly suited for them. Pacino is often accused of hamming it up, and although he does chew scenery in this film, that's the character he plays and I always found him a very subtle actor whose expressions speak volumes. De Niro of course is brilliant, that goes without say, and plays a likable crook who has found his niche on the other side of the law and does what he does best. Any attachments they have don't seem to work, and the only real bond they find is with each other through their mutual cat-and-mouse interest in one another. The film isn't just about those two characters though, and while it is a crime film, that's just a foundation for a sprawling, meticulously detailed yet effortless, interwoven narrative involving many people. The way it all comes together as the film progresses feels almost cosmic. Waingro (Kevin Kage) is sort of a spanner in the works throughout the film, a sort of devil of chaos with no awareness of what he's doing (?) who shoots cops in the opening heist and gets Vincent involved in the case and on the trail of Neil. He vanishes almost supernaturally when Neil tried to kill him and pops up in multiple uncanny ways to botch things up for his old crew and his new employer Van Sant (William Fichtner). He even manages to bring Neil and Vincent together in the end by being the chief motivator for Neil's detour from his escape to a new haven after the disastrous heist. Neil kills Waingro in a sort of cathartic cleansing, before being hunted down by Vincent and shot in the final hunt. They both kind of save each other in the end and it turns out the way Neil wanted it. It was his wish all along to die at the hands of this cop who knows him as well as he does, and it gives him a sort of release for the afterlife. I guess that makes Vincent, his hunter, his Shepherd. It's a moving ending to a great film, and the final scenes of Vincent holding Neil by the hand in his last moments as they stand in the night against the airport lights, the plane to a life Neil was never allowed departed and his downfall as it illuminates his shadow giving Vincent his cue to take Neil down, are all just perfect. It all feels very fatalistic in a profound way. The film is a great noir because it's all about purpose and the search for it. The supporting cast is also great, after all it's an ensemble film and there's a whole host of interesting, well played characters I haven't even mentioned because I can't be bothered now."

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","12","19","16 April 2008"," Intelligent, tense, and thrilling, Mann's ""Heat"" is more than an just an ordinary crime film
","""Heat"", much more than a typical crime drama, is a character-driven masterpiece of writing and a film so riveting and fascinating that one cannot take his or her eyes off the film for one second without possibly missing a masterful shot or a fine bit of character development. If the film's intelligent, appropriately 'epic', character-driven screenplay wasn't enough to make this a great film, then surely Mann's brilliant direction, Dante Spinotti's photography, and Elliot Goldenthal's memorable score make this a great film.<br/><br/>Of course, the big selling point for ""Heat"" to this day is the union of screen legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. I am not certain whether the film's excellent screenplay was written by Mann with these two actors in mind, but it doesn't feel like it because it does not feel for a second like a cheap marketing gimmick, and the two actors actually share very little screen time together (for the first time, as despite both of them appearing in ""The Godfather: Part II"", they were not in any scenes together). When they do, it is tasteful and interesting. The scene in the diner where they first really meet, not counting a quick encounter on the street just before, is perhaps the true centerpiece of the film, even more so than the famed shootout. In that short, beautiful scene the two main characters discover just how similar to and yet different from each other they are. <br/><br/>The film is brilliantly. It is around three hours in length, but passes faster than most 90 minute films. The film masterfully builds tension while developing characters in its early stages in what some might call subplots, which is entirely missing the point of this film being driven by the characters rather than strictly by the plot. The film has a loose 'main' plot, but is a true epic, one which concentrates on many different characters and stories in almost equal measure. It builds up to a climax which lasts for an entire hour, a riveting, spectacular, epic, brilliant hour of film that begins with the shootout. Oh, the great, famous ""Heat"" shootout in the middle of the street in broad daylight. My opinion may be blasphemy to some, but I think this is one of the best and most exciting scenes in film history. It's as well-shot and edited as any of cinema's most well-known action scenes.<br/><br/>The immediate thing that stands out about the visual look of the film is how carefully and beautifully composed some of the shots are, the prime example being the film's stunning final shot (which follows an equally astonishing final sequence), which is certainly up there with the great final shots in cinema. The film's look cannot be credited entirely to Mann, as frequent Mann collaborator (The Last of the Mohicans, The Insider) Dante Spinotti's work as cinematographer is certainly impressive as well. This cast is certainly much bigger than Pacino and De Niro, and I can't think of one performance, not even Jon Voight's that can be called anything less than excellent. From Val Kilmer to Tom Sizemore to Ted Levine to Ashley Judd, the supporting cast is terrific. Even Natalie Portman's good.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is a masterclass. The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, everything about the film is great from start to finish. Truly a brilliant film, and one that will not be forgotten anytime soon. It doesn't work because it is a good crime thriller, it works because it's a terrific character drama, one which I find more and more involving with every viewing."
"OllieZ","10","15","25","29 July 2005"," Stunning.
","After watching this film for what seems the 100th time - I have come to the conclusion that it is truly a masterpiece crime drama.<br/><br/>Mann has done so many good films, in different genres, like Last of the Mohicans, Manhunter, Collateral, The Insider, Thief - and yet this film stands head and shoulders above the others. Truly epic is scale, the tale of Cop and Thief is explored to its max, and is executed with extreme flair.<br/><br/>De Niro and Pacino are top of their game - this being De Niro's last great role (along with the fantastic Casino). Both play their roles with precision - and when they finally meet (in the diner scene) both excel, neither putting an end to the ""who is better"" stakes. Pacino and his mouthy, yet troubled cop and De Niro's syntax-troubled thief make for one of the greatest duels in crime cinema history.<br/><br/>Yet it is the fantastic team of supporting actors who help the main stars keep their balance. Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora - only to mention a few - are fantastic.<br/><br/>Heat is a modern noir, the urban Gothic, with stark sky's, hauntingly human snyth and a bruised L.A landscape. Mann has created such a deep film, that I can't express how much it means to me. Drama is great, acting is great and the action is superb (the heist scene to end all heist scenes) - so this film is the jewel in Mann's crown - and a benchmark for other films in the genre."
"starcher3-1","3","63","131","5 January 2005"," overrated
","The simple fact that a movie contains two great actors does not make it a great movie. The interaction scenes between the two feel forced in writing and in the acting. The movie suffers from a sub-standard plot. <br/><br/>In the end he does not drop and run. It makes no sense. The ending is forced into the good guy wins Hollywood ending. If he had gotten away it would have made much more sense. <br/><br/>Often when I have have mentioned that this movie is sub-par others have reacted with shock, ""Its Pacino and Dinero!,"" they always reply. Then I ask what makes the movie any good and ""Pacino/Dinero"" is the only response they can come up with."
"stinuswolf","10","7","10","3 November 2004"," The best crime-movie ever
","As a long time fan of Heat I keep getting amazed every time I see it. No other crime movie has ever taken the time to build up every character so thoroughly. Even the ultimate bad guy Waingro is not just a shallow character communicating with corny one-liners. Actually so much of the depth of the characters come out through subtle facial expressions, e.g. Diane Venora when Pacino leaves her at the hospital (the camera lingers long enough for her posture to speak a thousand words) Ashley Judd in the couch after signaling to her husband...I hold my breath with her and almost faint every time I see that scene. For gun buffs you gotta love the sound effects of gun fire. For once guns are really loud and not like most movies where people talk calmly to each other while firing guns.<br/><br/>The fact that no judgment is passed on the criminal crew or the cops is simply superb. There are no ""good guys"" and ""badguys"" here only complete characters.<br/><br/>This is a remake of Mann's earlier L.A. Takedown. A much improved version that is, and I can see why Mann wanted to do this story right. Another thing I love is that Mann pays homage to ""that other great crime movie"" Bullitt. This is apparent in the very end of the movie during the airport chase, a scene that also concludes Bullitt.<br/><br/>If Stanley kubric is the master of natural light, then Michael Mann must be the master of artificial and post-processed light. The visual side of Heat is absolutely STUNNING and the soundtrack work in perfect harmony with the images. Ladies and gentlemen, this is art!"
"ktwebb68","4","68","143","25 February 2007"," Is everyone on dope?
","Take the big moment of this movie. What the trailers touted. What was supposed to be the meeting of giants. The coffee scene with Deniro and Pacino. Both legendary film actors with credentials that are undeniable. What possessed them to allow this scene to get to the screen is beyond me. If your 10 years old you could have written the dialog. If your not and have kids, they have. In fact I have written this dialog as have many people that have put pen to paper and were ever drawn to cop/robber dramatic films. ""your going down brother"" Need I say more.<br/><br/>Then I read the reviews here and I am even more stunned. If you eliminate the horrific Pacino/Deniro scene you have a decent movie. Perhaps I would have given it a 5. Plot lines that were meaningless. A movie that tried very, very hard to be something more than it is, or was. Over direction. And the rest of the script wasn't Shakespeare either. It wasn't just the ""big"" scene. It was all of them. Kilmer's part was comical. I don't think that was the intent.<br/><br/>Anyway, I suppose, based on the unbelievable reviews for this movie here, I am in the vast minority. So if you haven't seen it yet all I would say is this. If we assume you have some degree of film intellect, then do not expect to see what you read in some of these reviews. If you go in not expecting much you may very well enjoy this very ordinary movie. if you go in expected the ""Best movie of the 90s"" or a ""masterpiece"" you may be sorely disappointed. I will laugh about these reviews for days. Utterly amazing otherwise intelligent people could be hypnotized by the hype of this film. Guys, at best it's a 5 out of 10."

","Still, after all these years, one of my favorite films. Not just because of the great cast, but the overall vibe and style is superb. When this movie was just released I was blown away by the shootout scene at the bank, but in the years after I found myself enjoying every single scene. One of the few films where the violence serves the storytelling instead of replacing it. Also the dialogues are sometimes poetry without losing credibility. The soundtrack is timeless and sets the right tone, straight from the beginning. An almost dreamy world that portrays a harsh one. I am writing this review (my first) on IMDb to honor this movie that never bores me. And as a filmmaker, it really influenced me a lot."
"Mobithailand","10","10","16","31 March 2016"," The definitive 'Cops & Robbers' movie - bar none!
","A few days ago I finally got around to watching the much regarded 1995 'cops and robbers' movie, ""Heat."" I'm not a particular fan of this genre unless it is really well done, but Heat has been on my list of 'Movies to watch' for quite a while. It received high praise from most critics and seemed to have some excellent credentials<br/><br/>Let's face it, a movie starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, (two of my all-time favourite actors), along with John Voight, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman and many, many more, could hardly fail. And it didn't – even more so as it was in the hands of one of the masters of the genre, Michael Mann, who wrote and directed it.<br/><br/>The film is a whopping 2 hours 46 minutes, but the time just flew by, leaving me begging for more. Heat is undoubtedly one the definitive films of any era and although it was made twenty years ago, it hasn't dated at all and is still eminently watchable. Okay, the cell phones may have been a little on the large side, but that aside, this movie could have been made last year.<br/><br/>Al Pacino as the hard-bitten cop on a mission and whose personal life is falling apart, and Robert De Niro – the tough, no-nonsense criminal genius – both play their parts to perfection. These two towering figures of the silver screen are only seen together in two scenes.<br/><br/>The first meeting is about half way through the movie, when they enjoy a cup of coffee together. This is a classic confrontation between 'good and evil'; with both of them acknowledging the unstoppable forces that drive them to do what they do. They even have a grudging respect for each other – given the different paths they have chosen in life.<br/><br/>The second time they meet is at the end of the movie when we watch the denouement of these two mesmerizing characters played out to the bitter end.<br/><br/>Pacino and De Niro are totally 'on song' in this film and Mann has written their parts in a way that allows them to excel in what they do best. The supporting cast, with the likes of Kilmer and Voight (both villains), are a joy to behold and the movie is acted by an ensemble of actors that was taken from the best that Hollywood had to offer in the mid - 90's.<br/><br/>Of course, with Mann directing, there is plenty of violence, and a seemingly never-ending shoot-out scene ranks right up there with some of the greatest shoot-outs of all time. To say any more about Heat would spoil the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.<br/><br/>Even if you have, it is well worth another looksie after all these years. Go get the DVD or download it. You will NOT be disappointed."

","Heat is written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brennerman and Danny Trejo. Music is scored by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Dante Spinoti.<br/><br/>Big time thief Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is after one last major score before he retires, but hot on his tail is Vincent Hannah (Pacino), a cop equally and methodically as driven as he is himself.<br/><br/>In the build up to Heat's release, much was made of it being the first on screen pairing of DeNiro and Pacino. A mouthwatering prospect for sure, it proved to be worth the wait and unfolds as a lesson in restrained acting with two modern greats affording each other the respect that was due. What we didn't realise in the build up to the film's release, was that it would prove to be one of the greatest cops and robbers movies of all time, brought to us by an auteur director whose kink for realism and commitment to research stands him out from much of the modern directing pack.<br/><br/>Rarely does a film come together as one, where all the cogs of the engine are in tune, but Heat is one such picture. From cast performances to visual aesthetics, to screenplay and actual substance of story, Heat is as meticulous as it is thrilling. There are a myriad of characters brilliantly stitched together in one de-glamorised City of Angels, as plot develops, and each character and their crumbling relationships come under inspection, we are witnessing a coarse viewpoint of human nature, where people's lives are ended or defined by their choices. Everywhere you look, here, there are folk cracking under the strain of being exposed to high end crime, dreams, hopes and happiness are unlikely to be achieved, and this is on both sides of the law.<br/><br/>For Heat, Mann fuses the tonal and visual ticks of Manhunter with that of the adrenalin rushes from Last of the Mohicans, with the former gorgeously born out by Spinoti's pin sharp photography, the latter thrillingly realised by Mann's skill at action set pieces. Once again word of mouth about the key heist and shoot out in the film led to high expectation, and again there is no disappointment. L.A. becomes a battle ground, rapid gunfire punctures the air, cars swerve and crash, bodies fall, visually and aurally it drags you to the edge of your seat, an extended action sequence fit to sit with the best of them. The kicker as well is that because Mann has been so detailed in his characterisations, we care about what happens to all parties, we understand motives and means. Which in a film with such a huge support cast is quite an achievement.<br/><br/>There is enough in Heat to fill out a dozen other cops and robbers films, fans of neo-noir and crime films in general are spoilt supreme here. It's not rocket science really, put a group of great actors together, give them an intelligent script to work from and let them be guided by a director who will not sit still, and you get a great film. Heat, the ultimate predator and prey movie, where from beginning to end it refuses to be lazy or cop out, and energy and thought seeps from every frame. 10/10"

","I gave this a 1 MOSTLY because not only is this movie absolutely terrible, but it is absolutely terrible AND nearly 3 hours long.<br/><br/>The plot to this movie is completely awful. The synopsis given by IMDb does not even remotely describe this movie. Maybe that's what the screenwriter possibly intended this movie to be about, and it started out that way the first 30 minutes (maybe), but it went in all kinds of directions with a bunch of meaningless plot-lines, meaningless characters, meaningless scenes.<br/><br/>The acting, fine. Everything else, why? What were you thinking? Were you thinking? <-THAT kind of bad.<br/><br/>We are introduced to several characters and their little lives like they mean something, like they're going to be something. Then they die, or just drop off out of the movie entirely for no reason.<br/><br/>Ultimate crime drama? I don't think so. Every criminal in this movie is an idiot. They're sloppy, make amateur mistakes in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and yet it's shoved in your face that ""De Niro's character is so clever and smart, always one step ahead"". If he's so smart, why hire a new guy in the beginning for a heist that kills someone and nearly screws your heist over? Then as De Niro goes to take care of the problem and kill him, he looks away (without a hold on the guy) and lets him get away? Didn't watch him or hear him? That was in the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just complete trash. We get random scenes of these criminal men with their families and how happy their lives are, but not enough to actually give an attachment to their character. We get random scenes of the detective, Pacino's character, in his little life. There was no point in introducing us to the drama of each of these lives, because none of these characters matter and ALL are cut out at the end with no closure, and no real story to close, besides Pacino and De Niro.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, the ""plot"" is the struggle between these two conflicting men and their will to do what they want in life. A very dramatic, drawn-out showdown, and De Niro goes down with Pacino holding his hand until his end. How touching. By that time, Pacino's character would have hated him, as De Niro's character shot down his cop friends right in front of him, and De Niro would hate Pacino for killing his friend. So why is there this touching scene where they are now at a closure in their relationship? They met once for coffee.... this supposed epic coffee scene, and talked about how neither would back down to the other. Afterward they killed each others' people and both were raging at the other. De Niro's character can't let a grudge sit (at least this is what the plot would have us believe) and kills everyone that betrayed him without mercy the rest of the movie. But Pacino, this man he met once, is different somehow? <br/><br/>If you decide to watch this movie, watch it with much reservation and no expectations."
"jcallows","7","19","36","14 June 2003"," good cop movie but a little long
","This movie was good.  I loved the gun fight scene in Downtown LA and Neil's last confrontation with Waingro.  This must've been my fourth time watching it and I still enjoy watching those two scenes. <br/><br/>However, much of the rest of the movie could've been edited out. I always thought it ran a little long.  Also, I thought the dialogue could've been better.  Am I alone on this?  Everyone seems to praise this movie as one of the best they've seen.  Am I the only one who thinks the sub-plots, especially those involving the characters' personal lives could've been shortened or eliminated altogether?  And that the dialogue was weak, even during that coffee shop scene?  <br/><br/>The pacing was slow and, except for a few scenes, the movie was boring.  The movie was basically a few great scenes strung together by a lot of weak ones.  Despite the movie's flaws, I enjoyed some of the action sequences and the performances of Al Pacino and Robert Dinero.  It's too bad they didn't get a better script.  <br/><br/>In short, this is an over-rated film that ran too long and that has a couple of great actors and some good action scenes.  7/10 stars."
"jameshally","10","5","7","6 April 2018"," Heat: a Michael Mann masterclass of the heist movie genre
","Director Michael delivers one of the best thrillers of the last few decades with Heat. A movie that came out in 1995 and continues to influence every heist movie that has come after it. I have yet to witness a heist movie that even comes close to the greatness of this slick thriller of a movie. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley and Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna are riveting to watch. Val Kilmer's extremely cool Chris shiherlis steals the show in some of the movies greatest action scenes. The city of L.A is also captured beautifully; whether it is a heart-racing gun fight on the streets of L.A or a conversation between two guys in restaurant, the city of angels feels like a character of its own.
Thanks to memorable performances, gorgeous cinematography, insane action sequences and a great plot, Heat is the king of its genre and also one of the greatest movies of all time."
"bob the moo","Null","8","13","13 April 2004"," A great cop thriller with a rich tapestry of characters and subplots topped with two fantastic actors brought together for the first time
","Neil McCauley is a professional crook; he and his crew do very planned and detailed jobs and execute them without error.  Vincent Hanna is a cop who's life revolves around catching criminals with robbery homicide division. One botched job brings these two men into direct confrontation, sparking a cat and mouse game where McCauley's crew wants one last job, regardless of the heat that is being put on them by Hanna.<br/><br/>The fact that this film brings with it one of the most anticipated onscreen pairings in recent memory is only the icing on a cake that stands out as one of the best cop thrillers of the 1990's.  Essentially a remake of the much lesser LA Takedown, Mann delivers a story that is a simple tale of two men on the opposite sides of the law who clash heads over one job - each using the skills they have in their field in an attempt to do what they have to do, but only one can succeed.  However this is layered with such great characters that it is difficult not to be impressed - many films would benefit from even half the characters and subplots that this has.<br/><br/>If they hadn't worked, then these subplots and side characters would have felt unnecessary and really dragged the film down.  It is to the script's credit that this doesn't happen here and what they actually do is strength and enrich the central narrative and easily fills out the running time. The direction is great - visually the film is impressive and it really uses the streets of LA to good effect; I was really taken by how Mann was able to not only manage that side of things but to also to deliver on the characters as well.  It is not without problems though - and some of the subplots are running for some time before we find out what the point of the character is (most notably in Breedan's cook).  Also some of the threads seem unnecessary and distract - the fact that McCauley's betrayer is also a rapist is a side issue, while Lauren's problems are not dealt with that well.<br/><br/>The plot is a solid crime thriller but it is the characters that make it so much better - in particular those of Hanna and McCauley, both of whom are well developed to the point that the audience never sides for one over the other.  The John Woo thread where the two men have admiration for one another is well done but not overdone.<br/><br/>Of course a massive boost to the delivery of this dynamic is the pairing of two actors who, regardless of bad spells, are rightly revered as two of the finest of their generation.  Both are on great form here and it is as good a showcase for them as any other film.  It is impossible to say who is better because both are excellent - hell, even Pacino's OTT woo-ha'ing works here! Both bring so much to their performances, using minor facial expressions to convey so much - just look at De Niro as he drives through the tunnel at the end, we don't need to be told his inner thoughts because De Niro lets us see them.  The plot holds back their first meeting and it is worth waiting for - it doesn't overdo it and it proves that less is more.  They both underplay in a scene that lacks fireworks but is immensely satisfying.<br/><br/>On top of this the support cast are roundly excellent with the material to work with in most cases.  Kilmer is not great normally but is excellent here, as is Sizemore and a nice role for John Voight.  It may be strange to see Haysbert now that he is famous for 24, but he is good here - even if the relevance of his subplot is less than clear until later.  Fitchtner, Williamson, Levine and Noonan are all good but, if the film has a weak link, then it is in the female characters.  The female cast are good on paper but they aren't given their fair share of the material.  Judd stands out because she is given a decent character but Portman, Venora and the beautiful Brenneman are only really required to fit in the best they can.  In fairness this is a minor compliant as such a rich tapestry was always going to have flaws - especially in such a masculine film.<br/><br/>So, yes, this film has the odd weakness - the female roles aren't as strong as the male ones, and some of the subplots require a bit of faith that they will come through, but mostly the film hangs together as one that works superficially, on a basic plot level but also deeper with great characters who have their own lives and are not simply there to say their lines and fill in the background."
"CForeman","1","53","122","9 July 1999"," You MUST be joking.... OVERRATED
","What an awful, awful movie. It is twice as long as it needs to be, for what the actual tired story really is. There are soooo many tangling plot lines that are never tied together, and some are frankly quite interesting. Al Pacino's character has an interesting ""relationship"" with his 3rd wife, and Natalie Portman's character is having severe problems, but she's only in a few scenes and we don't learn what ultimately happens to her.<br/><br/>To invest 3 hours in at least a dozen characters and to come away with nothing.....unreal! Even at such a length there are leaps in the action. And I was quite bored. If I hadn't rented it, I would not have sat through the entire thing. If it were on TV, I would have shut it off after a half-hour.<br/><br/>There's no doubt the cast is first-class, but they are wasted in one of the most overrated, predictable and boring films I've ever seen."
"JustSomeOtherGuy","1","45","102","21 September 2012"," Just bad
","I just don't understand how this movie can be rated this high on this site. It's generally not that off, but this is ridiculous to have this movie in the top 150 of all time. Just.. no.<br/><br/>So let's talk about this movie now. Al Pacino is one of the most overrated actors imho. He did well in The Godfather I&II, and then he lost it. I guess if you would let a barking dog play his role, you could hardly notice the difference. There is no depth to the character, no emotion, no feeling of reality. So that's the good guy.<br/><br/>The bad guy is played by de Niro. He plays it ""de Niro"". Nothing really special. He's played this role many times, and he's gonna play it some more. He was OK.<br/><br/>And now, the plot. I'm sorry, but this plot is plain stupid. Just the fight scene in the middle of the street, where Val Kilmer kills at least two dozen cops while taking cross-fire from both sides is a sad thing. All through the movie I had the impression that this shouldn't be happening, that is completely implausible, and so on. Yes! I enjoy movies like the Expendables where you KNOW that you don't have to take anything very seriously, and you are watching for the big guns and the crappy one-liners, and the completely, utterly ridiculous action scenes. But this is different. This movie tries to be about characters development and all, and the action scenes are totally misplaced to my perception.<br/><br/>Character development. You have more plausible characters in a Walt Disney movie than here. The ending scene where de Niro goes back to the hotel, whereas it is an apparent trap for some girl, betraying his whole personnality, is laughable. Meaning it's just sad. A guy who is supposed to have respected his own rules for his entire life, and who knows this is what got him this far, just acts completely out of character. And this is one of many.<br/><br/>The thing that I really hated about this movie is those moments when I was crying out loud in front of my screen thinking ""This can't be true that this should be happening!""<br/><br/>I don't recommend this to anyone. That line up is very treacherous, don't be fooled."

The movie is an all-time classic, carried out with outstanding performances from industry legends, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. The film exhibits an insight into both sides of the law in an intriguing and appealing manner.
There are some classic moments from the film which you can never forget. The coffee shop scene between Pacino and De Niro (this was the first time these two actors shared screen space besides working in The Godfather 2). The beautifully shot shootout scene between Pacino's squad and De Niro's crew.
Apart from the story and selection of actors for his film, Mann's movies are also known for their deep and satisfying background score. The background score of the film is in sync with every scene of the film in the most suitable fashion. Thanks to Elliot Goldenthal.
I'm a big fan of both Pacino and De Niro. Honestly, if you are looking for a movie with stellar performances and an intense plot, I would suggest you watch the first 20 minutes of the film and I bet you'll be hooked on till the end."

"parkerrodney","10","2","2","24 July 2018"," Heat - On Fire
","With Robert Dinero, Al Pachino, Jon Voight and Val Kilmer headlining this movie, Heat is an intense police crime drama which capitalizes on its great screenplay, acting, production and directing. Many police dramas, particularly those of this era, have well developed story lines which fully engage the viewer in the main plot as well as the lives of the main characters. Although, at its core, Heat is a cops and robbers movie, what makes it special is the intensity of the dysfunctional personal relationships which Pachino, Dinero and Kilmer have with the women in their lives, and the cat and mouse game play between Pachino, the L.A. Police Lieutenant brining the ""heat"" to Dinero and his team of technically proficient and professional bank robbers. 
The movie starts, not with a bank heist, but with the heist of bearer bonds from an armored car which results in the death of three guards raising the stakes of the crime from that of armed robbery to homicide for all parties concerned and putting Pachino on their trail. But less about bank robbing and more about the lives of Dinero and Pachino, one of the movies high drama points is when their cat and mouse game results in their meeting over a cup of coffee in a diner. During this meetin Pachino recounts Dinero's criminal resume and stays in the penitentiary, to which Dinero states that he's, ""not going back."" The two also speak candidly about what they each do in terms of chosen professions and how neither of them lives the regular life of ""barbeques and ball games,"" and healthy relationship, and that this is the life they prefer. During this meeting the men share common perspectives on how they feel about what they do, and what they will have to do, even to each other, if it comes to that point. And we know, this point is coming. This scene demonstrates just how good these actors have perfected their crafts, as they convince the viewer that adversaries can have mutual respect for one another.
Heat follows the same pattern of many movies of this type, where we know how this is going to end - in the game of cops and robbers, the cops always win, and the robbers always make mistakes, errors in judgement and betray each other for any number of reasons. In the law and order aspect of the film there are casualties on both sides. But it is the casualties, drama and betrayal in the personal lives of the characters which keeps us glued to our seats. 
As the movie reaches a climax, we see the wreckage coming. Pachino is in pursuit, even as his wife cheats on him and his step daughter attempts to commit suicide. Kilmer's wife seeks to sell him out to the LAPD, and changes her mind, and Dinero who in the process of escaping with his love interest must make a detour to kill one last person who betrayed him. This unplanned, undisciplined reckless and impulsive act we know will lead to Dinero's undoing, as his execution results in police, fire descending upon his location and him leaving the scene of foot with his love interest watching him take off.
The closing scene is a foot chase between cop and robber as Dinero attempts to get to the airport to make meet his connection and make his getaway. The airport scene is unremarkable, as the chase ends with Pachino shooting Dinero. As Dinero lay dying on the ground, Pachino grabs Dinero's hand as Dinero tells him, ""I told you I'm not going back,"" to which Pachino replies, ""yeah.""
If you like classic crime dramas, without all the special effects, shiny objects, stunts and computer graphics, ""Heat"" is for you. Make no mistake about it. As entertaining as ""Heat"" is it is a film of human tragedy. It is the wreckage of human relationships where women pay a significant price for loving the men that they love. It is hard not to feel a women's pain as it front and center in almost every interaction."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Here we have two of the most outrageous muggers of modern film: Pacino with full HooHaa and DeNiro dragging his biggest grimace.<br/><br/>Obviously, this film was first conceived with the two facing each other at the diner, to be followed by a massive shootout. Give everyone women problems. Fill in the rest with some Mann repeats and heist mechanics. The result is incoherent, simply jelly to stick some episodes together.<br/><br/>
Some of these are tolerable -- any of the scenes with Diane Venora or Jon Voigt. Venora knows how to be outside and inside at the same time. Everything else is TeeVee hash.<br/><br/>That's because Pacino and DeNiro have just given up trying. Their `method' is to find the character in themselves, which is NOT method acting, at least the Brando style. The problem is simply that these two actors are not interesting people, far less interesting than their characters might be.<br/><br/>
Ted's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with your time."
"st-shot","4","22","47","27 November 2009"," Heat is stone cold bad.
","What passes for epic cinema these days can be found in Heat, a noisy, bombastic, self reverential cops and robbers bore that between gun battles drags for most of it's three hour (yes three) running time.<br/><br/>Detective Vin Hanna (Al Pacino) is a standout cop with almost as many bad marriages as commendations. Neil MacCauley (Robert DiNero) is a career criminal always bent on the big score. Both men are very methodical and take great pride in their professionalism. After botching a brinks job Hanna pursues the gang which is beginning to fray at the edges. Mac Cauley realizes it's tough to get good help these days and decides on one last score before calling it quits.<br/><br/>Showcasing the biggest meeting since Truman met Stalin at Potsdam director Michael Mann treats the first meeting of Pacino and DiNero together (both were in Godfather 2 but appeared in no scenes together) with the same solemnity as the two actors wheeze through their moment. With nothing new or revelatory to say, they show manly respect and understanding for each other. The problem is the scene is more about these closely identified highly regarded actors than the characters they play. Their star wattage (as well as their skills) may have dimmed by 95 but their legendary status carried a lot of weight. It's about as interesting as two old codgers reminiscing on an old folks home porch and rings hollow like the rest of this lumbering elephant of a film.<br/><br/>The convoluted plot is filled with forgettable characters but it does allow Mann to wander around LA spreading gratuitous violence. The women in the film are relegated to looking tired and concerned over their boy friends, acting as sounding boards for the guys to spew their Mannly philosophy about honor and being true to your skills.<br/><br/>The action scenes are big, loud, bloody, poorly edited and ridiculous as LA empties out to let the boys shoot it out in grand fashion on the streets. The badly paced montage of Al and Bobby dashing up and down the avenues with some very big weapons (size is everything to Mann)playing cops and robbers runs out of steam before they run out of bullets.<br/><br/>By the time they made Heat Pacino and DiNero had peaked before doing self parody (though Pacino would go on to give a stellar performance worthy of his early years as Roy Cohn in Angels in America) and it shows in their lackluster tired performances magnified even further by the film stealing effort turned in by Val Kilmer as gang member Chris. Kilmer's energy and the self confident way he moves and acts delivers the passion the two stars lack.<br/><br/>As in some of his other films Mann explores the theme of moral relativism with usual heavy handed pretension attempting to bestow nobility on the good as well as the bad, solemnizing the whole ponderous affair with Elliot Goldenthal's vapid score that is more appropriate for a coronation than a shoot'em up.<br/><br/>In Heat MacCauley states ""Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out of in thirty seconds flat"". One should keep this in mind before watching this big helium balloon of hot air."
"pseelenbacher","10","12","23","13 February 2006"," Vincent Hanna cocaine user
","When this movie was originally shot there were scenes where Det. Hanna (Pacino) was doing cocaine. When he was outside the club about to go in to meet Tone Loc (Albert's brother) the bouncer outside gives him a vial, on the house, and he takes a snort of if as he goes in. There are several times throughout the movie were it seems like Pacino is over acting. This is because he was supposed to be wired. However, Mann decided the movie was intense enough without this story line and cut all of the scenes out. I spoke with someone who went to a program where Michael Mann spoke about movie making and mentioned this. Also, if you get a hold of some of the early drafts of the screenplay you can read these scenes in them."

","9.6<br/><br/>Has there ever been a moment in your life where you found yourself battling hesitation, or having to make a difficult choice? If so, and that decision was ever to see the movie Heat or not, let me take the burden off your shoulders. Watch this movie.<br/><br/>Coming into this, I wasn't expecting much. I figured, sure, a crime movie. Great cast... Michael Mann behind the camera. It has to be pretty good. At least everyone says it is. It's better than that. This is one of those films where I have to erase everything that I knew or thought I knew about it per what everyone else told me, or according to the general opinion about it. Then I have to watch the movie myself, and let every single scene soak in. <br/><br/>Heat is essentially a cops and robbers story. You experience the story from both points of views. You see the families of both sides. The good, and the hard times. The initiatives, incentives, and personalities behind both lifestyles. Then it melts them both together. You think, ""yeah, these men are performing horrible acts, and overall bad choices"", but you start to care about them as human beings. You want the good guys to win, but at the same time you don't want to see the others fail. There's one scene in particular which brings both worlds together. It's as if the cop and the robber went out for a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say much about the acting. After all, these are men who act, and don't talk much. ""Stop talking, okay, Slick"", a robber tells another in the beginning of the film. They get things done and don't really show much emotion while on the job. Al Pacino seasons the detective's role with the salt that he usually brings to the table. Mostly though, what you have here is a story with down to earth characters and down to earth performances.<br/><br/>The directing is phenomenal. Michael Mann and crew manage to bring tension to the right scenes, adrenaline where its needed, and just about every other emotion the film brings out at just the right time. The movie slows down and speeds up exactly when it needs to. The use of ambient sound and music is great here. Sometimes I couldn't determine what was an effect, what was music and what was ambiance. There are some shots that are close ups of peoples faces and the emotions on them that are of my favorite scenes in the movie. The movie goes from low-key conversations to high speed shootouts. Tactful scrutiny to emotional outbursts. And never misses a beat.<br/><br/>This movie, or maybe I should say film, gives you everything that you'd expect from a crime movie, yet offers so much more. It doesn't glorify crime or the background processes of it. It unveils the people behind it instead, and makes you think about what type of people do these things. They are not good people, that's for sure. But you can't help but think that their skills could have been put to better use. Maybe as detectives, the other side of the crime. Still, you're just going to have to forget about everything that I just said, as well as forget about what you've heard about this movie, and go watch it for yourself. It stands apart from the rest."
"anonymousmoose-1","10","8","14","14 February 2009"," My personal favorite movie of all time
","I have to say this is my favourite movie of all time. The acting is superb and the cast is great. De Nero and Pacino were great going face to face. It didn't seam like a De Nero and Pacino were chosen purely for getting butts on theatre seats like a recent movie I watched (cant remember the title and it was bad). Both main actors played their roles superbly.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was also excellent. I never really care about actors names so I wont go into details. Yet De Nero's crew were great as well as Pacino's force colleges.<br/><br/>The thing that I like the most about this movie is the fact its got a bit of everything. Action, drama, romance etc. It doesn't just focus on the main plot yet also explores the characters enough and gives ample time to get connected with them. You see their personal lives, their dreams, dedication to what they do etc.<br/><br/>I guess a lot of people thought the movie was too long yet I wouldn't have minded if it were another hour. Every part was necessary IMO to get the viewer involved and get them to feel what the characters are feeling the best they could. You just don't get movies like this any more. Quick action and straight to the point seams to be today's theatre. I guess I enjoy stretched out movies due to the old westerns I watches growing up. The ones where you'd watch 3 henchmen at a train station for 10 minutes before anything happened.<br/><br/>Heat is one of them movies I wished just kept going... I personally would have liked to have seen De Nero get away at the end to leave it open for a sequel. Yet I believe the ending was for the best as sequels usually screw a movie over (except the Godfather, Rocky until IV).<br/><br/>The dialogue was great. I loved the way Pacinos character interacted with people. The no bullshit approach, anything to get the job done.<br/><br/>I just didn't really like the fact that the Waingro character got away at the beginning. Surely De Neros crew would have been professional enough not to let him escape, even when being distracted by the cop car.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also suburb. I used to be a Moby fan and I like the way the movie integrated at least two of his less popular tracks.<br/><br/>Lastly I enjoyed the side stories, particularly the one where the crew go after Van Zant.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I love this movie. Every year at least one I sit down with a nice meal, some fine alcoholic beverage and enjoy. Now that I'm married I'll probably need to do it on a day my wife isn't home so I can enjoy uninterrupted.<br/><br/>I'll have to see if this movie is available on Blue-Ray when I purchase a PS3. I just had a look at the soundtrack price on ebay AU whist typing this and it still averages $20"

","Acted to perfection, rich in character traits, taut direction,... these words simply never can do this film justice.<br/><br/>What began as a simple tale of cops and robbers suddenly develops into insightful and poignant characterization, the boundaries between good and evil, and facing up to one's demons. Yes, not only did this film deliver by the thrills, it gave us, the audience, an in depth look at the lives of two equal men who work on opposite sides of the law, and how their routines affect them, in the city of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>First off, I would like to say that the acting in this movie is extremely well. You really emphasize with the characters and, for some, fell a sort of sympathy towards them. Kudos to Pacino and De Niro for playing the dedicated detective and disciplined thief, respectively. Both these men are exceptionally excellent actors and in this film, their acting is done to perfection. Without them, the film is nothing. Notable performances in the film: Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, and of course the lovely Ashley Judd.<br/><br/>For the cinematography, I must say that Dante Spinotti has done a tremendous job with the scenery. The city of LA has never looked this wide or gritty until this film. The nighttime scenes and the helicopter flybys of the film are stunning to watch, as it majestically captures a sparkling portrait of Los Angeles set against an urban world.<br/><br/>To accompany the cinematography, the music by Elliot Goldenthal is unforgettable. Especially the arrangements with the Kronos Quartet. It really adds to the entire atmosphere and theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Kudos to director/writer Michael Mann. The direction is taut (as mentioned earlier) and whip-smart, the story fantastically evolving and original, and the screenplay is well-written. The action scenes were extremely well-handled, and is kinetic and heart pounding, and best - and most important of all, realistic. This is what makes it stand out from the rest of the other crime films - they tend to put in moments of Deux Ex Machina, such as the police knowing every trick up the crooks' sleeve - but not this film. It's good, because Mann is dedicated to show both sides of the cop vs. criminal story, and he succeeds with masterful results. From this film and Collateral, I can tell he is a skilled and dedicated filmmaker when it comes to crime thrillers. By the time the film ends you won't even know three hours have passed.<br/><br/>In short, this film is nothing short of a masterpiece. It will stand the test of time for many, many years to come. If you manage to see it in a store, or while channel-surfing, do yourselves a favor and watch it. If you consider a fan of Pacino and/or De Niro, watch it.

","Heat is far more than just a standard 'cops and robbers' drama. For a movie like that, see Michael Bay's movies. Lifeless, full of one-liners, standard. From the mold. And that's everything Michael Mann doesn't do.<br/><br/>Unbelievably shot in L.A (using not one sound stage), Heat shows exactly what life in L.A looks like. The tinted blue, the dark, but beautiful nights of L.A. Michael Mann created one of the most perfect visual masterpieces I've ever seen.<br/><br/>However, it isn't only the incredible look to the film, but the story and the all-star cast. There are no slackers here, not when you unite two of the best actors in cinematic history. Al Pacino is over-the-top, incredible, and in one of his finest roles to date. Robert de Niro is at his finest, playing the cool, quiet and lonely Neil. Both create some incredible scenes, both eerie and powerful. Even Val Kilmer doesn't look out of place here, and holds his own with the two screen giants.<br/><br/>The script was perfect, layered with thousands of intricate details. At almost three hours, the movie is lengthy, however I would have wanted more. The amount of character development in this film is unprecedented, with Mann carefully showing the viewer exactly how the person would be in real life.<br/><br/>Heat is by far leagues ahead of any other cops vs. robbers movie made to date. Why? Because it doesn't get stuck in that mind frame. Instead, Mann sculpts the stories of many different people's lives, all unified by their drive to get what they want. Mann did a stand-out job, and this film definitely deserves a solid 11/10."

","The thing to strike me about HEAT is that it`s overlong . I don`t know if I`ve been watching too much MTV but a major problem I`ve had with a great number of movies coming out of Hollywood studios since the early 1990s is that they`re too long for their own good and I wish to add HEAT to this list since its running time is taken up with too many unnecessary scenes . If these scenes had been ditched at script stage not only would we have had a shorter film we`d have had a far better one . Take the scene in the coffee bar where the gang have just carried out the initial heist and Neil teaches Waingro a lesson  by banging his head off the table . Seeing as they`re shown throghout the story to be well organised , professional villains why would Neil draw attention to themselves by assaulting Waingro in this way ? It`s a scene that lacks any credibility and should not have been included . There`s another problem with too many domestic scenes , the film tries to show the audience the marital marital/romantic life of every major character , cop and robber . I know Michael Mann`s later movie THE INSIDER is also full of scenes involving home life but that`s necessary to the plot and characterisation . Here it is not <br/><br/>HEAT isn`t by any means a bad film , on the contaray it`s a good one . DeNiro and Pacino in the same movie , boy what a casting coup . Not only that we get to see Val Kilmer when he was famous plus up and coming names like Portman , Sizemore and Fichtner , and once the story gets going it is very compelling with a breath taking shootout . Unfortunately because someone ( I`m guessing Michael Mann deserves all the blame for this ) thought they`d stretch out a two hour movie into a three hour one HEAT remains good instead of great"

","HEAT has, of course, a terrific cast, but this sprawling, rambling, overlong, ultimately anticlimactic film is marred throughout by one of the more irritating clichés of cop dramas: the boring domestic scene in which the wife (or girlfriend) of the cop (or criminal) complains about how unfulfilled she is, the uncertainty of their relationship, how little she sees him, blah blah blah. In this one, it's hard-faced Diane Venora whining about how cop Al Pacino isn't THERE for her and her daughter (Natalie Portman), how she gets only part of his life, etc. Haven't we suffered through this boring situation in a hundred cop pictures? Then there are the uninteresting marital problems criminal Val Kilmer is having with Ashley Judd; who cares? Finally, there's the loony, preposterous, extraneous, wholly unbelievable relationship Robert De Niro has with Amy Brenneman, who plays a lovestruck artist/shopgirl who takes one look at De Niro, begins flirting with him, and is soon taking him to bed. Yeah, right: Here's a beautiful, glamorous-looking young woman who throws herself at a middle-aged, mean-and-careworn-and-greasy-looking guy who initially pretends to be a salesman and carries on a halting conversation worthy of a dullard. The relationship has no bearing on the plot that I could see; it's just an impediment and an annoyance. Thank God for the fast-forward on my remote."

Inolved in a number of high profile robberies Neil has become a bit soft in his life long career in crime. Neil is planing to pull off just one more multi-million dollar bank robbery and then call it quits and retire.<br/><br/>Let.Hanna on McCauley's tail want's to prevent him from pulling off his grand slam bank holdup but is always stymied as McCauley is one step ahead of him. Even though after the first armor car robbery, that resulted in the three armor car guards getting shot to death by McCauley & Co., all McCauley and his gang did was do each other in. As well as being, or trying to be, double-crossed by big time mob money launderer Roger Van Zant,William Fichtner, who's over one million dollars in untraceable Bearer Bonds the McCauley gang took in the armor car robbery and attempted to sell back to him at .60 on the dollar. This after Van Zant got back all the money that he lost in stolen bonds back which were covered by his insurance company.<br/><br/>Were then bombarded with both McCauleys and Hannas personal life that goes on for almost an hour like a day time TV soap opera and really has very little to to with the movie's basic theme about crime and punishment in the streets and airport of L.A. All that confuses and bores you to the point that your almost put to sleep watching it.<br/><br/>Who cares about Hanna's relationship with his old lady Justine, Diane Venora, and who she sleeps with! Even Let. Hanna doesn't seem too concerned he's only angry that Justine's lover Ralph, Xander Berkeley, has the nerve to watch his TV set and couldn't care less if he slept with Justine or not. Det. Hanna's step-daughter Lauren, Natelie Portman, is so upset over his and her moms bickering that she attempts to kill herself. Lauren does this by slashing her wrists and then trying to drown herself in her step-fathers apartments bathtub.<br/><br/>McCauley also gets involved with this young graphic designer Eady, Amy Brenneman, but it's so out of character for him that it leads to his ultimate demise at the end of the movie. McCauley juggling between Eady's going along with him, to heaven knows where, in his attempted escape from being captured by the police at the L.A Airport and then going out of his way to murder Wangro, Kevin Gage, at the airport hotel that's crawling with L.A policemen. Wangro who was involved in the opening scene armor car robbery was later kicked out of McCauly's gang, and almost killed by him. Yet how did Wangro somehow seems to have gotten a hold of McCauley's later plans to rob a midtown L.A bank? it's never explained what and how Wangro knew about the impending bank robbery since he was totally out of the loop when it was planned and later executed! And what exactly had Wangro's later involvement with the Van Zant mob have to do with him informing on McCauley's plans to the police?<br/><br/>There's also Jon Voight as this big mob honcho Nat who looks like General Custer at the Little Big Horn. Voight pops up every now and then in the movie, giving McCauley advice that's always on target, but who's part in the film is never really explained by the script writers. As well as not clarifying the story behind the Shiherlis' Chris & Charlene, Val Kilmer & Ashley Judd. The wacky couples zany and bizarre relationship soon threatens to screw up all of McCauley's plans for his last big score. <br/><br/>Chris gets badly shot up in the L.A bank robbery and looks like he's about to die from his wounds but then what seems like only hours later he shows up, with a new haircut, totally recovered! Chris also comes up with a new identity that was so convincing that even Let. Hanna and the LAPD had to let him go free! This after he was involved in the deaths of at least a dozen innocent people and L.A policemen that afternoon!<br/><br/>We earlier saw Charlene give Chris some kind of hand signal as the L.A police were about to pinch him, in a sting they set up for him. But all Chris did was turn around in his car and drive out of sight and like magic he was immune from prosecution?<br/><br/>The movies ridicules ending was about as exciting as a game of chess. Both Let. Hanna and his rival and adversary in the movie Neil McCauley are seen running for what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon all around L.A Airport and it's surroundings. This was all done I suspect so those of us, still awake and waiting to see the big showdown between the two, could finally switch the channel and get back to watching something that makes more sense and is far more interesting; like the Saturday Morning Cartoons."

","I was recommended to watch this movie. Now I wonder whether this even is a movie. Is it an insane fantasy? Is it a collection of clichés; the thoughtful gangster and the cool police chef - not to forget all the beautiful women who share the role of the loving wife and girlfriend? Who are the characters that are introduced and suddenly disappear again? Why are we presented with the entire background of the cook/driver who dies within one minute? What is up with the daughter, that tries to kill herself, for no reason whatsoever? Michael Mann has no idea how to create sympathy for his characters, nor does he know how to convey emotions or give insight to the human psyche. The plot is yet endurable, compared to the filmic devices. The cuts are dreadful, unnecessary scenes are emphasized,important scene miss completely, the setting lacks design (Mr.Mann simply wanted to film L.A at night), the dialogue is grotesque and superficial - and does the role of Pacino have a dangerously high blood pressure or why is he permanently swearing and shouting like a prolet? The characters lack depth, especially their relationships are cliché-like and absolutely hollow. Cinematically, the film has no structure, it is a slap in the face. <br/><br/>I recommend you to not watch this film, unless you want to have a good laugh with your friends."

","More than simply a cops-and-robbers story, ""Heat"" allows us to understand the characters more than the average crime story. In the first place, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) are good friends before they realize that they have to be enemies. And even when it becomes clear to them that they're on opposite sides of the law, the viewer still can sympathize with both men: we understand that McCauley doesn't want to be a criminal but has no choice, and we understand that Hanna finds law enforcement unpleasant but is trapped in his position. Never going overboard on violence or degenerating into silliness, ""Heat"" is a modern classic and a triumph for all involved. It was, in my opinion, director Michael Mann's best movie ever, and a very interesting look at Los Angeles. This is one movie that won't disappoint you."

It started off with some promise but degenerated into an overlong soap opera. At no point did I ever give a monkeys about Pacino's marital problems nor whether DeNiro or Kilmer sorted it out with their women. <br/><br/>That don't mean I like the bang-bang you're dead type police films, I like some character insight but the amount of dialogue in this was ridiculous. The script must have looked like War & Peace. The scene with Pacino & DeNiro in the restaurant summed that up. I knew as I watched it everyone would rave over it, but I still can't watch that scene, even on it's own, without my concentration waining half way through. It seemed as if the director wanted to get as many 'cool' quotes in as he could & sacrificed the tension level because of it. Thus, when the plot did get complex from time to time, with the extra characters, it really required 110% concentration at all times.<br/><br/>John Voight mumbled too much, Pacino shouted too much, almost Ric Flair-esque at some points, each character much have had tracking devices on each other the amount of times they bumped into each other, some of the least adept Police were on duty, there seemed far too many anonymous or convenient tip-offs and lots more was left unresolved after the end.<br/><br/>Over half an hour & some of the subplots could have been chopped from this film.

So much of what we see the crooks do just doesn't happen in real life, and this is a movie that seems to be pushing ""gritty realism,"" as opposed to, say, an Arnold Schwarzenegger flick.

"jason_parallel","3","13","31","27 August 2006"," One of the most overrated movies in cinema history!
","First off, I'll come right out and say that I've only ever seen two of Michael Mann's other movies: Collateral and The Last Of The Mohicans, both of which were entertaining but did not impress me overall. I'm no expert on his work, but he seems to have a knack for taking fairly talented actors and turning them into one-dimensional versions of themselves on screen.<br/><br/>Heat is a perfect example of that talent. We have a huge cast of famous actors, each one morphed into a character that ultimately offers no kind of sympathy with the viewer (at least this viewer). Mann tries so hard to give his characters some kind of emotional value that the actors end up looking like cardboard cutouts of every other role they have played in their illustrious careers.<br/><br/>Why does the director feel the need to delve into the lives of EACH AND EVERY CHARACTER in this flick? He easily added at least 45 minutes of time to a movie that is essentially of the action/crime genre, where character development is not necessarily as important as it would be in a romance or drama. Come on, dwelling on the fact that Natalie Portman's character had some parental issues, or that a minor player in the plot may in fact be a serial killer, or the fact that the getaway driver's wife is distraught over his death, is gratuitous at best. It only adds length to a film that already way too long to make it worth sitting through.<br/><br/>Which comes to my next gripe- this is the first crime movie I have EVER watched where I felt the need to fast-forward through certain scenes that I felt were dragged out too much, which was about 1/3 of the flick. It's really too bad, because Heat certainly had it's moments: the café scene between De Niro and Pacino was outstanding, as were the shoot-out and the final chase scene. If only Mann had concentrated on giving the rest of the movie the same level of intensity, I could have possibly found Heat to be one of my favorites of all time. The director should stick to what he knows best- action. Although I suppose you can't expect too much from the guy who helmed Miami Vice, one of the cheesiest t.v. shows ever made.<br/><br/>Mann should have looked at some other action/crime flicks, such as True Romance or Leon: The Professional to see how character development should really be done- colorful, well-balanced, and efficient. Although he did verify what I have always though about Robert De Niro; if you can make millions of dollars a movie just by hanging around on screen with your mouth open like a kid just off the short bus, then I guess there's hope for everybody to make a career out of acting.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 stars just for the good parts, 1 out of 10 stars for making me wish I had been doing something else for the 172 minutes it took me to finish this yawn-inducer."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","4","8","17","8 August 2013"," Should have been called Baggage rather than Heat
","An old piece of advice given to writers is ""simplify"". It is a pity such advice was not followed here, since the proliferation of subplots and other baggage (much of it irrelevant) make this film too unwieldy and long-winded for its own good.<br/><br/>The build up to the much anticipated meeting between Pacino (Hanna) and De Niro (McCauley) sums up the film.. First Hanna is pointlessly seen in a helicopter before he is set down to follow McCauley in a car. Then Hanna has McCauley pull pver, McCauley is seen preparing to use his gun, Hanna gets out of his car, his own gun in hand, he steps up to McCauley's car and says ""let's do coffee!""<br/><br/>This was clearly meant to to an epic build up to an epic scene, but its effect is bathetic (and even pathetic).Even the meeting scene itself is mediocre, loosely written and rambling, like the film. Would there be anything notable about it if it were not Pacino and De Niro involved?<br/><br/>The main plot is the hoary ""heist goes wrong"", but one of the criminal gang, Waingro, turns out to be a serial killer. He murders a prostitute in an unnecessary series of scenes, irrelevant to the main story arc since Waingro only gets his comeuppance (and not because of his serial killing) when he joins up with Van Zant (part of another sub-plot that I won't go into, although more integrated into the story).<br/><br/>Most of the baggage here is of the emotional kind. Just about everyone has overwrought emotional scenes with their loved ones including the briefly seen black getaway driver (formerly working as a chef...the scenes of him before he makes his brief appearance as the driver had me scratching my head) and even the murdered prostitute has emotive shots of her family. Such scenes as this distract from the main narrative but there are even more anguished relationship scenes concerning the main protagonists.<br/><br/>Neil McCauley (De Niro) has vowed to leave his woman at a drop of hat, but has apparently found 'true love'. Shiherlis (Kilmer) is a drunk gambler whose wife is leaving him until De Niro Godfather-like instructs her to stay. She has a lover who is blackmailed by the police into bringing her to them. Hanna (Pacino) has both wife and daughter problems. His wife is sleeping around while his daughter is suicidal.<br/><br/>If all this sounds confusing, I can assure you there is much more and the film takes us down every one of these blind alleys one at a time.<br/><br/>Despite the film lingering so lovingly on irrelevancies, important issues remain unresolved. Why, for instance, at the end does Hanna (the cop) take a fire arm from another policeman but not tell him to help him catch McCauley? This sets up an implausible and not very good, one on one shoot out and the unconvincing 'brothers in arms' handshake between the two as if Hanna had forgotten all those that McCauley (including cops) has murdered in cold blood.<br/><br/>Likewise the relationships are left hanging at the end. What happens to Shiherlis and indeed his wife? Do they sail off into the sunset together? Not likely considering she is sleeping with someone else. And what about Hanna, his wife and their daughter? Nothing is resolved.<br/><br/>The general look of the film is good but some shots are chosen more for their 'coolness' than their purpose. The action scenes are gory, perhaps unnecessarily so. The shoot-out, using sub machine guns, is overblown and unconvincing, and very Hollywoodian, including Hanna's ""threading the eye of a needle"" shot to kill one of the gang holding a child hostage. <br/><br/>A note on performances. They tend to be rather overwrought at all times, with the cast being aware they are in an 'important' picture. Mumbling and histrionics are the order of the day. Pacino, in particular, delivers an over-the-top performance, often shouting his lines in a psychotic way that genuinely seems to surprise his fellow actors. If this was how Hanna was in real life, he would probably be under heavy sedation or psychiatric care.<br/><br/>There is just about enough good stuff amid the padding to make this watchable. But only just."

Apart from a fabulous street shoot out between the goodies and the baddies, which is so realistic you will think you are actually there, there is absolutely nothing to this film. It is slow, verrrry boring and apart from THAT scene has no action in it what so ever. The script is lost in the hype as the clock ticks on very slowly indeed and as for the scene where nemesis's De Niro and Pacino discuss their intentions 'over coffee' I just have to say eh????, what's that all about???.

","As a fan of Al Pacino's ""later years"" works, this seemed to be a gaping hole in my viewing of his films. When the film concluded after nearly three hours, however, I was left feeling severely disappointed by a whole slew of things in ""Heat"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Heat"" sees Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) square off against notorious big-time criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). As a sort of cat-and-mouse game emerges between those two leads, a secondary plot line focuses on one of De Niro's henchman (played by Val Kilmer).<br/><br/>The #1 problem with this movie is simply that the story isn't anything to write home about. In fact, it is actually a sub-par plot that contains very little emotion or meaningful character development. It is a slow-moving, hard-boiled cop drama...but without any of the usual themes that make those types of movies watchable.<br/><br/>Also, what really puts the nail in the coffin is that the acting (what should be the flick's strong suit) is also poor. I never thought Pacino could possible over-act a role, but he does here, while De Niro is pretty much just stoic throughout. I know those two can do much better, but this was just not a great vehicle for them to shine.<br/><br/>I even considered giving ""Heat"" the dreaded one-star rating, but it isn't quite bad enough for that. There is one captivating scene involving Pacino/De Niro, and the plot is more recycled/dull than outright horrible.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Heat"" is nowhere near the ""epic cop drama"" it is billed as. I would say go out a get ""Righteous Kill"" if you want to see a better Pacino/De Niro pairing. While that movie is only average in its own right, it still surpasses this bloated marathon."

","In my opinion, Michael Mann's best work. The amount of planning that went into this film is unbelievable: including the weapons training, the character development, and the casting. The atmosphere between De Niro and Pacino is electrifying, right down to the final scene. There is a real restaurant in Los Angeles where one day of the week police detectives sit down and eat together, and on a separate night, known ex-criminals have dinner in the same room. Michael Mann placed his actors(police with detectives, and bank heist crew with mobsters) in the same room to listen to their stories, to get a feel for their role, for their character. It is this type of preparation that makes Heat one of my most cherished films. I would highly recommend viewing the special features disc because of stories like these that further explain the expert craftsmanship of Heat."
"El Cine","Null","6","12","26 November 2001"," Like Albert the informant, this movie ""wasted my m------------g time"" (Okay, not quite)
","The praises bestowed on this film by critics and IMDb users and the pious references to the leads' ""conversation over coffee"" scene is a sign of the powerful grip that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino hold on the attention and minds of movie-goers, and the places in pop culture that they have grabbed a hold of. But after seeing all of those dreamy-eyed comment titles in the index for this movie, I just thought I'd bring to mind a few reasons why this film is by no means as good as they come.<br/><br/>**spoilers**<br/><br/>The cop-and-crook chase ending is a ""cop-out"" ~~ Yawn. A shootout is really just an arbitrary way to end the story. So McCauley got shot and killed. Whatever. What if Hanna had been the one to get hit? Instead of a moving scene that has a relevant connection to the plot as a whole, the viewer is given a trite shootout that only seems concerned with upholding the film tradition of ""Good Guy outfights Bad Guy so the movie can end"". It even features Hanna failing to call for backup on his cellular phone so Pacino can look even more heroic, and afterwards it shows De Niro slowly slumping to the ground as he expires. This does nothing dramatically.<br/><br/>Implausibility ~~ The writers seem to have been so preoccupied with conveying an ""epic"" sensation that they didn't polish up on the little (and not so little) details that detract from a movie if left unpolished. Some of them have already been discussed by other commenters. But ""Heat"" has plenty more to bother you.<br/><br/>So Van Zant has not only failed to rub out McCauley, but has received vengeful death threats from him over the phone, too. Does he grab his riches and some bodyguards and hide out somewhere? No, he just sits in his mansion (with no security system, apparently) all alone in his bathrobe and watches the hockey game on TV, almost waiting for McCauley to waltz in, kill him, and walk away unharmed.<br/><br/>Then we are supposed to believe that the cautious, carefully-planning McCauley would give up his chance to make a clean getaway just to extract some revenge from Waingrow, who has inexplicably gone from staying in cheap motels to renting luxury hotel suites. Let's ignore for a minute the fact that this public enemy could actually stroll into a big hotel, through the kitchens and laundry rooms, and through the lobby without being stopped and recognized, not even as an outsider in an employees-only area. He actually pulls the fire alarm for a distraction while he carries out his execution. Surely even he would have expected traffic jams, stampedes, firetrucks, and cops 'a plenty to arrive, making a quiet exit impossible.<br/><br/>Poor sense of scene ~~ The director is too caught up in extreme close-ups to let the viewer breath and get a feel for the settings. The result: claustrophobia and tedium. With all those big mugs filling up the screen, I would have been overwhelmed if I had seen this in the theater.<br/><br/>Histrionics ~~ I've accepted Pacino in some of his other films, but his raise-my-voice tough guy routine is tired here. It doesn't help that he has to shout moronic lines like ""Women's ***!!!!"" complete with hand gestures. Of course, this fits in with the absurdity of the dialogue overall. The film is another example of actors awkwardly reciting heavy, moralistic paragraphs, instead of characters behaving normally. We even get slow zoom-ins on the actors' faces so we can be told when the Important and Moving Drama is taking place. ""You don't live with me, you live among the remnants of dead people. You sift through the detritus, you read the terrain, you search for signs of passing, for the scent of your prey ... and then you hunt them down."" Um, I thought the filmmakers were aiming for ""realism"", not melodrama. And since when has anyone ever used the word ""detritus"" in a conversational sentence?<br/><br/>Add to all that a flat pseudo-classical/rock soundtrack and considerable length.and you wind up with a pretentious, unimpressive, undistinguished movie with a couple of big names on the poster."
"SilentJerry","1","23","64","1 January 2003"," Warning: This movie will be about an hour too long.
","While this isn't a horrible film; it doesn't belong in the top 250. First of all: it's long. Way to long. It felt like I was actually sitting there for three hours. Good movies will draw you in and let you forget about time during the running length. This movie wasn't good enough to do that. Did they really need all those scenes about Hanna's home life and poor marriage? No. Likewise, was all the screen time with McCauley and his girlfriend necessary? No. It felt like typical movie relationships. The entire movie spent way to much time developing each character and quite frankly it didn't need to.<br/><br/>However, there are a lot of great scenes. Including the bank robbery, the shoot-out afterwards, the heist at the beginning of the movie, the diner scene between Hanna and McCauley, and the shoot-out at the drive-in. The acting is top notch. DeNiro and Pacino are great leads. They both portray their characters wonderfully. The rest of the cast was great too. Plus any movie with Danny Trejo is worth seeing.<br/><br/>So if not for the overlong running length, I highly recommend seeing it. If you want to see a fast pace heist movie; I'd recommend Heist with Hackman and DeVito. Heist was able to cut the fat and make a great movie. This movie just keeps going and going and going until it finally reaches the end."

","They don't make films like ""Heat"" anymore. A multi-layered crime yarn filled with fascinating characters against a noirish Los Angeles cityscape. Truly the stuff of great cinema. What's so refreshing here is that even though this is a tale of cops and robbers, both sides aren't exactly typical hero or villain. We see the cracks and the downfalls of both, but we also see their honor, loyalty, and commitment to the job regardless of the risks or consequences. Director Michael Mann stages each scene with meticulous and razor sharp edge, and the second act shoot out is among one of the greatest action scenes in film history. Leads Pacino and DeNiro both deliver career-defining performances, adding so much nuance and depth to their respective characters. Great supporting performances from Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Danny Trejo, and Amy Brennaman also add to the mix.

"Dr_Nick","10","4","7","4 July 2000"," A Los Angeles Crime Saga - Of epic proportions
","Heat is an example of what can be done with a very worn genre, namely ""cops and robbers"", when at the hands of a master director, in this case Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Mann has taken what is ultimately a simple premise, a bank robbery, and made it into a saga.<br/><br/>Heat is the story of a tight crew of well trained crooks who execute highly organized scores, led by Neil McCauley (DeNiro). When one of these robberies does not go entirely to plan the LAPD Robbery-Homicide squad begins to investigate, headed by Vincent Hanna (Pacino). Neil's crew initially unaware of the LAPD surveillance plans two more scores, one of which is an incredibly daring daylight bank robbery.<br/><br/>The action scenes are comparatively few when compared to other movies of this genre however when there is action it is executed as realistically as possible. Definitely no ""John Woo"" style action here. The gun fight in the street is one of the most realistic depictions of a gun battle ever portrayed on the big screen.<br/><br/>The character development is fairly in-depth for the number of characters in the film. By far one of my favorite scenes is the coffee shop when our two main characters meet face to face for the first time and compare their lives, which are not all that dissimilar. I did not fully understand the ""Waingro serial killer"" sub plot, perhaps it was to give a little background as to the type of person Waingro was. We also get to see that the characters in the film are ""real"" by showing us their life ""behind the scenes"" so to speak - not just when they are working.<br/><br/>Mann must have done a great deal of research into this movie. Many aspects of the film are very realistic. The characters of both police and the criminals, the police procedures, the use of informants, the execution of the action scenes, the weapons used - all very accurate (or as accurate as it gets in Hollywood).<br/><br/>The soundtrack for Heat by itself is brilliant. The soundtrack is collaboration of several artists all of which contribute towards a very powerful score. When combined with the movie it enhances the mood incredibly. Tracks of note would be the opening titles ""Heat performed by the Kronos Quartet, Moby's closing titles ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" and his rendition of ""New Dawn Fades.""<br/><br/>The cinematography is also outstanding. Mann did not use any soundstages - the whole film was filmed on location in and around LA. This is apparent with some of the moody lighting created in the dawn and dusk scenes with the smooth, deep blue lighting.<br/><br/>All in all Heat is a very powerful film that delivers on all levels. Action, love, betrayal, romance, tragedy, suspense - Heat has it all."
"jonr67","1","23","65","22 September 2004"," Several problems...
","Spoiler Alert Okay, I am baffled at the amount of the people who are in awe of this film. I, personally, think it's a decent film. That's me... not you. You probably love it (or hate it).. whatever. But, I don't care for it. And here's why:<br/><br/>1. When a film is complete fiction and based off of pure bull$hit, like Heat, then I expect an ending that correlates. For example, when I watch a documentary, I don't expect a happy ending, because I expect a documentary to be about a serious topic. When I watch The Godfather, I don't expect a happy ending, because The Godfather is supposed to be serious and in some ways realistic. But with Heat, the writer makes up a bunch of unbelievable crap and then ends the movie pretending to be serious. It's like the writer threw a bunch of bull$hit at you, then was like, ""okay, time to take the film seriously!"" Here's what I mean: There are several really unbelievable Hollywoodish things that happen. First, a big cop/criminal fight takes place that kills off a whole squad of police. Second, police work is back to normal the next day. Third, DeNiro's character and his buddy who *somehow* manages to survive an entire fleet of L.A.P.D officers (and slaughter them all) get away! Okay, that coooould happen... in a blue moon. But, further, somehow this DeNiro character decides to stick around town to finish old business - right - so these are professional criminals (""the Best!"" right?) and they decide to stick around town and settle old business? Yeah right. In reality, those guys would take their money and run if they were ""professionals."" Fourth, somehow by some odd chance in a million, Pacino's character stumbles in a random hotel room with his stepdaughter... okay, I guess it's just his lucky week. Fifth, after DeNiro's character finishes off that psycho killer guy in his hotel room, he walks outside the room and shuts the door at which point an L.A.P.D officer holds a gun to his head and admonishes him to place his hands in the air... oh, but not this tough criminals. Somehow, this guy manages to backup into the cop's gun then make a 180 turn and knock the gun out of his hand and beat him! Sorry people, but that wouldn't ever happen unless that cop wasn't trained. Cops are trained to shoot when an armed criminal even brushes against them. DeNiro's character would have been dead the moment he touched that cop's gun barrel. But... this is all cool - I don't mind suspension belief when watching a film. What really pisses me off though is that the film has no moral compass. Essentially, two of the bad guys get away. That's bad! If a film is going to pull me through all this bull$hit and make me pretend to believe, then I better have an ending which makes it worth my while. This brings me to problem number 2.<br/><br/>2. Two bad guys got away. What kind of message is this film sending? Basically, the writer of this script is allowing justification for a criminal's actions. And for some reason everyone thinks that's cool. So, let me get this straight. Val Kilmer's character manages to kill several cops, destroy an L.A. street block, kill several innocent civilians, rob a bunch of banks and... and... by the end of the film, his skank girl friend (excuse the language) covers for him and he goes free. What's worse, the film tries to act like this is justice. As if we the audience should be smiling and happy that his morally backward girl friend would let this murderer go. What she did was selfish in regard to her son and immoral in regard to the people who this character killed. So, where the hell is the moral justice here? But that's not all. We have Pacino's character feeling sorry for DeNiro's character - how touching. So, this guy kills a bunch of people, but... but... it's his nature, so give him a break. WTF? Where's the justice in that? Basically, we have a film with a bad cop, a bunch of bad guys and no justice. But it seems no one gives a damn about justice at the end of films. People just want to see all of this completely unrealistic action, DeNiro and Pacino holding hands, and a bunch of criminals getting off at the end.<br/><br/>I agree, this film probably isn't about justice. It's neither about morals nor ethics. But, don't even try to tell me it's about realism! Heat is NOT realistic. So, what's that leave us with? An unrealistic film that pretends to be real. <br/><br/>Why do people like this film? Where's the good ending? Why does Mann write bad guys going free? Wouldn't it have been a lot nicer if Kilmer's character's girl friend would have actually obeyed the law and ratted him out? For God's sake, he killed a bunch of people and her child was on the line. C'mon people."

","It is rare when you can identify the exact point where a movie goes horribly wrong.  Al Pacino pulls Robert Di Niro over in an unmarked police car and says: ""How about a cup of coffee?""  I can just see a commitee of studio execs (they roam in packs like hyenas) saying ""We need to have a meeting between the cop and master criminal, to give the movie, you know, more personal tension. Plus, it's Pacino and Di Niro, how can it miss?""  It missed by a mile.   <br/><br/>After the friendly coffee talk, everything slides quickly downhill.  Plot holes open up like fault lines, little sub plots rise up with no rhyme or reason, then get cut off.  (witness the ex-con turned short order cook subplot.)  ""Emotional"" scenes with peripheral characters get tacked on to the end, I guess to tug at our heart strings, since they add nothing to the plot or to our understanding of the characters.    <br/><br/>Everyone seemed to be going through the motions on this one.  What a shame, considering the cast.  This movie is not worth the talent put together to make it. <br/><br/>Oh, and it drags on FOREVER.

"Ziya90","10","5","10","19 December 2009"," The film of the bests
","Heat is one of the best movies of all time and Michael Mann's best movie to me. Also one of the best crime thrillers with the best bank robbery sequence. This is a film that Al Pacino is in the cast. He is not a supporter actor. His character is also suits him a lot. And there is Robert De Niro too. He is not a supporter actor like Pacino. And this movie is three hours. However, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are not father-in-laws and Heat is not a comedy. Pacino plays a cop and De Niro plays a thief. Pacino says I will catch you and De Niro says, do it if you can. While reading the cast for the first time, I said this is enough, OK. but it continued. One more very good (and to me very liked) actor or actress and one more and one more. This is a crime, action movie, but a deep one, not a shallow work at all. Heat shows almost every character's personal lives, working lives and problems, but even one scene is not uninteresting. Some scenes are so still, but I like it. Stylish. To me Heat is the most stylish Michael Mann movie with The Insider. I like the movies which show us the city or show us the places that Scorsese never does. There are almost two action scenes, one of them is very short, but very exciting. The other is one of the longest and realistic clashes of all times, probably the most loudest action scene, too. You have a headache, this is inevitable and the gun sounds ring inside your brain, your ears ring. However, I don't care about it so much. I love watching Al Pacino while he runs, Mann turns the music down. It must deserve to be put in the action cinema anthology. Almost all the people saw the film talk about the scene which Pacino and De Niro talk face to face, as you know, Heat is the first film that De Niro and Pacino were in the same scene. Honestly, I am not interested in it so much, I mean I don't love Heat so that there is this scene, it is a historical moment in cinema may be, but cut this scene, the film is still excellent. A very powerful and stylish crime epic."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","5","10","21 August 2009"," The best at several things
","This is undoubtedly Mann's finest, and I'm not sure even he, himself, can really top it. If you ever wanted to know about crime in L.A., this is what to watch. The plot is excellent, and consistently told well, so that the audience never loses track, and in spite of great complexity, it manages to not be difficult to follow. Every single performance in this is spot-on and effective, from the two acting veteran leads through the young and always talented Portman, and to the smallest, briefest role. The characters are all fleshed out, credible and interesting. This doesn't take sides. It gives insight into the private lives of people on both sides of the law, those who uphold it as well as those who break it. Not everyone is in a positive light, but no one is unfairly treated by the presentation of that type of person, and the word ""one-note"" is simply not part of Michael's vocabulary when he penned the marvelous script. The emotion is genuine, and this is immensely involving and engaging from first to last frame. This is long, however, which hopefully will not deter any possible viewers. It's around three hours long, give or take twenty minutes, depending on the version. There is a little humor, at least worth chuckles, and it isn't trying to leave you in stitches. The dialog is sharp and impeccably delivered, often saying a lot with few lines. This has concise social commentary. It also has magnificent suspense and tension. Production values leave nothing to be desired. The action is among the most unforgettable committed to celluloid since its invention. Realism is sky-high, with next to no Hollywood(in fact, in all aspects of this), and I kid you not, when those guns go off, you can *feel* it. Nothing fancy, no stylization. Instead, every shot comes off as having an impact, as being dangerous. People actually reload, accuracy is an issue and the firearms can't magically handle whatever situation they're used in. Pretty much any moment of this that has bullets flying is epic. The ending is amazing, if I do argue with the very last bit. Hey, MM and finales... anyway, it doesn't bother me enough to lower my rating any. There is a lot of strong language, and some bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of drama who can stomach it. 10/10"
"MaxBorg89","10","5","10","22 July 2008"," Mann's masterwork
","Ever since his breakthrough in television with Miami Vice, which he executive produced, Michael Mann has had an eye for cops, and more specifically their relationship with the criminals they track down. Manhunter, his superb Hannibal Lecter film, showed this in a most admirable fashion, but it is Heat that will be remembered as his crowning achievement, one of the few must-see thrillers of the '90s (or of all time, for that matter).<br/><br/>The title, as far as I can tell, comes from a quote in the movie: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"". That's the motto Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) observes every day, since every single second matters in his job: robbing banks. He has a great team working with him (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight), but if it became necessary he would leave all of them behind. Even his affair with a woman named Eady (Amy Brenneman, fresh out of NYPD Blue) is ultimately meaningless, just another expendable element of his life.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, that same mantra could sum up the life of Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), an LAPD officer who finds it hard to juggle his ever demanding job and his fragile (third) marriage, which comes complete with a troubled stepdaughter (Natalie Portman). If he could, he would dump everything and commit wholeheartedly to his work. And the opportunity presents itself quite quickly when Neil's latest bank job doesn't end as well as usual and Vincent begins to close in on the previously elusive criminal, beginning a battle of wits like few have ever seen.<br/><br/>Being a Mann film, Heat is technically perfect: from the cinematography to the spot-on editing (especially in the central heist sequence) to the locations (L.A. is to the director like New York to Scorsese), the film shows its big budget credentials without hesitation, making for one hell of a visual experience. Light and dark converge into a new shape, emphasizing Mann's point: the ""good"" and the ""bad"" guy aren't that distinguishable anymore.<br/><br/>That leads to the other asset Heat can boast, namely Mann's key theme of hunted and hunter being substantially equal: Manhunter suggested this in a quite eerie way, and it returns here in one of the most talked-about scenes in movie history - the coffee shop encounter between Hanna and McCauley. ""I don't know how to do anything else"" remarks the tired cop. ""Neither do I"" comments the crook. ""And I don't much want to either"". ""Neither do I"" McCauley repeats. There's a very thin line between the two sides of the coin, and Mann hasn't just blurred it, he's erased it for good.<br/><br/>The coffee shop sequence also highlights Heat's main trump card: Pacino and De Niro. Justly described as the best actors of their generation, Mann's opus gives them the chance to actually meet on screen (which didn't occur, for obvious reasons, in their previous shared credit, The Godfather: Part II) and contrast their trademark personas - De Niro's controlled calm against Pacino's rage-fueled outbursts. They are accompanied by a terrific supporting cast (Kilmer, Voight, Portman, plus briefer roles for Ashley Judd and Simpsons voice actor Hank Azaria), but it's their combined presence that makes Heat the gem it is: the best philosophical crime movie ever, and, alongside The Usual Suspects, the best thriller of the '90s."

","However you take this film, there is no denying that it is one of the best thrillers ever made.<br/><br/>The more you watch it, the more obvious the subplots become; almost to a point where you can take the film on a level which upon first viewing is so well hidden you don't notice it. It may appear to be a fairly simplistic good vs evil tale, but this can also be applied to Neil vs Waingro, rather than Vincent vs Neil. <br/><br/>I would suggest the most intriguing thing about this film was the character development, and the basis of them upon real people. Real life isn't as polarised as Hollywood most often implies; so its nice to see a film where can view the characters actually developing throughout a film, and maybe hazard a guess as to what turned them into the people they are.<br/><br/>Serial killers, hi-tech heists and an expertly paced plot make this one of, if not the, best thriller ever made.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it - watch it, then watch it again; you are sure to realise how deep this film really is."

The plot sucks you in and never lets go, and there's nary a car chase nor explosion to be found!  (how refreshing.)<br/><br/>One of my top twenty favs of all time. No need to add more, as other reviewers have pretty much covered it."
"patemm-1","7","6","13","7 October 2014"," Quite a bore and overrated
","I watched this movie twice now. First a couple of years after its release and again last night. I did not remember much of the plot or character from the my first viewing which is not a good sign. I am a fan of Al Pacino and De Niro, but what a waste of talent. Al Pacino first, well he is Al Pacino playing a cop. You don't see a cop you see Al Pacino, no creativity and no effort in making the character more subtle. De Niro is quite better playing it it cool and professional with a little bit of nostalgia in his eyes, but he cannot save the movie.<br/><br/>I could not care about the other characters in the movie. Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore are usually good, but their character development was quite weak. Although the movie is pretty long, it seems that each scene was missing the point and at the end we do not feel any sympathy for any of the crew members, except De Niro. What about Dennis Haybert character, what the point ? Why adding a side story for a few minutes of interaction ?<br/><br/>I haven't seen the original, but it seems that it is the problem of adapting the story and trying to fit everything in it, but missing important links.<br/><br/>I put a five because of the cinematography and for the action scene that show LA from a different angle.<br/><br/>But again, Al Pacino and De Niro in a movie and that all what we get, sad...."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","8","19","25 September 2008"," Mediocre
","The film, much hyped for the first on screen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, opens with an only in Hollywood heist of an armored bank truck. The newest member of the gang- Waingro (Kevin Gage)- panics, which results in the murder of the 3 guards. De Niro's character, Neil McCauley, the gang's leader, attempts to kill the screw up, but he escapes. Meanwhile, Vincent Hanna (Pacino), LAPD homicide expert, takes over the case. Needless digressions include Hanna's failing marriage with his faithless wife Justine (Diane Venora) & suicidal stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), Waingroe's revelation as a serial killer of prostitutes, McCauley's contrived and sparkless romance with a lonely bookworm 25 years his junior, Eady (Amy Brenneman), & the backstory of the newest member of the gang. If the long and superfluous digressions are not bad enough, the implausible action scenes & character interactions are worse- this is an absolutely abominable screenplay, folks. Here are just some of the implausibilities: after figuring out that McCauley's thieves have turned the tables on him Hanna stops McCauley, who absurdly agrees to a cup of joe with him. This is the big 'Clash of Titans' the film hypes, but is as realistic as John Ashcroft breaking bread with Osama bin Laden. Instead, we get insipid dick on the table banter as Hanna warns McCauley he just might have to 'take him out'. McCauley counters, 'Oh yeah? I just might have to take you out.' It would have been a hoot had McCauley replied, 'You talking' to me?', but no such luck. In short, Heat is a mediocre movie at best- its visual style accounting for whatever props it deserves. It was only 2 years later that the brilliant L.A. Confidential came along & showed America what a truly great crime film could be. As for the DVD itself? It's no-frills- there's no commentary, 3 trailers, but the actual transfer of the film print is very clean, as is the sound quality. Curiously, the DVD package seems to recapitulate the making of the film: great attention paid to the shine, but a fairly hollow core.<br/><br/>I waited years to see this film because it was so over-hyped, just like I waited years to see the abominable Schindler's List. Heat is not that bad, but post-9/11 this sort of juvenilia all seems kind of unreal."
"Colonel Ted","4","8","19","11 February 2000"," An average thriller, overrated by the presence of De Nero and Pacino
","A lot of people have made a lot of fuss over Heat. After seeing it for myself I really can't understand why. Aside from the presence of the two leads Heat is essentially a cops n' robbers saga given a little extra dimension and a lot of extra gloss. I can't fault Michael Mann's style. His stark vision of Los Angeles is excellent. The opening shot with the elevated train coasting past the camera with the haunting synth score is truly memorable. However, when the first shot of a film is the best part, you're in trouble. Mann as writer fairs much worse. His script (actually based on his 1989 TV movie LA Takedown) is a mess; padded his unnecessary subplots and characters; it substitutes intrigue for confused plotting. The near 3-hour running time is sheer self-indulgence, when the concept behind this film is complete mouse of idea: that cops and robbers are very much alike. In reality this so-called character development that Mann has put at the front of his film is just a story of male bonding between two highly unlikeable and unsympathetic characters. Pacino as the cop and De Nero as the robber are both well-worn clichés that are slightly deeper than normal. Pacino as an angst ridden cop, on his third marriage and De Nero as the calculating psycho criminal who plans his life so that he can drop everything and leave at 30 seconds notice when the heat is on. Both these characters are as unlikeable as the other is and this blunts much of the tension. A brilliantly staged gun battle on the streets of LA is wasted because we don't care which character comes off the better. The two leads don't do anything for their roles either. Neither gives performances that equal their best and the film's main purpose is simply to bring them on screen together. They appear twice together. Once in a coffee shop to discuss their morals and at the film's ending, which more than resembles that of Bullit. Clearly Mann has attempted to say that police and criminal are indivisible, and this is probably why we don't sympathise with either of them. This is such an unoriginal concept that has been explored as far back as the 70s with The French Connection and Serpico it also is the reason why, the film is overrated. Why should we spend 3 hours with two people we don't like?"
"bandw","5","7","16","4 April 2009"," Strong on testosterone, weak on script
","The only thing that would separate this from being just another cops and robbers movie is the star power of Pacino and De Niro. But I just kept thinking of what a good movie these two could have been in rather than this routine outing that did not push them beyond the stereotypes that they themselves have helped create. The ""just one more score"" theme is getting a little threadbare too. We have seen Pacino and De Niro in these kinds of roles so often that I could not separate the actors from the characters they were playing. <br/><br/>So many plot elements just do not hold up. The relationship between De Niro and the lovely Amy Brenneman is unbelievable. A young, gentle bookstore clerk is going to get mixed up with tough guy De Niro and not be just a little interested in what he does for a living? And sticks with him when she ultimately finds out what a snake he is? For all of De Niro's talent he can't play a tender love scene with Brenneman that is the least bit believable. In the big shootout between De Niro's gang of four, and what looked like the entire LA police force, we are to believe that two of De Niro's gang escaped? And so on.<br/><br/>The much ballyhooed scene between Pacino and De Niro has all of the impact of two emotionless middle-aged guys sitting across from each other at a table in a diner spouting lines like, ""You do what you do, and I do what I do,"" and ""I don't know how to do anything else."" And then there is the ""my balls are bigger than your balls"" moment when each of the two allows as how he will have to take the other down if it comes to a standoff. This scene must account somewhat for why this movie is so popular with young males. The two share accounts of recurring dreams no less (a banquet table populated by dead people for Pacino and drowning for De Niro). There is an implication of bonding in this scene that I found to be a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>We have extraneous side stories thrown in, like Pacino's suicidal stepdaughter and a substitute gang member that turns out to be a serial rapist/murderer on the side.<br/><br/>The score by Elliot Goldenthal is generic and transparently manipulative, designed to raise the tension level at appropriate places and frequently announcing how we are supposed to react to a scene.<br/><br/>This thing drags on for almost three hours until its inevitable showdown between De Niro and Pacino. There is little new here."

","Plot In A Paragraph: In L.A, a group of professional bank robbers led by a loner called Neil (Robert De Niro) start to feel the heat from the police headed by homicide detective Vince Hanna (Al Pacino) following their latest heist.<br/><br/>The pinnacle of Michael Mann's career so far, Heat is simply superb. It's interesting to note he hits a lot of the same beats from Thief and Manhunter, plenty of shots of the ocean, men sneaking out of bed leaving their woman sleeping, scenes in cafe's at night and again one hell of a score. Boy does this guy know how the chose his composers. So reminiscent of Thief's score, I looked to see if it was Tangerine Dream. But it was Elliot Goldenthall. Brilliant at helping create tension and setting the tone. <br/><br/>People always wax lyrical about Pacino and De Niro in this, and they are worthy of the plaudits, but so is the supporting cast Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Kevin Cage are all brilliant, as are William Fictcher and Hank Azria in smaller roles too.<br/><br/>Of the women in the movie is Amy Brenneman and Ashley Judd (for years I thought it was Charlize Theron) are more than just scenery, as can often be the case in this type of movies. For her brief time on screen (3 scenes) Natalie Portman is superb and her subplot is heartbreakingly sad. Ignored by her Dad, no fatherly figure support from her step Dad (Pacino) and her mam pretty much ignores her. <br/><br/>I love this movie!! One of the best of the year, if not the decade!! <br/><br/>Heat did not do as well at the box office as I thought, grossing $67 million at the domestic box office to end the year the 25th highest grossing movie of 1995. <br/><br/>To put that in context, Father Of The Bride 2, the Hugh Grant comedy Nine Months and Mortal Kombat all out performed it.<br/><br/>WTF?? Don't get me wrong 1995 was a good year for movies, but I expected to see this higher when I looked."

Al Pacino is incredible in his role, as he goes through various stages and moods that are followed by great emotions and some amazing scenes. Robert is also great as he shows his love towards women he feel for, hatred towards guys that betrayed him and that wanted to cross him over and is filled with emotions. Others were also incredible but not as those two guys and they sometimes leftover to get their chance to show but never get it fully.

","I've seen a few of Michael Mann's movies...Manhunter (the original Silence of the Lambs), The Insider, Collateral. Heat has to be one of the best. A lot's been said about Heat, but there are a few standouts. Dennis Haybert plays Donald Breedon, out on parole and is hired by a crooked diner owner (Bud Cort - good to see him acting). When Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) recruits Breedon to be the getaway driver, you feel a sense of foreboding. But good to see Dennis end up playing the President of the USA a few years later.<br/><br/>The final scene between Val Kilmer's character and Ashley Judd's character was very moving even though no words are exchanged. Their facial expressions alone are enough, and it's quite moving.<br/><br/>The shootout scene has to be one of the best ever in movie history. With all the death, damage and destruction done, I can only wonder the headache this caused to the insurers in the storyline."
"MartinHafer","9","3","5","23 April 2011"," Exceptionally well done though it's not the sort of film for everyone...but what movie is?
","I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like ""Heat"". However, on a lark and because it's apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.<br/><br/>The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It's almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro's oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.<br/><br/>There's very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino's character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it's just me....<br/><br/>Overall, if you don't mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull."
"bkoganbing","9","3","5","4 November 2008"," The Summit
","One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. <br/><br/>The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.<br/><br/>You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.<br/><br/>Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.<br/><br/>This action film also does not stint on woman's roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.<br/><br/>Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.<br/><br/>But like in Heat, it should have happened."

I felt, that I was there in the midst of the drama. Not every movie has the power and ability to bring you to a place of longing. The characters, and the people playing the parts, where pieced together just right by casting agent Bonnie Timmerman. Then as far as it goes for Mann, he knows what he wants!<br/><br/>1995, Heat hit the theaters and a man I knew, who was 'Special Forces' weighed in with his thoughts on this before I even had a chance to see this. He said' ""When you're in the middle of a firefight, any of them, you practically need ear-plugs. Just like it is in reality. All the other activity, was real believable."" He was impressed, even as a military man in special forces. I went and caught it, when I had the time and from the onset, it opens up and lets you glide into the story. I pretty much could get lost in this one. I don't mean, not understanding the story and so on either. It's just an incredible trip for the sense of suspense and intrigue. It's spellbinding in effect. The 'Mann', telling the story draws you in by the activity and spreads out a silence around in various parts, causing you to think and feel through the absence of 'speech' or talking. Just by the essence of the scenery, unfolding the story and using more elements than, just dialog. My thoughts become a lot more enthralled when the story is so smart in it's execution, using your mind, instead of just giving everything through the 'characters words'. A drawing in of your feelings as you watch a scene get set with a somber building of drama, leading up to a climax that doesn't get blown, the wrong way. Through the 'Crew's' activities and the murders on the streets, the M.C.U. is getting stretched, but hasn't snapped. Vincent is on the 'case'. Kevin Gage (Waynegro) was a special kind of 'scumbag' for me. He was an authentic criminal. A precise coward, an ego maniac and a 'life' story loser! Perfect. There are other good and great directors out there as well. However, it seems that Mann rarely misses. (*****)"

","First of all I would like to begin by saying I love movies and on the whole the movies that get high ratings are generally good. However, my issue is that I don't understand why people seem to think a star cast automatically makes a better movie, and Heat is a perfect example. LA Takedown (the original TV movie) starred nobodies and was seen by a fraction of the people who saw Heat, but the film was much better. Why? because the script was less wordy and obvious, the original had subtlety and inferred what the characters thought whereas the remake had to spell out every idea, leaving nothing for the audience to do. <br/><br/>Another issue I have is with the basically ridiculous plot twist in the remake. In the original the reason the thief goes back to confront the rat is because his girlfriend rejects him. In the remake he has the girl but he still decides to go back so you have a confrontation of good Vs bad. In the original the cop respects the thief and shows that by how he treats the rat. This is similar to The Departed which is absolute garbage in comparison to Infernal Affairs(a must see) on every level acting,writing,plot but because one stars Jack, Leo, Matt Damon and is directed by Marty and the other is foreign starring and directed by relative nobodies one is considered great wins awards and is wrongly lauded. I defy anybody to watch the originals of either movie and say honestly the remake is anything other than rubbish i.e. in the Departed Jack is a rat why? and again the good guys win predictable crap. fine this is Hollywood but since when did Marty stop making real films Raging Bull, Goodfellas and start pandering to the Oscars voters.

","Pretentious bank heist ""epic"" about a team of detectives led by over-the-top loud-mouthed Pacino on the trail of tight-knit group of robbers led by a-little-too-reserved De Niro. The film dates poorly; specifically, with Pacino screaming out supposedly clever lines that were probably witty for 1995, but nowadays is just seen as a cheap cry for attention. But even for 1995 standards, the film is incredibly overrated, what with your typical over-sappy and unnecessary Michael Mann unsexy love scene, or the ridiculous time spent (or wasted) developing overly-complex characters only to give them a rushed send-off.

The direction is as tight as a Led Zeppelin concert, the cinematography is simply breathtaking, the major players are larger-than-life yet believable, the action sequences are exquisitely choreographed and finished to near-perfection. The moral questions the movie raises are an interesting side-issue as well. Not to mention the way the plot examines the flawed, but redeemable, relationships of post-modernity. In the end, one has become so involved as to try to stop the subtle plot from fulfillment. The suspense at the end builds to an almost unbearable climax, and the denouement is as brilliant, and human, and deeply moving, as they come...

"Mr_Censored","10","4","8","13 October 2009"," Pure intensity.
","In what is arguably one of the finest heist movies in history, ""Heat"" pits two acting heavy-weights in Robert De Niro and Al Pacino against one another. One is a professional thief, so well seasoned that he has avoided the law for as long as he can probably remember. The other is a troubled homicide detective whose third marriage is fizzling out due to his over-riding commitment to his job. Each character ultimately finds he has more in common with his adversary than with his peers. Both are flawed, tired and run-down middle-aged men who, in the immortal words of Roger Murtaugh (see: ""Lethal Weapon"") are ""getting too old for this .""<br/><br/>""Heat"" is hardly your average cops and robbers tale. It's long, it's sweeping and is steeped in character moments and conversations. While much of the hype about the film has always revolved around its finale – the bank robbery – it's the small moments that make the film. Take for instance a scene in the middle of the film where Pacino, too tired and beat down to do anything else, tracks down his suspect (De Niro) and invites him for a cup of coffee where the two talk shop and in spite of mutual respect for one another, both vow not to back down. This moment serves to build the tension that is the big pay-off in the film. You get to know and feel for these very real and very flawed characters, so that when the heat is on, so to speak, you don't know who to cheer for anymore.<br/><br/>Undeniably, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are the stars of the film and are a large part of its greatness, but it is also Michael Mann's (""Collateral,"" ""Manhunter"") unique eye and story-telling sense that defines the film as well. Despite his insuppressible style, the film still retains a gritty, realistic air that is best evidenced in a shootout that takes place in the Los Angeles streets. Without a doubt, this is the director's masterpiece and definitely one of the best of its kind. It's a true epic that is filed to the brim with intense acting (nobody's forgotten about you either, Val) and complicated characters as intricate as the job they are trying to do. For all intents and purposes, ""Heat"" lives up to its name."

It is a great movie to watch, to comment, to think about it and let's face it: there are more than one subjects to debate on: 1. Traditional approach to one of the most dangerous jobs: that of a cop. Is it enough to be a good cop to catch a thief? 2. Is the line between ""cops and robbers"" clearly drawn thinking of the prejudice that the first are good and the latter are bad? 3. Every man or woman portrayed in this movie has a hard shell, projecting a certain image and also a soft core, with deep feelings, frustration etc. i.e. everything that makes us human...<br/><br/>Enjoy this perfect movie and you will all have your own themes to think about..."

","Pacino. DeNiro. Ask anyone who the greatest actors of all time are, and those two will be at the top of anyone's list. But here in ""Heat,"" there is an opportunity that will cause any movie-lover to begin salivating profusely: Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro star in a movie together! The story is simple, because ""Heat"" is about its characters. Robert DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a professional thief. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna, the Los Angeles detective who is trying to prevent him from taking down his next big score.<br/><br/>Despite being on opposite sides of the law, McCauley and Hanna are very much alike, yet their lives are governed by opposite circumstances. Hanna's marriage to Justine (the wonderful Diane Venora) is failing, while McCauley, a previously satisfied loner, finds romance with graphic designer Eady (Amy Brenneman). However, both of them have a similar mindset when it comes to their lot in life. Both of them simply do what they do best: McCauley takes scores while Hanna tries to stop him.<br/><br/>The acting is what you'd expect it to be: outstanding. Pacino and DeNiro are in top form, and so is everyone else. Standouts from the main cast (apart from Pacino and DeNiro, of course) are the female love interests, Venora and Brenneman. Venora brings a torn sense of weariness to her character. She loves Hanna, but she also knows that he can't be the man she needs. Brenneman is great as the rather shy librarian, who decides to take a chance on Neil, but realizes that she doesn't know what she's getting into. Special mention has to go to Kevin Gage, who is seriously creepy as Waingro. Gage is absolutely chilling; he's the stuff of nightmares.<br/><br/>When it comes to directors, Michael Mann will always have a special place in my heart. His tough-as-nails style is instantly recognizable, and ""Heat"" is pure Mann (no pun intended). The film is highly stylized, often times resembling magazine ads (though not in the same way as, say, Tarsem. Think high-end apartment ads, not fashion magazines). ""Heat"" is a long movie, clocking in at a little less than three hours, but Mann keeps things moving. The actors are so good that the time flies by.<br/><br/>However, all that is fluff compared to the highlight of the movie: the robbery. Simply put, this is one of the greatest action sequences of all time. Not because it's full of explosions and extravagant stunts, but because it's so real. I had no problem believing that a bank robbery could have been carried out just like this. It's superbly choreographed and expertly shot. The sound of the gunfire is completely realistic, and the tactics are all in evident. It's exhilarating.<br/><br/>There's not a person alive who wouldn't find something to like in this movie. It has great drama and spectacular action. ""Heat"" definitely is one of the masterworks of the cops and robbers genre."
"pc95","10","4","8","10 April 2009"," Michael Mann's Best; One of 90's best
","My gusher of a review - Epic in length and equally good, Heat is one of my favorite movies I've ever seen. It has everything a movie-following man (and woman if you like violent cops and robbers)could want in a superbly finished and edited package. Yes, everything is outstanding in this movie - the drama, the story, and most especially the cinematography and acting. Leading the way is Al Pacino's performance whose bravado is 2nd to none - he is full of intense energy and wit. Robert De Niro is not far behind, chameleon-like, patient, and thoughtfully calculating. All supporting cast from small roles to lead support are interesting and dynamic. The script is concise and simple; likewise the dialog - very well written and believable. The action is graphic though not gratuitous. It's well placed and enhancing. Best support comes from Kevin Gage as Waingrove and Jon Voight as Nate - both understated and sharply well acted and additionally Mykelti Williamson who injects some stern realism to Pacino's emotional explosiveness. Running over 2 and half hours, you'd hardly notice as engrossing as this gem is. There are scant few scenes that the movie would benefit from being cut, and the music gives a great shading and undertone to the LA lights and settings. A defining movie for the 90s, and a superior effort for the crime drama genre in cinema, Heat stands out glowingly. Highly recommended."

Though this is an action film everything is very cleverly made, all action scenes were exiting and thanks to the good sound effects and camera job it seemed that this is going on for real. At first it appeared a little boring to me but when I got to know the characters better I couldn't take my eyes off screen. This movie is the best know for having Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one film, but it doesn't seem that everything in the movie was going only around them, there were few other characters played by great actors and this movie was about all of them.

","Simply incredible. This movie wasn't a massive box office hit like other similar movies but it is easily one of the best movies of all time because put simply, it has it all. To start with, it is visually stunning. Michael Mann couldn't have made LA look any better. Then we have the fantastic cast led by Pacino and De Niro and supported brilliantly by the likes of Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. The casting is astonishing considering this wasn't a big budget, box office smash type movie. Then we have possibly the best written storyline in recent history. The story revolves around the dedicated but highly strung cop Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and his team of detectives trying to bust articulated thief Neil MaCauley (De Niro) and his team of bank robbers. The complexity of the characters becomes shades of grey rather than black and white as Neil wants out but struggles to give up doing what he does best and Vincent struggles to hold his marriage together as his pursuit of Neil takes over his life. All the characters in the movie are complex and interesting, adding different dimensions to the already fantastic storyline. It really has the lot. It is nearly 3 hours long but every minute is gripping and develops the story further, and the acting is fantastic. I recommend it any casual fan as much as fans of the genre. Sensational."

",""" A guy told me one time, 'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.'"" Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) from Heat <br/><br/>I've always been of the opinion that it is incredibly difficult to make a great crime picture. The genre has been explored so many times from so many angles. I can say with a degree of certainty that 99% of crime films being made today fall in to the ""Forgettably Entertaining"" category. Michael Mann's Heat is a film that falls in the final 1%.<br/><br/>Heat (apropriatley subtitled ""A Los Angeles Crime Saga"") is at its core a character study of archetypal cops and robbers. The two sides of a coin: homicide detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and ace thief Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Their stories are fairly typical: Pacino is always on the job, must to the chagrin of his third wife, Justine (Diane Venora). This is a Pacino performance of the first rank. He's manic and riveting. Though he represents the ""right"" side of the law, Hanna is not Elliot Ness reborn. He loves the role of the hunter and craves it, Pacino, always an incredibly intelligent actor, knows this and bases his performance in this characteristic.<br/><br/>DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a career thief who is the best in his profession. He's never had anything to weigh him down, so he's always been at the top. DeNiro bring a realistic cynicism to the role. In the hands of a lesser actor the role could have seemed to maudlin, but DeNiro pulls it off due to the attention and fascination her garners on screen.<br/><br/>Yet, when it comes down to it, this is truly a Michael Mann film. It is an epic of surprising scope, and thankfully Mann is a director of considerable range. Mann stages what is arguably the most impressive shootout of the past twenty odd years. He doesn't just throw it on the screen, it is carefully edited, and maintains a naturalistic flow. However, by praising his direction I do not mean to discount his taut scripting. The film is filled with endless fascination, down to the characters and their daily routines, details are abundant in this film.<br/><br/>All these elements are a certain greatness on their own , but when combined into a saga like 'Heat',they take on a special brilliance. When the credits roll it dawned on me, the film is so masterfully made, it is not only a masterpiece of the genre, but of the medium."

","First off, this is my personal favourite film of all time. It is recognized as one of the police crime films of all time but at the time of its release it was unbelievably overlooked. it should have won plenty for Oscars - say four, and one of the actors should have received the award for best actor be it Pacino or DeNiro.<br/><br/>The level of acting is almost far superior to any other film i have seen as all the cast give stellar performances. DeNiro, Pacino and Kilmer play the main characters in an absorbing fashion while there is great support form the likes of Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and a small role for Bill Fitchner.<br/><br/>This film should rank up there with LA Confidential and other great Cop films like Cop Land as one of the best.<br/><br/>a great film 10/10."

","This film brought the Godfathers of Hollywood (if you excuse the pun) to bring you Heat, one of the greatest crime thrillers to hit the big screen. The overall plot is mesmerising, due to the fact that you experience the lives on persons on both sides of the law that are thrown together to take you on an incredible ride through the world of bank heists and shoot outs. You have Pacino as Vincent Hanna, the sharp and volatile cop investigating a line of heists. The thieves responsible for these heists are De Niro, as Neil McCauley, the smooth and mysterious mastermind, and his right hand men Kilmer and Sizemore. Despite the great ensemble of cast, Pacino and De Niro steal the show by both delivering unforgettable lines and action scenes. The beauty of this cast ensemble is that neither one of them out staged one another, as if one delivered one good line the other would just hit the other back with an equally good line. The scene within the diner is a truly classic scene, where you see Pacino and De Niro just talk, no yelling or physical movement, yet each line they deliver electrifies the scene.<br/><br/>Other than Pacino and De Niro, the film also consists of a thrilling shoot out, keeping you on the edge of your seat by the sound of every gun shot.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, Mann is a genius, and this is his masterpiece!"
"thinker1691","10","4","8","10 June 2007"," There Is A Flip Side To That
","Throughout ones cinematic life, a fan comes to understand the essential ingredients of every movie. When it comes to crime dramas, it becomes standard for the good guys to win over the bad guys. However, after a lifetime of watching the same scenarios, and knowing full well the good guys don't always win in real life, sophisticate audiences then expect reality to be part of the movie. Few authority figures want to change the 'good always triumphs' myth, but modern audiences demand more 'authentic' crime dramas and thus a few courageous directors will give the audience what it demands. The best among them is Michael Mann. The movie ""HEAT"" has earned him more acclaim than any movie to date for realistic films. Anyone who views Heat, will see real life drama in action. Watching the film one realizes more than Mann's superior direction went into the creation of this unique story. The sheer star power added to the magical combination. Here we have Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) a veteran no nonsense detective who goes after only the best crime 'Crews' and will not stop until they are put down. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a master career criminal who rarely makes mistakes in his craft. Val Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a professional who is willing to put everything on the line for his woman and the Big Score. Jon Voight is superb as De Niro's mysterious fence and skilled consultant. The Big heist is upon them and De Niro's hand picked crew is going for 70 million. Al Pacino's special elite police squad will be there to try and stop them and to bring their crime spree to a end. Expect Micahel Mann to allow the experienced criminals to take on the well armed police with military weapons and precision teamwork in one of the bloodiest, explosive most exciting running gun battles ever created. This movie is a must for anyone who's tired of the bad guys losing all the time. *****"
"FungasUK","10","4","8","10 February 2007"," Extravaganza
","Wow...I have to give a ""summary""...?! Well, extravaganza it is. Seeing this film for the first time was like opening a box of treats. And not having long enough to savour each one. So, on repeat viewings, the box exposes itself and my appetite for Michael Mann's take on the human condition is sated, more so.<br/><br/>Heat begins like many movies of its' genre; the opening scene-setters are very brilliantly shot and choreographed (the opening smooch between Vincent and his wife; Val Kilmer's character purchasing the weaponry from an unsuspecting Martin Ferrero etc). This movie starts well, and as it means to go on. Information is the key. The more you know about why these characters are who they are, they more you may understand why they do what they do.<br/><br/>Complications set in quickly; Al Pacino's Lt Vincent Hanna is plagued by guilt over his lack of commitment to his marriage, which affects his relationship with step-daughter Lauren; Chris Shiherlis is a rogue, but endlessly loved none-the-less; Robert De Niro's Neil Macauley has a pact with himself: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" This is complicated city! These people have feelings! They are loved, and they do too.<br/><br/>As a heist movie, Heat is great. The L.A. take-down scenes are breathtaking. You pine for the guys who get shot, more so for the robbers who we've come to understand and, hell, like. The ultimate in cinematic connivance comes, however, when Robert de Niro and Al Pacino appear on screen for the first time ever. Yeah, they did Godfather 2 but, hell, a whole generation separated their characters. This is big stuff...however, the scene is so brilliantly underplayed that it takes on its own life, and becomes almost the point of reference for the whole movie. Al Pacino's cop chases Robert de Niro's robber and, Christ, they meet in a café. What do ya know...?! Suffice it to say, the climax of this movie is one of the most memorable and emotional in recent movie history. If you really feel these guys, and buy into what they do and what they say, you'll be hard pushed not to be blown away by the finale. I was. I saw this movie and realised that some people in Hollywood still know how to press the right buttons for people who are waiting impatiently for something good to come along and...well...blow them away.<br/><br/>Hats off to all concerned. This is one hell of a movie."
"jdkraus","10","4","8","9 December 2006"," A cool masterpiece from the Mann
","Miami Vice was no doubt the best cop show every brought on television. I may have come late from seeing this film, but I have to say that this is an excellent feat of movie-making.<br/><br/>it is the typical cops chasing robberies story. Al Pacino plays an obsessive detective who is ""on a downslope of a marriage"" with his third wife (Diana Venora). The other side of the law is a tough, ""never miss"" thief Neil McCauley (Robert de Niro). Both men collide when Neil's crew of thieves steal $1.6 mil, from an armored car, executing all three guards. From here on, the tale explodes like I've never seen before.<br/><br/>It is a different form of cops chasing robberies film, simply because the film not only focuses on the action, which was a fair amount in the film, but also the lives of affected by these men and many other lives. The movie gets in deep with the character's and their families and personal struggles, which is captured brilliantly. And Michal Mann does it swell, with a cool taste of music, unforgettable action scenes, including the famous street shootout, and as well as intelligent and compelling actors.<br/><br/>The cast illuminates the film and story. This maybe a three hour film, but it flys by, and when it ends, I want more. This is no doubt my favorite Michael Mann creation, besides Vice. Simply a great film that has everything from entertainment value, great stars, such Jon Voight, Val Kimmer, Ashley Judd, etc., drama, and above all strong feeling of saga. 4/4"

","OK, if anyone is reading this 10 years plus after the film's premier, I'm sure you're puzzled by my claiming this is a romantic film....but it is.<br/><br/>Master thief Macauley--DeNiro--falls in love with a relatively shy young woman. He and she are on their way to a new life together, when he decides that her love and their new life are just not enough--he must risk all that by stopping to kill a traitor to his criminal group. He turns his back on love and romance for one more criminal act, and is pursued and shot as a result by Lt. Hanna (Pacino).<br/><br/>In contrast, Chris Chihurlis (maybe Shirhulis,the Val Kilmer character) is saved from capture by his wife's undying love for him. The couple has fought viciously throughout much of the film, but when the police pressure his wife (Judd) to betray him, entice him into a police trap, she subtly waves him off, knowing she may never see him again but that he will be neither killed nor captured by the police. She risked her own freedom in so doing, but this couple was saved by love--the DeNiro character lost all when he turned his back on love. <br/><br/>The message, the theme inherent here--love is everything, treasure it, seek it above all, and it may literally save your life, save your freedom.<br/><br/>All in all, a magnificent film...and one of the best depictions ever of The sense of place that is Los Angeles....SEE IT..."
"ymmiT","10","4","8","13 February 2006"," Heated and Smoking like Gun Barrel
","I maybe a bit too liberal with my grading, but I honestly believe that it is one of the best films ever made. Heat is an incredible epic, packed with memorable, absorbing, succulent and real moments. This film also offers stunning visuals. Be it the scene where Bob De Niro and Amy Brenneman are falling in love while the city lights shine below or the violent shootout, bank robbery scene, we are punched in the face with the awesome cinematography of Dante Spinotti. I also love the fact that Mr. Mann wanted to shoot this in real places in the LA Area. <br/><br/>The cast is absolutely excellent. Al Pacino was absolutely fabulous. Every line he spat out has me in either stitches or left me awe struck. His performance was as powerful as his .45 Caliber sidearm. And we cannot forget Rober De Niro's doomed character. He played this magnificently. De Niro was great as the cool under pressure leader of a group of professional robbers. Though he was a robber, a good one at that, he was also a good man and displayed his goodness by helping out his friends, especially the character played by Val Kilmer. His character was one that grew on me. As I discovered his loneliness, I started to feel for him. It's amazing how he took a character who is this professional robber and gave him this real human element to him.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was just as gorgeous. Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Kevin Gage and yes even Natalie Portman all made strong impacts in this film.<br/><br/>One scene really stood out to me. It wasn't the ending shot or the meeting, though those scenes were absolute screen magic. I'd have to choose the scene where Robert De Niro is sitting at the table with his group at that fancy place having a good time. As he looks around the table, he sees that they all have someone special in their lives. It's at that point he discovers he is lonely.<br/><br/>""I know life is short, whatever time you get is luck."""
"MarkiG","10","4","8","17 July 2005"," Flawless
","Much has been made of this movie being the first showdown between masters De Niro and Pacino, however those two short scenes may not even be the high points.<br/><br/>This movie is, in a word, flawless. The script develops every event in such intricate detail that one hardly notices the almost 3 hour running time. while it may be true that the scene in the coffee shop is one of the most brilliantly crafted in motion picture history, the scenes before and after are the true reasons to watch this movie.<br/><br/>How this movie was overlooked by the Academy is beyond me. The screenplay, direction, and acting are all better than anything Nicolas Cage or Kevin Spacey turned in in '95, and the assured, incredibly nuanced direction was easily far and above anything Mr. Gibson put forward in Braveheart (not that it wasn't a good movie, though).<br/><br/>Heat handily wins the top spot in the Canons of Director Michael Mann as well as stars Pacino and DeNiro."

","This film is way flatter than any film starring Pacino and DeNiro has any business being. Choppy, inconsistent, overdrawn and forced, the salvageable bits of Heat can fill a thimble (I kinda liked that one scene where you wonder what DeNiro is going to do when he learns where Waingro is hiding).<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays the generic LAPD policeman - the wisecracking, gum-chewing dry attitude dude who quips one-liners over dead bodies and issues swift businessman-like orders. He lurches from dry to overacting with such aplomb that he remarks to one character ""yeah, I get over the top don't I?"" It almost sounds like Pacino is explaining to the audience how the change came about. I can't believe DeNiro filmed this the same time he was bringing the nuanced Ace Rothstein to life in Scorsese's Casino. DeNiro's character in this film is so flat that he can be summarised in one word - ""serious"". The rest of the cast, which includes some surprisingly good character actors like Danny Trejo and Tom Sizemore, is completely and utterly forgettable. Only Natalie Portman kept my attention for more than a moment, and her character is ultimately completely redundant to the film.<br/><br/>Heat's editing is very choppy, and there is some hideous green screen in places. The screenplay is heinous, as it lurches between flat dialogue and formulaic plot points - the scene where McCauley and Eady meet is so generic that I knew what was coming before it happened. His romance, along with the affair of Pacino's wife, Portman's troubles with depression, and the entire subplots of Dennis Haybert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Ashley Judd and even Jon Voight could have been cut. Haybert literally only needed to exist as a fill in driver, so why did we have to watch all these scenes about his struggles? It just makes the film drag on so very much (an hour passes without anything actually happening).<br/><br/>The film doesn't even try to constrain itself with police protocol - police stakeouts involve five guys gawking over a balcony down into the alley below. The cops discover information either by needlessly complicated methods (i.e. introducing new, unimportant characters) or by ridiculously simplistic ones (""oh I get it!""). <br/><br/>The most heinous scene in the film is the shootout in downtown LA. Apparently Val Kilmer is still Batman, because the cops somehow couldn't hit him ONCE yet he and DeNiro rained lead hell on the LAPD. Additionally, the police fired willy-nilly into civilians with no casualties. Pacino is unable to shoot through Kilmer or DeNiro's plot armour when he has a clear line of sight, but he can headshot Tom Sizemore even when he has a hostage and human shield? Where is the consistency? The whole street fight was just excruciating for me.<br/><br/>People call Heat a character study. I say the characters are boring and I cannot believe I spent over 160 minutes watching their bloated, boring story. Go watch Scent of a Woman or Casino instead."
"tvr1977","5","6","14","13 May 2014"," Long and Boring
","Has its good points, but at nearly 3 hours this movie is crying out for editing. I would have left out the whole Waingro as serial killer bit, including the scene with the hooker and the subsequent finding of the body - its inconsequential, irrelevant, and left unresolved. I also would've left out the whole ""sell VanZandt his bonds back"" subplot and just had Waingro be a straight out snitch. It would cut out a lot of nonsense, and leave the movie a lot leaner and meaner. Basically only include the armored car job, the foiled metals heist, and the bank job and denouement. At an hour and fifty minutes, this would be an action packed thriller. At 3 hours, it's kind of a yawn-fest."
"leplatypus","4","6","14","13 February 2012"," Not a hit (dvd)
","For the moment, the simultaneous pairing of Al & Bob isn't unforgettable. As in ""Law and Order"", the movie is boring. If the duo copes well, the fault is on the story and the directing. About the story, this cop/gangster is stupid because the cops find the crew easily when they are planning while they fail when the crew attacks. Worse, all the characters manage easily their jobs while they got problems with their relationships! About the directing, the scenes are slow and there are a lot of useless moments. If Mann forgot to go in editing room, i haven't forgotten my fast forward button on my remote. There are a few good moments (Natalie's scenes, Bob's trap, the last chase) but it's not enough and not worthy of 160 minutes! To close the case, the hair style is particularly hideous from Kilmer, to Bob, to Voight (who stays definitely in the bottom of supporting actors!)."

","I lasted about 90 minutes before turning off this nonsense.What had the makings of a decent cops and robbers film is totally ruined by too much talking, multiple sub plots, and a storyline I was unable to follow.It really ought to be perfectly possible with a decent cast to give us a semi believable and exciting story about robbers being pursued by cops, right? Wrong: What we get is being exposed to the exceedingly soap opera-ish private life of some of the main characters in this film. Boring, boring boring. This movie bears little resemblance to real life and is unrealistic. The picture goes on far too long. I would think it runs into thousands the times we get films about policemen who have families who resent the irregular hours the cop works and the difficulties their jobs cause to their home life etc etc and blah, blah, blah. Who cares.....as most people watch movies to be entertained and not to have to be tortured in viewing the tedious domestic lives of others. Incidentally: A good way to know if a movie is worth watching is to see what the critic Roger Ebert says about it. As a general rule if he raves over a film, then usually it ain't worth seeing. If he says its' not his taste, then take a look!<br/><br/>1/10"
"woodgree74","10","5","11","7 October 2005"," One of my Top Five
","This movie settles the score of who the better actor is, DeNiro or Pacino? Although both great actors only one can come out on top and be recognized for their outstanding performance in this one. The infamous scene where the two are face to face (rumored to be a split screen because the two can not work together) at the diner is where I feel the judgment can be made. I will let the viewers come upon their own conclusion, or maybe one can not be made, but I will say if you pay real close attention you will notice one of the two actors trips up on their words. Besides this scene, both performances are almost flawless ('nobody is perfect'). Each character in their own rights is content on winning and absolutely NOTHING will stop them; not love, friendship, or themselves. When I say 'themselves' I mean there personal/emotional problems, and they both have many, will not affect their goals.<br/><br/>The mentality of the two main characters, one of almost no regret no regard, trickles down to the whole supporting cast. The supporting cast could have not been put together better, I developed much respect for Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer after this movie. I would like to name the rest of the cast, because it is good, but these two stand out the most. While watching this movie imagine Kilmer as DeNiro's good son and Tom Sizemore as his wild child trying to learn DeNiro's flawless and seemingly simple routine criminal tactics. One gets himself in trouble.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is one of the best. I wish it were a top 10 because it deserves to be, but due to violence and the lack of a love story so many crave, it isn't.<br/><br/>Sit down and enjoy, don't plan to relax as this one is a quite a ride.

I'll admit that Pacino chewed the scenery to the point of caricature, that clichés abounded almost constantly, that characters that could have been better fleshed out were ignored in favour of the leads. It's flawed. But it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>I read a review once of Mann's being described as a ballet of violence. I feel like it's more like an opera.

They obviously agreed, but I wonder if part of the agreement was that the movie would be nearly three hours long? Must've been. <br/><br/>Pacino: ""It's my movie.""
De Niro: ""It's my movie.""
Mann: ""We'll give you both your own movie within the runtime of this one.""
Pacino and De Niro: ""OK.""<br/><br/>Even with Heat being a marathon of a movie it was still good. This was a high stakes cops and robbers movie with the leader of the cops, Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), trying to outsmart the robbers while the leader of the robbers, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), is trying to outsmart the cops. This heist movie worked because you had some big time actors and a plot that was intelligent without trying to be too clever. Both sides made some smart and shrewd moves without either of them being overly complicated and relying upon myriad of high tech plot devices. We got to see some skillful gamesmanship without there being a lot of players and a lot of moving parts.<br/><br/>And the story within the story was one of work vs. family. We got to see two sides of the main characters: De Niro, Pacino, and Kilmer. All had a work-life and a family-life and none knew how to balance the two. Whether it's the good guy or the bad guy; if you dedicate too much time to your work then your personal life will suffer. Sure, one of the guys' job was that of a lieutenant with the LAPD and the other two were professional thieves but amazingly their personal life troubles were remarkably similar and for the same reason.<br/><br/>Heat pitted two dedicated alpha males against one another and said ""fight"". You couldn't watch without picking a side but only one could be the winner."

","'Heat' is a long, epic crime film that pits two iconic Hollywood actors against each other in a game of cat and mouse. In a nearly three-hour runtime, it explores myriad sides of crime-the criminals, the police work, the sources on the street, and the strain these lifestyles put on everyone involved. It's an ambitious undertaking in which director Michael Mann opens many doors and closely all of them successfully in a deeply satisfying way. <br/><br/>Vincent (Pacino) is a workaholic police detective with a hard liquor habit, two failed marriages in his rearview and another likely in front of him. He doesn't want to burden his wife or anyone in his life that he cares about with the horrific events he witnesses at work on a daily basis, so he refuses to share particulars. But the lack of communication doesn't end there. He hardly shares anything with his wife, which makes her starved for attention and a deeper connection. <br/><br/>Neil (DeNiro) is cunning criminal who spent time in the clink and will do anything to avoid a return trip. His life motto is, ""never get attached to anything that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you feel the heat getting too close."" A philosophy that makes him successful as a criminal makes him a failure in any personal relationship. He's alone.<br/><br/>After a robbery gone wrong puts Neil on the police's radar, Vincent begins to investigate Neil and his team, looking to catch them in the act on their next job. As the two leading men match wits, it becomes increasingly clear that they're sharper than everyone else in the game. We get the sense that they're impressed with each other. There's a mutual respect, despite their obvious conflicting interests. <br/><br/>DeNiro plays the part with a brooding, quiet confidence, while Pacino opts for a more boisterous and manic persona. They're both equally entertaining, and they take turns delivering classic one liners that you'll be repeating for years. <br/><br/>These aren't the only actors of note in the film. This is a loaded cast that seems to showcase a new star every few minutes. Mann masterfully juggles all the pieces of the dense story universe he has created. The plot never drags, and the scenes are always memorable. Because of Mann's directing acumen and a lively script, the moments of conversation are as exciting as the action sequences. And, of course, every Michael Mann movie comes with distinctive, pulsing music.<br/><br/>'Heat' deserves to be recognized among the great crime films of the past 30 years. Even 23 years after its release, it still holds up in every way. If you're a fan of the genre, you absolutely must watch this movie."

","Michael Mann's Heat is quite possibly one of the BEST crime dramas in cinematic history. Mann puts in a lot of work to make this film feel authentic and real, while also telling a compelling story. Showing the unique contrast AND similarities of the lives of cops and criminals. The writing also does a fantastic job of fleshing out the main characters, almost to the point where you want to see BOTH sides succeed. Heat's gritty, realistic feel comes mostly from fantastic use of location in the city of Los Angeles and immaculate sound design that still blows me away today. It's a truly tansportive movie that tosses you right in the middle of the action, and it's absolutely riveting. The action sequences in Heat are filled with both tension and raw fiery that will give you goose bumps and make you feel anxious at the same time, which makes Heat one of the most entertaining movies you will ever see. A modern masterpiece that i watch at least twice a year. Highly recommend"

","Think about the best heist films, or mere scenes, that you've ever seen and look no further than this film as one of the chief inspirations for them. <a href=""/title/tt0113277/"">Heat (1995)</a>, the legendary crime-thriller film directed and written by <a href=""/name/nm0000520/"">Michael Mann</a> (<a href=""/title/tt0369339/"">Collateral (2004)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0140352/"">The Insider (1999)</a>), is a tour- de-force of direction, acting and creating an atmosphere of sheer anticipation. Perhaps most surprising is its zero Oscar nominations - easily could there have been nods for Best Picture, Lead/Supporting Actor/Actress, Director and Screenplay. <br/><br/>Since I have seen it, there has been one scene in particular that's stayed etched in my mind and I need not regurgitate its specifics here. But anyone whose seen it remembers that legendary scene when our hero and villain finally confront one another - it's a beautiful piece of on-screen acting and features a conversation whose subtext really defines the film in a nutshell; all these guys know is the jobs they've committed too, and they're both darn good at them. <br/><br/>""If it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna widow. Brother you are going down."" The story is certainly a complex one because there is an undeniable sense a comraderie between Lt. Hanna and Mccauley and yet they know the second they step out of that restaurant, they're each other's prey and target. One senses it's too late for either of these guys to get out before it's too late and that is really one of the themes of the film; at one point can one be able to walk away from all they know?<br/><br/>I ramble on about this scene but the entire film is a masterpiece of its type - compelling performances, a tightly-wrapped story and top-notch direction. There's meticulousness to how everyone operates and that craft is shown to near perfection - it's a nod to the pacing as well that the three hour run time feels closer to two. This is one of the greats in a superb decade for crime films."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","2 October 2017"," Only partially fulfills the premise
","""Heat"" is an American 3-hour(!) film from 1995, so this one had its 20th anniversary 2 years ago. It is perhaps the most known career effort by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Michael Mann, even if this one here did not receive any Academy Award noms, seemingly even did not win a single award despite of how big of a project it was. The latter is proved by the inclusion of lead actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino here, the probably finest Italian-Americans Hollywood has to offer and one thinks immediately of the Godfather sequel of course when mentioning these names. So the premise here really was gigantic as you could expect a big conflict/rivalry perhaps between these two actors as they play characters on the opposite side of the law. But sadly, it never lived up to the premise. One problem is that they have almost no screen time together and the other is that you also never really felt the connection between them as it was intended. Instead it feels like each of them has their own film in this one here dealing with their messed-up private lives and complicated professional lives at the same time. I also feel that a great deal of this could have been left out and the film never should have made it past the 150-minute mark, probably even less.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: I don't think that the two story lines were really that bad, but just that they never got the connection through really and the showdown at the end, even if it was among the best the film had to offer, cannot make me look beyond that like apparently the many did who voted this film for some reason into the IMDb top250. I also felt that Pacino had a moment here and there where he seemed to be overacting while De Niro's subtle approach had a bit of a lackluster tendency to it. And I usually like these two. A lot even in Bobby's case. So yeah, there are several flaws in here, most of all that the plot and subplots had far from enough quality for this massive runtime. If they intended this as some defining crime epic, then it really went wrong. Maybe a mini-series would have been the better choice, but of course those weren't as popular back then in the 90s as they are today. I give this one a thumbs-up, but just a cautious one and looking at cast and crew here, this was really one of the biggest missed movie opportunities from the 1990s. Pacino, De Niro and Mann as well all have many far better projects in their big bodies of work. Known supporting players like Kilmer, Levine, Portman or Voight also did not have the material to shine. You can watch it if you are a RdN/AP fan, but don't get your expectations up that much. If not, you can skip it too and you won't be missing too much."
"JamesHitchcock","5","2","3","26 June 2015"," Cop and Robber
","""Heat"" reunited Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for the first time since their starring roles in ""The Godfather Part II"", a film in which they never actually appeared on screen together. (They were later to act together again in ""Righteous Kill"" from 2008). Like both those films, this one is a crime drama; here the two stars play adversaries on opposite sides of the law. De Niro is Neil McCauley, a professional criminal who organises a security van heist in the course of which three guards are killed. Pacino plays Lt. Vincent Hanna, the L.A.P.D. detective charged with investigating the crime. The plot gets very tangled, so I will not attempt to summarise it any further.<br/><br/>The name ""Neil McCauley"" was taken from a real criminal on whom De Niro's character is partly based, although he was from Chicago rather than Los Angeles. The character of Hanna was based upon Chuck Adamson, the detective who tracked McCauley down. I wonder if the name ""Vincent Hanna"" was borrowed from the well-known British television journalist, who would still have been alive when this film was made in 1995. (He died in 1997). <br/><br/>Of the two big stars, Pacino is certainly the better. Hanna is quite a complex character; the film deals not only with his attempts to solve the crime but also with his problems in his private life. He already has two failed marriages under his belt and his third marriage is also troubled because the long hours he has to work, and his obsessive dedication to his job, are placing his relationship with his wife under strain. Pacino copes well with the difficulties of conveying the two sides of Hanna's personality, the dedicated, almost workaholic professional and the struggling family man. <br/><br/>I was not, however, so impressed by De Niro. After starring in films like ""Mean Streets"" and ""Godfather II"" in the seventies, he became almost synonymous with crime thrillers, and I am not convinced that this has always been to the benefit of his career. At his best he is, of course, one of the greatest actors working in the American cinema, but at times he can fall well below that best. It is notable than many of his best performances have come when he has tried something different in films like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""King of Comedy"", ""The Mission"" and ""The Fan"". Now most, perhaps all, of those films can be characterised as ""crime films"" in that they involve criminal acts committed either by De Niro's character or by someone else, but none of them fall into the standard ""gangster epic"" or ""cops and robbers"" formulae. When De Niro does appear in standard crime dramas it sometimes seems as if he is simply retreating back into his comfort zone where he does not need to try very hard.<br/><br/>That is precisely what happens in ""Heat"". His performance is not particularly bad, but it is mediocre, lacking the spark of brilliance which he can bring to those films which really stretch him and challenge him to do more than falling back on the tried and trusted. Also, his delivery is at times below par and I found it difficult to catch some of his lines. I never had that problem with Pacino. The one time De Niro really comes to life is in the scene where McCauley and Hanna meet in the coffee bar. While watching the film I felt this scene was a bit unrealistic, but in fact the real McCauley and Adamson did indeed once have such a meeting.<br/><br/>Heat was a commercial success, and was generally well received by the critics, but I can't say that it is a film that I cared for very much. My main complaint would be that at nearly three hours it was too long. Some will doubtless reply that the film needs to be this long to deal adequately with all the complexities of its plot, but it is these very complexities which are part of the problem. The film would have worked a lot better with a more straightforward storyline, fewer characters and greater concentration on the main McCauley/Hanna confrontation. 5/10"
"goodsoldier","Null","2","3","14 June 1999"," to say that i love this film, would be an understatement
","i must say that there are two things about this film which could have been either omitted or improved:  first, the pacino-deniro coffee shop scene is a big let-down.  the direction and script leave a lot to be desired, and it's to the credit of pacino and deniro's considerable acting talents that the scene manages to stay afloat.  two lesser actors would not have managed to save the scene.  secondly, the portrayal of the women as passive, servile, demure characters is a little disturbing, and though it was in the interest of the story that these characters were portrayed as such, a re-write or two could have done the women a little more justice, by giving them a backbone...<br/><br/>having said that, this is one of the best action films of the past ten years!  the truck heist scene that opens the film, the shootout in downtown l.a. to close the second act, and the climactic airport runway chase scene (reminiscent of the closing scene of peter yates' ""bullitt,"" starring steve mcqueen. hmm...) are pulse-raising, nearly heart-stopping fun!  the script is superbly researched and this shows in its clinical, detail-rich depiction of the activities of both cops and thieves.  the character development of the principals (women excluded, as stated above) is magnificent, and mann even goes so far as to develop minor characters (like dennis haysbert's short-order cook, donald breedan, or ted levine's bosko), so that when something happens to them (usually violent death), the audience cares.  so many times in films, characters are killed and the audience doesn't give a thought as to who they were or what they were about, simply because THE SCREENWRITER doesn't do it for the audience, as he or she should (hell, in ""star wars"" a whole planet is destroyed and all that happens is obi-wan kenobi gets woozy!  'disturbance in the force' my ass! talk about gratuitous violence!).  ""heat"" is not so much a film about ""what happens"" - in ""heat,"" you know what's going to happen.  the script treads on very familiar ground - but rather about ""how it happens.""  mann provides the audience with a lot of information about the latter.<br/><br/>finally, michael mann's visual sense, with the great dante spinotti's help, is breathtaking!  (c'mon!  anyone who can make a .45 on a glass table-top look sexy has good visual sense in my books!).  i own this film because i love it, and because it's a three-hour lesson in framing and composition.  there are shots in it that ""make me wanna holler,"" to quote the immortal marvin gaye.  the score is great, too, by the way!  i own it as well.<br/><br/>c"

","Everyone needs to watch this movie. Its an exploration of men, of the choices we make in life, and of relationships.
What I loved about this movie is that it wasn't just a crime movie with really cool heists without depth to the characters, it went way beyond that. it was about these realistic character's, what they value, their pursuits, and most importantly dysfunctional ways they form bonds with others. The movie explored several family/romantic dynamics in ways that I think was beautiful and so profoundly human.
it explores several questions and here of course their dilemmas are amplified due to the extreme lifestyles of criminals and cops. Your job or your family? As in the case of Vincent whose job is to prioritize other people's lives and save them so is it okay to give it his all? . Also, the dilemma how far do you go for your personal pursuit and goals? Does Vincent's end goal excuse his methods? When you are passionate about a goal how dedicated can you be before you are labeled obsessed or it becomes unhealthy?
I loved Niels. He was portrayed perfectly and got me thinking about the question of how far is a person willing to go for the ones he loves? Can a woman ""change"" a man? At what point do you choose yourself?
Major theme: Individualism vs the need for companionship
Sometimes you must leave people behind in pursuit of your own self, is that selfish?
At the end of the movie the choices they made were in line with who they were the whole movie and it ended exactly as it should have been. I liked this specially because the movie wasn't a cliché, at the ending no one acted ""out of character"" to get surprisingly this great oh everyone formed a family and was happy every after."

","It's not a secret, that Michael Mann's 'Heat' (1995) and other movies were a great influence on Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' (2008). The 'Heat' is a long movie that requires patience. One can call it a telephoto movie, as the frames are wide open and the background is compressed. That's how Michael Mann made sure that viewers grasp the city as a character too. Personally, I love the telephoto movies; they give you the liberty to absorb more details from the environment of the scenes, my favorite one is 'Foxcatcher' (2014), shot on 35mm/16:9 frame.<br/><br/>Apart from the visual style and bluish impression, there are some obvious parallels between the 'Heat' and 'The Dark Knight'; the famous bank robbery scene and a face to face confrontation of the hero and villain, where for the few moments they are like the two different faces of a same coin. The dialogue in the 'Heat' is;<br/><br/>HANNA - ""My life's a disaster zone.  I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage. My third. Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.""<br/><br/>NEIL - ""A guy told me one time: Don't get attached to anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds, if you feel the heat around the corner. So if you're chasing me and you gotta move when I move, how do you expect to keep a family?""<br/><br/>Here, a skilled and sophisticated criminal Neil sets a rule of no personal attachments, while Lieutenant Hanna is trapped between his family life and the police life. One can draw its parallel with 'The Dark Knight', where Batman seeks an alternative of himself, so that he can also have a personal life he has been sacrificing for the Gotham."
"RagingDraugr","8","1","1","1 August 2019"," Crime has (almost) never looked so good.
","A film so successful in its execution and, well...success, that it has been parodied and referenced to no end, in other heist films, in video games like the Grand Theft Auto series and even, arguably, real life. The film has been cited and blamed for real world robberies - most notably, the 1997 North Hollywood shootout. Whether or not it's impact was substantial enough for full-blown blame is up for debate. But it still goes to show just how far reaching the influence of Heat is.<br/><br/>Now, I don't revere this film as much as other people might do. It's still great, don't get me wrong - it does a good job of managing its near three hour runtime, the brutality and realism of the famous shootout heist-gone-wrong scene is top notch and of course, the highlight of the entire film for me is the chemistry between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters which is showcased brilliantly in the coffee shop scene where this understated, soft music plays and then culminates into a more ominous moment where, though they share immense mutual respect between them, if it comes to it...they will both try to kill the other. And that scene is only part of the reason why this film is so acclaimed. There's also the romance between Robert De Niro's character and Eady, which is surprisingly touching, but much like the rest of the film, it has a tinge of darkness and sombreness to it when Eady discovers that Neil (De Niro) is a criminal and that she was blinded by her love and naivety. Finally, the way Heat demonstrates how easily and quickly criminal organisations can crumble is simple but effectively executed, where one mistake becomes the entire crew's downfall...leading to the death of Neil which, much like his romance, has heart to it with Al Pacino holding his hand as he passes on. It's a bit sappy, sure, but it works.<br/><br/>The only major thing I can think of that I didn't like as much about it was the cinematography. It's serviceable, and does its job well...and if the film is of a high enough quality level like this one, it shouldn't matter that the cinematography isn't perfection incarnate. And besides, there's some interesting things Michael Mann does with lighting and shadows which especially comes into play in the tense climax at the end of the film. I just think it's one of Heat's weaker elements, as there isn't a whole lot that was particularly striking about it, taking everything into consideration."

It's that one line ""Never let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" It explores a problem almost everyone deals with, trust and commitment. Neil believes that having the slightest attachment to anyone will be his destruction. But when he meets Eady, he breaks the one rule he should have followed. It's the irony that keeps my attention after numerous times of watching Heat.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","1","1","2 May 2019"," An excellent 2-hour action film set within a nearly 3-hour movie.
","It's interesting to go back and watch something by Michael Mann after seeing his later work. I enjoyed Collateral (2004) and considered it to be a well-directed film. Of course, there's deliberate pacing and acceleration of Collateral that drew me in. Unfortunately, this biased me somewhat when I sat down to watch Heat (1995). Stylistically, both are fairly similar and use similar locales. However, at almost three hours long, some of the pacing in Heat made me think that it could have used a bit of a trim in the first half.<br/><br/>I understand the deliberate nature of the buildup of the first half, with each event introducing some core tenet of the main characters that come to fruition by the end of the film. It helps that there's a good bit of action early on, but until the twist that happens about half-way through occurs, the comparison to the pacing of the second half makes the early part of this movie feel like molasses. Heck, I'd probably just show the action scene that starts the film, then jump to the twist and have the rest proceed as normal. That way I'd trim the running time down by a good 30-45 minutes and tighten the pacing.<br/><br/>Fortunately, with actors like Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino (with perhaps one of the best lines he's ever yelled residing in this film), Heat is a great action film with huge payoff. The shootout mid-way through the film is perhaps one of the best I've ever seen committed to film. Additionally, the ending is a tour-de-force that pulls the trigger on all the little bits of foreshadowing to create a satisfying conclusion by the time the credits inevitably roll. Maybe Heat is no Collateral, but it's certainly worth the time to watch, regardless.<br/><br/>An excellent 2-hour action film set within a nearly 3-hour movie, I give Heat 4.0 stars out of 5."

","What i liked the most about this movie is how it showed us the other sode of the main charecters' lives, they are not just criminals or cops, they are humen, who love and get loved, get betrayed and hurt.
The second half of the film (from the bank robbery scene)is amazing, and the shooting scene between the gang and police is probably one of the best of this kind ever made.
Al Pacino an De Niro were really good, especially for Pacino who had some GREAT moments.
The only two things that i didn't like are the weird background music, and the final scene which was overdone and unnecessarily over dramatic."

","""Heat"" makes me feel I am Robert de Niro for a minute. It gives me an instant of illusion that I could be Al Pacino as well. I can be a hero for a minute: cool, calm and collected.Isnt that the greatest thrill!<br/><br/>What is it that makes ""Heat"" especially stand out above all the other gangster flicks? In short: the true to life depiction of heists and gun fights. They are truly riveting, like I havent seen the equal of over the last decades. I would dare to say, that ""Heat"" has one of the ultimate gun fights ever recorded on the silver screen. It is filmed in a way that gives me the impression that I was there, right smack in the middle of it, because the PHOTOGRAPHY IS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT!<br/><br/>But the acting performances by Al Pacino and Robert de Niro are ofcourse the real reason why everybody wants to see this movie. They both act truly magnificent! ""Heat"" will be looked upon in movie history as THE ultimate ""battle"" between Robert de Niro and Al Pacino, because these 2 legends had never acted together before in 1995.<br/><br/>The story in short: Detective Al Pacino is trying to catch gangster Robert de Niro for a big crime he is about to commit. Both detective and gangster are lone souls, destined to loneliness forever, only to find solace in the company of each other, however hard they try to destroy each other as well. That is the bitter irony of this story.<br/><br/>Almost clocking at 3 hours, this thriller is a contineously fueled adrenaline shot. Director Michael Mann's best work. Worthy of many rewatches, because this movie still stands strong, decades after having been made. Terrific music score as well and I mean really haunting and mesmirising music, often conjuring up ambiances which truly lift this movie up to an even higher level. One of the best gangster classics in American cinema!"

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>Heat is the pressure robbers feel when they sense the cops are on their tail that tickles their intuition telling them they should abort a heist. The film kicks off explosively with a tight group a robbers executing an armored truck heist lead by DeNiro. Pacino heads the detective unit who are quickly on the scene and will play an escalating cat and mouse game to try and catch them in the act. Much of the film is also an introspective look at the personal life of this crew and how they manage a family or how they deal with being alone. Additionally, while Pacino is laser focused on his job, his personal life suffers. Enjoy the rare Pacino and DeNiro duo as they try to outfox each other and see if either of them will be able to give up the life they live when opportunities arise. The film's tone is no nonsense with acting as the main focus. Mediocre cinematography yet has a couple outstanding shoot 'em up scenes."

Many of the heist scenes are echoed in TDK, which goes to show how effective the scenes are. <br/><br/>It is these scenes as well as the investigative scenes from Pacino's character Lt. Hanna that carry the film. The personal life backstories of the main characters are necessary in moving the plot forward and creating an ideological struggle in each person's mind, but they are not what make the film memorable, particularly the angle on Neil, De Niro's character. <br/><br/>Yet I will remember Heat mainly by the way it is carried by De Niro and Pacino, two world-class actors who balance and complement each other perfectly throughout the film, even when they don't share screen time.

","I somehow missed this movie back in the 1990s when it was popular. Recently my public library bought the BluRay version and that is what I watched. It is filled with first-rate actors and for the most part is a very gripping police and crime drama.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is Lt. Vincent Hanna, very dedicated and focused on catching crooks and putting them away. His main nemesis is Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, the leader of a well-organized band of big- time robbers. Among his gang are Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis, and Tom Sizemore as Michael Cheritto. A fixer, the kind of person who can make connections and get fake credentials is Jon Voight as Nate. <br/><br/>All of them are good but the real focus of the movie are the Pacino and De Niro characters. In fact about half-way they meet face-to- face in a restaurant, each makes it known to the other that they intend to accomplish their missions, and we know both can't succeed.<br/><br/>Also good are the ladies, Diane Venora as Justine Hanna, the wife who has a hard time coping with her husband's duties. And Amy Brenneman as Eady, who McCauley falls for, making his exit more difficult.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The big bank heist at the end, where the robbers carry out several large cases of paper money, is almost foiled but in a massive (and unrealistic) shootout in the street the robbers manage to get away. But Hanna is still looking to find an informant, he is certain that the crooks have a plan to leave L.A. for parts unknown. But when he gets the clue there is a showdown at the LAX airport, as a plane is landing shadows reveal McCauley allowing Hanna to shoot him. His vow of never going back to prison comes true."

You have some great talent in the supporting cast, Sizemore, Voight, Noonan. Kilmer, etc. You have one of the best bad guys ever in Waingro (Kevin Gage). Coordinating these brillinat actors together is one of the greatest directors of our time, Michael Mann. Brilliant dialog, direction, choreography, cinematography, etc.<br/><br/>The movie centers around the relationship between ""cops"" and ""robbers."" Mann shows us just how close these two groups are to one another. After all, if you devote your whole life to staking these robbers out, thinking like them and investigating them, you are in reality, living their life. Pacino's character is consumed with busting guys that ""take down scores."" His marriages collapse, his personal life is non-existant. Moreover, the robbers live an almost identical existance. They plot and plan and steal. Living for the score. This movie shows you that criminals do live by a code and cops get off on the action just as much as the cons.<br/><br/>The real strength of this film is the great story and dialog provided by Mann. He used hours and hours of prison interviews to get ""con literate."" The result is dialog that is real and a story that is all too plausible. In fact, several bank heists were directly inspired by the events portrayed in this film. Now this is not a good thing, but does show just how on the ball Mann was in his script. **** out of ****."

","In Los Angeles, a gang of armed thieves is hitting serious targets - major banks, vaults, and armored cars. These thieves are led by arch-criminal Neal MacAuley. One of their operations, an armored-car robbery, goes bad and the armored-car guards are murdered by the gunmen - putting LAPD homicide detective Vince Hanna on the trail of the thieves. Hanna knows it will take a lot to bring these dangerous, armed thieves down, and it will end in a horrifying gun battle when the thieves try to rob a major federal bank... Heat is a pretentious and overrated crime thriller. I don't know about 1995 but as of today, the film fails to impress. The fact that Heat is hold as one of the best thrillers of all time is a joke. Michael Mann, himself, has done much better thrillers that don't have half the fame of Heat, like Collateral and Miami Vice for instance. First of all, the film seems to put all its chips in the reunion of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino instead of being an exciting thriller with a proper story and good writing. Good actors don't make a good film, it's as simple as that. The plot is convoluted, shallow and empty, and the side stories thrown in, like Pacino's suicidal stepdaughter and a gang member that turns out to be a serial rapist/murderer on the side are uninteresting and contrived. Plus, the action sequences are completely unrealistic with the thieves killing several cops and escaping despite being surrounded and completely outnumbered. Roberto De Niro was actually enjoyable as the gang leader Neal MacAuley, but he didn't have much room to expand or develop the character thanks to a mediocre script. On the other hand, Al Pacino, who I enjoyed in other films, was a huge disappointment. He was constantly trying too hard and had no sense of subtlety, he just screamed and yelled his lines without any real purpose. Val Kilmer, John Voigh, the great William Fichtner and a very young Natalie Portman, all had too little screen time to even comment on their performances. Another big problem, was the run time. The film drags and drags clocking at an amazing 170 minutes, almost 3 hours, when the story could have been easily told in 90 minutes or so. Overall, Heat is a mediocre thriller with a poorly written script that has gained much fame, only because, it stars two of the most well-known actors in Hollywood.<br/><br/>5/10"
"pfgpowell-1","4","5","12","28 July 2008"," There's less to this than meets the eye
","It seems almost churlish to say so given the big movie names involved  Pacino, De Niro and Michael Mann, but, depending on what you want from a film, Heat, isn't really that good. As usual here in IMDb reviews it gets both 10/10 an just 1/10. Well, both are off mark. I have given it 4/10 because  well  as a movie spectacle it does the business and then some. The trouble is that Mann apparently wanted to make more than just a intelligent crook v an intelligent cop movie. Mann wanted to inject meaning. Well, he hasn't unless you're the kind of guy or gal who thinks that your average R&B pop video is meaningful. That's not to say, of course, that this is merely on the level of such a video, only that it has the same spurious significance. The usual cliché is that you often have to suspend disbelief to enjoy a tale, and Heat demands that a lot of disbelief is suspend. For one thing there is no back story: we are presented with a range of characters and must either accept them or not. But how did De Niro, portrayed as rather an intelligent cove get into crime when undoubtedly his intelligence and character would have made him a success in many more legitimate areas. On the other hand, he is remarkably ruthless, is apparently incapable of forming relationships (until he meets a girl who he thinks might be 'it'), and can see himself pursuing no other career than crime. Then there's Pacino: wedded to the job, his third marriage going down the pan, the man is an interesting case history. But no explanation is offered as to why this should be. Well, you might say, none is needed. Just accept those two characters and enjoy the action. In that case, why does Mann introduce the theme of relationship, their hold over us, their strength, their weaknesses? What was needed was another film which would examine that theme at length  but then Mann would not have had his action movie. So if that is what you want, enjoy it. But don't be taken in by the faux philosophical nature of the movie."

Also Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi and Dennis Haysbert appear in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Big, sprawling cops and robbers drama. There are multiple story lines and all the characters are fully realized individuals. The acting is great across the board (except for Kilmer). There was a lot made of this film because of the 8 minute sequence in which De Niro and Pacino face off verbally against each other. They're both great and the sequence is crucial to their characters--but it isn't particularly well-written. Still this might be the only time we'll ever see the two together on screen (They both starred in ""The Godfather Part II"" but shared no scenes).<br/><br/>The movie is well-directed with constant close-ups (for some reason) and shot in washed out color with some truly incredible gun fights (the last one is just jaw dropping). An ALMOST great movie.<br/><br/>There are problems. There are too many story lines and the film becomes quite convoluted towards the end. For example--a subplot between Pacino and his stepdaughter comes up, disappears and pops in out of NOWHERE at the end. Also the film is much too long at 3 hours. This worked great in a theatre in wide screen and ear-shattering stereo (the gun shots went right through you). It doesn't work as well on TV. Also avoid the edited for TV version which cuts out about FORTY minutes rendering the film incomprehensible. Worth watching...but it should have been tightened a little."

","Interestingly this is a remake of a TV movie by the same director made only 6 or 7 years previous.

In my opinion it is also one of the best films ever brought to the screen.<br/><br/>The amazing cast includes as already mentioned Al Pacino and Robert De Niro plus Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Wes Studi and Dennis Haysbert. Not only is the cast almost dream like on paper but also all put in great performances (in many cases personal bests).<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays Lt Vincent Hanna, an LA detective who is passionate about his work to the point he is unable to keep a satisfactory personal life running as well. His performance is very powerful and at times almost bordering on over the top but this fits the character well. De Niro arguably out does Pacino with his brilliantly understated performance as Hanna's nemesis - thief Neil McCauley. This is easily De Niro's best performance in years - the realism of his character is amazing. Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a member of McCauley's gang and gives a solid performance supporting the two key stars. As I say all the cast put in a great performance but it is worth mentioning Natalie Portman's early role as Hanna's troubled step daughter Lauren Gustafson, it shows why she has become such a big star since.<br/><br/>Director/writer Michael Mann shows this must truly have been a labour of love. Every detail from character development to photography and music is spot on. The film has the audacity to be one of the most well acted and written drama's and yet also include possibly the greatest shoot out scene ever seen.<br/><br/>If you watch just one cops and robbers movie in your time, make sure this is the one."

"tastyhotdogs","9","4","9","8 October 2005"," Best movie ever!
","20 reasons why ""Heat"" is the best movie ever<br/><br/>1- Best cast for a movie ever. How's this for a cast: Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brennemann, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Tone Loc, Jeremy Piven, Mykelti (I have the coolest voice ever) Williamson, WIlliam Fichtner<br/><br/>2- Love movies where the main character can beat up people twice their size, in this case Neil McCauley beating up Wayne Gro a few times and Henry Rollins. Close runner up would be Ed Norton beating up DeNiro's bodyguard in ""The Score""<br/><br/>3- Pacino explaining the first crime scene. It's so good you can overlook the amount of things he says that would be obvious to cops but not to us, the naive viewer (the exits, how they knew the average police response time etc). Not done as well in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" when scientists explain basic weather information that many movie goers wouldn't know. It would be like in ""Rocky"" if the trainer said ""Hey Rock, you gotta knock him out before the 12th because that's when the fight ends"".<br/><br/>4. Al Pacino never saying ""goodbye"" or ""ok"" to end phone calls. Looks so cool just hanging up at the time you feel like it. I tried it a few times on friends but they no longer talk to me so my technique obviously needs some work.<br/><br/>5. Neil McCauley's routine to pick up Eady at the bar. If you've never gotten a date, try this.<br/><br/>6. Al Pacino's couple of screaming rants. Bill Simmons said about Pacino is his piece on DeNiro v Pacino that all of his characters in the last 10 years have basically been like the one he plays in ""Scent of a Woman"". Lots of silly yelling and screaming. The best one in this movie is probably ""Gimme all you got!"" in his ridiculous conversation with Albert.<br/><br/>7. The cameos in this movie. The best ones being Henry Rollins , Jeremy Piven and Tone Loc.<br/><br/>8. The quote: ""Have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat coming around the corner""<br/><br/>9. How creepy the diner manager is. He'd be awesome in ""My Restaurant Rules""<br/><br/>10. When has the ""cop pursuing likable criminal"" not worked? My second favorite movie of all-time is ""The Fugitive"", so. Even ""US Marshalls"" is watchable purely on this premise. Oh hang on, theory ruined, I forgot about the Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones one, ""Double Jeopardy"".<br/><br/>11. Another McCauley quote ""I'm talking to an empty phone...There's a dead man on the end of this line."" Try it on a telemarketer sometime for a laugh.<br/><br/>12. Vincent Hanna talking to Kate about why he doesn't talk talk about his work. Great Pacino work. She holds her own too, except that haircut ruined her character for me.<br/><br/>13. The fact the movie seems to be around bank robbers but really is all about relationships. Watch from about the 56min mark for 10 minutes and see how it goes right into them. The movie has them all. The dead relationship between Kate and Vince, the blossoming relationship between Neil and Eady, the roller coaster ride of Chris and Charley and lots more.<br/><br/>14. One of the few action movies with cops ever where no-one over rides the man in charge's orders. It's pretty much a staple of cop movies these days. See ""The Negotiator"" and ""Con Air"" for the worst offenders.<br/><br/>15. Pacino quote: ""Who..Who...What are you a %$^&*( owl?""<br/><br/>16. Neil's suit.<br/><br/>17. ""The Scene"" with Vincent and Neil having a chat over coffee. Both guys are almost having an ""act-off"" (like the ""walk off"" in Zoolander). Forget Shakespeare, aspiring actors should watch and rehearse a role from this scene and they'll be set for a huge career.<br/><br/>18. Pacino Quote: ""I'm very angry, Ralph""<br/><br/>19. The directing of Michael Mann. Visually stunning movie.<br/><br/>20. The Shooutout. Awesome cinema. Once again, look past the fact the layout is absolutely ridiculous (see Kilmer standing in between two ends of wall to wall cops and shooting one way and then the other)"

Ultimately Heat frustrates because you see what it could have been. It has a terrific cast and what should have been a terrific story if only it was told better.<br/><br/>Of course the vast majority of hype which surrounded Heat concerned the two lead actors. Robert De Niro plays Neil McCauley, who leads a group of professional thieves in Los Angeles. Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna who is the lead investigator on McCauley's trail. De Niro's performance is reliably brilliant. He is undoubtedly the best thing this move has to offer. He shows how subtlety can be a great asset for an actor, something Pacino apparently forgot somewhere along the way. Pacino's Vincent is a guy who goes through life screaming things at the top of his lungs for no good reason and this act gets really tired really quickly. Perhaps not coincidentally the only time in the whole film that Pacino comes back down to Earth is when he's seated across a table from De Niro. Robert De Niro, a calming influence? Who'd have ever thought it? The rest of the cast is littered with big names who have nothing much to do besides watch De Niro scheme and Pacino scream. Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria...they're all here. But we never really get to know much of anything about their characters. It's De Niro and Pacino, Pacino and De Niro, all the time. Whenever De Niro or Pacino isn't on the screen it feels as if the movie is just killing time. When these other lesser characters see their respective stories ultimately play out it's hard not to think, ""OK, whatever, I don't really care what happened to them anyway. What are De Niro and Pacino up to?"" From its beginning, through its slow, plodding middle and all the way up to its inevitable conclusion Heat is all about Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Maybe if Pacino could have toned down his act and the film didn't take so long to get where you know it was going all along, that wouldn't have been such a bad thing."

","Michael Mann's western ""The Last of the Mohicans"" frustratingly told a complex story (that of the settlement of America) with a black-and-white vision of good and bad.  In ""Heat"", he performs the reverse trick, and in a story of a brutal mass murderer and a policeman, tries to assert the moral that they're really both the same.  It doesn't convince in this convoluted, but essentially shallow film, in which even deNiro and Pacino fail to do much more than fill out familiar outlines; the fault in part lying in the degree of respect that Mann accords both stars. Neither wholly realistic nor truly slick; ""Heat"" holds the attention but little more, nothing really sparks except for a ludicrously over-the-top gun battle of which Peckinpah might have been proud.  For a really great movie in a similar genre, watch and compare to ""The French Connection"", 25 years older but lean, taut and merciless; ""Heat"" adds nothing new except for sentiment and flab."
"chadlund","2","3","6","18 May 2018"," Outsmarting vilains
","This is probably one of the most far-fetched movies and wasted casts of all time. It starts with a heavy heist, spectacular but right from the beginning, you can tell that this picture is going to out-smart itself, with cheesy soundtrack and ridiculous slow pace. The whole theme of the movie, is let's make these vilains so damn smart, let's show how intelligent they are and let's make sure the cops repeat it 15 times so that the viewer gets it....BORING ! <br/><br/>Why would a team of gangsters hire somebody off the street they never worked with until the last moment ? And why wouldn't McCauley just gun down the other thief in the van and get rid of him, instead of trying to pay him his share TO THEN kill him in the middle of a parking lot ??? Where is the sense in that ! Why give him a meeting in a cafe, give him his money but then plan to kill him ? Oh my goodness this makes no sense at all. For a gang of pros they really know how to screw up like amateurs if this is going to be the theme. And then the cops, they start off as a team of tools, who can't get any information by their own department but need cons on parole or ex jail birds and check this out, Vincent schedules a meeting with Albert an informant who for some reason has his brother coming into town (why would Vincent agree to visit his brother anyway?) from Phoenix and he holds some really special information about the current case he's investigating. Wow, just like that, an outsider from Phoenix knows exactly the authors of a big heist by lucky fortune because he once met an ex-jail bird in custody, right in the middle of some street. Who wrote this script ? This is bad, this is far fetched, this is a draft, this is not a script. How can the police or the FBI not have a list of cons working in a perimeter instead of going through informants who's dialogues make no sense ! Man this is the way to make Police look absolutely useless. <br/><br/>So just like that by recognizing the word ""slick"", the LAPD then manages to identify several gang members without really revealing it to us, considering how appalling they are we have our doubts. But even with a team spying on them the gangsters still manage to outsmart the cops by spying on them as well !<br/><br/>But there are too many shortcuts in this movie, I don't understand how the Police suddenly gets the bank heist information at the last minute, gets there in time and then not just fire one gun shot but at least a thousand of them in the middle of the street (lucky pedestrians) from some narcotic agent who turned heel, makes no sense to me, and they still lose out on the two criminals. Never understood the diner scene and the confrontation, especially to talk about nothing and a cop trying to convince a criminal not to commit a crime like that makes sense. Why does the gang who seemed so determined to kill Waingro forget him for so long and how the hell does he get Trejo's adresse ?But the shooting is the most outrageous scene of all, there is no way that the police can risk flying bullets and crossfiring kill pedestrians in the middle of a gun-shooting -- just let the criminals go and sacked them in a turn or whatever but don't stand there stray fire impulsively, this is absolutely ill-advised. This scene is completely nuts. If you did not secure the perimeter before it is impossible to get into this kind of a shooting, this is cowboy stuff, not to mention the moment where Vincent shoots Cerrito holding a little girl hostage in the head. <br/><br/>And even after that scene, there's still a good 45 min, the movie is way too long, doesn't move fast enough, lingers too much on useless dialogues that get the story nowhere, the scene with the new-boyfriend watching the TV and the suicide girl I mean who cares when you're 2hrs30min in the movie just get it going ! The structuration of the script is completely wrong, these scenes do not add anything to the picture and especially not at the climax of the script !And the ending ends exactly like the whole movie is, far-fetched, a final chase where Pacino has legs of a 30 year old in the body of a 55 year old and shares a fraternal truce with McCauley, it's just not good at all. This whole theme of outsmarting vilains and making them look more glamor than they are is quite lame and uninteresting. Too bad, a lot of good actors, could have projected something so much better."

","Wow. While the basic plot is nothing complicated, it is one of the most well executed movies of all time. The acting of everybody involved is superb. Every single key character is meaningful and presented in such a way that you become emotionally invested in all of them, good or bad. And the distinction between ""good"" and ""bad"" is very blurry line here - the main ""bad"" guy is intelligent, loyal, dedicated, gentle, insightful, respectful - all whilst being a ruthless criminal capable of delivering merciless high order violence at a moment's notice. The ""good"" guy is obsessive, emotionally dysfunctional, and incapable of seeing the train wreck which is his stepdaughter's life until it hits him in the face.<br/><br/>The visuals are fantastic, the music excellent. The scenes where Pacino and DeNiro interact really show these two actors at their best. And the action scenes are some of the most intense and realistic in any movie - the actors were clearly provided with outstanding training and choreography for these scenes.<br/><br/>In short, this is a masterpiece. Michael Mann at his absolute best."

","WOW! I wasn't expecting anything like that. I kept ignoring Heat for quite some time. This is a movie with no flaws, nothing is fake here, nothing rushed. Thrilling and chilling atmosphere from the start 'till the end. Where do I even start? From a 2h 50m long movie you'd normally expect some boring moments or silly, out of place humor to compensate that. But there were non. Pacing was incredibly accurate.<br/><br/>The plot is generic and simple: two men from opposite sides of the law collide with each other. Those men are played by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro and they are at the top of their game (both actors and characters). Unlike many other movies we're not only told that they are good, we're shown! Each of them demonstrate why they are the best. Both crafted well and intriguing. All side characters are perfectly placed. It's a very risky move for a 3 hours long movie to take itself that seriously from the start to finish, but I think it paid off. And what a great casting choice, Al Pacino and De Niro both are very dedicated to their roles, they are not relying on their reputations.<br/><br/>Other than great acting, storytelling, crafting a tension, pacing. There were 2 elements that elevated this movie to become a masterpiece: cinematography and score. Both are incredibly rich. Both are amazing by their own and when they unite with all those classy elements of the movie: THEY CREATE ART! This movie respects it's audience and never cheats.<br/><br/>Best way to watch: spare some free time, get comfortable on the couch, be sure that you wont get disturbed. This is not an action movie that you watch with friends while chatting. This is not a background movie. This is intense."

","'Heat' is one of these films that tried hard at being an epic. It's pretentiously long running just under THREE HOURS, and is really nothing, and I do mean nothing more than another fine action-crime drama type film that depicts the innerworkings of gangsters with their plans for heists, vs the good guy coppers. It tries hard to produce a stage for De Niro vs Pacino, the evilly motivated but likable scum vs the very flawed but ultimately good guy, and of course they meet before the climactic ending and share and manifest a mutual respect for each other, how of course they are not so different in the end, that old chorus... but although, again, this film lets itself watched, even despite the very lengthy runtime, it's too much a caricature of what it sets out to do with very little intelligence in subtly, originality or reinvention at all. The women/family of the protagonists are just filler to add more matter to the plot and runtime, and although they highlight aspects of the main lead characters' personalities they are just as ordinary and unspecial as them, and the entire film. Good action scenes, a fine crime movie, but nothing more, really."

","Take out all the relationship nonsense, and you'd have a decent action film. Take out the ""false"" symmetry between Hanna and Mccauley. One is a police officer, the other is criminal scum. I found this equivocation that goes on in the movie seriously offensive. They're not opposite sides of the same coin. One tries to save lives, the other is a criminal scumbag. The whole coffee scene is so stupid. Here's a guy who's indirectly responsible for the deaths of cops. And Pacino treats him like some long lost brother... what is with the respect Pacino is giving De Niro in this scene. Oh but some guy slept with his wife without knowing she was married and he goes all nuts on him. What kind of cop is he? <br/><br/>The female characters in this film are so annoying. The whole Eady romance was forced... Her reaction to learning what Mccauley does is pitiful. You're a criminal scumbag, but I love you anyway because we just met and I'm lonely... so I will run away with you. What is up with Justine's character? just looking to start arguments with Hanna for no reason... the guy's a police officer and doesn't want to talk about his work. is that so unacceptable?<br/><br/>Convenient plot points in this film: How Mccauley just lets Waingro escape. How there's an ex-con getaway driver right at the diner where they're hanging out. The movie hinges on the word 'slick'. The police letting Val Kilmer getting away at the end.<br/><br/>Really unnecessary subplots: 1. stepdaughter's suicide. 2. getaway driver's story. <br/><br/>Not worth 3 hrs.

","Heat is not above criticism. I've put off reviewing this film for a long time as I know any negative comments will provoke an angry response from people who are blind to any faults. It's a good film, but it is far from perfect.<br/><br/>Pacino and DeNiro are cop and crook who go head-to-head over a major heist. They have many similarities, and could otherwise have been friends, only they are on opposite sides of the same coin - both cerebral, cunning, and crafty. Attempts at juxtaposing their lives come across as a little indulgent, but it's a crime epic, with lots of characters and cameos, so the running time has to be filled-up with something.<br/><br/>I just wish the dialogue wasn't so clipped and the editing so inconsistent. The movie has a naturalistic feel, meaning a lot words sound mumbled, and characters seems to come and go with no orientation given to the viewer. I am not saying that Michael Mann should pander to all audiences and dumb down the material, but a middle ground could have been found.<br/><br/>Mann shoots LA with wide-open empty spaces and stays high above the city for the most part, giving it a cold, alienating feel. Dante Spinotti's photography is raw and filter-free, and all locations are real with not a single soundstage used (although there are a couple of obvious green screen shots). It gives you a view of LA not typically seen in movies.<br/><br/>For a 170-minute it doesn't pay-off much considering the talent. There is a great 125-minute movie desperate to get out of Heat. The movie as it is has a lot of fat and you'll have to endure it if you want to see what all the fuss is about."

","Heat certainly sports an amazing cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Dennis Haylsbert, Amy Brenneman, Ted Levine, and Tom Sizemore. Top drawer all the way, and directed by Michael Mann, who knows something about action movies.<br/><br/>Despite this, Heat managed, for this viewer, to be about forty minutes too long (the version I saw was nearly three hours) and slow.<br/><br/>The story concerns two dedicated men: Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and Neil McCauley (De Niro). One is on the side of the law, and the other is a master criminal who has pulled off some amazing heists.<br/><br/>Neil and his team target banks, vaults, and armored cars. When there's a problem on one of the jobs, the police finally has a clue and the robbers begin to feel the heat. Vincent has to begrudgingly admire McCauley for his cleverness. The two men are similar: both are dedicated to their work at the expense of their private lives. Vincent is married to Justine (Venora), who has a troubled daughter (Portman). The marriage is on the rocks; Neil doesn't want to share his work with Justine, and is away on the job all the time and noncommunicative at home.<br/><br/>Neil has a philosophy, which is, 'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner.' He disapproves of one of his associates, Shiherlis (Kilmer) because he is married with a child. His wife (Judd) is unhappy because Shiherlis is a compulsive gambler and doesn't act like an adult. But when Neil meets Eady (Brennemen), he falls in love. The men plan one last big score, though the heat is becoming more intense.<br/><br/>I'm sure I will be criticized, but I didn't care for this film. At a length rivaling Gone with the Wind, the story could have been told in two hours. As it is, it's slow going. There are several gun fights, with bullets the size of rocks going through windshields, car bodies, and people on the streets of Los Angeles. After a while it became mind-numbing.<br/><br/>In New York City and I assume most big cities, the police can draw their guns, identify yourselves as officers, and pursue the suspects; I guess in Los Angeles it doesn't matter how many pedestrians and cars are around.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent -- it's hard to miss with a cast like this -- and it is exciting to see Pacino and DeNiro together. I just wish it had been in something else.<br/><br/>There are many positive reviews on this site. I'm curious as to how many of the positive reviews came from men. This is a man's movie all the way, from the behavior of the various women to the automatic weapons and explosions.<br/><br/>If the film had been shorter and tighter, I might have liked it better."
"Quinoa1984","10","3","6","25 June 2009"," pretty tight for a 3 hour crime epic
","Heat comes on TV, and you have see what scene is on. More than likely you'll get something really worth watching, sometimes for five minutes, other times for the whole running time. I was too young to see Heat in the theater, but soon after TV made it available. It's a film that takes to the professionals on both sides, and we have a great deal of empathy for both of them, for the tired but spot-on detective (Al Pacino) and, yes, even the ruthless criminal (Robert De Niro). Michael Mann's script is key, but it's a sense of the story, of the mood that all of those locations in Los Angeles brings, the streets, the little crevices, the diners, the architecture, the concrete and steel.<br/><br/>There's also philosophy to Heat. It may not be a deep essay like Godard, but who'd want, or perhaps expect, it to a big Hollywood production? It's simple: Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner. This is the stance the super tough and least vulnerable criminal mastermind in 90s American cinema Neil makes, and its potent enough to match up against the hard-line stance that a detective has with his prey. The plot moves at a good pace and the wheels keep going along and Mann has these powerhouse sequences here and there (most notably the big bank robbery that turns into a battle with machine guns on the street outside), and of course the cast is large and amazing throughout (a who's who from Val Kilmer to Natalie Portman to Danny Trejo to Wes Studi).<br/><br/>But what makes Heat endurable for such a long length aren't the actors but its substance. Mann's film is about something, about the conventions of cops and robbers, and that's what makes it work as well as it does. Sure, seeing a match-up of titans in that diner scene is enough to recommend it, but a combination of factors, of cast and direction and script, of danger and action and quiet moments, make it a kind of modern classic."

","There isn't much new to be said about ""Heat"". It's a solid, well paced film that satisfies the strong need for logic in a story that is human and poignant as well. Often I find myself unable to enjoy a film because some small plot hole unravels the point of the story. TDK has several plot holes that upon repeated viewings get more glaring, as well as pacing problems (I tend to feel exhausted by the joker is captured halfway through and just wish it were over). Heat does not have these problems. It is poetic and grounded. The only reason I haven't watched it a hundred times is that I enjoy it so much I like to live with my impressions of it between viewings.<br/><br/>""Collateral"" suffered from an all too convenient third act twist, that while being setup early on still felt too convenient. TDK definitely had some ""how the hell can you plan for this kind of thing"" moments when the Joker was pulling his social experiments. In this film, the rules apply throughout. No one is super-smart, or possessing of plot device powers. They're just good at what they do. Consequences are followed through in a very satisfying way that raises the question, why don't more script writers adhere to their own created world's inevitabilities when Mann can do it and make it supremely enjoyable? But then, not very many directors/writers have Mann's subtle and meticulous vision.<br/><br/>Sober is a good word for how Mann constructed this film. From start to finish, deviations from the plan only lead to failure. Every time the police get closer to catching the criminals, it's because someone deviated from the plan or stepped outside of the rules.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone that finds the common fair of bloated plot-hole riddled blockbusters dissatisfying. This is cinema at its best. Well paced and tense with poetry and poignancy."

The bottom line is ""this is as good as it gets, folks"". I thought it was perfect back in 1995. I watched it on DVD some twelve years later and that assessment hasn't changed.<br/><br/>So it's a cops and robbers film. You already know the plot. A crime happens. A cop pursues a criminal. There is a big confrontation at the end. You've seen it a thousand times.<br/><br/>But HEAT isn't about the ""what"". It's about the ""how"". How is was made, and how it was delivered. And to put it simply, the film is completely flawless. The acting is beyond breath-taking. Every scene is perfect.

","A classic hip thriller surrounding a world where crime lords run the show and cops can only try and keep up with the pace. ""walk out in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"" That's how the game is played. Criminals have to stay ahead of the heat and plan in advance to get away with whatever they can. First they strike an armoured van, then a bank heist. They do whatever they can, they are hi-tech and infinitely smart. Robert DeNiro is Niel McCauley the leader of a motley crew of criminals who think they're better than the law, and smarter than the cops. As the film goes on they get into bigger things, the heat gets turned up and they even begin to stalk the cops, not have the cops stalking them. But every game must have an ending, and even though DeNiro is on the verge of getting out, he can't help himself and so he begrudgingly gets back in on the business with the intention of killing a piece of scum killer who used to be a part of his gang. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna a top notch cop who wants nothing more than to bang up his nemesis, but cannot find enough evidence to support his case. But as DeNiro gets back in he takes an even bigger risk, that exposes him to the full force of the heat, and Pacino is ready for a final showdown. A showdown of courage, guns, and willpower. Honestly this film is brilliant, tense and taut and not form the faint hearted. It is nonetheless fantastic and even Val Kilmer's thrown in to add to the bang. Michael Mann shows flair in probably his best ever film. It is a long three hour epic, but it is also a great film to watch over and over again."

","First off I would like to say that Heat is one of the best drama films in a long time personally in that decade. Mann is a very talented man but all his films he made before heat were OK like Manhunter, The last of the Mohicans, Thief and his writing also in Miami Vice. I am not knocking him down and saying all the film before that were bad or not that good they where good and his writing has improved so much over his carrier its amazing. and his directing well thats been good to, But Heat is what I personally think is gonna to be one film a lot of people are gonna to remember him for I mean his screenplay was like a novel with a pulse the dialog was well written and the Chaterter Developmeant was beautiful I mean every person in that movie had everything in a chain circle and the way he made you have a felling towards Lt. Vincent Hanna (AL Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro)it wasn't like I was meant to favor one better then the other instead I learned what it was like to live both life's and what the Pro's and con's are.Now for Al Pacino this is one of his best movies after this His acting wasn't really that terrific granted he did a awesome job in Donnie Basco, and the Insider but man when he talked you knew he meant it when he was with his Wife, his co-workers, even with DE Niro stand in.I mean this man was on the ball and he knew how to deliver expression with the lines. Robert De Niro is an other actor who i think this was his last terrific film after this was what Analzie this and that give mean break When I saw De Niro come off that train in the intro I knew he meant business and he didn't have no born to lose tattoo to his chest. I mean his performance was right on the ball including when he talked to his pal's people and even Pacino's stand in. They were both solid actor's with a solid Script / Director. Let me tell you some what that one scene with De Niro and Pacino was like noting to describe it was perfect each person told about them self s and said to each other plain and simple this is what I do and this is how I plain to do it and nothing is going to come in my way no matter what. All and all this Movie is amazing and to see two actors come together in a film with plenty of other well know actors like Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Natile Portman and Tom Seizmore they where all awesome I mean what a great job they helped carry this film it wasn't just two actors it was the cast and crew and Mann who made everything alive.

Michael Mann always puts his main characters always at the opposite end of a long distance, and yet you feel there is close interaction. In Heat, Pacino and DeNiro meet twice, but the are talking to each other from the beginning till the end. One can't help getting between them while watching the movie.<br/><br/>The other half of the story is the action. No mind blowing huge explosions or endless high speed chases, but real action. This movie gives you an impression about how simple and complicated real ""jobs"" can be. It just happens and you feel like your walking in that very same street, watching the whole thing while it happens in front of your eyes.<br/><br/>That is the greatness of this movie. It feels real, both the action and the complex characters. It is not the regular good-guy-nails-bad-guy-flick. Both sides are figuring out the antagonist's next move and the spectator is caught in the atmosphere of mixed feelings: respect for the other side, both cop and gangster admire each other, but there both hardliners. No time for emotion, and yet there's a continuously glowing heat in their interaction, something that's reflected in their personal lives, the way they handle their private life.<br/><br/>This movie is black and white in real life color.<br/><br/>Well, it may be a matter of personal taste, but this is one of the best crime saga's ever shown on the big screen..."

I am not sure if some suit got a hold of the film or if the writer could just not figure out how to end it. Whatever the reason, the end was so weak that it destroyed what should have been a great movie.<br/><br/>I sometime wonder: if Hollywood made a movie of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" would Cyrano end up with the Roxanne.

Filming is also very very bad - you can easily see bluebox pasting of characters. Colours are washed and scenes are set in very uniteresting way.

","I believe Heat must have been the concoction of some childlike-emperor of a movie producer. His vision, the sad delusion of having two of Hollywood's biggest tough guys square off against each other, Pacino versus De Niro, although neither tough guy is over 5'8"". Val Kilmer wears a ridiculous wig, or maybe its his real hair, which would be much worse. Some fool cast Tom Sizemore to appear in this movie. Heat features talented actresses ( Venora, Judd, Brenneman ) but the movie asks of these ladies to be part of the scenery- I can only assume this is because having good roles for the women in this movie would spoil Heat's chickensh*t macho fantasy. Its like this movie was written by a twelve year old boy, who wrote the the script with burned food rather than ink. Great job Michael Mann."

","The one thing about 'Heat' that set it above it's peers was it's bare knuckle showcasing of the violent struggle between law enforcement & smart criminals. The scene sequences in my opinion are still unmatched to this day (2014). When you watch a movie about good vs bad guys, the natural tendency is to root for the good guys.... That premise doesn't apply here. From the opening scene to the last, this was nothing but an adrenaline rush! The acting, writing & direction of this film was phenomenal! Every part worked. Most people avoid seeing a movie twice in the theater no matter how good it was, me included. This movie is still the only one I've watched twice on the big screen. The effect watching it the second time wasn't diminished. I rented the DVD when it came out thinking I'd have gotten over it...far from it! If you like action movies that carry a story well and doesn't waste precious minutes with empty filler scenes, then you have to watch this film. If only this film had been recorded in HD (which wasn't available back then), you'd been in awe nearly two decades later! easily among my top five films ever made. If you haven't watched it, go for it, you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>Just to point out an obvious observation; the film is still so good that the owners won't agree to it being streamed online continuously. You either pay for it, wait for it to be streamed for a short while OR just buy the damn thing! Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.

With his devoted involvement to the film, ""Heat"" surpassed all viewers expectations for the first show down between Pacino and DeNiro. <br/><br/>In the film, Vincent Hanna(Pacino) is an LA detective working to stop master thief Neil McCauley and his team from pulling off another successful heist. While these two men are on opposite sides of the law, there is an undeniable connection between the two of them.

","Given the rating on IMDb and the rave reviews, I had high expectations when I started to watch this film. I was extremely disappointed from the beginning. The story was poorly stitched together, the details unbelievable ( culminating in the Val Kilmer character's escape, apparently as a result of cutting off his pigtail, and the fiasco at the hotel when De Niro takes his revenge) and the acting largely uninspiring. De Niro seemed to be wandering through the film for the sake of getting his fee and Pacino was execrable, substituting shouting and bizarre facial expressions for proper acting (and we know that he can act - he just seems to have lost the knack). <br/><br/>The only redeeming feature, as far as I am concerned, was the stunning visuals."
"PredragReviews","9","2","4","13 May 2016"," ""All I am is what I'm going after.""
","This is quite simply one of the finest movies of the last 20 years. The acting, direction, production and cinematography are all of the very best quality. This movie is well known for 2 things in particular. Firstly, for a while it was the only film in which Pacino and De Niro shared the screen *at the same time*. That has since been done again in Righteous Kill, but that was a vastly inferior movie to this. Secondly, as has been pointed out elsewhere, it contains the best heist shootout scene ever filmed. This scene is one of the most intense use of firearms you'll ever likely to see on screen, with the phenomenal sound of high powered rifles echoing off the buildings of downtown LA - if you have a home cinema system, turn it up for this scene, the background music is faded as the shooting begins and it is an audio assault on your ears. Fantastic atmosphere.<br/><br/>What's fascinating is how Michael Mann balances the two sets of production values, moving skilfully between in-depth character exploration and major action sequences. This is done by offering the viewer a juxtaposition between the 'normal' aspects of the criminal's lives and their 'work', conveying the point that, for these criminals, it's a lifestyle, a habit, and a pattern of living that in some ways has its own appeal and is difficult to escape from. Even for De Niro's more experienced and level-headed character, 'one last job' is just too tempting a prospect. The grim consequences of this failing are told here with weary inevitability: a fatal confrontation between law and criminality is on the cards. What this film reminds us is that these two communities are equal sides of the same coin. The glimpse this film gives us into their lives is a pastiche, but in a way it is no more unreal than the weirdness and tragedy that pass for reality.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"frank-924-406023","10","2","4","12 May 2016"," Michael Mann at his best.
","For this movie not to have won best picture back in 95' is nothing short of a crime. I don't have any knowledge of filmmaking or cameras so this review isn't going to be very technical. From the opening scene with the train I knew this movie would be great. While the actors are all good, the real stars of this movie is Los Angeles and the soundtrack themselves. The way Mann shoots the city for his crime masterpiece is amazing. The look and feel of it, along with the soundtrack gives the city a look I've never really seen in another movie. The bank scene is incredible. I actually didn't know who to root for at first, and by the end I was for De Niro all the way. This movie should be a ""must see"" for everyone before they die."

","Brilliant action-drama-thriller. Directed by Michael Mann, and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Historic in that this is the only movie that these two mega-legends of the screen have appeared in together.<br/><br/>Excellent plot and direction. Mann gives the characters depth and builds the tension and drama. This is the movie where Michael Mann demonstrated the cinematographic style that would be his trademark: the use of colour and light on dark, the beautiful high-resolution night scenes. Visually amazing.<br/><br/>Great acting by De Niro and, to a lesser extent, Pacino, but you would expect that. Pacino maybe overdoes the theatrics, though. As an indication of the magnitude of the main stars, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight and Amy Brenneman, major stars in their own right, get fairly secondary roles and Tom Sizemore and Ashley Judd have fairly minor roles. All perform superbly."
"alek-kelly","9","2","4","22 August 2009"," Simply Fantastic
","Michael Mann understands character(s). This is why 'Heat' stands out as an original piece of work that can demonstrate to young writers and filmmakers on how important character is to a film. There is so much depth given to the two central characters that it may propel some to question its use in several scenes. Yet it is precisely why this film is effective in juxtaposing the parallels of good guy versus bad guy, highlighting how De Niro and Pacino's characters are identical though on opposite sides of the spectrum. Subtle dialogue and actions are incorporated early on in the film so we are able to determine that when the two finally do meet, well into the second act of the film, we have already established that they mirror each other. Thus when the dialogue flows, we are well aware of this observation and allow the scene to naturally flow without the need to reiterate this fact. Fantastic--fantastic--fantastic!!"
"Brawl_666","9","2","4","12 August 2009"," the illusion of reality.....
","Heat's opening heist certainly takes you aback, but thats just a mild taste of whats about to come. Somewhere in the second act is an absolutely shocking, stomach-chewing battle sequence that may well be the most numbing action set-piece ever committed to film. Nothing else like it exists, not in the most awe-inspiring war movies nor in the most fiercely adored action flicks. Its something like what Peckinpah might have done, only ten times more riveting. Heat literally climaxes at this point - in an orgasmic fusillade of gunfire.<br/><br/>Heat is NOT a film about ideas or realism. Despite what countless viewers will have you believe, Heat offers no symbolism or metaphor, nothing beyond the literal surface story that we see. It has nothing deeper or psychologically real to say about anything, and certainly not about the so-called relationship between hunter and hunted. All that is a mere play on words and an escape for bored people. And by asking the viewer to identify and empathize with sociopaths, Heat proves that it has more to do with machismo than justice or reality.<br/><br/>Enough grousing about what Heat *isnt*. I come to praise this film, not bury it. We are all seduced by the spectral filmic experience that Heat is. Mann's unrivalled synthesis of sound, cinematography and music. He aims for a very high degree of visual verisimilitude, and attains it. There is no one else in Hollywood who can bend the logic of big-budget film-making in this way.<br/><br/>I'm just sorry that this film doesn't make me contemplate a thing, other than Mann's film technique. Never can I shake off the feeling that this a gigantic comic book, or a Western in techno trappings. He does try to convey something about the essential emptiness of these two men's lives, and how they seemingly need each other. Most viewers cant wait to label that as ""existential angst"". They might like to consider that maybe these two are just closet cases. That last scene especially is a bit too much."
"lisacamillek-1","10","2","4","12 September 2008"," Pacino and De Niro at their best
","This film is so good it kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the credits. This is one of the best films I've seen from the 90s. We've got Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in a well-made movie together created beautifully by Michael Mann. The scene where the characters played by De Niro and Pacino meet up for the first time in a café is one of the most incredible scenes in cinematic history. To see these two magnificent actors in a film delivering performances that are so intense and real, you have to watch it several times to take it in.<br/><br/>Throughout, the film is stressful and moves fast like a roller coaster that keeps the audience on edge. There are many things happening at the same time, which is basically Mann's trademark. Then at the end, the whole thing reaches to climax which was mentioned previously in the diner scene between De Niro and Pacino. It looked just amazing, and yet so tragic.<br/><br/>When I found out that Righteous Kill, the latest renunion of these two screen legends, was coming out soon, I got very exited and started gathering up all the information I could find. If they're starring together in a film and have more scenes together, baby, it's damn well worth your money to go and see it if you thought this film was good. Whoo ha."

First of all, who ever doesn't think this is a masterpiece knows very little about films. I'm sorry but it's true, I read some of these Hate-It reviews and man i gotta to say, to put this movie down is a crime to art in general. wait wait. A genius story, complex characters, great score, all star cast, a bank robbery scene to put an end to all bank robbery scenes, and Michael Mann directing it all. I probably missed a lot more but the point is if you're into the crime genre and haven't seen this film you're not into the crime genre. If you are not into the genre then you will be only never to be this satisfied again. ""Don't get yourself attached to anything you can not walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the HEAT around the corner."" Buy it! Buy it!

"Robert_duder","8","2","4","15 April 2008"," Heat is exactly what it says...a crime saga...not your average action crime flick
","In many ways Michael Mann is the type of director who really does have his own style and flare. I can't honestly say I'm necessarily a fan but I think he really does try to make the audience feel his story, and bring them into it and then on top of that makes it a snazzy artistic film that people can look at and say ""Yep that's Michael Mann."" I hold a certain disdain for him since I paid and sat through the utter garbage that was Miami Vice but you couldn't deny he tried to make it feel real and sharp and gritty and Heat is the same way. He called it a 'crime saga' and there is no doubt that Heat packs a punch but is it for the right reasons? The film clocks in at nearly three hours which as much as I appreciate a good long film, it's far too long for this type of movie. There is plenty that could have been cut out to make the film move a little better but again Mann wants it a certain way. The film chronicles every detail of both sides of this fight...the criminal side and this little family of crooks and then the police unit trying to stop and catch them and then it goes into the details about the personal lives of the two leaders to (I believe) show us that the two men aren't different at all.<br/><br/>The key to Heat being what it is are the two players in the game and this is the legendary and moving Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in their first screen time together (they both starred in the Godfather 2 but never shared any screen time together.) I worship these two men, they acting gods and they don't disappoint in these roles. DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a life time thief who is brilliant at it and treats it like a major operation that it is complete with his tight knit crew. McCauley is cocky in some ways, egotistical and yet subtle and smooth. DeNiro is a sight to behold and does a great job. However between the two of them I have to give it up for the amazing Al Pacino who is mind blowingly good as Lt. Vincent Hanna whose passion for the job is bar none. Pacino's personal life is explored at length as we see how much he lives for this job and to stop McCauley like it's a personal vendetta for him. He's passionate and loud as Pacino always is but grips you to his scenes. The rest of the cast is just packed with stars of various talent and Hollywood status including Val Kilmer (underused but his character is still great,) Jon Voight (more of a cameo for him), Tom Sizemore (also underused), Amy Brenneman (terrific chemistry opposite DeNiro), Ashley Judd (really great performance), Dennis Haysbert (small role but really great and different for anyone used to seeing him on The Unit or 24), William Fichtner (small role but terrific as a slimy businessman), Natalie Portman (very, very small role), and Mykelti Williamson (always makes a good cop.) However you like at it, this ensemble cast was put together to support DeNiro and Pacino and they do that just fine.<br/><br/>There is definitely some key moments in Heat and the first one is the cup of coffee that McCauley and Hannah sit down for. Here are these two Hollywood legends sitting and having a banter of wits over coffee and it's a terrific scene that can only be experienced. And then of course is the infamous bank heist scene that turns into a full scale war of M16's and automatic weapons that wraps the film up basically. I also thought it was well worth hanging in there to see the final cat and mouse game between Pacino and DeNiro which we've all wondered about and then to get to see right there on the screen. Despite the film running long which I understand he really was trying to make a saga of sorts and kudos to Mann for doing that...the film is worth seeing. I will say that I think it is a little over hyped considering it never did that well when it was released but only now has a cult following but it's still a powerful film to watch. 8/10"

","This movie is not a standard thieves versus cops movie, it really lets you get to know the characters of both sides and see their emotional lives. You can pick your side, so you can concider the end of the movie as a good or a bad ending. On which side are you on? The film is directed by Michael Mann, known for his work on the hit series 'Miami Vice'. 'Heat' has a great cast with some of Hollywood finest actors. The two main characters are played by the best gangster actors you can get; Robert De Niro ('Goodfellas') and Al Pacino ('Scarface'). The story line concerns both sides. You have the story of the life of Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino, who has a relationship crisis with his wife because he is always busy chasing criminals. And also his step daughter is a mess, because her real father never shows up. Then you have the story of master criminal Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro, who never had a wife because he wants to be independent so he can escape wherever he wants without having to worry about someone. The two admire each one other. The plot begins when Neil and his crew rob a transport wagon and steal the obligations of rich guy Roger van Zant. The robbery goes wrong when a gang member called Waingro shoots one of the drivers, so they have to kill anyone around to leave no witnesses. Waingro then gets kicked out of the crew. Still part of the crew are Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore). Officer Vincent Hanna an his team of LAPD agents are put on the case. They find out that they are dealing with real professionals. They track them down to find out what their next score is going to be. But McCauley's crew are on to them and play games with the LAPD. The next big score will be a bank robbery in central Los Angeles. Everything seems to be going smooth, until the LAPD gets the tip by Van Zant who got it from Waingro who is working for van Zant as a snitch. The police arrives just in time and the whole area gets turned into a shooting gallery. A lot of people die in the proses, but McCauley and Chris manage to escape. Now Neil has to escape before Vincent Hanna finds him. Which is difficult for him because he finally found a woman he loves. Neil has an escape plan but Vincent is right after him. The final scene is a battle between Neil and Vincent, eventually one of the two dies If you like gangster movies, then I would recommend Heat. Not only does it have the best gangster actors of all time, It also has a thrilling plot with great action."

This was not the case in this intelligent and exciting thriller. De Niro plays a criminal, and Pacino plays a cop. Although, on opposite sides, both characters are very similar. They both are excellent at their jobs, and they both have ruined their lives by being obsessed with their respective careers. This is the point of this film. In the end, both characters are tragic - De Niro for being trapped in his role, and Pacino for ruining his personal life in a lifetime pursuit of justice. The interaction between the characters is brilliant. There was also a tribute scene to Bullet (the McQueen film), where a chase goes through an airport. Val Kilmer also is very convincing as an apprentice criminal. De Niro's character feels an obligation to help out Kilmer's character, but also reminds him constantly that 'you have to walk away from anyone and anything within 30 seconds to get the heat off your trail'. This is a brutal reminder of how hard a life it is to be a career criminal."
"CarsonTrent","10","2","4","19 May 2006"," Astonishing cops and robbers tale
","Never have I seen L.A. look so cold and empty. The choice of music is superb as Mann depicts this self-sufficient city through a cold blue lens and a passion for detail I have rarely seen and creates one of the most complex character-study of cops and robbers ever to hit the big screen(incomparable to the original version which is not more than an action flick). The bold three hour marathon (a box-office draw-back) featuring a line-up of numerous character actors follows a web of numerous narratives(following not only the two leads, but also Neils crew: Chris, Michael, Trejo and traitor Waingro) in great detail rendering an extremely vivid picture of Hanna's relationship towards his job, life(deliberately placed second), colleagues, wife Justine, step-daughter and mainly McCauley, the man he's chasing after, but genuinely respects as a professional. <br/><br/>Neil McCauley's perspective is equally consistent in depicting his relationship towards his co-workers(deliberately called that, for in fact they are true friends respecting and trusting one another 100%) and trade of choice, which he does with an obsessive attention for detail and a devotion that finally will even suppress his conservation instinct and feelings for Eady. <br/><br/>The act of treason is depicted in rare realism and typological diversity, each shown for what it truly stands for and all involved condemned for breaking the code of honor, to which the two leads truly live and die by. Waingro-the psychotic serial killer who would sell anyone for a buck, Van Zant-the coward white-collar criminal, Alan Marciano- the sleaze ball two-timing snitch, Trejo- the true friend who succumbs to torture, and not at least Justine, for the chosen method of resolution with Vincent(these are but a few). <br/><br/>The moment of the heist is truly impressive for its complexity and dynamics. The attention to detail is razor sharp, as it presents a truly real-life outcome, leaving the final confrontation secluded and private between two hunters that share the same values but are on opposite sides."

","One of the best crime saga movies ever made in film history. I mean even the director himself stated that it took him and his crew some time to plan the movie out and study the concept of criminals to start filming the picture. Michael Mann himself wrote this picture, he also hand picked the two main stars Pacino and Deniro. Two well known actors for their ability to study their characters and bring them to life on a screen. There are also lots of crime films as in scarface, the godfather trilogy, goodfellas, carlito's way, casino, blow, dead presidents, etc..... I can go forever. My point is that Heat is like the king to these movies....now wait...I know scarface and goodfellas and godfather is more classic but heat compares it's crimes to real life situations that happen now in days back then mobs and mafias are already old. What movie have you seen block a whole main street and start a bank robbery in public with full automatic weapons M-16s. Cops around the country have said Heat has been the most truthful movie to ever come close to the big screen. Well enough of my Heat admiration I just had to leave a comment enough to prove who ever hasn't seen it to watch it and enjoy."

","Heat is not just a film about good vs evil. It is so much more than that, anything else would be an insult to the viewer. The lines are blurred here, yet the course laid out in front of the viewer is crystal clear. We know a showdown is imminent, but it's the journey through the various sub plots of this film that make it worth the almost 3 hour length. Some have criticized the ending as being anti-climatic, or a sell out. I couldn't disagree more. I believe that was the point of the ending, to tie together the main theme of the plot. The characters live up to there billing throughout the film, including it's ending. 10/10 for one of the best movies of it's genre ever made."

I was at the edge of my seat and had sweaty palms until I left the cinema - if i remember correctly.<br/><br/>all those who submitted ones and twos must have voted tens for movies like titanic huh?"

There's so little crime and violence in my life that Heat seems to be a foreign film--and what a great one at that! <br/><br/>Michael Mann has told a story of people I don't want to know but care about anyway. I was shocked and angered and frightened by the lives of DeNiro and Pacino and Sizemore and Kilmer. <br/><br/>Heat is simply one of the most effective stories about criminals I've ever seen. It's not meant to be a message film or a documentary, just really good storytelling of a harsh, angry story.<br/><br/>I don't want this level of misery and violence in my life, but watching good and evil battle it out in Heat on the streets and between the warehouses of LA was and one of the better 2 and 1/2 hour blocks I've spent in front of a screen."

"tfrizzell","Null","2","4","29 November 2003"," Where There Is Heat There Is Always Fire.
","I started writing movie reviews for this site nearly four years ago. During that time I have written information about over 1,200 movies. Constantly I get messages, good and bad, about my reviews. Sometimes individuals point out errors I have made in terms of something I mis-wrote and I go back and correct those mistakes. Others demand changes to be made in my criticisms and those requests always fall on deaf ears. I wrote a review for ""Heat"" back in the summer of 2000 and gave it 4 stars out of 5. I liked the movie, but looking back my review was not entirely correct. Surprisingly not one person has ever written to me about my review of this picture (no praise and no criticism). What I want to write today is something that has been bothering me for quite some time when it comes to this movie. I did not reward ""Heat"" with as much praise, respect and fondness that I should have. Honestly I think I was not the movie-reviewer I was in 2000 that I am now. I feel I have grown up to an extent and that I must correct the mistake I made in regard to this picture. ""Heat"" is one of the most brilliant, captivating, sophisticated, intelligent, honest, emotional and powerfully-moving experiences I have ever had when it comes to the cinema. In modern day Los Angeles a career criminal (Robert DeNiro) and his gang (which includes Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Danny Trejo) go around the city and create destruction and chaos early on by robbing an armored car. Immediately police detective Al Pacino and fellow cops Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine (among others) get involved in the case. Quickly it is very clear that the thieves are skilled, skilled beyond anything Pacino has ever seen before. Soon a bank heist of more than $10 million is hatched by DeNiro and his gang with help from others like Tom Noonan, William Fichtner and Jon Voight. DeNiro and company though are struggling outside of their work. Kilmer's gambling problem over-shadows his illegal work and wife Ashley Judd turns away from a marriage that is being ruined because of his terrible addiction. DeNiro meanwhile suffers from loneliness and isolation. He has been dealt a poor hand in life, but amazingly he finds love with librarian Amy Brenneman (""Judging Amy"" fame). On the good side of the law Pacino is on his third marriage. This time he is with pot-smoking wife Diane Venora. Pacino's obsession with his work has created an island between himself and his wife and his private life is a jumbled mess because of it. Adolescent step-daughter Natalie Portman suffers herself from an unstable home-life (her real father is nowhere to be found) and begins to question why nothing is going the way she would like. A very fine invisible line is drawn to show the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Pacino and DeNiro. Their personal lives are wrecks for the most part, but when they are doing what they were born to do (policing for Pacino and thieving for DeNiro) they are much like mythical gods. Many characters come and go throughout the course of the picture and a few side-stories take place, but in the end ""Heat"" is about one of the best relationships I have ever seen in a motion picture. It is a brotherhood-styled relationship between Pacino and DeNiro that is mysterious, complex, legendary and definitely thought-provoking. The picture runs right at 180 minutes and the two all-world performers share only about seven or eight minutes of screen-time, but their time together are some of the very best moments I have ever been lucky enough to experience in motion pictures. About half-way through the film the two meet for coffee in a busy cafe. To a stranger in the restaurant they could be friends or even brothers. What no one except the audience knows is that the two are mortal enemies because of their God-given skills. They do not yell, they do not fight, they do not ever raise their voices. Instead they chat and they get to know each other, they realize that the other is suffering outside of his work and they both learn to humanize one another. They share backgrounds (which they both basically know about each other anyway) and then they share dreams and fears. It is very clear that the duo hate their lives and make up for that empty feeling they both have by immersing themselves in their work. You hope they will actually come away friends from this conversation, but sometimes that just cannot be. Men like these two cannot change. They both act like they cannot stand the heat in their lives but in actuality they must have it in order to survive and function. Pacino and DeNiro admit that under different circumstances they likely could have been friends, but in their topsy-turvy existences that just cannot be. Maybe they won't ever see each other again, but then again maybe they will. Whether they see one another again is not really the point. The point is who you are and what you do ultimately dictates your life. These two are knights in a chess match of words, strategy, territory and ultimately emotional connections. Pacino is a great cop because he can think like a criminal and DeNiro is a great criminal because he has the intelligence to see things like a cop would see them. ""Heat"" is all about the roll of the dice in each person's life. Under many circumstances Pacino and DeNiro would be brothers, men who would stand beside one another and fight for the other until the bitter end. However the roll of dice here has come up snake eyes. Both have hardships and both have emotional scars that are literally tearing them up inside, but they do not let that get them down to the point where they cannot do their jobs. Instead they do what they were meant to do and do those jobs to the very best of their ability. The only question is how will these two experts do when they possibly meet again and which will make the potentially fatal mistake that will change the entire landscape of the film. ""Heat"" is a film that I really did not get as well as I should have when I first saw it, but as time passes I see the unquestioned brilliance this picture possesses. Really the whole movie becomes a microcosm when Dennis Haysbert (of ""24"" fame) comes into the picture for the first time. Many have wondered what the point of his character is. The point of Haysbert's character is that you are what you are and you cannot always change that. He has been recently released from prison, but assigned a terrible job as a cook at a small restaurant with a sadistic and cold boss (the uncredited Bud Cort). He wants to do right and make it in life honestly, but it is clear that just cannot be the way it is. An opportunity to work with DeNiro leads to a situation that may be predictable, but is also chillingly dramatic and highly nerve-racking. Writer/director Michael Mann had supposedly been working on ""Heat"" as a television movie back in the late-1980s. His work on the very impressive television show giant ""Miami Vice"" had endeared him to many in Hollywood. However ""Heat"" was stuck in limbo because honestly no one really knew what to make of Mann's vision. The big screen is the only place this would have worked well. In my earlier review I stated that ""Heat"" could have been the film of the decade. Looking back I am not sure that this was not the finest picture of the 1990s. Everything is perfect here. Dante Spinotti's cinematography gives Los Angeles a glossy and slick look throughout. The City of Angels has never looked better on celluloid. The very memorable musical score (primarily by Elliot Goldenthal) continues to be quite possibly the finest soundtrack I have ever encountered (Moby's instrumental ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" is one of those tunes that has just glued itself to my soul). I believe ""Heat"" is a movie that should be studied, embraced, cherished and remembered by all those who realize that movies can create thoughts and emotions within us that nothing else on Earth can. 5 stars out of 5."
"birdybluejeans","10","0","0","8 May 2020"," A masterful crime drama with outstanding performances
","In Heat we witness the actions and the daily lives of both career criminals and career cops played out over almost three hours of screen time. This is no mere ""good guys Vs. bad guys"" story, but is instead a deep and dramatic epic that dissolves that aforementioned theme and offers to us a rich, complex tale of desperation, dedication, and at times, despair.<br/><br/>What lifts Heat above the norm is it's focus on the human story. You are given a set of characters whom one might expect to be two-dimensional in such a setting, but who are, for want of a better term, very much alive and living in the world the film portrays. People who only share six minutes of film time are given a backstory with a brushstroke of brilliance, thanks to a wonderful script and clean, concise directing and editing.<br/><br/>That's enough from me.

The leader of the gang played by De Niro, Bin Bin, is polite and gentle, but like a senior white-collar worker in an office building. The contrast of the temperament of the two characters is also one of the film's dramatic tensions, and at the same time expresses the director's perception of the complex aspects of human nature, making the film's ideology more diverse.<br/><br/>In the first half of the film, the rhythm was dull, and in the second half, the feeling of conflict from the official confrontation between the two was more intense. It reached its climax in the final duel of the forbidden two. At the end of the two, I was defeated, The emotions that had been foreshadowing broke out.

I'm not a huge fan of Michael Mann's work in general. I find his films to be no more than very long music videos. His movies seem to epitomise style over substance to me, and Heat is no different.
DeNiro and Pacino chew through the scenes like they normally do. That's a given. The rest of the cast are as competent and watchable, but the film doesn't feel deep enough for me. Though judging by the way everyone else is rating it, I must be missing something, even after watching it three times.

The final shootout scene is the best of everything, feels like real. The suspenseful ending that makes me feel speechless for a few seconds. However, the rest of the film is dominated by conversation rather than the action where some people get this boring. For me, this is how an action movie is made.

","In my mind, Heat is truly one of the greatest pictures ever. Michael Vaughn does little wrong in this incredibly directed story covering both sides of the law. The tone and cinematography creates an atmosphere which extrapolates the complexities of the characters, allowing us to explore them more on a moral basis. The acting performances from this star studded cast are also commendable, and more or less faultless, with a hugely underrated performance from Kevin Gage as Waingro. Finally, the soundtrack pieces everything together with the Moby track in the final scene making this a forever memorable film."

But watching Heat I remembered again that length doesn't make a movie good or bad. It's how well it's directed and acted.<br/><br/>I'm not very familiar with Michael Mann but he seems like a director who knows how to tell a story. Also we have a super cast of great actors. Al Pacino belongs to my favorites. He's sympathetic even when he plays gangsters, but this time he's a cop, so he's even more relatable as a good guy. Robert De Niro plays the main bad guy who is cool too. These two legends make great arch enemies who try to outsmart each other before the other does. One of my favorite scenes is when they meet for the first time and have a chat over coffee together - the two guys who are trying to kill each other!<br/><br/>The movie is quite slow but there are a couple of more action packed scenes that will put the heat (excuse the pun) on.<br/><br/>Because of the length and slow pace I'm not going to watch it again very soon but I got the feeling that I will probably at some point.

"PCT1970","9","0","0","5 May 2019"," Diner Scene
","This is Mann's best film and one of the greatest crime dramas to date. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, editing, score and acting. The entire cast delivers the goods. In particular De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer, Judd and Voight are superb. The buzz around this film was that it would be the first time that two icons of Hollywood, De Niro and Pacino would appear on screen at the same time and they don't disappoint. The plot revolves around master thief Neil McCauley and Lt. Hanna. Neil is trying to deal with the consequences of a heist gone wrong due to the actions of a last minute add on to his crew. He is trying to hunt down this rogue member who has gone off the grid while at the same time planning to pull off one last heist before retiring from his profession. He is also trying to simultaneously deal with issues occurring in the life of his most trusted member Chris Shererlis. While this is going on Lt. Hanna is on to Neil and his crew and is hell bent on taking him down. Lt. Hanna is also dealing with his own personal issues with his wife and stepdaughter. Neil and Lt. Hanna meet at a diner and over a cup of coffee make it very clear that they are the best at what they do and no matter what it comes down to one or the other is going to lose. This conversation creates a bond and mutual respect between the two but does not prevent either from going through with their plans and promise. The plot is clever, intense, violent, intelligent, thrilling, action packed and has a poetic ending. There are many memorable scenes in this film, none more mesmorizing than the diner scene. When Neil and Lt. Hanna claim to be the best at what they do, it is symbolic of De Niro and Pacino. There are also many memorable quotes such as Neil's, ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"". This proves to be vital and crucial advice. This is an unparalleled film in it's genre and has yet to be surpassed at this time."

"grantbullert","8","0","0","3 July 2018"," A Pioneer for Heist Films
","""Heat"" is a heist film unlike any other. It surpasses all that came before it, and has yet to be outdone by any heist film that has followed.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The pacing and tension building is always right where it needs to be. The drama within each characters' arc is powerful as well. The heists are not the main focus all the time. The lives of the characters is what matters for much of the film, and that is a refreshing take to have in a heist film. Michael Mann demonstrates his control over drama and tension all throughout the film. Each character is flawed, but each on has their positive aspects. We are caught in a trap of caring for each character, and that is what makes this film so beautifully dangerous. *Cinematography/Editing: Much of the film is rather simply shot and lit. It looks natural enough, but does not draw the viewer in as much as could be hoped for. The work of Dante Spinotti is acceptable but not extraordinary. A few scenes feel like they were shot in the studio and that takes away from what is happening on screen. But overall, the cinematography holds up and contributes to the film in a positive manner. The editing of the film is simple as well, but it works well. It draws focus to the characters. There are a few weak moments where things look a bit choppy, though. *Dialogue/Acting: Here we have the strong points of the film. The dialogue is authentic yet interesting. The world that is created on the screen feels real. It does not seem staged like many other films fall victim to. The acting is beyond incredible. Pacino and De Niro deliver some of the best work of their careers. They don't share many scenes, but it is something special when they do. Val Kilmer holds his end of the bargain in the film. The rest of the cast is acceptable but not overly inspiring. *Music/Sound: The score is intense yet well hidden. It doesn't draw too much attention to itself, but it really adds to the overall experience of the film. The sound design and sound mixing are one of the highlights. Most notable is the shootout in the street. It hits the viewer with an incredible amount of weight. It is one of the most realistic and immersive gunfights to ever have been but to screen. While there are some amazing moments of sound in the film, there are also some very weak moments. Some moments of editing are off and a few sound effects feel inauthentic and cheap. *Production Design/Special Effects: The set work and costumes are average. There is nothing flashy about them, but the do a good job of being a help to the overall film, and not the focus of it. The special effects are immersive and impressive. There are very few moments that feel cheap.<br/><br/>*Conclusion: ""Heat"" doesn't try to get too fancy where it doesn't need to be. It remains focused on the story, a gripping story at that, and it is all the better for it. The film paved the way for successful heist films. Some films try to live up to what ""Heat"" has accomplished, but none have as of yet."

","WARNING: HUGE SPOILERS IN HERE! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, DO NOT READ!!!!<br/><br/>I admit that after watching Heat for the first time, I was kind of annoyed. I thought that it was overly long, and I had gone in expecting a complete action movie, nothing more. However, after thinking about it for a while, and after I figured out the story a bit more, I completely changed my viewpoint. Heat is a masterpiece. I commonly say that after about 1991 or 1992 action/crime movies lost their ""spark,"" and I still think that. However, Heat is a movie that manages to fully resurrect that same spark that I love. Stupendous performances by Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, and even Ashley Judd are coupled by a great, intricate story line, a awesome setting, and, for an action buff like myself, one of the most gritty and realistic machine gun battles I've ever seen. The ending also blew me away (no pun intended-sorry). After Pacino shoots DeNiro, that final shot before credits role...classic. It gives me shivers every time I watch it. The only thing that I have to complain about in this movie is that I do think that in some cases is just dragged on too long for its own good, slightly overstaying its welcome. However, overall, this is a small flaw in a truly great movie. Bear in mind, though, that this is not a movie for anybody younger than 15, I'd say. Language is foul (up to 60 f words), and the violence is very realistic; as such, it is brutal and bloody, and there's plenty of it. No sex though; I was glad that Mann didn't throw in the usual obligatory sex scene. In short, if you're over 15, and you can handle and appreciate complex movies, this is the movie for you. In my opinion, one in maybe 5 movies that come close to approaching the caliber of movie making so prevalent in the 1980s and early 1990s, and perhaps the only one that actually succeeds. Highly recommended."
"BarneyTabasco","9","0","0","19 October 2004"," With this much talent, it can't fail
","Michael Mann's modern take on the cops-and-robbers genre, sees Pacino as a workaholic robbery-homicide cop tracking down ace thief DeNiro.<br/><br/>The movie explores the mutual respect between a policeman and criminal and, in their absolute commitment to their own cause, how this affects the people in their lives. <br/><br/>In the hands of lesser film-makers, this type of movie would have sunk without a trace. Given the talent on display, we would have had to see one of the biggest displays of 'off-form' for it to fail. But, it doesn't fail. It succeeds, and then some.<br/><br/>Pacino, it seems, is allowed to be the energy source of the main characters.<br/><br/>Full of bluster and showmanship, Pacino gives the most awkward moments (getting home whilst his wife's lover is still there, for example) a lighter side and, on occasions, some welcome over-acting. By the end, though, his character pays for his energy and we see a more restrained, considered approach from him for the final thirty minutes.<br/><br/>DeNiro plays the quiet man, but with wonderful acting wrings every drop from his character. Given that DeNiro is not given the latitude to express his character like Pacino, then he could have been outshone by his co-star. Of course, he's not.<br/><br/>Michael Mann shoots every frame immaculately. Mann has the style to go with the substance. His script doesn't treat female characters well but mainly because they are all making one last attempt to reach out to their male partners. I think the movie makes the point that people who give a huge amount of commitment to a cause lose sight of the people that are supposed to be the closest in their lives.<br/><br/>Together with some great characters, Mann has also included one of the best shoot-outs ever seen. The almost balletic shoot-out between Pacino's team of cops (and a large chunk of the LAPD) and DeNiro's group of thieves succeeds because it almost feels as if you are in the middle of it.<br/><br/>Of course, Heat is not perfect. Similarly to his Collateral, Mann constructs a weak final fifteen minutes. Both movies are far from standard Hollywood fare but do spend its final minutes in them. Both movies have a shoot-out that feels a little clichéd and you can't help but think that Mann had a thought-provoking ending to both films but the studio got their way. In other words, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Still, Heat is probably the finest movie of its genre.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"zing_the_merciless","Null","0","0","17 October 2004"," Beautiful, epic, real.
","Heat is a visually wonderful effort from the skilled shop of Michael Mann. A remake of his 1989 movie ""LA Takedown"", one might be concerned at the result, perhaps it would result in a self-centered sprawl. <br/><br/>The true result is an Epic masterpiece, at 164 minutes Mann maintains an unswerving grip on the storyline and more importantly one's attention. Pacino and De Niro may not breach the boxes that they have come to occupy so well, but instead excel as obsessive detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and his alter-ego, sharp suited master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro). The storyline is woven around the two characters, who come to the realisation that they share an obsessive quality that lays their relationships to ruin. An unlikely, if somewhat romanticised respect is born between the two that plays on the emotions of the audience.<br/><br/>The story culminates in a startlingly realistic shootout on the streets of LA. Heat is well worth the time, probably not believable - but real, probably not the best acting - but a spectacular and even moving film.<br/><br/>Look out for godfather Jon Voight, a horrifyingly evil performance from Kevin Cage and ""Wild Thing"" Tone Loc talking jive in the club."

I find it impossible to take my eyes off the screen. I think the movie provides great character development of McCauley and Hannah who are basically the same but on different sides of the law. They both have the same drive and commitment in what they do. They will not stop until the job is done. Great supporting cast also. Even though I have seen it many times it never gets old. I believe because of the drama and intensity. The first time I saw it the ending was not what I expected. There are also comedic moments especially by Pacino. It is a must-see."
"swayland7","10","0","0","8 October 2004"," Breathtaking - where are this film's Oscars?
","Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna of the LAPD robbery/homicide division. Now in a third failing marriage, Hanna is a man consumed by his occupation, which exposes him to all the sordid crime and violence for which LA is famous. Robert DeNiro is Neil McCauley, the leader of a successful bank robbing team that includes his protégé Chris Shiherlis, played by Val Kilmer. After a fouled-up heist puts Hanna on McCauley's trail, Heat becomes an elaborate cat and mouse chase between a driven police lieutenant and a seasoned criminal. Writer and director Michael Mann (Manhunter, Miami Vice, Last of the Mohicans), uses the chase as an opportunity to examine two interesting personalities who turn out to be more alike than different.<br/><br/>As if Hanna and McCauley didn't already give enough material for three movies, Heat one-ups itself by leaving no supporting characters behind. Chris and his wife, Charlene (Ashley Judd), are given some of the movie's most intense drama, when after the climactic shootout, police use Charlene to lure Chris into captivity. Ashley Judd is given an emotionally restrained moment to reconcile her love for Chris with her desire for a more stable life. From her apartment balcony, she makes a simple hand gesture that signals Chris to turn around and never come back. Chris is forced to accept her decision for fear of being caught. Diane Venora, as Vincent's wife, serves up one of the movie's finest supporting performances. As Justine, she is a woman in an impossible love relationship. Venora balances the anguish with compassion and understanding, making her relationship with Hanna the movie's most engaging. <br/><br/>In Heat, even characters with only ten minutes of screen time (or less) are given full character arcs. Dennis Haysbert plays Donald Breedan, whom we first meet outside the context of the major storyline. He applies for a job at a burger joint, where's the manager knows he's a released convict and treats him with great contempt. He takes all of Breedan's tips and pays him less than minimum wage. Haysbert, portraying Breedan as a character who has made a sincere effort to change his life, has very powerful, though brief, scenes with Kim Staunton, who plays his girlfriend, Lillian. When Breedan, disappointed with his job prospects, asks, ""Why are you with me?"", she responds, ""because I'm proud of you"". Haysbert almost cries. With only two short scenes, these characters have already inhabited Heat's world and drawn us into it that much more. When Breedan is propositioned by McCauley to join the big bank heist, we understand why Breedan makes the wrong decision.<br/><br/>And when Lillian learns of Breedan's death on the evening news, it's a genuine emotional moment. In mere minutes, we knew these characters - because Heat takes the precious time to introduce them and let them exist as something other than plot points.<br/><br/>And there are so many more to know, with well-established actors in all variety of supporting roles: Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, William Fichter, Hank Azaria, Henry Rollins, Tone Loc, and Xander Berkeley. No one is a throw-away. All of them are real in the moments the camera turns to them, giving spice to what is already a remarkable achievement worthy of its tagline - ""a Los Angeles crime saga"". <br/><br/>Michael Mann gives Heat his signature visual flare. LA has never looked this good, nor have many films. Dante Spinotti's photography and Mann's framings are nothing short of mesmerizing, aided by a hypnotic soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal, Moby, and other artists. This powerful synthesis hits viewers broadside from the very first shot, one of a railway station at night. Through smoke and fields of blinking city lights, washes of blue and the occasional piercing red, we are drawn into this world in a powerful visual and aural way - matching, if not surpassing, the narrative efforts. Mann, famous for the iconic look of Miami Vice, goes the extra measure in Heat, as evident in scenes at McCauley's home on the ocean, in balcony scenes overlooking the vast city of lights, and in a great number of scenes shot at ""magic hour"", that ten minutes at dawn or dusk when the skies are at their most beautiful. One lush frame blends into another, and the parade never ends until the movie is over. Heat is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. - Scott Schirmer"

","After seeing this movie for the 10th time in the last 8 years(wow, is this already that old?), I must say that HEAT still is an enjoyable experience due mainly to the presence of 2 of the finest actors in cinematic history! The ""heat"" has a duality in this movie depicted bth as in the police(the heat) and the power and passion that DeNiro and Pacino have for their respective roles in the movie! I live in LA and am very familiar with the locations and names of streets and freeways..etc..and it is funny how they say places that aren't even connected in real life! But that is probably true of most any fictional movie. Another interesting side point is the real life bank robbery that took place in 1997 in North Hollywood where 2 men dressed in full body armour pulled of the bank hiest much in the same way it was done in this movie. They used similar rifles and body piercing armour. I actually went down to the bank the day after the robbery and checked out all the damage done by the AK-47 rounds that hit buildings, cars and houses all over that neighborhood! Real scary stuff. Talk about the movies affecting real life! Those 2 guys took this movie a little too seriously! But see it for the great dialog and action! 4 1/2 out of 5 stars!"

","What a great movie !!<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>Neil McCauley is a thief... an expert thief... one of the best. His philosophy in life - become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from if the ""Heat"" is on. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of Detective Vincent Hanna. But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime, and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.<br/><br/>My opinion:<br/><br/>This is certainly my favorite Micheal Mann movie, and also one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>You wanna now why ? well because of the great story, almost perfect cast and of course it's great soundtrack and ending.<br/><br/>But the most powerful thing about this movie is the fact that you can't choose side between the L.A.P.D (Pachino,) or the master criminals leaded by deniro. do you want the cops to stop the bad guys or do you want them to get away with it ?<br/><br/>This movie also contains some of the best scenes i've ever seen, like the big bank shoot-out and the coffie house scene with deniro and pachino Talking about there different lives who actually look a lot like each other. Cop and criminal do respect each other but if the Heat comes around the corner they will take each other down.<br/><br/>like i said before i see this movie as one of the best of all time and i think it is underrated by a lot of IMDb members. i am happy the staff gives it an 8.6 which it deserve. i give this movie a nine out of ten.<br/><br/>9.5/10 **********"

","Some action yes, but a lot of poetry too : I can't forget the green lights view of LA by night, the black Camaro that pass under the heavily lighted tunnel, and is becoming white for a moment. And did somebody find such an intense suspense as the moment where Hana and his crew are peeing MacCauley and his fellows attempting to steal the platinum, especially when McCauley notice a little strange noise, did somebody find such a suspense in another movie??? I'm the kind of guy who prefers viewing 10 times the same good movie than 10 not-very-good different ones, I don't know how many times I viewed Heat but it seems to never bore me. And a thing I noticed : Mann knows how to prepare the action with some seemingly relaxed scenes, he mixes danger with love! A man and a woman looking at the city by night, from a high height, seem so little things floating in the air, we can feel the space, and the space between Hana and McCauley is sometimes decreasing, sometimes increasing, it's a fascinating way to show the work between hunter and prey, and when the prey becomes hunter the hunter feels that the enemy is really strong. It's like a chess game where each one can't come back against time, each one has to improvise the best answer, each one has to enhance his amount of information about the other, each one has an army under his command, one army is numerous but heavy to command, the other is a few but more quick."

","To me 'Heat' is without a doubt, one of the best movies ever known to man. It has an extremely good cast and an excellent bank scene. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro two of the world's best actors mixed together in one film was a very good idea. <br/><br/>The most exciting thing in the film was the bank heist. The minute De Niro walked in I was switched on and found it hard to switch off after wards. They handed the customers and guards very carefully and managed to make it out of the bank with all the money and without any of the bank employees alerting the cops. It's not like movies where some people take one step in the bank and the cops on the way (Ocean's Eleven, considering it's a Vault heist). <br/><br/>After wards came the best shootout ever. Where the crew blast there way out of the police stronghold, which would've seemed impossible for any petty thief to handle.<br/><br/>These are my thoughts on one of the best movies ever made."

He yells, he screams, he cries, he even throws things, but there are times when he is silent and that is him at his best, when he is silent. Robert De niro really doesn't do anything, but here's the tricky part, he's really the whole film, his character is quiet, has hidden rage, he love his work, he is also in love, but like he said, ""I don't really want to do anything else.""

","As a person who watches films for both pleasure and criticism, I can honestly say that right now, at 31, my favorite movie is Heat. The flaws in this film are so minimal that they're negligible. Of all the movies I've ever seen, this by far is the best character study. The story flows, the acting is great, and the shootout sequence is well-done. What I really enjoyed was how the two lead characters discover they're a lot more a like than what they realize. If circumstances were different, Neil and Vincent wouldn't just be best friends--they'd be brothers. Besides this, the soundtrack was great and for a 3-hour film, every scene was crucial. Of the minor characters, besides being a big fan of Ted Levine's, I especially liked the callousness conveyed by the restaurant manager who was stiffing Breedan.<br/><br/>What really floored me about this film are all the subplots. Usually, with this many subplots things get missed and there's always that tendency for casting of less-than-convincing characters. Not so here. The young black lady who played the prostitute killed by Waingro (the first one whom he told that he could always spot a liar). When she tries to lie, she does so convincingly (to the film watcher) that you think she's telling the truth. And her face changes as she realizes she's in grave danger.<br/><br/>I note that this film received no Oscar nominations; this tells me all I need to know about how misguided and overrated the Oscars are.<br/><br/>

With a pairing of Pacino and DeNiro, and it coming off as well as it does, that would probably be enough for moviegoers. But add Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Dennis Haysbert, and the always interesting Tom Sizemore, and you have a cast without weakness.<br/><br/>Michael Mann, as he proved with Ali, knows what to do with a great cast. As he demonstrated in Last of The Mohicans, Miami Vice, and Manhunter, he has a visual flair that is unequaled in Hollywood. He's one of the few directors whose visual style identifies his films even if you don't know who's directing. <br/><br/>I am hoping that sometime soon, there will be a sequel using Pacino's character.

","This is one of my favourite Al Pacino movies of all time! On first viewing, I didn't think it was particularly amazing, but I've re-watched the film several times now, and I'm always just stunned by the level of detail in the movie, and impressed as to how Michael Mann tries to make the shoot-out scenes as realistic as possible. That bank heist is really quite brutal, despite the fact that it may not be as 'glamourous' as action scenes from other run-of-the-mill movies. The military-style truck-robbery as the first action set piece in the movie is meticulously well thought-out.<br/><br/>Another one of my favourite things about this movie is the atmosphere it creates in LA - the night time scenes where De Niro's house is (lucky git!) are absolutely gorgeous (the backdrop with the myriad of lights/the 'Fiji island algae bit'...wow). A lot of the film takes place at night, (no coincidence?!), but it really gives the film a cool, and sexy feel, especially when coupled with the electro-synthesiser background music. I've never been to LA before, but the backgrounds in this movie would be a good reason for me to go!<br/><br/>Al Pacino is as you would expect gives the film a real kick, with his pezaz and fiery demeanor. De Niro is more reserved, and icy-cool, in perfect contrast. The scene in the cafe, yes, is one to remember, but the other actors also put in a performance I think - in particular, Mykelti Williamson as Lt Drucker and Ashely Judd as Val Kilmer's wife.<br/><br/>All in all, a very immersive, atmospheric film, and of course worth watching because of Pacino and De Niro."

","I really liked this movie. I remember seeing it about 5 years ago and not being impressed. However, upon further viewing last night, this is one to be remembered. First things first, Michael Mann is a great director. His films have always given the viewer the perfect blend of superb visuals and very in-depth, interesting plots. ""Heat"" is probably the 2nd best Mann film behind ""The Insider"", which to me is a masterpiece. I was surprised that the 3 hour running time never really felt too long, however, i do think some of the stuff involving the ""Waynegrow"" character could have been ditched. I know his involvement was central to the plot, as a means for McCauley & crew to be caught, I just didn't like the whole serial killer subplot. Anyway, De Niro and Pacino are definitely on their respective games throughout. Kilmer is good but not as great as some have proclaimed. Two of my favorite characters in the film were played by Wes Studi and Mykelti Williamson. Their roles were small but played perfectly and really added to film's realism. The final scene on the airport runway was, IMO, even more amazing than the bank heist/shootout. Excellent way to end the movie.<br/><br/>

Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro bring gravitas to the tired roles of the dedicated cop and worn out robber, their first and last meets are touching in a way. Jon Voigt also brings considerable depth to the performance. The best scene in the film is between Voigt and DeNiro, the two are conversing on the phone for the last time before DeNiro is to escape, the simple words they say and the meaning beneath them (set to Elliot Goldenthal's mesmirizing score) almost brought me to tears.

Maybe the plot is not that original but with such a great cast you remain wordless: Al Pacino is a cop in love with his job, far tougher than every criminal he ever tried to catch but very sensitive at the same time. De Niro is a lonely robber falling for a lonely girl he decides to escape with after the last heist. Their destinies cross and when making their acquaintance they realize they esteem each other symmetrically. At the end of the picture I don't get to root for the cops but I hope Neill will manage to get away with the cute Amy Brenneman (really sad character) despite his being a ruthless killer. Should I decide whether De Niro or Al Pacino was more brilliant and effective in playing his role I would say that among these two gorgeous actors Pacino was the best.. he's perfect in the part of the exhausted detective, but as-well professional and so smart that he never fails.

That includes those characters that would get little or no lines in other films.<br/><br/>And there's Al Pacino being Pacino.

Maybe the fiery Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) can stop them before anyone else gets in their way. It's also a story about the different love lives of all those involved and the consequences of being so dedicated to each side. <br/><br/>What more could any movie buff ask for? DeNiro playing the seasoned criminal, and Pacino depicting a hot-tempered cop who will do whatever it takes to stop them. A movie with a cast and story like this was bound to turn up sooner or later, and thank the low-rid it did! The supporting cast is also top notch featuring Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer as members of Neil's crew. I felt the cast that was assembled was very believable and the performances were as well. The camera work was well done, I loved the dialogue and the music seemed to fit each seem whenever it came into play.<br/><br/>
Minor Spoilers:<br/><br/>Heat features two of my favorite action sequences ever. One is at the beginning when they take down the truck and the other is close to the end when they heist the bank. The tractor trailer tow truck ramming the armored car while being blocked by a stolen ambulance was simply genius, and might actually work in the real world if one were so inclined. The bank heist sequence was heart pounding and kept me on the edge of my seat curious as to who would get away and who would get taken down. An all out war in the streets of L.A., it's hard not to enjoy that.especially when you care about the two main characters involved. <br/><br/>But Heat isn't all about actionit's also a love story in a sense. We get to see Hanna's failing marriage continue to fall apart as the movie goes on, as he seems more dedicated to his job and catching Neil than to spending time with his wife. Things take a turn in Neil's life as well, when he finally meets a woman he truly cares about and doesn't want to leave behind. He now must make a choice between leaving while he can with the heat hot on his tail, or take a chance to go and grab the woman he loves and never look back. And when Chris' (Kilmer) wife Charlene (Ashley Judd) is approached by the police, she must make a decision on whether to turn her estranged husband in, or face the risk of losing her child to the heat for aiding a known criminal. Decisions, decisions. I like that.realistic drama.<br/><br/>It all boils down to a man to man showdown between McCauley and Hanna in the end, and only one of them is going to make it out alive. Perfect ending for a perfect movie. I can't believe this movie isn't rated higher than it is. If you're a Pacino or DeNiro fan, this movie is a must.<br/><br/>A truly masterful film in every respect and a favorite among my collection. 10/10.<br/><br/>PS  `You get killed walking your doggie!!'"

","Mann wrote and directed a tv movie called ""LA Takedown"" in the early 1980's and for those people who don't like complexity, character developement and want straight A-B storytelling which doesn't challenge them, then see that version.  For those who like movies, of whatever genre, to challenge, dazzle, involve and intrigue, then plump for ""Heat"" in all its 3 hour glory. Mann is on top of his form in the crime genre; building up from ""Thief"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Camarena: The Drug Wars"" this is his magnum opus.  It's not enough that we have cop versus robber, this delves into the character's souls.  Pacino and DeNiro are men who want to connect with a partner, but ultimately are loners incapable of supressing their drive to make a relationship work.  Kilmer has a dysfunctional relationship, but ultimately his wife's loyalty wins through to save his life, Sizemore is portrayed as a family man (despite his criminal job) but is prepared to use a child as a hostage.  Everyone sacrifices something in this movie.  And what makes ""Heat"" a great movie is that a) it has an excellent script which is b) backed up by brilliant set pieces.  The gun battle has been talked about as one of the best ever in movies.  It's not just the action, or the amount of lead fired; it borders on documentary style photography and it uses sound brilliantly.  The shots echo off the buildings, giving the fight a sense of scale and depth.  I saw the film with an ex-army officer who said that was the most realistic depiction of a gun fight he'd ever seen on film.  But a review of ""Heat"" cannot go without mentioning the two stars.  For me, there are two moments which sum up why casting Pacino and DeNiro isn't for the headline value.  First is where the cops are staking out the bank at night whilst DeNiro's crew fiddle with the electronics.  A cop makes a noise in the surveillance van; DeNiro spins around and stares at the source of the noise.  Look at his eyes, it's chilling.  The second is the part where Pacino's team are lured to the docks, he realises that he's not the hunter, but the hunted.  Again, notice Pacino's eyes and his body language.  As for the bit in the cafe, I think it's clever that Mann never shows them together in the same shot.  Forget the conspiracy theory that the two actors hated each other and refused to be present on set with one another.  If Mann had showed us the two in the same shot, the audience would all be going ""whooo, look at them, two greatest method actors of their generation sitting together!""  Instead, we are drawn into the scene and we can concentrate better on the dialogue."

","I left off watching this movie for a long time, despite being a big fan of both Pacino and DeNiro, because from the trailers it seemed like yet another facile glorification of criminal life.  The reviews here made me change my mind and give at a go, but as it turns out, I was right.  Despite the gritty cinematography, this is a schoolboy fantasy.<br/><br/>The story with Pacino and his home troubles felt real enough, and although it wasn't very connected to the rest of the movie was the part I enjoyed most.  But the endlessly clever, fearless, honourable crooks with their beautiful, noble, self-sacrificing girlfriends.... pur-leaze.  And Pacino weeping while music swells over the body of a multiple-cop-killer he met once -- why?   Go ahead and connect with your inner schoolboy, enjoy the lovely editing and great score, drink in the craggy-face-fest.  But this is simply not a serious look at what crime does to either the perpetrators or the cops who chase them.  I have more of a stomach for this sort of thing when it DOESN'T try to be all art-filmy.<br/><br/>""The Sopranos"" packs in more honesty about these types of people in two minutes than 'Heat' does in two hours.  If you want some true-life cop-n-robber grit, watch ""The French Connection"" again.  If you want a fun heist film, check out the original ""Italian Job"" (NOT the horrible remake, for the love of God).<br/><br/>Strictly for kids of a certain age."
"eamon-hennedy","10","0","0","27 October 2003"," A Fantastic Film.
","Undeniably one of the best films of the 1990's, Heat is a superb crime thriller that is both thrilling and artistic. Michael Mann has made many a great film; Manhunter and The Insider, but here he has created a work of sublime art, a film that is both violent yet oddly beautiful, repressive yet oddly emotional and optimistic and of course, it features Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on screen together for the first time, however it is the story that Michael Mann is telling which is the real star. Pacino and De Niro together may have been the driving force of the publicity of the film but they only share at least ten minutes of this 160 minute film together on screen. Mann just tells his story of what is essentially a film about two men who are both parts of one coin but who undeniably exhibit two sides. It is a testament to Mann's talent as one of the best writer/directors working today that this film works so well. The story of the cop hunting the robber and their story ending with a shoot out has been done to death, but here it feels new and original and best of all it is a story that is well told.<br/><br/>Heat is an urban epic first of all. The film is takes place in the jungle of Los Angeles and proceeds to tell the story of two men, either side of the law who, while respecting one another, will kill each other when they get the chance. Over the course of their story Mann successfully introduces us to their lives and an interesting portrayal of both McCauley (De Niro) and Hanna (Pacino) develop. Despite being the crook of the tale, McCauley is the most sympathetic of the two men. Currently in a developing relationship with a book clerk he is experiencing love and we see how much he really cares for the woman he is falling in love with, while Hanna is stuck in a loveless marriage which is so loveless he doesn't give a damn when he learns she is cheating on him, the only thing he cares about is the fact that her lover is watching his television in one of the funniest scenes of the film. The way the film cuts from McCauley to Hanna is masterful as we get a sense of the lives the lead and how different and how similar they really are. Only Pacino and De Niro could make a film like this work.<br/><br/>In saying while Heat is about the differences and similarities between cop and robber we also get to see the differences between these two masters of the acting worlds, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Both put in fantastic performances, no doubt, but I believe that De Niro is the better of  the two actors in this film. We see how De Niro is one of a more restrained quality, an actor who says his lines with restraint and custom whereas Pacino goes into what I can only describe as Scarface mode and shouts much of his dialog in the film. Yet when the two share the screen in the now legendary coffee shop meeting we see how brilliant they two of them are. As method actors we see how they bring across their characters and we see how truly great they are, both showing the restraint and master craftsmanship of two of Hollywood's finest. Their descriptions of the recurring dreams they have being one of the finest moments of modern cinema. Never has a scene consisting of page after page of conversation in a film script transfered so brilliant to the big screen.<br/><br/>Even the many sub plots that take place around the De Niro/Pacino dynamic (Hanna's step daughter's depression and the disintegration of fellow thief Val Kilmer's marriage to Ashley Judd) doesn't dismantle proceedings. In fact it adds to the story and the character arcs of both cop and robber and works fantastically in a film that is one of the finest I have ever seen.<br/><br/>To sum up Heat is a superb film. It is quite simply magnificent."
"valdabyryn","10","0","0","23 September 2003"," Epic Crime Saga
","An epic crime saga, indeed - as described on the back of the box.  This is my favorite film of all time.  I need not go into great detail about the knockout cast, though it does the film bounds of justice.  This film's best quality is the fantastic acting meshed with Michael Mann's directing (See ""The Insider"", also directed by Mann and also starring Al Pacino and Diane Venora for comparison and like style).  The film also has a well composed score.  Regarding the use of music in Heat, the exclusion of background music from various scenes (like the bank robbery) forces the viewer to take in what's happening visually, and this is how power actors like Pacino and De Niro really make this film the masterpiece that it is. I voted this film a 10 because I think it excedes, and actually exemplifies, the criteria that viewers of good taste and quality want to experience when they see a movie. Fans of organized crime films such as Casino and Goodfellas will appreciate the up-to-date representations of crime in Heat.  Heat presents a modern tale of cops and robbers without focusing on the protagonist or pushing the viewer towards favoring one particular character.  This films blurs the lines between good guy and bad guy, and you'll be surprised who you'll root for in the end."
"lamborghini_77","10","0","0","20 September 2003"," Definitely one of the top 10 films of all time
","******Note..SPOILERS******<br/><br/>I'm surprised by some of the negative comments about this movie. There was one guy who said De Niro's character was a mass murderer, but yet he only killed 2 people in the whole movie, both for good reasons---Van Zant because he tried to kill Neil, and Wangrove because he killed a police officer. And I think some people didn't understand the ending...the symbolism of Neil & Vincent holding hands was that Vincent understood Neil and his obsession, knowing he had an obsession himself(""All I have is what I'm going after.""). I thought the ending was spectacular...this movie went against the typical ""get-the-girl-in-the-end"" ending. Like the tagline says, ""a epic tale of crime & obsession."" Neil & Vincent were both obsessed with there own ""job,"" so much so that they both were willing to kill the other one if it came down to it. Another reason this movie was so good was the character development. It was the type of movie where both characters were developed so well that you don't know who to root for. And the production & music of the movie were also excellent. The music was perfect for the movie. And I personally did not think it was too long...in fact, I didn't realize until after that it had been so long...the movie kept me in suspense the whole time.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely one of the top 10 movies of all time, yet surprisingly underrated given the cast."

","Michael Mann's ""HEAT"" is one of those rare films that effectively combines great action sequences and visual storytelling with fully developed characters all played beautifully by a great cast. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are two of the greatest actors of all time and both have dynamic chemistry that is played out beautifully in what will go down as one of the greatest scenes ever filmed. The other star of this film is Los Angeles itself. The use of colour and architecture by Mann is brilliant and lends the city an almost haunted, souless landscape, which is mirrored by the characters. Alided with the production design by Neil Spisak, the cinematography by Dante Spinotti, and the score by Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Mann has made a film that surpasses every other cop movie in this genre and turned ""Heat"" into one of the greatest films ever made.

To tell you the truth, I was a little too young to remember when this movie first came out in the theaters in 1995, and then when it came out on video, I didn't bother seeing it with my parents once I noticed that it came in 2 video tapes.  Now that I'm a lot older and have developed a liking to De Niro and Pacino's movies I thought about checking out HEAT. It's great to see on dvd, a lot more clearer and the camera angles used were perfect.  The director did a great job on depicting the situation of each character, plus he also didn't put too much action so that it didn't seem too much like a testosterone fest (ex. Bad Boys 1 or 2).  If I ever get a chance to start my own dvd collection this movie will definitely be in my list."

","""Heat"" is a cops drama, but also a crime drama.  The stories of Lt. Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino) and robber Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) parallel each other until they meet near the end.<br/><br/>Pacino's Hannah might be considered your cliche ""overworked cop can't spend time with his family"" but if it is, Pacino still does it well.  De Niro's McCauley is strong and intimidating, but still gives off a ""polite"" feel in most of his scenes.  Of course, De Niro does that in almost all of his movies.<br/><br/>Like I said, the two act very well, especially for a cops and robbers flick. The supporting cast is also star-powered, making this film experience worth while.  Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert, Ashley Judd, Danny Trejo and Ted Levine to say a few, all play there roles like real people and not just mindless cops/robbers.<br/><br/>""Heat"" shows that robbers have friends too, with the countless (but entertaining) ""dinner scenes"", showing either Hannah or De Niro sitting in a restaurant talking with friends.<br/><br/>The message in ""Heat"": cops and robbers are people too.

","I have seen this movie probably 15 or 20 times, and each time I finish it I remain convinced that it deserves consideration as one of the best all-time crime dramas. Certainly it is one of the better assemblages of screen talent you'll see in any movie. Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, together onscreen for the first time since Godfather II, electrify the screen with their roles as cop and thief. The conflicts they face, both with each other and in other areas of their lives, relays to us the great human drama that lies at the heart of the movie. Both actors shine as they try to find balance and stability in their singleminded endeavors. If you don't care to analyze it that deeply, Pacino and DeNiro are simply phenominal actors.<br/><br/>
Let's not forget the rest of the crew, either. Val Kilmer, in my opinion, gives us the greatest role he has ever played. Tom Sizemore, a perennial supporting player, gives a fabulous performance, one which reminds us of how underrated an actor he is. Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Jeremy Piven, Natalie Portman, and Henry Rollins (among others) all do their part to add to this masterwork. Michael Mann has solidified himself as a player in American Cinema with his stunning direction of this film. The film owes much of it's effect to Dante Spinotti's cinematography, which includes one of the most intense and impressive shootouts in all of movie history.<br/><br/>
I can't say enough good things about this film. It is a true classic, possibly the vehicle in which we see the last truly great performances from Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, two giants of the American cinema.<br/><br/>

","You've got to hand it to Michael Mann.  Anyone who can make LA look as good as he does in Heat has got some aces up his sleeve.  Throughout this movie LA appears the futuristic wonderland everyone seems to think it is-even the greasy spoons have something extra.  The reason I mention this is after watching every Quentin Tarantino film and any other recent film taking place in LA, Heat makes Los Angeles an interesting place to watch.<br/><br/>But that's not the best part about this film.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is that it is real.  Let me say that again - it is REEEAAAALLL.  Get it?  No greenscreens where the heroes are diving down mountains ahead of avalanches and one guy carrying a .38 snubby can hit opponents blazing away with AK-47's.  At all points you can see how the makers took pains to show the characters doing it just like the real bad guys would.  That probably makes it difficult for the majority of movie-goers who are used to being force-fed process shots and can still allow themselves to be amazed when Bruce Willis dives out a 15-story window running faster than an explosion while still managing to land on an awning he didn't even know was there.  It also makes all of us sigh a little more when we see Pearl Harbor being sold for $30 and a gem like Heat getting stuck in the $15 bargain basement section.<br/><br/>The reality of the movie makes for some slow moments but when the action gets rolling, you'll be glad you waited.  Not only is it first-rate, you don't stand a chance of knowing what's going on without watching the quote-unquote slow parts.  Give the movie a chance and it'll never make you sorry.  Pacino and Deniro have a ball playing the lead men on opposite teams.  It's clear that both are playing characters on opposite sides of the game that give and expect no quarter.  Sizemore and Kilmer are excellent as supporting members of the bad guy crew.  Ashley Judd and Diane Venora are also excellent as the unhappy love interests.  Six major plots in this movie weave seamlessly and Mann knows how to move from one to the other to keep you riveted.<br/><br/>The music reminds you of Mann's days with Miami Vice; ultra-modern yet understated and elegant.  The sound editing is appropriate; when you have a dozen different types of weapons all being fired simultaneously, you appreciate not having to listen yet again to a foleyed-in Hollywood ""pow!"" A full metric tonne of supporting actors all lend their little bits (Watch Hank Azaria as the mouthy Vegas paramour-Pacino has fun slapping him down to size).  The ending does seem to a drag a little in my opinion-reminding us a little of the mexican standoff in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". After a while you're ready to scream ""Shoot already!""<br/><br/>Heat is hands-down the best LA crime drama to come out in a long, long while and along with LA Confidential, stands to be one of the best of all time."

The idea of seeing Pacino and De Niro together is enough to get me excited and anxious to see this film. I first saw it in 1998 I think, and I must have watched it many times after that. What really lures me is the great plot. It may have its defects and holes, but it really stands out from the average cops 'n' robbers movies which is usually just an excuse for some violence. It pays attention to the life of the characters, their struggles in life, their desires, their ups and downs, and not just the crime they're involved in. This makes Heat stands out. And of course Pacino and De Niro's acting is flawless. The action, on the other hand, is intense enough, and realistic enough for this near-3-hour film. While the opening robbery scene is great, the bank robbery scene can be said as the best ever (or at least one of) action scenes in movie history. It is a must see. All in all, a good film, good enough for me to give it 9."
"The Grand Master","10","0","0","9 March 2003"," Heat - an excellent and intelligent crime movie.
","Heat is one of the best films made. This is a thinking man's version of the cops-and robbers genre and it just doesn't have someone being killed every five minutes and something exploding which is ubiquitous in all of the action blockbusters today (which is kind of sad). The characters are three-dimensional and flawed and their relationships are fully explored in this movie. It was good to see two great actors appear in one movie.<br/><br/>The two leads, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are dynamite. Pacino and De Niro have played plenty of cops and criminals in their respective careers and this would have to be a major highlight in their impressive filmographies. Al Pacino portrays Vincent Hanna as an intelligent, tough, no-nonsense, obsessive and relentless yet flawed character. Vincent might be a highly decorated cop, but he is so consumed with his work, that it takes its toll on his personal life. He has been divorced at least twice, his daughter is messed up, and his third wife is ready to divorce him. It shows that his job as a cop is his entire life. He's not the type of person to sit around all day. <br/><br/>Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley is more restrained than his other characters in the past (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear). Neil McCauley though a career criminal, isn't portrayed as such a bad guy. He is portrayed as a human being with a life. He too, has a personal life which is parallel with Vincent's. He is intelligent, precise, violent and private, though he is lonely and does not have any attachments in his life. The only friends he has are the other criminals he works with and the love interest in his life which plays a big part in the movie later.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is actually pretty good in his otherwise hit-and-miss career. Other supporting actors including Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson and Ted Levine are solid and this keeps the strength of the movie together.<br/><br/>The best scenes in the movie were the armoured car robbery (well executed), the pivotal scene where Pacino and De Niro finally meet face to face, the big shootout in downtown L.A. after the bank robbery (realistic and a major highlight in the movie), and the final scene where the two leads have the final showdown.<br/><br/>Heat wasn't nominated for any awards, but it was a pretty well acclaimed movie (back in 1995). Michael Mann's direction was brilliant. Cinematography, sound, editing, and music is flawless.<br/><br/>One flaw, it is a bit overlong (164 Minutes), but is still a top movie.<br/><br/>Rating - 10 out of 10."

","That's correct; it is a sin not to like `Heat'. Anyone who doesn't like this film should be critically flogged, beaten and crucified. Every critic in the last century is right and we are not entitled to our own personal opinions. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm being sarcastic. <br/><br/>I just didn't get `Heat'. I didn't see anything particularly good about it. The dialogue is boring, unmemorable and too subtle to notice. The film's only aim was to get Al Pacino and Robert De Niro (two world class actors) on screen. They succeed in doing this, but surround the actors with a whole lot of irrelevant material and a bad script.<br/><br/> The main problem was that it had a huge supporting cast (and I mean HUGE) that had little to do with the plot, were undeveloped and just wasted valuable screen time. Val Kilmer, who was the third actor credited, never got any conviction and was more of a decoration than a supporting actor. The rest of the easily over-seeable cast act as stand ins and get very little screen time. <br/><br/>The end scene with Pacino and De Niro is nicely executed, but that's about the only damn good thing about the film. I certainly wouldn't consider it an epic and overall, I thought it was nothing more than mediocre. 4.9/10."

","From the director of the acclaimed ""Manhunter"" (I'm not gonna get into that debate!), ""Heat"" is a superbly crafted Crime Thriller which places more emphasis on characterisation than actual violence or action. At a little under three hours it may seem slightly long but you will be rewarded with a beautiful looking film which boosts the superb cinematography of Dante Spinotti and excellent performances from the legendary Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.<br/><br/>Saying that, when there is action it is capably handled by Micheal Mann. Mann displays his powers of being stylish without having to resort to CGI or flashy camera movements. Yet again (for a Mann film) the soundtrack compliments the onscreen action beautifully.  The film also boosts an impressive array of brilliant supporting actors (Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Noonan etc.).<br/><br/>The only possible flaw is the fact that there is too much going on and the narrative drive of the film sometimes gets side tracked as characterisation takes centre stage.<br/><br/>Still it is one of my favourite films and well worth a look."

","With a ton of action, drama, REALISM, and no; repeat, NO orange fire-balls erupting from cars getting shot (three shots maximum, as per the norm in a silly blockbuster), Heat has to be considered one of THE BEST cops-n-robbers movies ever. This is not even taking into consideration that this film marks the first time Pacino and De Niro share the screen together (they both starred in The Godfather II, but obviously we would never see them on screen together). Michael Mann takes you into the lives of two crews; De Niro and his crew pulling scores with surgical precision and stunning realism, and Pacino with his squad of detectives pursuing them with the same sort of accuracy and grit that spawned several hit TV police dramas. This is not a typical good guys/ bad guys plot. The bad guys aren't pure evil and the good guys are not saints.<br/><br/>The film takes you into the lives of the crews, and while this is a change of pace, it lends development to the characters- their chosen professions and how it affects their lives. It is not until almost two-thirds into the film that two of film's greatest actors FINALLY bring their well-honed craft to the screen (with 5 Oscars between them to boot). The supporting cast is SOLID (Ashely Judd's breakthrough role) with Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi, Danny Trejo (a real ex-con), and Jon Voight. The big sell in this film is at the climactic shootout in downtown LA. Turn up the surround sound for this one, as Michael Mann hired some true professionals to coordinate what has to be the most accurate, intense shootouts ever filmed. Again, NO cars erupt into orange balls of chemical flames when shot; they simply do what cars do when shot (they display the bullet holes in them and that's IT!). Brilliance.<br/><br/>So, if you're wanting to see something with flashy Hollywood blockbuster-cheap effects, whitty one liners, and a typical good guys versus bad guys plot, then go rent a Lethal Weapon movie. Michael Mann's epic has flash, style (a very cool look), accuracy, and an All Star cast to make this, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest police drama/ action films ever."

","An interesting thriller, it has two good ingredients, acting of excellent Italo-American actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It is delightful to see both ""Mafia- Godfather"" actors together. Here Pacino is a policeman while De Niro is a thief. The director, Michael Mann did very well when he left enough spaces for each of them in his own role to show his problems and feelings. Pacino is tough, but with good feelings, obviously always with the obsession to capture any guilty man, in this case De Niro, no matter how and when. De Niro is a criminal, but not a vulgar one, he has some literacy and is able to love a beautiful lady. The best scene of the film is the direct dialogue Pacino- De Niro had in a cafeteria and how both politely explain their intentions. The end of the film is a bit bias, nobody will try to make justice if he/she knows that police is behind you. These last scenes remind me a bit the Western films, with a duel where the good kills the bad one."

","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The movie is an incredible film and it serves as an excellent piece to show you how a great director and writer like Mann can take many characters, and give each of them enough depth so you understand and pity them when their time comes. Examples, Breedan (played by Senator Palmer from 24) has about 10 minutes of total screen time altogether in the movie but we know he's an ex-con, and we know he's trying to get his life back together. However, as we can see in the film, not everyone has a welcome mat for him, and he struggles. The short dialogue between him and his loyal girlfriend afterwards serves as a great scene as he vents his frustrations which ultimately leads to his decision to rejoin De Niro's crew. Subplots like this, done smoothly and all tie in with each other, help establish each of the great characters. Val Kilmer is a reckless gambler and a horrible husband, but his wife still loves him and he finally acknowledges that when the world's coming down on him. Sizemore is the complete opposite. He tries to be a good father and husband, BUT he has trouble balancing his loyalty to De Niro whom he has worked with for years, and his family. His job is dangerous, how long can he continue doing this? And there are plenty of others, all question their obligations towards family and their work which is good. I simply don't understand how anyone could consider this ""boring""? Would people have preferred no character development and just mindless explosions and shootouts? Let's not forget Heat is a drama/action film (by the same man who brought us Miami Vice), not an action film.<br/><br/>
And to all of the other naysayers of this movie, based on your inane and asinine remarks of various scenes, it's quite obvious you have NOT seen the movie. If you intend to criticize a good film, try to watch it instead of taking what little negative remarks (when they are themselves fabricated out of their bungholes) out there and using it as your own.

With the exception of that they are NEVER in the same shot.  In the restaurant, where this theory is really obvious, please notice that DeNiro sits across from Pacino and the camera angles never show a side shot of the two of them together at the table.  It is always over the shoulders of the actors. It actually makes me dizzy with all the cuts in that scene to avoid a different angle then over the shoulders.

As you know it stars two of the best method actors of their generation, as two men on opposite sides of the law, both completely obsessed with their work, with personal rules that are more constricting than society's. This obviously leads to problems in their personal lives; De Niro's character McCaulley simply hasn't wasted time on one, his only relationships are those with his fellow thieves. Pacino's character Hanna is going through a patchy end to his third marriage, as he spends too much interest in his career. Such a synopsis barely scratches the surface of Director Michael Mann's masterful crime epic. I'm sure you'll have read many reviews about how fantastic the action sequences are in this film, and they are, but they aren't what makes this film a classic.  What makes this film so memorable is the depth of characterisation Mann achieves with not only the two leads but also the supporting roles.  Emotions are implied with such natural method-style acting reinforced with perfectly stylised imagery.  This is what Mann is most known for - and he delivers, reminding us of the new-age, colourful cinematagraphy in Manhunter (which is far superior to Silence Of The Lambs, I don't care what any Academy geek thinks). The music too is inspiring, the soundtrack is definately worth buying. Generally speaking, the film is about finding your path in life, and testing how far you will be willing to go to stick to it. When these two hard personalities find some commonalities they open up to one another in what is favourite scene of the movie.  And toward the end when they hold hands and De Niro dies (sorry if I spoilt it for you) is very touching, I just found it quite poetic that two men who made their livings out of being tough nuts letting their guard down despite their duties. I've read reviews saying these scenes relied on the two lead performances being as powerful as they were - well I think every good screenplay requires good acting, any script which attempts to allow for poor performances is just laughable in my book, this isn't one of them. I'll cut this short as I'm sure you'll like to go off and rent the movie (so you should). I think anyone who says any one film is the best is simply naive and arrogant.  I'll simply say that this film is my favourite, and that anyone who doesn't enjoy it is simply a victim of commercial style no-brainer blockbusters, and so have not developed an attention span, or simply a traditionalist character drama enthusiast who gets dizzy at the sight of fast-paced stylish editing. I hope you are neither, just lay back, let go of your expectations and enjoy perhaps one of the best films of our generation. Please email me with any interesting comments, thanks for reading.

"gcostanzo11","Null","0","0","24 July 2002"," Pacino and DeNiro heating it up on screen
","This movie has got it going on, plain and simple.  Not only does the cast rock, but the direction, action scenes, and story are all equally worth of praise.  <br/><br/>'Heat' is a crime movie where guys on either side of the law are willing to take things as far as they can go.  Robert DeNiro plays Neil McCauley, the leader of a tight unit of friends that plan and execute risky robberies that pay off well.  Al Pacino is the detective Vincent Hanna who's on the case and hot on McCauley's trail.  Michael Mann who directs brings the viewer into each of these lead characters' lives and we develop an understanding of what they are--which turns out to be what they're after. <br/><br/>
The first time I saw any of this film was when my father was watching it and called me into the room just when that explosive gun battle poured into the streets of L.A..  I have seen tons of shoot-em up scenes in movies before, but nothing ever has compared to the 10 minute or so downtown shoot-out between DeNiro's crew and the police.  The rounds fired in this scene is incredible--the sound is deafening and bullets are ripping through cars and shattering glass everywhere.  Mann does a great job here by taking the camera and running with it along side some of the characters as the run through the urban terrain shooting and taking cover.  And the buildup to all of this is worth mentioning too.  DeNiro and company smoothly get in and out of a bank with bundles of money stuffed in duffel bags draped over their shoulders.  Everything looks good as they leave and approach the getaway car until the last one in, Val Kilmer, gets spooked when he sees a cop across the street and starts spraying rounds from his automatic rifle.  And as I described, things continue to get hot.<br/><br/>The supporting cast in this movie is awesome.  Val Kilmer is DeNiro's main guy and by the end of the film you feel his pain and sympathize with the fact that he gets away but is forced to turn his back on his wife.  Tom Seizmore plays another bad guy and he is just a cool cat throughout the movie.  Even Henry Rollins is in here, and he definitely gets away with his role...good job.  I'll mention one other, and that's Jon Voight.  He is Nate, the guy behind the scenes who makes it all happen for McCauley's crew, the one who things go through before they get to McCauley.  Also, when you're watching, you should know that the scene where Pacino and DeNiro are sitting across the table from each other in the diner is the only time the two shared the camera together.<br/><br/>I really love this movie.  Every time I see it though I wish DeNiro would never turn that car around and just proceed to the airport with his girl. But that really can't happen now, can it?  But the end moment between Pacino and DeNiro is still one of my favorites, and the soundtrack just amplifies the emotion I get from watching it.  I can keep going on with this sort of stuff, but I'm not.  This is just a must-see for anyone who enjoys watching these actors at work, or anyone into unbelievable gun battles that tear apart a city block!"

","I haven't watched this movie for a long time, but after watching it again, I don't understand why I waited so long.<br/><br/>This movie is great.  It has a good cast, including Pacino, Robert Deniro, Val Kilmer, and you can just look at the cast when you first look up this movie on imdb, so I won't name the whole cast.  But trust me, it is quite impressive.  The acting is on point, but the show is stolen by Pacino and Deniro.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two when they are together on camera is dazzling. Though they don't have that many scenes when they are actually together, when they are, it's just amazing, you can just feel the power of the scenes. <br/><br/>Natalie Portmans brief role was quite good also, at least she had a little emotion, unlike her robot self in the recent star wars movies.<br/><br/>A definite must see for all Deniro and Pacino fans. 9/10"
"actionclip","10","0","0","7 July 2002"," High Quality Action Move
","Although these bad guys would have to be the most disciplined crooks in the history of hoodlums, the tale of their exploits is engaging. Great action movie with intelligent characters.  The shootout after the bank robbery is thermonuclear."
"hmarcy","10","0","0","21 June 2002"," Best Cops and Robbers Movie Ever
","This is an amazing piece of film from the creator of Ali, Miami Vice and my favorite, Thief.  Michael Mann was able to weave ten or twelve concurring plots into a whole coherent movie that never lets you relax.  The heist, the people involved, the families and the relationship between each of the groups, the cops and the robbers, are done seamlessly.  You are brought along the entire movie by the actions of the people to the situation rather than the situation dictating the moves of the people. <br/><br/>
The choice of actors doesn't hurt the movie either.  There is not one part that isn't played well by the likes of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Asley Judd, and on and on.  There are no landmark performances here but the whole is greater that the sum of its parts.  Each player was a small part going through responses of how the plot of the movie was affecting his or her lives and as a result the movie took form and the puzzle came together.  If all of this was not enough this film had two great scenes that were enough to make the picture on its own.  It had a head-to-head scene with Pacino and De Niro where the two acting styles also came head-to-head.  Pacino with all the expressions and eye movements that were creating a dialog of their own and De Niro's character with a quiet, in control, inwardly thoughtful way of telling you how it is.  More is said in the moments between his lines than the lines themselves.  You can see two great artists at the height of their craft interacting inside intelligent and confident characters.  These were equals in every since of the word having a very meaningful, insightful conversation and the audience was privileged to eavesdrop.  <br/><br/>The second scene that makes this movie one of the best was the most realistic shootout ever-devised on film.  I won't give away the plot as to how it came about but I will only say that when it is over you will think to yourself `How long was I holding my breath?'. <br/><br/>The plot never lets you down, there are no slow points and this movie has some of the greatest scenes in 20th Century film; did I leave anything out. If I had to look for something wrong I would say that some of the sub-plots did not reach a conclusion but I only noticed this after the third of forth viewing.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants non-stop cops and robbers action with intelligent characters and great individual acting."

"Opion8d","10","0","0","7 June 2002"," Really Good
","*Heat*<br/><br/>Over the years I've been told I had a weird taste in movies.  Unlike most girls my age I would rather watch a Robert De Niro movie over a Freddie Prinze Jr. one.  But if I had a top 100 movies list Titanic would probably be by Heat.  So I guess you could say I have bi-sexual movie taste.  Anyway I enjoyed Heat very much.  <br/><br/>Al Pacino plays the cop, Robert De Niro plays the bad guy.  Just having those two leads it's obvious this will be no ordinary movie.  Their first meeting is in a coffee shop.  The scene is incredibly well done.  I kept thinking ""Micheal, your father loves you very much,"" but they were playing completely different characters from The Godfather II.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the length of Heat but it didn't bother me.  It allowed you to get to know the character's lives outside of their jobs.  De Niro and Pacino give great performances and so do it's supporting cast. Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and even Natalie Portman has a few scenes.  This is a great movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre.<br/><br/>*9.5/10*"

","Me, I'm usually not one for action movies. However, I flipped on HEAT one day when it was in the middle of its 3 hour run. I was hooked to it immediately. I watched the remaining hour and a half, and watched it again when it rebroadcasted. After that, I ran out and bought the DVD. This movie is amazing. De Niro and Pacino are super super super cool. Better yet, they define the term ""cool"". They both act brilliantly. And may I say, ahem, they have quite the sex appeal(!) Ladies, don't get turned off by the ""action"" label on this movie. It's not ALL action. The romantic sub-plots are quite touching and real, and will surely make you root for the ""bad guy"" in the end! I have to say, I felt for both De Niro and Pacino's characters-- that's the sign of fine screenplay, acting, and directing. The little looks that De Niro and Pacino make say a 1,000 words. Also, some of the best lines are said in this movie! And if anyone thinks of cursing as an art form, one can take pointers from this film. All I wish is that Harvey Keitel would have been in this one too-- now that would have been some billing, eh?!"
"Jaymay","Null","0","0","4 June 2002"," Heat passes the test
","""Heat"" has been in nearly constant rotation on HBO lately, and while I was never a passionate fan of this movie, I have to say that it passes the test. That is, whenever I flip to a channel and ""Heat"" is on, I am inevitably drawn in for at least an hour of it.  Even when I do NOT have that hour to spare.  It's a riveting movie.  Pacino and De Niro are working in their sweet spots and the dirty, slimy sheen of Los Angeles rings very true.  A Michael Mann film will never be spotless, it will always over-reach and be, at certain points, pretentious.  But Michael Mann's films always draw me in, and ""Heat"" is his best."
"danielle76uk","Null","0","0","25 May 2002"," The best cops and robbers movie for decades
","It might be one of the oldest stories in the world, but it's never been put on film with as much care, intelligence and class as in Michael Mann's 'Heat'.  Remaking his made for TV dress rehearsal, and given the money for proper actors, Mann has produced an extremely satisfying crime drama.  He has also given us De Niro and Pacino in the same film for the first time in twenty years.  Their performances are grounded in the history of their previous films and nicely balanced by the fact that their roles are interchangable and could have been played the other way around.<br/><br/>
Aiming for a moment of cinematic posterity he has also allowed us the chance of seeing two great American actors of the last thirty years share the screen for the first time. A lesser movie would not have been able to keep them apart for 90 minutes, and when the scene arrives it is a complete indulgence that adds nothing to the plot.  Who cares?  Five minutes of verbal sparring between these two is worth anybody's entrace fee.<br/><br/>How could Mann top this?  Easily.  With a neverending, street length gun battle that matches any action scene that John Woo ever produced (and without the need for slow motion).  In a cinema with surround sound you can hear bullets whistling by your head, and feel like you are right in the middle.<br/><br/>'Heat' also boasts a supporting cast that matches any ever assembled.  And it gives them all enough screen time and strong enough characters to register strongly even in the smallest supporting roles.  Sizemore, Voight, Levine, Studi and Williamson are all as reliable as we would expect. Kilmer is actually better.  The female characters are also very well written. Natalie Portman (a long time before Star Wars), Amy Brenneman,and Ashley Judd all have interesting subplots that develop very convincingly.  The underrated Dennis Haysbert (as a reforming ex-con) is also highly effective, and even as his character proceeds to his predictable relapse he creates a realistic and tangible pathos.  I might even suggest that the film could have been extended to further develop some of the secondary storylines.<br/><br/>This movie is also stunningly photographed, credit must be given to Dante Spinotti for his incredible cinematography.  The sleek, silver urban landscapes of LA almost become an extra character in the film.<br/><br/>Downsides.  Well the donoument is slightly disappointing, ensuring that the movie ends less interestingly than it could.  This is minor criticism, and shouldn't stop from watching the best cops and robbers movies for an awful long time."
"tcdarkness","10","0","0","21 May 2002"," ""Heat"" isn't a film; it's an event!
","Few films are this length (almost 3 hours) and not boring.  And it doesn't take what could be one of the best film action sequences in film halfway through it to be so.  There's always the threat of something bad going to happen in every scene.  And most scenes have the threat realized.  At every turn the film could end but it keeps on going, building the tension for the shoot-out to end the film.  Of course, that is not even the best shoot-out in the film.  The 10-minute exchange between the robbers and the cops is simply *awesome*.  Only great films like Heat or Terminator 1 and 2, etc. can have great action, bang-up, shoot-out sequences but not rely on them to sell the movie.<br/><br/>The dialogue's got the mix of snappy remarks, emotional releases, and expositions that make for great film.  It's equal only to the performances of the actors who deliver the lines.  And what actors there are!  Few films combine such a slate of name talent.  Besides the two headliners in the film, most of the actors who play minor characters are now leading actors and actresses in Hollywood (Judd, Portman, Voight, Brenneman, etc.).<br/><br/>I wish they would put out a definitive edition for this film with the added scenes for the NBC broadcast.  The DVD out right now has only the basic goods you would get."
"michaelconrad99","10","0","0","10 May 2002"," a true gem of quality film long gone
","Let me preface this by saying that this movie IS considered a crime-action-drama type movie.  But if you aren't necessarily interested in those specific genres of film, do not worry.  Heat is not just another action-drama.  It rather speaks to an innate issue in all of us.  What will we live and die for?<br/><br/>In my opinion, being a huge Pacino fan and an even bigger DeNiro fan, given the years of experience and sheer amount of superb roles each of them has underneath their belts, I would argue that this film, in their latter years of film making (Pacino then at 55 and DeNiro at 52), is some of the best work that each of them has done on the screen.<br/><br/>This is the true ultimate story of two men unwantingly on the opposite sides of the law.  DeNiro fills his smoother than smooth bad guy role to the T, bringing in the reality of the character and showing him to be dynamic and real.  Pacino takes on the part of a street wise, taking no crap from no one, hard nosed driven type of guy.<br/><br/>In addition to these two godfathers of film who could just as well carry the movie, we are blessed with multiple superb secondary characters that provide so much color and support for Pacino and DeNiro.<br/><br/>Specifically Val Kilmer as the loose cannon, yet cool under fire (literally) bad guy in DeNiro's gang and Tom Sizemore who in my opinion adds so much to every film that he is in.<br/><br/>Jon Voight is great in his small role as DeNiro's inside man, Ashley Judd is beautiful and as talented as ever as Kilmer's wife, Amy Brenneman is great in one of her first big roles as DeNiro's love interest, and the ever-talented, young (and now not so young but still as talented) Natalie Portman as the troubled step-daughter of Pacino.<br/><br/>Michael Mann breaths life into the script (that he wrote too) and into the movie.  This is a movie that hits us all.  See it.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"genius-15","Null","0","0","10 September 1999"," Al Pacheeso at his cheesiest
","I used to like old Al, back when he knew how to act. But ever since the first two Godfather movies, in which he was brilliant, his abilities have rapidly diminished. Now he's just the same husky voiced screaming neanderthal in every film, whether it be Scarface (a very stylish yet justifiably criticized film), Sea of Love (A low tide leftover cop flick), Scent of a Woman (another silly cliched disaster) or this dragged out feature, which was actually just a remade version of Michael Mann's tv movie released 6 years earlier. I guess Mann felt that a few extra loud sound effects, weirder music, more gunfire, and of course Robert De Niro and Al Pacino having coffee together would somehow make it all work, sadly he was mistaken. <br/><br/>It takes some pretty lousy acting to make Scott Plank, the title character from LA Takedown (and Nick from Melrose Place and Wiley from Air America!)look like Laurence Olivier, but Pacino manages to pull it off. Val Kilmer is fairly talented and does a good job, as does Ashley Judd. Robert De Niro is a superb actor and no matter how crappy the film is, he and his abilities manage to emerge unscathed. It doesn't require a film school graduate to know that the ending to Heat is probably the most ridiculous and contrived since Lisa Blount's ""Way to go Paula!!"" cry in an officer and a gentleman, so hit the stop button about 15 minutes beforehand. If you have to watch a trashy bank robbery movie, try Point Break, it doesn't try to hide its silly plot and has much better action scenes."

Well it does, in spades. <br/><br/>Pacino has the showier role of Vincent Hanna, an instinctive career detective and Pacino pitches it just right without being too flamboyant. De Niro is Neil Macauley, the cool and chillingly collected head of a gang of professional thieves. Much is made of the contrast between the problems with personal relationships that both are experiencing but De Niro is also grappling with a psychotic gang member, a slippery businessman whose bail bonds he has stolen along with the heat he fears is 'just around the corner'. <br/><br/>Mann's taut and muscular direction makes the most of the LA locations and the grimly professional action scenes only bring even more depth to the multi-layered and detailed plot. Two scenes in particular remain in the memory: a casual encounter between cop and criminal in a coffee shop (the only scene between Pacino and De Niro) and a botched bank raid of such ferocity that will have the hairs standing up on the back of your neck.<br/><br/>Incredibly well directed and acted and almost mythic in places, HEAT is a definitive work in the crime thriller genre."

","Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. I could have ended this comment right here. If any actors have been a guaranty for quality during my career as a moviegoer these are the ones. And I think it is safe to assume that I was not the only one who had been looking forward to seeing then in the same movie again.<br/><br/>On top of that, they are brought together by Mr. Miami Vice  Michael Mann. Some people will argue that he is not an A-list director, and they are right. But if you can create a success with Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, there should be no limit to what you could do with the acting material available in this movie.<br/><br/>The strength of this very good crime story is that Michael Mann gives us time to get to know the main characters. Therefore I felt like I had been watching two separate movies at one time. One of them starring Pacino and the other one starring De Niro. And that is this movie's strength.<br/><br/>
The most powerful scene is the one in the coffee shop where the leading characters meet for the first time eye to eye. The only other time we see them together is in the all too obvious final scene. And in container area (if that is Pacino on the ground). Even though Pacino and De Niro are the big-names on the acting side, there are several good performances in supporting roles. Of course big parts like Val Kilmer's and Tom Sisemore's draw some attention I really like Jon Voight  even though it is a very small part.<br/><br/>This is by all means a powerful crime movie and I can warmly recommend it to everyone especially fans of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro  if they haven't already seen it."

","How this movie was ignored by the Oscars is totally beyond me, but then again so is 2001's best picture loss. This is a great crime epic. The big scenes and small scenes are crafted with equal care. It is just about as good as the first 2 Godfather's and just as haunting. Michael Mann wrote a cold, brutal and very moving story about two men who are predators and are lost in life because of their natures. We have Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro --two of the greatest actors of my generation (I'm 41) giving two of the greatest performances of their careers. Their legendary scene over a cup of coffee may ridiculous in real cops and robbers life but but, man (pun intended), it makes for unforgettable cinema. The action is as good as it gets (the bank robbery ""set piece"" is one of the top 5 shootouts ever filmed) and never seems dramatically phony i.e. thrown in just for ""action's"" sake. Like just about all great movies the supporting is wonderful. Every role is memorable. This is one of the few scripts I've ever bothered to buy. It is a long movie that is richer for its length. Earlier Mann wrote and directed a wonderful (and equally underappreciated) movie called ""Thief"" with James Caan 15 years before this one and I can't help but to think that ""Heat"" is the novel length version of ""Thief""'s short story."

"Pan-12","10","0","0","31 July 1999"," Heat is an excellent film all round.
","I first saw heat when I was 13 and immediately established it as one of my favourite films. While you could call it slow and/or a standard action/thriller, I feel it has an extra edge which makes it great. It is partly the acting performances by Deniro, Pacino and Kilmer. But one of the best things about this film is the realism displayed in the dialogue and the character development. Even the negro character who only has a short amount of air time is well established as man who is weighed down by a crime ridden past, has reformed, but cannot rid of the tag that his crimes have left with him. The inclusion of Val Kilmer for me was always going to boost my opinion of the film. I feel this is his best performance second only perhaps to his portrayal of Doc Holliday in Tombstone. It is not so much his acting ability or aesthetic appeal that does it for him, but his raw presence and charisma. Finally, I have to give credit to the shootout scene towards the end of the film. I have designated this as my favourite scene in a movie ever despite its violence.<br/><br/>Great stuff."

","An expertly crafted action-drama.  You can see the painstaking detail Michael Mann took in making this film.  Not a single scene was shot on a studio sound stage, and what results is a slick, uncompromising, stylishly made movie that makes you feel as if you're witnessing a real-life story. The movie kept me glued to my seat from start till finish, despite its nearly 3 hour run time.  I've read various criticisms of the movie, usually involving length and/or the heavy focus given to the personal relationships of both the cops and criminals.  However, if you allow yourself to be drawn into the movie, you'll find that those aspects are actually strengths and not weaknesses.  Michael Mann doesn't shy away from anything, he wants to show us what it's like to live and breath as these characters do, and as a movie watching experience, it's absolutely gripping."

Robert plays the role of a bad guy as Al plays the ""good"" guy.<br/><br/>One crucial thing in this movie is that both Pacino & Niro are great character actors. Roles are played convincingly and with style. Second one is that Michael Mann has done really nice job with the script. The Heat is on from beginning to the end of the movie.

","Heat is a wonderful movie. It is one of my top 5 favorites movies. One of the reasons why it is such a great movie, is because they put two of the greatest actors in it ( Al Pacino and Robert De Niro), facing off each other. The main plot of the movie is there is an L.A. cop named Vincent Hanna (Pacino), Trying to arrest a master bank robber named Neil McCauely ( De Niro), which ends with a great face off. It is wonderfully acted, and has a lot of explosive action. So if you're in the mood for a great action/thriller, watch ""Heat""."

","Every element is here- De Niro and Pacino locked in battle with extras like Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman, Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, Ashley Judd, Wes Studi etc etc... Bottom line is that it has one of the best casts of the decade. Well, this is not enough to hold the film up. The romantic side of the characters is shameful. The film just touches upon the action and focuses more on the characters rivalry. Pacinos part may well have been given to an amateur. De Niro is only slightly better! Having said this, Kilmer is superb, as is Voight and Sizemore. The coffee shop scene works magically as a anti-climax and the final battle is brilliant. The most emotional character is the much hated Waingro(kevin gage). Appeals to some more than others.Rating=3/5"

","I haven't seen a movie this involved in a while. I picked it from the video shop because I thought it would be a simple action no-brainer for a Friday night, but i was happily mistaken. Both De Niro and Pacino were excellent, and really touched on the hard, unromantic lives their characters led. I was surprised at how much time is spent with the minor characters, but maybe I looked too hard. I can't really think of a weak point in this movie. It does have some pretty intense gunfights (the one outside the bank is horrific) and some of the violence in it could exclude some viewers. besides that, it was fantastic."

","This film has everything. Pacino and DeNiro finally facing off in Mann's masterpiece. Acting is superb although I've never cared much for Val Kilmer. The running time was 2H 44Min which might be considered a bit too long, but for me it was ok and there really wasn't any scenes that should be cut. The beautifully choreographed firefights are really something to behold. The action reminded me of John Woo's Hard Boiled and Killer. Where Woo packs a punch with fast paced action and bloodshed, Mann and Andy McNab have built a stunningly beautiful city combat scene after DeNiro and buddies escape from the bank. The firefight scenes were filmed over and over again until they were just right and when McNab and his friends were watching Heat, they all applauded wildly when DeNiro loaded his weapon correctly.<br/><br/>The film centers on good versus bad, but the line between them is very blurred. Pacino's character is a workaholic who's only life seems to be in his work. His personal life is a messed up family with loads of arguments and fights. DeNiro's character is a loner and one of his quotes best describe him. ""allow nothing to be in your life that you can't walk out in 30 seconds if you spot the heat around the corner.""<br/><br/>Both of these characters have great respect for each other which is shown in the famous cafe-scene. The characters talk like friends, but under the mask both know that only one will survive. This film is a definite classic."

","I saw this film again yesterday, while on watch.  I'm glad I did:  it's rare that I see a film more than once, and even more so that it should get better with each repeat viewing.<br/><br/>This time, I noticed the small, nuanced scenes, instead of the big, loud action scenes (which is not to say they seem any less stunning).  Most importantly, the final scene between Ashley Judd and Val Kilmer carried more emotional impact with it than a dozen other lesser melodramas.<br/><br/>Also, further viewing made me understand the complex story a little better. The first time I saw it, in Virginia Beach three and a half years ago, I had trouble understanding Neil McCauley's decision to ""do one last thing"" near the end.  Through careful observation this time, and taking notice of bits of dialogue I didn't hear before, it made sense.  Then, and only then, did the climactic scene work (for me) the way it was intended to.<br/><br/>I have as much anticipation for Michael Mann's next drama, ""Man of the People"", as for the next Oliver Stone film (""Gridiron""), the next Martin Scorsese film (""Bringing Out the Dead""), or Spielberg's new sci-fi picture, ""Minority Report"".  Mann has had an excellent track record over the past twenty-some years (Anyone who's seen ""Thief"", ""Manhunter"" or ""Last of the Mohicans"" will probably agree with me.)

The answer is the excitement of the chase, more than the result: ""regular life? what the f*** is that? barbecues and ball games?"" is what McCauley despises most of all in the most dramatic encounter of the movie. Their rejection of ""regular life"" is what sets them apart from your ""regular fellow.""

Mann's technical trademarks are present: the haunting, ambient score, and the industrial set design and exteriors add to the film's moody resonance and give Los Angeles a whole other dimension. The acting, writing, and direction is the key, however, and Mann has crafted insightful dialogue, and gotten stellar performances from all involved. It helps that the hunter and his prey and played by two heavy-hitting forces of nature -- Pacino and De Niro. They have a classic moment in a coffeehouse (the first on-screen pairing of the two method men), during which the viewer is left mesmerized as the two men unload the weight of the would in breathless, crisp dialogue. The shoot-out is one of the most cataclysmic, fantastically-choreographed scenes of action in one film; it's the kind of ballistic ballet that only John Woo seems capable of. All the negative reviews of the film gripe (understandably) about the length (or overlength).

It is a collision of monumental proportions; one that sparks a chaotic downward spiral as each antagonist grapples for control of his respective world.<br/><br/>Mann appears to do little to draw his audience in and make them care about his characters; he merely presents them for our viewing.

The characters are never entirely right or wrong in their actions, very much like in real life. And always this level of dedication displayed by the two lead figures, so unreachable for us mortals.<br/><br/>'Heat' shows two men beyond the disturbances of everyday life. This I believe is what gives me goosebumps - that we see a scaled-down version of life, where winners are decided not by the virtue of their morals, but by the level of their desire to come out on top. 'Heat' is a true masterpiece."

","If you look at the cast of 'Heat' you must think to yourself that you can't go wrong.  And, yes, this is very true.  But to make a great movie you must, also, have a strong story.  This film has it. The film follows two sides to a very gripping story.  On one side, you have the on-edge detective, Vincent Hanna (played exceptionally by Al Pacino). You see the drama and heartache he must go through to be so dedicated to his work.  On the other side, you have Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, who, in his own right, is a honest man.  The regrets he has and the pain he faces by being a criminal are both well played without exactly making you feel sorry for him.  Then, as the two slowly some together through their own destinies, you get to see the bond and similarities they share.  This film actually has three climactic points.  The first is the meeting in the coffee house.  It is there that they both show how much they actually respect each other.  The second is the robbery sequence.  This is probably one of the greatest action sequences ever to grace film.  The final climax is just that, the final sceen.  It is the final showdown between Pacino and De Niro.<br/><br/>Now, as I have already said, the film's two main stars could at least make this worth watching.  But the directing by Michael Mann and the supporting cast are what really make this movie so attractive.  Val Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis gives a unique side story to the film.  It's the relationship with his wife, played by Ashley Judd, that we find ourselves being drawn into. Wes Studi and Mykelti Williamson play Vincent Hanna's right hand men.  And, Tom Sizemore plays the third out of three crucial parts to the gang.  You also can't forget the musical score.  Beautifully played, it really accents the happenings of the movie. This is the only movie in my life that I can literally watch over and over again.  The reason why, because I can never decide what outcome I want.  Do I want Hanna to catch McCauley, or do I want McCauley to keep driving for the airport before he veers off to the hotel.  The final, seemingly most important part of this movie, the clasping of hands.  When Hanna is holding McCauley's hand you really get a sense of what this movie is about."
"Motoko","Null","0","0","28 January 1999"," A truly poetic film.
","It's difficult to sum up in a 1,000 word description a film like Heat. Having read through some of the comments and agreeing with all of them (I've yet to see a negative one) it's hard to add anything that hasn't already been said. I could talk about 'that' scene but why bother? If you haven't seen the film but have read the other comments then I hope you've caught on that it's pretty good. If you have seen then you should know that it's one the greatest ever caught on camera. I could go on about how Pacino and De Niro are simply breathtaking in every frame but I believe thats already been mentioned. Perhaps I should mention the fact that its story is an unparalleled study in human nature, professionalism and obsession. Nah, thats been done to death.<br/><br/>Maybe it's enough simply to say this. Heat is a masterpiece. If ever a film could be poetry then this is it. As emotional and thrilling as it's possible to be. Rarely does a film about crime manage to cover as much ground in as much time as this one does. The cast is awe-inspiring. Pacino and De Niro are the stars but the support is never eclipsed. The characters are so real you could almost touch them and the intricate plot never leaves you hanging. Michael Mann, possibly the most under-recognised director in the business, deserves full credit and I shall sign off my review with a testament to his skills as writer and director with these two scenes both of which involve Kilmer. Those that have yet to see the film should stop now.<br/><br/>The first is during the shootout from the bank getaway. Kilmer is shot in the shoulder attempting to escape and gets dropped. That's it. No messing around with slo-mos. No background music. He just gets dropped. Simple. Any other film would highlight the scene. Mann just lets it happen knowing that the action itself will be enough for the audience. That is a display of trust that few directors have to guts to have.<br/><br/>Next is Kilmers final scene. He's been baited to a police trap by his wife who has been coerced to co-operate under a threat of taking thier child into care. All his wife has to do is stand by the window and draw Kilmer in when he arrives. Kilmer does and sees his wife. His wife sees him and in one of the most emotional scenes I've ever witnessed gives a silent warning. A word isn't said throughout the scene but there doesn't need to be any. It's in their eyes and their faces. Kilmer will escape but most likely never see his family again. His wife will get off but never see him again. Kilmer's the bad guy, in a film where bad is a relative term, but we feel sorry for him and his wife. That takes true talent. It's that talent that makes Heat what it is. One of the greatest films this decade, century, millennium. Take your pick."

","The thing that really hit me about this movie was its humanity. The Coffee Shop scene was brilliant.  Not only because two of the greatest actors of all time were sitting down having a cup of coffee together, but because they did it so well.  The next time you're at a coffee shop look around.  Then think about that scene.  DiNiro wasn't some raving lunatic with a light up bow tie, and Pacino wasn't some pumped up adrenalin junkie with only motto...Shoot whatever moves!!!  They were just two ordinary guys having a cup of coffee.  Also, the bank job was completely realistic and not a group of Surfers wearing president masks."

","When I watch this movie I think that Michael Mann (again) pulls off what Cameron always tries to do and what De Palma does hit and miss: he walks a perfect line between script depth and cool but sentimental direction. The bank shoot-out alone is enough reason to see this movie, but it's not by any stretch of the imagination an action flick. Anyone who goes to see this movie expecting the playing out of a good ensemble cast will likewise be disappointed; the movie gives about as much attention to its female characters as its protagonists do--that is to say, a regretful nod every now and then. It's essentially a one-man character sketch, except that that one man happens to be split between a cop and a robber who recognize their own detached ambition in each other. Every other character in the movie pretty much orbits them; but that one portrayal is so emotional to witness that nothing else is needed. The plot essentially documents their warring desires, fears and insecurities and finally comes to a there-but-for-the-grace-of-god-go-I conclusion. The film itself is very blue and, shoot-outs aside, very quiet; but it's that quietness that, as in Raging Bull, accents the mad desperation of its two characters to define themselves as not only men, but powerful men. Highly recommended to anyone who can fully appreciate that violence and that sadness side-by-side."

This well-crafted and beautifully acted film is that of a rare breed of films that actually covers every aspect of its characters and plot.

When I Watched this film again yesterday (for the seventh time) I still agree with myself that this is the best film I´ve ever seen. Absolutely everything in this film is marvellous. The scene when Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) talks to Neil McCauley(Robert DeNiro)in the coffee shop is the highlight of the film as well as the one were DeNiro´s robber gang confronts Pacino´s Policeteam in a big shootout. All the actors,the splendid cinematography,the music,the dialogue etc makes this an extraordinary flick. Robert DeNiro portrays one of his most interesting characters ever as the tough and focused but also vulnerable Neil McCauley. Fine actors: Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Jon Voight, Val Kilmer and Diane Venora are perfect beside the dynamic duo of DeNiro-Pacino. Although the film is very long you never get bored from watching it. Michael Mann (the director) could have made an ordinary and cliché-filled Actionmovie but instead he has brought us not only great action but also lovely characters with different dimensions.

","In twenty years, Michael Mann will be remembered as one of America's greatest directors. He consistently has churned out modern classics, from Thief(1981), Manhunter(1988), The Last of the Mohicans(1992) and The Insider(1999). But in my opinion, Heat is his best. It may be strange to say so about a movie with a cast that includes Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Jon Voight, but its the writing that gets me. Is the dialouge Mamet level? No. Maybe its not the most original plot in the world either. But the screenplay has something that almost no movies can truly claim these days- efficiency. It may seem odd to say that about a movie that is almost 3 hours long, but there is not one scene in this film that doesn't advance the story. And the subplots are clear and every single one of them is resolved before the credits. Much has been made of the first onscreen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. And when I say meeting, I mean it, as they literally share one dialouge scene together. And it is a fabulous scene. There is a reason this movie could not have been made in 1978 and had the same impact.<br/><br/>Whats so special about the scene is that Pacino and De Niro have essentially lived their lives and aged before our eyes, and are now very much the seasoned professionals they portray in this movie. The other strength of this movie is its action, which isn't at all what the movie is about, thereby making its setpieces that much more intense and compelling. In these scenes Mann proves that he is a born filmmaker. Its also nice to see interesting female characters, which is so rare in this kind of film. If you want a captivating experience, check this out. Had I been a movie critic in 1995, this certainly would have made my list, with Seven, Nixon"

This film was so different, so ambitious, and it had two of the premiere actors of our times in the same film.<br/><br/>I remember doing a class project by making my own movie trailer for this film (which was pretty good, too, for I got an A), and this was the film I instantly thought of. Brilliance is never accepted in the early stages of conception, and I figure it will take years before anyone fully appreciates this film. The cinematography was top notch, the editing was strong, and the acting was excellent. (the music, though primarily ambient, was also solid) While some scenes could have been deleted in the film, it encompassed the idea of the epic, only set in modern times. So many great actors graced this film, its difficult to even name a few of them."

","Warning #2: This review contains a certain amount of spoilers. You may not want to read it if you have not already seen the movie.<br/><br/> In my opinion, this movie handles a good deal of the things I'm hoping to see when I lean back into the chair - it has action, but is not driven by it, and I would not call it an action movie. It illustrates in a good way the interpersonal relationships of people torn by their calls in life, and how two men on different sides of the law can come to respect each other. I didn't expect this to come out good, but the meeting, and the respect growing between Vincent (Pacino) and Neil (De Niro) is skillfully done.<br/><br/> A very big part of this credit is due to the people behind it allowing the story to take its time to unfold, resulting in a movie 170 minutes long - this is a good thing. It gives you time to get to know the characters, and the plot and story rarely seem hastened, as is the case with a lot of movies nowadays.<br/><br/>The length also, of course, allows for the buildup in suspense, another one of the Heat's strong sides - from Vincent and Neil not knowing about each other, via being brought to each other's attention and meeting over a coffee, to the inevitable showdown in the end.<br/><br/> And this brings me to the big downside of Heat - the ending. Suddenly a lid is put on all the suspense, and you realize that like with 99 out of 100 Hollywood movies, it has to end with the good guys winning the day and the bad guys getting what's coming to them.<br/><br/>In one way, this could be argued for: Neil ends up breaking his own rule about not letting anything or anyone get in the way of his escape when he can, as he puts it, ""spot the heat around the corner."" But mayhap his newfound love and his final decision to go for revenge rather than safety brings about his end.<br/><br/>His partner Chris (Val Kilmer) on the other hand, makes the decision to leave his wife and child behind and flee (or at least lay low), when he finds out it isn't safe to meet up with them - and as far as we know, he gets away.<br/><br/> Still though, this does little to diminish the over-all predictable element of the movie. It may not be a particularly happy ending for anyone, as all who survive have had to give something up to achieve their goals, but as so often, the hunter gets his prey, and case closed. In my opinion, this is what limits Heat and keeps it on the ""definitely a good one""-level, while falling short of - to borrow a line from ""Swordfish"" - pushing the envelope."

Actors such as Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Jon Voight are a part of McCauley's montage who will stop at nothing to take down that one last score. The cinematography in this movie was fantastic.

But Niro suspects Eady...that she has talked to the police and that they together arranged the whole thing. That's why he's running out on the field. Too bad. I really feel sorry for Eady, being all alone and left out there in the mess...and I also feel a little sorry for De Niro too.

"Rakesh Kumar","Null","0","0","16 April 2002"," Intense and exciting.
","If there are two actors in Hollywood that can make the Tinseltown beaming as proud parents of some brilliant child, it has definitely got to be Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - at least for those who had been watching movies from the seventies, arguably the finest decade in movie business.<br/><br/>Both of them had appeared in one film, The Godfather part 2, though they never shared any of the scenes together. It was the film that launched both of these acting greats' careers (alongside some earlier efforts like the first Godfather for Pacino and Mean Streets for De Niro). Both rejuvenated the Method style of acting after the industry suffered a great draught of talent in the acting department ever since Brando and Newman burst into the scene in the fifties. Great many good actors did appear in the sixties, but none of them made as much impact as Pacino and de Niro. <br/><br/>
Both of them made many good movies and save many bad movies with their performance alone, and then came the year 1995 when the whole world saw the appearance of these two in one film - Heat.<br/><br/>Heat takes the traditional cops and robbers story to a new height. While the script coughs occasionally, intentionally bending on furthering exploration on the third dimension of its characters, it is nevertheless exciting. It could have been a great action piece in the tradition of, well, any good cop and robbers movie, but dammit, this movie has, in addition to Pacino and De Niro, John Voight (midnight cowboy), Val Kilmer (Tombstone), and Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan). On top of that we have Michael Mann as the director. This guy directed The Last of the Mohicans and helped to create TV series like LA Law and Miami vice. He later directed the excellent The Insiders (also starring Pacino and the legitimate successor to Pacino and de Niro, Russell Crowe). Enough name tossing. 	 The highlight of this show is the 15minutes scene involving both de Niro and Pacino. Pacino, the cop, invites de Niro the thief, for a cup of coffee. And THAT big scene says all about these two's supreme acting talent. Both are in awe of each other, respectful and at the same time very observant of each other's thoughts. The dialogue sounds like an ordinary conversation, and it is not. It is so intense that even Pacino, who was ranting and raving throughout the show, gets quiet, now that he found a worthy adversary. The whole movie was worth seeing for this scene alone.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean that it is without some action. The initial robbery involving a security van, the shootout in the streets of LA and the final cat and mouse chase between the two leads are exhilarating, and heart-pounding.  There are subplots involving Pacino's relationship with his ex-wife, and stepdaughter, while de Niro find himself stepping out of his discipline' by getting intimate with a graphic designer. The scenes slow down the film, but add extra edge to the lead characters. Grab a video or DVD of this film. Have a good time."

","Around the middle of Michael Mann's 3-hour heist epic there is a simple scene between Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Two men sit down at a table in the middle of a stylish L.A. restaurant. On one end of the table is Vincent (Pacino), a cop who is losing his family due to his dedication. On the other end is Neil (De Niro), an expert thief who puts aside all personal aspects of his life for a score. As they two men began talking they each find out that they don't necessarily like what their doing its just the only thing they really know how to do. It comes natural to them and each of them is the best at their chosen profession. As the conversation continues Vincent and Neil begin to look more and more like two friends sitting down for a drink. They look like everyone else in the restaurant and yet they are very different breed. What makes a human being become thief or a detective, instead of an accountant?   Here lies the brilliance in ""Heat"" as it differs from every other cops and robbers movie by looking at the human nature of these people.<br/><br/>Vincent Hanna: You know, we are sitting here like a couple of regular fellows and if I have to go out there and put you down, I'll tell you, I won't like it. But if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down.<br/><br/>Neil McCauley: There is a flip side to this coin. What if you do get me boxed in and I will have to put you down? Cause no matter what, you will not get in my way. We've been face to face, yeah. But I will not hesitate, not for a second<br/><br/>A question arises when you look at movies in the crime genre. Why do we care for these criminals? We shouldn't feel anything for Butch Cassidy, Verbal Kent, or even Bonnie and Clyde but we do. It is because we go throughout the film learning about their personal lives. It doesn't matter that these people kill and rob others, they become our friends. Robert De Niro's character Neil is cold and unfeeling. His life is reflected in the way he lives, his house has barely any furniture in it. Neil is prepared at any moment to say goodbye to anything in his former life and create a new one.<br/><br/>Neil: A guy once told me, ""Do not have any attachments, do not have anything in your life you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner.""<br/><br/>It is through the meeting of a young design artist, a subtly performance from Amy Brenneman, that you see there is more to Neil. You learn Neil has traveled frequently and plans a future life away from crime. The entire cast has deep personalities and backgrounds such as this; even Dennis Haysbert's minor role of the get-away driver is given depth. The acting is solid throughout as Pacino's wild cop balances De Niro's quiet thief. The camera work creates a documentary feel and makes it seem as if you are really there. Michael Mann does not force the viewer to choose sides between the cops or the robbers and that brings realism to the movie, everyone has their problems. ""Heat"" in the end does not preach morals it simply tells a gritty story. 9.5/10 By John Francis"

"pjhuska","10","0","0","28 December 2001"," In My Top 5!
","It would seem logical that a movie with two of the greatest actors ever (Al Pacino and Robert De Niro) would have to be an incredible movie.  After all, this is only the second movie in which both have appeared (Godfather II, the other) and the first where they are together on screen.  But, the general public never seemed to take to Heat.  It did not do very good business at the box office, was not even one of the top 10 grossing movies in the year of its release (1995).  In listing the best movies ever (or favorite movies) no one will mention it.  Maybe people did not like how long it was (171 minutes is pretty long for this type of film).  Maybe there were too many other good choices in 1995 (Braveheart, Se7en, The Usual Suspects, to name a few). But, the people who have seen it must love it, because (at the time this was written) it is in IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I love this movie.  In fact, I place it on my top 6 list of favorite movies.  These may not be the best movies, but they are the ones I love to watch.  (The list, for those who are interested is, in order: The Godfather, Fight Club, Casablanca, L.A. Confidential, Heat, and Gladiator.)<br/><br/>Movies are great when characters are complex.  The two main characters, a detective (Pacino) and a thief (De Niro), are very similar.  The movie follows the two men as the thief plans for his ""last big heist"" and the detective tries to nab him.  The two seem very similar in many ways.  You can hope the thief gets away with it without feeling guilty (he is a decent person), and maybe root against the detective a little without remorse (he is an egomaniac).  They are both the best at what they do and as the movie follows their paths, you cannot help but think these two could be twins separated at birth you chose different paths.<br/><br/>The other part of this movie that I like so much is the end.  Without giving anything away, let me say this.  Most movies like to leave you with a good feeling when they are done, a great movie is unafraid to leave you a little disappointed at the end.  You will notice from my list of 6 that three of those movies do that to you."

McCauly and gang (Sizemore and Kilmer in excellent roles) try to pull off one last bank heist. However, a traitor (Kevin Gage) tips off Hanna and a mammoth firefight ensues.

","Michael Mann has brought his TV classic CRIME STORY full circle with this epic.  There is recognizable dialogue (""You do not get to watch my television set"") taken from the TV show, which is fine:  It was Mann's original work to begin with.  Mann gets superstar talent in DeNiro and Pacino in 2 men who are both without any quality of (personal) life. While both are an emotional train wreck, Pacino's Vincent Hanna, has a badge and a weekly paycheck, giving him a micro spec of stability. These are characters that could die in cliches, but Mann is too smart a director and screenwriter to get sucked into that obvious trap and he dodges the sacarine factor at every opportunity just as the cops and civilians duck hot flying lead in the now infamous Wilshire Blvd. gun battle sequence.  At 3 plus hours, you wonder where the time went. With the usual cast of ""Mann Players"" in tow, although I miss Dennis Farina being in this one, the performances carry the film.  Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore stand out in supporting roles that polish the work of 2 film icons.  One of 1995's best!"

If you want to see two brilliant actors at the top of their game, then you have to see this movie.  It is perfectly written and directed by Michael Mann, one of the best film makers today. Mann picks and chooses his projects wisely (note:  he has only directed six or seven Hollywood movies in the last twenty or so years), and they almost always differ in content (ex. this is the same guy who directed one of my personal favorites ""The Last Of The Mohicans"").

","OK, so I may be a little biased as this is my favourite movie, but who isn't about theirs ? Anyway, I'll start with character portrayal and representation. Michael Mann exceeded the 'blue-print' (LA Takedown), by taking the time to make you understand the logic behind the characters' actions, ranging from the 'main' ones (De Niro, Pacino) to ones that didn't have much screen-time, like Kilmer's wife and the black guy who was the bank shoot-out driver.  Mann didn't need to go into so much depth with this, as the 'typical' film lasts around 2 hours, but he's not the sort of director who follows traditionalism, obviously.<br/><br/>And then there's the screenplay, the score, lighting, sound-effects - I could go on, but I won't.  I'll let you watch it and make your own mind up.<br/><br/>De Niro and Kilmer in the diner still has to be one of the most memorable scenes of any film, with both of them understanding the other's actions and course of life.<br/><br/>Please watch it and form an opinion of your own though !"

And yet, we end up liking both characters, and I found myself actually hoping that DeNiro should get away free. And the end could really have been bad, I mean the whole film is a buildup to the final confrontation, but it was actually pretty OK.

","One thing's for sure: Michael Mann knows how to write satisfying dialogue. Taking a cue from older movies that featured great words and sentences, that were of course unlikely to be spoken extemporaneously, he treats the audience to diction that is smart yet unpretentious.  Not that all the dialogue is unrealistic, there is plenty of middle brow conversation, he just knows that audiences don't always want to hear what they do everyday on the screen.  Case in point: the great exchange between Pacino and Venora after he comes home 3 hours late for dinner and doesn't want to discuss his day.<br/><br/>
	Of course that's not the only instance of brilliance in this film.  The clever juxtapositions (relationships--both between men and women and friends-the separate dining out scenes; one with the cops one with the crooks and even a subtle touch such as Pacino and Deniro gouging the eyes of a combatant in different fight scenes), the enthralling scenes (the diner meeting between the tow main characters and the bank robbery-a rare demonstration of violence that is overt yet not gratuitous) and the simple intrigue that is police work all add to a spectacular work of film.

This was the most exciting action scene since the French Connection's train chase.

Possibly my favourite of all time, Heat takes the viewer on a never less than enthralling trip into the world of the cop and the robber, the hunter and the hunted. I'm not going to go into the storyline suffice to say that Michael Mann has taken a tired and seemingly unoriginal genre and slapped it around until it resembles something altogether different. (But not that different obviously.) By giving as much of the film's focus over to the criminals as the cops trying to catch them, the film achieves an unparalleled level of authenticity with each side reacting to the others best attempts of capture/evasion being one of the films great strengths.<br/><br/>It says a lot when the only criticisms that can be levelled at a film are it's length (a criticism which holds no meaning given how wrapped up the viewer becomes in it all), it's lack of action scenes (of which there are plenty for the mood of the film including one of the 'greatest' shoot outs of all time) and part of the ending (which is, I admit, a little out of character of the meticulous McAuley). But these are of little importance when everything else is so good. The acting is uniformly excellent with even Val Kilmer turning in something resembling a dramatic performance. Then of course there is the meeting of two of the most accomplished screen actors around (YES YES YES, the coffee shop scene IS as great as everyone makes out.) A haunting soundtrack ,which nobody else seems to have mentioned, direction which takes in the 'real' settings of L.A. to their most stark and startling effect, realistic characterisation and a storyline that is as unsinkable as the Titanic was meant to be all add up to make Heat one of the greatest crime flicks ever put onto celluloid.

Pacino and DeNiro are on sensational form, and although great deal can be said of Mann's restraint in their historic on-screen pairing, HEAT also packs an outstanding supporting cast who also deserve credit. Michael Mann and his director of photography display incredible cinematic technique in shooting the film, and with captivating set pieces, including the most incredible shootout in cinematic history, HEAT will satisfy all. Given its modest commercial success I feel privileged to have caught this unexpectedly profound film in the cinema. If you didn't, just thank God for DVD."

","I could not believe how excelent this film was when I first saw it for the first time. It absolutely blew me away. Pacino and DeNiro are great together, and Mann assembled a fine cast of supporting actors such as Val Kilmer and Jon Voigt. The action scenes are unforgettable in their realism as Mann brought in Andy MacNab to be the technical advisor. You can really see the military influence in the combat scenes. But what really sells the movie is the story and script. If less intelligent than ""The Heist,"" it is much clearer and easier too understand and much better. Another great aspect is the fact that there really isn't a ""good guy"" or vilain. While DeNiro is supposed to be the bad guy, you find yourself wanting him to end with a good ending for him. While the very end of the movie may not be up to scratch and not really believable, it is very good and should not discourage people from seeing it. My recommendation is not is rent it, but buy it IMMEDIATELY!"

","This was, perhaps one of the great caper films of the last 50 years, save for the ending. Rivaling Kubrick's 'The Killing' in intensity and 'Thief' in technical precision, this movie started off with a bang and kept a very real, very intense pace throughout the film, highlighted by some of the best acting performances in the careers of Portman and Kilmer. Deniro is excellent and when he's finally face to face with Pacino(first time they've had scenes together), the two play off each other as if they had acted together since the beginning. As usual, Director Mann shows he's no fool behind the lens, putting his music-video directorial sensibilities to good use, especially in the high drama action sequences. He makes good use of musicians like Brian Eno and seems to find the right music for the time. He does play fool in the ending, however, when he opts for hollywood ending as opposed to true-to-life. However, even this cannot detract too much from what truly is a gritty, interesting caper film, full of surprisingly multi-dimensional characters and a healthy blur of absolute justice. With an all-star cast and excellent directing, this movie does sizzle. I only wish there was a director's cut out there somewhere with a different ending."

","Heat is a very special movie. A perfect combination of excellent writing, superb acting across the board, and wonderful direction.<br/><br/>Watching a Michael Mann film is a fulfilling experience; rewarding the attentive and thoughtful viewer. Take one of the first scenes in Heat where we see Val Kilmer purchasing something from some hardware place. Only at the end of the scene, briefly - very briefly - do we see the explosive sticker as he walks away from the camera, blink and you would have missed it. Its that attention to story telling which is all but gone these days. Most movie directors would have told you up front without hesitation what exactly is occuring and why leaving nothing to the imagination.<br/><br/>It goes without saying the acting is top notch with the super-pairing of De Niro and Pacino. The support cast is equally good, particularly Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer (shocker), John Voight, Tom Sizemore not to mention smaller parts from Amy Brennemen, Wes Studi, Diane Venora, even Ted Levine (are you about a size 14?).<br/><br/>Although clocking in at 3 hours, I appreciate Mann's pacing. Most movies would have tied everything up after the big shoot out climax, which actually occurs at halftime. Heat utilizes location shots for every scene and L.A. never looked cooler, especially the night shots.<br/><br/>The score is also sublimely soothing, tetering on new age with the help of Lisa Gerard who also helped out on The Insider soundtrack.

"Fluig_2013","Null","0","0","15 July 2000"," A masterpiece of masculinity
","I cite this film was a masterpiece of masculinity, but as an exploration of character it does little for me.<br/><br/>Michael Mann bears comparison to John Woo: he is a fantastic stylist, great at portraying the excitingly macho world of gunplay, cops and robbers, sharp suits. The characterisation is risible though, camp to be honest.<br/><br/>It's obvious that the director wants to show he's making an effort to humanise his characters: unfortunately there's nothing humanly quirky about the methods used. Pacino as a cop obsessed with the job at the expense of a failing marriage is nothing new. The odd manic outburst is purely Pacino, and appears to have nothing to do with the character. De Niro is quiet De Niro, with a beard. When the 2 meet, fortunately it's brief, because suddenly we're not watching the characters, we're watching the actors. (Did anyone else find the dialogue here a bit of a let down?) The final loyalty of the Val Kilmer character's wife at their separation is touching, but the theme is duplicated with De Niro's character and his girlfriend. This repetition is a luxury that might have been avoided. It's a long film.<br/><br/>Any pretence at this being a serious examination of crime is lost at the beginning: a lot of the tension hinges on us believing that the criminals are formidably competent, but from the off they've needlessly executed the security guards during a raid, followed by a scene immediately after where they violently draw attention to themselves in a diner, then bungle an execution in the car park outside!<br/><br/>At the centre of the film is a gunfight with machine guns: an unpleasantly exciting experience. I don't remember hearing how many policemen die in this sequence: it probably doesn't matter. After this, we're in a revenge thriller, with De Niro mopping up the pieces, taking on the usual superhuman characteristics of the avenger. Exciting of course, but not to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>What Mann does is whip the thing along: his vision of LA is awesome, and even his interiors are energised with a super-elevated style.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have cited this film as a demonstration of the grey area that lies between good and evil. It's a film about Pacino in midlife finding prey finally worthy of himself, his equal in expertise, and the basic excitement that this hunt produces. The protagonists are joined by their indulgence in the hunt and the violence, but not their motivation, the job to be done, which makes the moral distinction."

","Most action movies subsist primarily on eye candy: lots of explosions, frenetically-edited chases, and big-budget special effects.  The soundtrack -- both music and dialog -- does little more than add a nauseatingly heavy dose of auditory sweetener to string all this together.  But Heat is a movie you can just listen to: not only are the dialog and line delivery excellent, but the music is one of the best of the action genre.  Most action movies have scores by staple genre composers such as Hans Zimmer (MI2, The Rock, Crimson Tide, Broken Arrow) that are so relentless and overbearing that they become tiresome by the last quarter of the movie.  The first thing that ought to tip you off that Heat's music is different is the exclusive use of extant music and the inclusion of works by some of the best electronic ambient artists around: Brian Eno (""Force Marker""), Moby (the amazingly beautiful ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters""), and William Orbit (""The Last Lagoon"").  Like the other elements of the film, the soundtrack is very reserved and thus more powerful because it is not overwhelming and balanced well with the rest of the movie.

","It's dense and long, you get involved in those people's lives, at both sides of the law. Although both main actors seemed to overdo their roles somewhat, everyone did a good job here: a good, tight and logical plot; credible people, each with their own strengths and weaknesses; a photography that's always in the exact focus for each scene.<br/><br/>I have one small nit to pick in this film: Robert de Niro's character, Neil McCauley, was almost a superman. He could rob a bank, an armored truck, a safe, in a perfectly staged sequence. He could pick a girl in a few minutes at a cafeteria and take her to bed within a few hours. The only way he could be caught was by betrayal. In real life, this man would not need to be a criminal. He could make much more, without the risk of spending several years at a penitentiary.<br/><br/>By contrast, Al Pacino's character, LAPD lieutenant Vincent Hanna, seemed sorely incompetent. He messed completely his own personal life, and only full time dedication, together with a good knowledge of criminal procedure, allowed him to prevail in the end. The other characters, too, seem to have one or more weak points. Only Neil McCauley is perfect, and that's why I don't give this film a perfect 10. No criminal is perfect in my opinion."

"Khaled Yafi-01","Null","0","0","3 June 2000"," Masterpiece
","The plot is simple; two men, considered as paragons in their respective fields find themselves on opposite sides of the law, and must use their expertise to outwit each other. Pacino is the driven detective, with a sixth sense for secong-guessing his nemesis, DeNiro is the brilliant thief, always one step ahead of the law. In terms of plot premise that's it, so 'Let the games begin' This film received mixed reviews; some felt the dramatic once in a lifetime on screen pairing of Hollywood's two greatest actors was a masterful stroke. Others felt the film was overly pretentious and too long to sustain the interest of the viewer. I side with the former; Heat is, if anything underrated as a film because many can't accept it's brilliance on the cinematic level. People seem to be drawn to it because of the actors and the action setpieces and nothing else.<br/><br/>To begin, the idea of pitting the 20th century's two greatest actors against each other was a splendid idea. The film plays out like a contest; each demonstarting their vast expertise as  characters and actors. Only one can stand supreme, but the finale still leaves us questioning as to who the taller man actually is. What makes Heat even more absorbing is the contrast in acting styles. Pacin o loves loud gesticulations and likes to scream a lot. He has made the overacting thing his forte and we love to imitate him. DeNiro, conversely likes to keep quiet. He seduces the audience with the looks that tell a million stories. He likes to underact if you like and this allows the two actors to play off each other superbly.<br/><br/>I beg to differ that this film is half as good without the two leads. I found the script to be exquisite; the characters are so profound and the shape and evolution of the plot is determined by these people. There is so much emphasis on the work ethic of these men and how this drive makes them more and more alienated from their families and love lives. It is a strong undertone that is being expressed here; we realize that juggling work and family is impossible. You must do one at the expense of the other. The more committed you are to one, the more you distance yourself from the other. In Heat this is expertly conveyed!<br/><br/>Timing is everything in Heat; there has to be a balance between Pacino and his brigade doing the investigating and DeNiro and his crusaders getting away. The fluency of the direction and the writing ensures that the tempo doesn't falter for a minute. My only complaint is the one you'd least expect. The big street fight between the cops and robbers is over elaborate and goes on for too long. This scene was intended to break the film in two; it divides the initial story (the build up to the job) with the second story (the getaway) and Director Michael Mann intended it to be the big butter knife that divides the two. However, he drags the scene on for too long. I always feel one should leave the audience gasping for more rather than suffocating them with everything you have to offer. It's not a big detail because the rest of the film plays out like a beautiful symphony; every note is perfectly timed and executed.<br/><br/>What is worth appreciating is, as cited, earlier, the character development. These people could have been in any number of other movies, in any number of genres and they would still have preserved their essence. It doesn't have to a a cop movie; it could be a film set on Wall Street, on a desrted island, on Mars, whatever.....It's characters are so 3-dimensional that they could be as effective and productive playing in almost any other movie. Hats Off to the writing!! It shows that this is not your run-of-the-mill formulaic cop thriller.<br/><br/>Long movies are always in fear of exhausting the viewers patience. If you are going to be long, you must make sure that every scene is worth it! This is a golden rule! Heat makes no mistakes in this area; each scene goes a long way in maintaining the integrity of the script. The musical score composed by Elliot Goldenthal is very imaginative. It's hard to descibe it and why it so efficiently complements the movie, but it does!<br/><br/>I don't know if the two leads actually like each other, but I would like to think that their relationship in the film is akin to their relationship off it. They are in competition for who is the greatest of his time, the battlefield is not big enough for both of them so only one can stand alone. Despite the conflict, they have the deepest regard and respect for each others styles and commitments. In another lifetime, they would the best of pals, in this one they must fight to the death. Fortunately, Hollywood continues to recognize the both of them and they still appear to be neck and neck in the race."

It was excellent to see Pacino and De Niro, perhaps the two greatest actors in the history of crime-genre movies, finally appear as nemeses. The fact that they didn't appear on screen together for most of the movie was also a great buildup to the diner scene. Fabulous character study between the two--it trashes the usually superficial emotive tendency to cheer for the ""good guy"" and hate the ""bad guy."" Like De Niro's character asks, ""What is normal?"" Who is the good guy? Who is the bad guy? Above all, I loved the viscerality--each of these guys is in it for the thrill, not for money or convictions. Not so for the lesser characters in the film, but this, too, feels appropriate, and throughout the movie, I felt a hair's breadth away from each character's id. The cinematography was also amazing. The gun battle in the street early on in the movie was the most gripping scene I've ever experienced, and the diner scene is also one for the ages--nothing on the screen except for two great egos matched up against each other for the thrill of the fight."

","Heat is an intensely emotional experience, culminating in a superb climax. The film boasts a highly acclaimed cast, led by Robert De Niro and Al Pacino who are two of the greatest method actors ever and despite my skepticism of the combination of so many big names in one film, each member fits into their role beautifully. Director Michael Mann has created a masterpiece: beautiful screenplay and gritty realism combine with the stunningly elegant and orchestral soundtrack to produce a thrilling crime film that is elevated out of this at times unoriginal genre to greater heights. The plot examines two men on either side of the law: De Niro as the criminal genius who never lets anything get too close to him is fascinating, and Pacino as the obsessive, dedicated detective is equally engaging. Mann cleverly unites both men at a diner - here their similarities and motivations are revealed.<br/><br/>Heat offers more to our insatiable appetites though: an intense street battle, a brilliant supporting cast, and an atmospherically charged final scene that is perfectly poised, and not over-sentimental as some declare.

","The first time I started watching ""Heat"" on the VHS I realized that something is wrong and that this isn't a traditional and classical cops-and-robbers genre, and that the film's seductive poster picture of a few masked men is just a simple promotive trick to attract the potential viewers who will surely expect a luxury of shootings, chases, fights and swearings - all settled clichees of an American crime genre. Since I didn't complete watching the movie, I rented it a few months later and gave it my full attention. I got under the skin of every replica and shot. Very soon it was more than cristaly clear what was wrong: ""Heat"" truly is a motion picture that just goes beyond the expectations of the cops-and-robbers genre and easily steams into the kingdom of movie masterpieces. Further elaborations are not necessary. ""Heat"" really is, not just because of the author's anti-thesis as the corner stone of this epic tale, ""the last crime movie"", which brings its every element, wheter it's writing, directing, acting or any other important segment of filmmaking, to complete and astounding perfection and stratified storytelling complexion which pulls the story with unbelieveble smoothness and calm, literally excelling from one shot to the next, interweaving its situations with some kind of magical, subtle and modern elevation and with juicy dialogues sharpend to the utter perfection of screen writing, surely simptomatic and authentic for the characters' surroundings and their professions. Michael Mann, probably one of the strongest and studious Hollywood directors today, breaks down the accepted thesis of life and film and asks the discussable question from which he creates the corner stone of his masterful master-piece, although remaining the exact definition of time and place of the action, and, in the end, still only fictious characters he adores so much. A parade of acting icons and Hollywood pearls shines with the foreground of picturesque characters, Pacino's appropriate mannerism and De Niro's intimistic coldness of a loner. Are there any other more suitable characters for the profiles of those two? And is there any scene in their careers that can be as historic and as fascinating as the coffee confrontation scene? The one that can, in some way, be a simbol of the plot of this unavoidable master-piece. Which is, unfortunately, the most underestimated film of the decade."

","I must admit that when I first saw Michael Mann's HEAT I was not too impressed.  However, now that I have had the chance to watch it again on DVD (twice this week), I am struck by what Mann, Pacino and de Niro have accomplished.  HEAT capably juggles many characters and situations.  It resists the temptation to go for melodrama.  Mann gives us characters and lets their lives play out on the screen.  The opportunities for extended weeping and the emotional trappings of long soliloquies are resisted even though opportunities are ample, especially when the film delves into the relationships of the characters.  The film also has confidence enough to meander through the lives of its characters--in and out of the main plot. It is a masterful case study not of crime and action, but of the lives of the people who inhabit these lifestyles as ""cops and robbers.""  Pacino and de Niro both shine in the character-types they do best--Pacino over the top, borderline maniac and de Niro as the cool and confident man of action. But it all comes down to the observation made in this film that there is no difference between these two characters on opposite sides of the law.  In fact, the de Niro character seems more admirable than Pacino's much of the time.  HEAT could easily run ten hours, and it is admirable that Mann was able to condense this film down to just under three hours and still cover the ground he does (I would love to see an expanded cut of this film). Finally, this film looks good--from cold blue nights to amazing action sequences.  One of the best films of the 90s."

Pacino bawled away in an only too typical broken marriage alcaholic cop bla de bla role, while De Niro seemed to be sleepwalking in that dull way he perfected in Casino. The action scenes, location, photography etc. was excellent but it just seemed a bloated film, the characterisation just didn't seem to work. I thought at the time that it could have done with being edited down to size. Imagine my surprise then when I saw LA Takedown (Heat's TV movie predecessor), a much tighter script and shorter film with characters who would realistically have more in common (both young talented guys, both obsessed with making some cash, getting ahead etc.) Shorter and more thrilling, LA Takedown was what Heat could have been. Mann made a big mistake re-making it using his earlier script and the big name casting compounded his errors. De Niro and Pacino carry too much baggage in Heat, they are both individually great but together they both sadly sucked. They weren't helped with an overblown boring script and a needlessly sloppy ending. See LA Takedown, avoid Heat (or see them both and wonder why oh why!)."

","What a superb show from start to finish and as good a crime thriller as I've ever seen. Heat is a film that plays upon your imagination long after the ending credits have disappeared and is one of the more realistic interpretations of the criminal mind. Michael Mann gives both sides of the divide as we see both the robbers and the police during their own get togethers with their colleagues.In fact the film's appeal stems from this, with the realism transpiring as a highly intelligent plot, a number of explosive shoot-outs and their consequences and a feeling of empathy with nearly all sides.If you are looking for non-stop action, a sky-high body count and lots of big explosions then you would be well advised to look elsewhere. Heat is one shot, one kill stuff that takes no prisoners. Gone are the days when characters were shot in the arms or legs and still fought on relentlessly or likewise the days when character went up against scores of heavily armed men, all of whom seemed to miss the hero who, by contrast, would strike a foe down every time he pulled the trigger. De Niro and Pacino are both the stuff of acting legends and both pull of stunning performances in their roles of good guy/bad guy. A simple platitude that works to great effect. Their back up cast of cops and robbers are also interesting characters and as the action progresses, their paths become gradually entwined in events that will culminate into one of the best shoot-outs in cinema history with the audience looking on and hoping their favorite will not be gunned down and realising they probably will."

He dedicates himself to his work and tries not to bring anyone down with him.<br/><br/>The scene between De Niro and Pacino typifies the similarites between the cops and the robbers. After speaking, both men truely like each other. And in the tradition of the greek tragedy, both men secretly realize they cannot change their fate, and one day they won't come home from ""work"". Their jobs are a part of them that cannot be changed. De Niro says matter of factly to Pacino ""I take down scores, thats what I do.""<br/><br/>Heat is a film with well-developed characters that is unusual in this genre. The similarities between the life of the cops and that of the robbers, are highlighted very well by Mann. By the end of the movie, you look at De Niro's crew not as mindless thugs, but as people, whose job happens to be on the wrong side of the law."

","what perhaps most impressed me about ""heat"" is how well-directed it is, an aesthetic tour-de-force in some ways.  visually, michael mann's cinematographer, dante spinotti, is extremely talented, and most impressed me with the tone of the film, which was easily established through the muted colors and grey-blue overtones apparent everywhere.  ""heat"" to me most resembles sogo ishii's ""angel dust,"" at least in terms of how drab it looked, yet there was a vitality that ran through everything.  kudos to mann also for the way in which he set up most of the violent scenes (e.g., the big shoot-out in downtown l.a.).  utterly realistic and wonderful."

This seems to be a shared opinion with many of my guy friends.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't find action sequences all that interesting... something blows up, someone gets shot, someone gets punched, and that's the end of it.<br/><br/>I fell asleep during Lethal Weapon 4 in the movie theater.  It is hard for me to care that much about what happens to a character during an action sequence when all that I have seen of him so far is his ability to handle action sequences, or maybe his sexual prowess in the occasional gratuitous sex scene.<br/><br/>I am a audience member who is begging to care about the main characters in a film.<br/><br/>Heat shows more of its characters' lives than just violence and action.  It let's us into their personal worlds and shows us their relationships with lovers and friends.  Heat makes me care about the people involved.  I like that.<br/><br/>I like for instance, that we see DeNiro's character have a somewhat awkward conversation with a girl in a diner, or Pacino's character lose his temper over his step-daughter's emotional problems.  These scenes, which my cousin would have cut out, make the characters real.  It makes them three dimensional.  It makes them people.<br/><br/>And I care a whole lot more about what happens to a bunch of people than I do a bunch of cartoony action heros.<br/><br/>This is why I hold my breath during the robbery scene, and wonder nervously who will come out on top during the final showdown between DeNiro and Pacino.<br/><br/>Heat gives me something to care about, and for that, I give it a 9 out of 10."

","How can a film starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro be bad? It really can't because they would never approve the script or director. By that I mean, they would pass. The fact that neither of them passed says something.<br/><br/>At the very least, this is a pretty good film.<br/><br/>And it is. In fact I think this will be one of the defining films of the nineties. I suspect it will be viewed in distant eras and scrutinized for clues about the American psyche, circa 1995. Some will see a fantasy glorifying professional criminals and the men who fight them. This will be true. Others will see a morality tale about good and evil played out with women in the background, but actually in the forefront of our consciousness.<br/><br/>I wish this part had been more fully developed.<br/><br/>Eady, played by Amy Brennaman, chooses the man who excites her (De Niro) and ends up with nothing (but she had an exhilarating ride). Charlene, played by Ashley Judd, swaps her men around, searching for the best deal, the one who will best provide for her and the one she can best manipulate. Justine, played by Diane Venova, cannot help but choose the workaholic super cop (Pacino) because he is so superior to any other man she's ever met, particularly to her first husband, the uncaring father of her adolescent girl. But her life will never be secure because he is always leaving her alone so he can chase criminals because that is what he really loves.<br/><br/>Some of this is a mafia-style film without the mafia. We have the same worshipful attitude toward those who thumb their noses at society and give orders that must be obeyed, super macho guys who bond together and follow the code, guys who can out shoot and out fight mere mortals. This is part of the fantasy. We see the expensive cars and the dinners with the beautiful women and the adorable children at fancy restaurants as part of the booty of being men who aren't afraid to take what they want regardless of risk. These men will always have the pick of the herd because if successful their mates know they will get a lot of the goodies of this world, and if unsuccessful, there's always the next risk taker who might succeed.<br/><br/>This is a complex film and I would have to view it twice to make sure it all fits. Being a thriller, I know off hand that it won't. Thrillers unravel. But life is too short to view this twice, so I will say I wasn't offended by the unlikely events: the fact that the touted bank robbery scene was like a war scene filmed with surround sound effects and jittery camera immersions and bullets flying everywhere-semi-plausible even if nobody seemed to run out of ammunition. The robbery of the armored truck was nicely done except that the tire-puncturing chain strewn across the street for the pursuing cop cars seemed a bit stagy, and the whole thing required the most exquisite timing. In the uncompleted break-in there was a familiar ""Mission Impossible"" tension-filled race against the clock that seemed authentic, but probably wasn't. The Los Angeles environs, especially the final scene at LAX, provided atmospheric locales that made everything seem real and immediate.<br/><br/>Where I think director Michael Mann went astray was his insistence on giving the audience the expected confrontation between the two big stars, a subplot that reached its low point with the phony bonding scene with De Niro the bad guy and Pacino the good guy having coffee together and exchanging dreams like blood brothers. This mutual admiration society was right out of some WWII film in which the American general admires the courage and cunning of his Nazi counter part and vice versa. De Niro's final line was a little corny, but Pacino's squeezing his hand reminded me of the way a big cat lovingly licks its prey after killing it. Bottom line though, Pacino and De Niro made us believe, or at least suspend judgment for awhile, and that is what Hollywood is all about.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

The performances by De Niro and Pacino are excellent, especially in how they relate to each other.  The scene where they are talking over a cup of coffee in particular brings a level of excitement without resorting to action.  But the movie was too long and had to many subplots to constantly maintain interest throughout the film.  Nonetheless the story was generally entertaining."
"DrCarol","8","0","0","11 October 1999"," Worth three hours of your time
","Yes, this movie is long and emotionally exhausting, but it's never boring. The action, when it comes, is well worth waiting for, but the primary reason for watching this movie is the characterization. Most of the reviewers have it wrong--de Niro and Pacino are not ""identical twins"" who could easily switch places even though both are absorbed in their work (robbery is a ""business"" for Neil McCauley, de Niro's character) and both have disastrous personal lives. As the Time review correctly points out, Hanna (Pacino) is high-strung and intuitive while McCauley is cool and intelligent, depending on reason rather than instinct. Both are capable of brutality but neither is innately vicious. Most viewers will like them both and have a hard time deciding who to root for.<br/><br/>Much the same can be said of the supporting characters, though the lives and personalities of McCauley's gang (especially Chris, played rather mechanically by Val Kilmer) are somewhat more fully developed than those of Hanna's crew. We're given just enough of a glimpse into the life and character of Bosko (Ted Levine) to wish to know more. (What IS he doing sitting in a bar with a tarty-looking girl on his lap, especially since Hanna is also there with his WIFE? Guess I need to watch it again to find the answer to that one.)<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, particularly the night scene where the helicopter flies by the gleaming glass towers of LA's sky scrapers. The bank robbery scene feels so real that your heart is pounding regardless of whom you're rooting for.   And of course, Michael Mann deserves credit both for his directing and for his intelligent, mostly realistic, script.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws in the movie, but this movie is worth the nearly three hours of  your time that it takes to fully develop the plot and the two main characters. The few predictable places are more than made up for by surprises throughout the movie--few or none of them implausible. There's also the satisfaction of seeing one really despicable character get what he deserves. More important, we see two seemingly hardboiled men, one on each side of the law, reveal their humanity."

The actors all take on an understated tone, nobody overdoing it, and there are scenes that allow the viewer to appreciate the surroundings.  This is a Los Angeles film, with Michael Mann showing as much of an appreciation for LA as he did for Miami in Miami Vice.  Besides, just to see DeNiro and Pacino on the screen at the same time is worth the price of a rental."
"lrecuenc","Null","0","0","25 November 2003"," Apocalyptic and highly accomplished
","I have heard of this film for ages, and I had never had true interest in watching it -I had the prejudice of an artificially fixed gimmick of De Niro and Pacino together again- until a good friend got me the DVD. I find exaggerated to say that this is one of the best 10 films of all time, but it doesn't deserve the poor 249th place of this ranking.<br/><br/>First, this film has one of the best action scenes ever: the bank robbery is one of the most powerful sequences of the 90's coming into my mind, truly spectacular stuff without relying that much on `cheap' fireworks as an average Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson action number (not to tell Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone films!!) despite the wild shooting. For me, the biggest assert of this scene is the way Michael Mann administrates tension: a robbery that could be a highlight by itself is used as an introduction, as a presentation of one of the rivals in a Western duel. The other fighter, the LAPD, comes to the screen in very effective parallel action. So far everybody has moved at his natural tempo, but only in a second, one shot, all the tension accumulated during this magnificent presentation becomes released, triggering a riot of bullets in all directions, with a very effective contrast: the scene is shot so that we get the feeling of going very fast, but indeed, the gangsters leave much slower than, as usual, `running down the street and hiding at the first corner'. This speaks of the high skills with which Michael Mann has shot this film: at every point of this story, you get the right speed, the right colours, the right camera angles, and also an excellent music score (both composed and selected), so that the action flows naturally, full of style, but without falling in pedantery or self-indulgence of author films. At this point, I see some parallelism with `The Deer Hunter': most of the typical explosion-nuts complain about the slow development of the film excepting the action sequences, precisely what makes this different from most of the beloved pyrotechnical blockbusters of today: the accurate description of two characters having so much in common in spite of their goals. This is not a standard fight in the sense of who blows off the bigger targets, but a confrontation of two extremely competent professionals from the word `go' right until the end, taking the roles to a higher dimension through an analysis of their private situations, and spiced by the stories of some of the supporting characters. You don't know how they are hearing a bully militar reading up their curriculums like in a Chuck Norris-90-minute-epo, but watching the way they handle at every situation during the 3 hours of the film. Anyway, a  big screenplay wouldn't be anything without big actors, and here is where the film ranks at the very highest: featuring an intense Al Pacino (as obsessive in his excessive acting as Vincent Hanna in lurking for his prey), the finest performance of Robert De Niro for a veeeeeery long time (in my opinion, his best work since the early 80's alongside with Goodfellas; the not-as-usual-overacted presence of this actor is just as magnetic and fascinating as in his best days back in the 70s), and very credible, top-notch performances from an all-star cast including Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, etc... The only drawback I see is that you can figure out what is going to happen at every moment, what in my case didn't matter that much because of the striking intensity of what I was watching.<br/><br/>To sum up: highly recommendable, too boring and sensible for average violence freaks, but a must for true cinema lovers."

Hell no.  It's epic, it's supposed to be three hours. Pretentious and heavy-handed?  No, it just takes itself seriously, which is only a crime if you're making a movie about Jesus.  Not enough interaction between DeNiro and Pacino?  Guess what: the script was written in the early eighties, it was actually supposed to be a TV mini-series, so they didn't center the story around the brand-name actors who would be playing the two main characters (maybe they made a mistake marketing the film as DeNiro and Pacino Sharing The Screen For The First Time Ever, but that's a marketing fault, not a fault of the film).<br/><br/>So, pair the fact that there is nothing substantially wrong with this movie (and there is something a little bit wrong with EVERY movie, even Return Of The King, with the slow-motion This Is Your Life scene at Frodo's bedside) with the fact the story is held together by some of the most underrated great scenes in movie history, and you see what I'm saying.

While watching this movie, I was constantly reminded of his hit 80's TV series, ""Miami Vice"". As many will remember, the show became a massive success not because its story line was something totally different than other Cops-n-Robbers shows, but rather because of its creative, original visual style.<br/><br/>The same logic can be applied to this movie as well. By adding a great shoot-out scene (really, one of the very best action sequences ever shot---right there with the car-chase scene from ""French Connection"") to the enhanced glitter of LA, and tossing in two of best actors of our generation, Mann has come up with a pretty impressive package. (At least, it was impressive enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire movie, which, by the way, is not a short one.) As for the story, there were a couple of ""holes"" in it and the development for the supporting characters was a bit weak, but considering the amount of attention given to the ""style"" side of the film, I can't say it came as a surprise.

","Awful. That is exactly what describes this film. I think the main problem with this movie is its desperate attempt to be meaningful, to be some sort of saga. It never is. Why ? Because it moves so slow, and because it is so predictable, and because many of the scenes are just so ridiculous and because the acting is at times so horrible. Imagine being around someone who is ALWAYS reflecting, and always melancholic, it makes you...run ! The lack of humor adds to the dark mood it creates, there is no one in this film to lighten things up. The bank robbery and subsequent shootout are breathtaking, due to really bad dialogue, incoherent action, and thousands of bullets flying without one hitting its target, and without the apparent need to reload. Of course detective Hanna manages to down one of the gangsters who, after apparently taking a head shot, but where is the blood, goes down slowly and controlled, probably because he has a hostage in his arms. The famous coffee scene...did anybody notice that McCauley uttered the exact same words earlier in the movie, in an earlier futile attempt to be meaningful ? Saying the exact same thing twice annihilates its effect. A lot of the violence simply does not make any sense, such as the prostitute being killed in the beginning, what is the point here ? There is something wrong with every single scene in this movie, it is either too slow, the cops are acting too stupid, the action is not credible, and the characters are simply never believable. The lesson to be learned: if you want to create depth, do not ever show it, but show the opposite. Heavy dialogue must be used only very very seldom, this increases its effect by a factor of one million."

Led by De Niro, a crack team of professional thieves & bank robbers have carried out a number of unsolved crimes & detectives led by Pacino are determined to bring down the ""crew"" responsible. Along the way, Pacino's obsession for his job is causing his marriage to break down. Likewise, De Niro has fallen in love with a young lady causing him to forget the maxim taught him by his criminal mentor, ""Never have anything in your life that you cannot walk away from in thirty seconds flat if you feel the heat coming round the corner"". When the two adversaries finally meet over a cup of coffee in a cafe it is a spellbinding moment. Pacino coolly warns De Niro that he intends to take him & his gang down.

Several famous actors have parts such as Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner and several others. The movie runs for just less than three hours which is about 45 minutes too long in my opinion. When Michael Mann makes movies he has a tendency to make the film drag and run a lot longer than it should be and try and make up for it by putting a scene where there is a lot of action. In Heat there is a big shootout after a bank robbery but it takes forever to get to that point of the movie.

","I remember the buzz around this movie when it came out. De Niro and Pacino on screen together for the first time. I'm not a fan of the noise around movies, so I waited until it died down. You might think that waiting 23 years was perhaps a little too long but I wanted to be sure.<br/><br/>I'm joking of course. I did see it in the '90's, not on the big screen. Probably on video. My memory of it was pretty sketchy, likely because of two things: 1) In my 20's I just absorbed everything, as people in their 20's often do. If it's the new thing, yes. If it's a classic or must-see/hear/read, yes. If it's one of those ""I can't _believe_ you haven't seen x!"", yes. And 2) Weed.<br/><br/>So I know I saw Heat back then, but apart from the armored car robbery and the eventual meeting of Bob and Al, nope.<br/><br/>I've revisited a few movies lately. I decided to watch Heat again because it's one of those movies that people refer to as a bit of a landmark of its time, beyond the heavily touted meeting of a couple of Hollywood's heavy hitters.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel that this movie would either have been a very different beast if the two leads weren't involved, or it wouldn't have been made at all. How many drafts of the script came after Pacino and De Niro signed on? Was it Michael Mann's intention from the start to anchor the movie around a third act meeting? Did the plan always involve so much needless exploration of the protagonist's and antagonist's relationships with their lovers/partners? The production asks many questions. But the story asks none. Worse, the story _may_ ask a few questions, but I don't care what they are, let alone care to try and answer them.<br/><br/>Heat is one of those movies that has you looking for the star in the EP credits to confirm your suspicion that it's a vanity project. Can't pin it on the actors, though. It's the vanity of the writer/director/producer, Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Heat is as you might expect. The two 'above the title' stars are given plenty of room to do their respective things, although you've seen them do it better elsewhere. The supporting goodies and baddies, with the exception of Val Kilmer, whose scenery-chewing turn is not helped by the fact that his & Ashley Judd's subplot is shoehorned into an already heavily domestic storyline.<br/><br/>I've not seen the original trailer for Heat, but I'm going to guess that it was more concerned with guns, explosions and action than it is with the love lives of its stars.<br/><br/>On a side note, Mann's last feature, 2015's Blackhat, was a critical and commercial failure, returning less than $20 million against its $70 million budget. Yet Mann is about to go into production for a biopic of Enzo Ferrari. By contrast, Peter Weir's last film, The Way Back in 2010, brought in $20 million against a $30 million budget, and Weir not only hasn't directed since, he's finding financing extremely difficult to come by. <br/><br/>I'm loath to make direct stylistic comparisons of the two directors. I will admit to a preference for Weir's body of work, but that doesn't mean I haven't enjoyed a few of Mann's contributions. That said, Weir hasn't made a movie as bad as Heat."

","Michael Mann's remake of his own L. A. TAKEDOWN boasts impressive performances from two powerhouse actors of the late 20th century - Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. It's a surprise that the two actors haven't been matched before, seeing that they are so alike - same age, same appearance, same intensity. Frankly, any film in which these two face a brutal showdown was going to be intense, and HEAT doesn't disappoint. In fact, it's one of the best, most realistic portrayals of criminal life since GOODFELLAS. Eschewing all-out action in favour of plot development, this is a film which really makes you care about the characters - even if they are all criminals, and murderers at that. Most of the screen time is given to showing us the parallels in Pacino's and De Niro's lives, their relationships, and gives us a character study of the two men, for whom work is the number one priority.<br/><br/>Al Pacino comes off worse in this case. Although putting in an impressive performance, this reviewer was constantly detached from his character, who basically doesn't possess a single character trait that makes him likable. He treats his colleagues and family like dirt. Yes, he might be brilliant, but at what price? The other reason for one to hate Pacino's character is because he's dedicated to catching De Niro, and De Niro is such a likable character that you don't want anybody to seriously oppose him. It's a testament to De Niro's acting ability that you end up liking a super criminal who shoots people in cold blood. It should be the other way round, surely? After Pacino and De Niro, there is a solid supporting cast of actors to fill out the roles of De Niro's criminal gang. Tom Sizemore, a family man who lives for the rush of a bank job; Val Kilmer, a hopeless gambling addict who just needs the money; and the ubiquitous Jon Voight, De Niro's shady contact. All three men are as equally as impressive as the two leads, but in a smaller way.<br/><br/>For action fans, there isn't really much in the way of gun battles to get excited about, with one major exception: the street battle between the cops and the criminals. This one lasts for at least quarter of an hour, and has to be one of the most accurate and relentless battles I've ever seen. It's very good. However action isn't really what this film is about, it's about family values, loyalty, betrayal, and honour. And who can forget the ending? It wouldn't work anywhere else but here, and it's sheer brilliance."

","Let's start with this: This is probably my favorite movie of all time, all categories. And I've seen a LOT of movies (too many).<br/><br/>It has some of the finest actors of our time together, although not in many scene shoots together maybe. It is, by far, one of the most ""correct"" movies ever made considering the characters and how they act according to their backgrounds, and certainly in their trade-craft - how REALLY professional criminals/robbers do their job. This is mainly due to Mann's attention to detail in interviewing and involving former cops, criminals, and special forces guys in the making, in everything from stances, weapon handling, clothing and equipment down to the last details, and how they walk and talk. They gave Andy McNab (former SAS) the task of producing the most efficient way to do an armored-car heist, bank-heist, and how to move a small outnumbered armed group out from an area surrounded by police (it's all SAS tactics by the book), and the result is astounding.<br/><br/>This movie is so known and over-reviewed I'm not going to say anything more, just see it if you haven't! A clear 10."
"TdSmth5","10","2","5","25 August 2012"," An epic masterpiece of modern American cinema
","Heat is among the finest 10 movies ever made. It's a classic. You can watch it nearly 20 years after it was made and it still astonishes you, every time you see it. Heat is a movie I never get tired of seeing.<br/><br/>In Heat we follow a very professional tight crew of criminals led by DeNiro's McCauley that specialize in complex high-yield crimes. In the intro crime, they are forced to hire a new guy- Waingro, which will end up being the cause of their undoing. That intro crime is also among the more thrilling crimes ever filmed. It's elaborate, brilliant, fascinating.<br/><br/>Tasked with solving the crime will be Pacino's Hanna. And he sure is up to the task, a man just as dedicated to his job as his nemesis. While McCauley is a loner and introvert, Hanna is the loud, at times funny, extrovert- and is he ever an extrovert.<br/><br/>Hanna quickly catches up with this crew and keeps track of them in secret. But, McCauley is no dummy and he catches on to the cops, in a scene that is flat out genius.<br/><br/>Hanna has unorthodox methods to say the least and one night he decides to invite McCauley for a coffee- leading to the famous face-to-face scene between DeNiro and Pacino. McCauley's character is the coolest criminal ever, and you most definitely don't want to this movie to reach its unavoidable conclusion. But for getting there you are rewarded with the most exhilarating shoot out scene put on film- following the crew's bank robbery in the middle of downtown L.A.<br/><br/>Heat succeeds on every level: action scenes- the now legendary shoot out scene; on a personal level- Hanna's marriage falling apart and McCauley finding a girl; it has plenty of memorable funny moments- Hanna visiting Alan Marciano or Albert Torena; the fantastic music- many directors pay attention to their music (Tarantino being a bad example of it) but the score of Heat is perfect; not to mention the casting from the main to minor characters, it now reads as a who's who of Hollywood.<br/><br/>What is most remarkable about Heat is the attention to emotional detail. The scene where loner McCauley looks in tenderness and disbelief the next morning at the girl in his bed is outstanding. In general, relationship are handled so well in this movie, in a mature, smart way that's not melodramatic. And the most significant relationship is the indirect one between Hanna and McCauley. They are truly meant for each other. There is a deep reciprocity in their lives. Without brilliant criminals like MacCauley there wouldn't be brilliant cops like Hanna. Hanna is married but the marriage is falling apart; MacCauley is a single and deep down lonely and finds a relationship. But both men aren't meant to live a regular life.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning is also the cinematography. This movie looks gorgeous, every scene, every setting, the fashion, the cars. There is an aesthetic sensibility here that is years ahead of the aesthetic focus in movies these days. The tone of this movie, the looks, the music, it's all so understated yet so unashamedly brilliant.<br/><br/>What makes this movie unforgettable though are the characters and the script. And there is no shortage of amazing characters. This isn't a movie that depends on one character or where one performance makes the movie. McCauley, the coolest criminal; Hanna the outrageous cop; Waingro, the vicious criminal; one could go on and on. One in particular is interesting because mysterious- Jon Voight's Nate- the man behind McCauley, pulling strings for him. What is his deal? We'll never know. A TV series based on him would have been a great idea. It's a shame that Mann's Robbery Homicide Division TV series never developed into what it could have been, a TV version of Heat.<br/><br/>There are good movies, there are great movies, and there are movies like Heat. In a category of their own."
"a1_andy_11","Null","2","5","20 February 2010"," THE best heist film ever made.
","I believe that Michael Mann wasn't completely satisfied with Thief, or perhaps he thought he could do more and improve upon the genre. He was right, there is no better heist film out there.<br/><br/>The realism of this film is one of the main reasons for it's success. The viewer is taken into this criminal underworld and we believe it all, there is no reason to suspend disbelief like you have to with so many ""Hollywood"" films out there. Ex SAS soldier Andy Mcnab was a weapons adviser to the film and in an interview he stated that Mann was completely obsessed with getting the realism of the gunfight. As many will agree, the thrilling downtown gunfight is one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Mann made LA look beautiful too, there were shots that created such a strong mood, and that complimented the characters and the moment perfectly.<br/><br/>The characters have a lot of depth too, we understand what drives all of the main cast, especially De Niro and Pacinos characters. The cat and mouse between Pacino and De Niro and his crew is brilliant, there aren't many directors who could pull off a scene where the two face off in a roadside café/restaurant.<br/><br/>Finally the ending is spot on, I won't reveal it here but it isn't something expected and works so well because of such great character development on De Niros part."

","I remember the first time I saw Heat. I was completely gripped from start to finish. The story, the characters, the performances and the score are absolutely amazing in my opinion.<br/><br/>For me Heat has some of the most emotionally powerful scenes ever. Some of my favourite scenes in the movie are the café scene - De Niro and Pacino, two living legends face to face. The scene with Neil and Eady when they're driving to the airport - you can see Neils thoughts eating him up - genius. And the scene where Neil walks away from Eady echoing what he said earlier in the movie about not having anything in your life that you can't walk away from at a seconds notice.<br/><br/>I'm not ashamed to admit that I've cried on numerous occasions during the finale and that's in no small part down to the incredible music by Moby.<br/><br/>Outstanding."

","Heat is the story of a brilliant Los Angeles detective named Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino, Scarface) and his confrontation with an expert thief named Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro, Raging Bull), as well as his crew (including Val Kilmer as Chris, Tom Sizemore as Michael, and Jon Voight as Nate). The film is more about character development than gangster action. That is part of what makes director Michael Mann's Heat the best of Al Pacino and Robert Niro's careers.<br/><br/>The performances in Heat are superb. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play their characters in such a way that you don't know who to root for and you can't tell who is the better actor. The supporting cast is strong also. The film is long, which gives it more time to bridge into several different subplots (examples: Hanna's troubled home, McCauley falling in love with a civilian, and Chris's gambling addiction).<br/><br/>Okay, now here's for the new generation. The action in this movie is great but spread out throughout the story. There is a very famous bank heist scene which follows with a lengthy shootout between the cops and criminals. Although my favorite scene is when the two rivals (Hanna and McCauley) meet face to face and drink coffee at a diner.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and fans of the crime genre will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Heat has such a reputation to it. One of best films of 1995, one of the best films of the 90s, one of the best cop/crime films made, the best film of Michael Mann's career and the first film to have Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starting in it together. It was overlooked in the Oscars 1995 when the God-awful Braveheart won.<br/><br/>Al Pacino plays Vincent Hanna, a homicide detective for the LAPD, and Robert De Niro is Neil McCauley, a leader of a crime crew who are successful at robbery. Both are men on the opposite side of the law. They fates become interlinked when Neil's crew rob a security truck and kill everyone inside. Vincent and the LAPD try to investigate the crew who are men who have been arrested for smaller crimes. Vincent sets to get them for a big crime that he know they will commit. He wonder's what they are up to and has to use every resource he can to find out, including his own wits. Neil and his crew had stolen bonds from a business Roger Van Zant (William Fichtner) who had them insured. Neil sets out a scheme to sell the bonds back to Van Zant who would make a profit on them. However Van Zant tries to betray Neil and ends up becoming a part of the criminal world. Neil also has to try and keep his crew together. Neil next big scheme is rob a bank for $12 Million, a big payoff but a big risk considering the heat.<br/><br/>What makes Heat stand a part from other crime thrillers is the investment in character. Neil is a man who has a new love interest, Eady (Amy Brenneman) who he wants to settle down with. Vincent is suffering from difficulties in his marriage with Justine (Diane Venora) because of his committed to the job, and his step-daughter Lauren (Natalie Portman) is emotionally depressed. There is Chris (Val Kilmar) who also going through marriage difficulties with his wife because of his gambling addiction, but also Neil's best friend. Trejo (Danny Trejo) is a serial rapist. Even a really minor character like Donald (Dennis Haysbert) has a backstory. Michael Mann know how to write. They is a hell of a cast, and not just Pacino and De Niro. Many of the actors involved are at the top of their game. Even Val Kilmar is good in this film.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is a great director and it's easy to see why in this film. He shoots with really style with his quick camera work and excellent editing. Mann keeps the tension going through the film, gets the best out of his actors and knows how to shoot action scenes.<br/><br/>Heat is a modern classic and should have been noticed by the Academy."
"Crane_94","9","2","5","23 August 2008"," An excellent and intelligent movie
","The two leads, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are dynamite. Pacino and De Niro have played plenty of cops and criminals in their respective careers and this would have to be a major highlight in their impressive filmographies. Al Pacino portrays Vincent Hanna as an intelligent, tough, no-nonsense, obsessive and relentless yet flawed character. Vincent might be a highly decorated cop, but he is so consumed with his work, that it takes its toll on his personal life. He has been divorced at least twice, his daughter is messed up, and his third wife is ready to divorce him. It shows that his job as a cop is his entire life. He's not the type of person to sit around all day. Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley is more restrained than his other characters in the past (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear). Neil McCauley though a career criminal, isn't portrayed as such a bad guy. He is portrayed as a human being with a life. He too, has a personal life which is parallel with Vincent's. He is intelligent, precise, violent and private, though he is lonely and does not have any attachments in his life. The only friends he has are the other criminals he works with and the love interest in his life which plays a big part in the movie later. Val Kilmer is actually pretty good in his otherwise hit-and-miss career. Other supporting actors including Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson and Ted Levine are solid and this keeps the strength of the movie together."

","Michael Mann wrote and directed a film that must have wasted miles of film - there were so many scenes in ""Heat,"" I could hardly watch it. So many, in fact, it was difficult to keep-up with the story. That means I shall have to watch it again.<br/><br/>Al Pacino's (""Lt. Han"") frantic actions wore me out. De Niro's character (""McCauley"") had a calming effect, but the only scene I thought was worthy of his talent was the scene in the restaurant, talking to Pacino. Kilmer's role (""chris) was excellent and insistent. Jon Voight (""Nate"") did what he could with what he was given to do. It's so sad this great actor does not seem to be able to find a role to show his range of talent.<br/><br/>Of course, the action in the film pleased everyone who likes all that loud stuff. The special-effects were great, and the stunt-folk must have made a fortune.<br/><br/>I'm glad that so many people commented on ""Heat."" BUT, there are so many other films exactly like it, the story gets lost it all that fire-power. Perhaps I'll get more from it on the second watching. I gave it a ""10"" because it all came together, although it was very predictable. I liked the touch of closeness at the end......showed a touch of humaneness, even with so much violence."

","When I first saw Heat, I was too young to understand the detailed battle between the ""flip sides of the same coin."" Now, after watching it almost a dozen times, I believe history may look at this movie as the best and most personal film of Michael Mann's career. The flaws are there, but this is an example of a movie so big and splendid that it is capable of gobbling up its own missteps (like Ashley Judd's performance). The style, while not overwrought, really brings Los Angeles to life. This is a sprawling movie with a sprawling cast that could easily suck if it weren't for Mann's obvious visual talent (Michael Bay of Bad Boys fame could take a page from the Mann book of cinematic style) and the great acting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. This film will always be in my ""top five."""

Its supported by an all-star cast (Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman ...) and is directed by Michael Mann.<br/><br/>Due to Mann's style, the LA surroundings and photography are fully utilised, creating a visual backdrop second to none, and not just serving as pleasant on the eye but also plot devices throughout.<br/><br/>Sure it's a cop flick, but more than being about the cat and mouse antics of the cat and mouse style story, it is an explicit snapshot of human nature and choice, it is a compact summary of what Mann clearly views as the mechanics of everyday occurrences placed under extreme stress. The subplots to each character is complex and twisted with each is a powerful subtext, which is not fully revealed till the last shot has been fired in the closing scene.<br/><br/>Simply stated, this film is genius. Managing to manor around the simplicity plot holes of the 'cop' genre, Mann has created a stunning canvas of human life and emotion second to known, which is kind to the eye yet persistently juxtaposing the viewer's perspective."

","""Heat"" is really an extraordinary movie. The crime story is not only one of the best written but also extremely strong directed by Michael Mann (""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Manhunter"").<br/><br/>It twists around the bank robber Neil McCauley, played by Robert De Niro (Academy award winner - ""Raging Bull"" (1980)), and his magnificent chaser Lt. Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino (also Academy award winner for ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992)). They both produce two of the most remarkable and stylish characters of all times, which is due not only to their great actor skills and abilities but also to the chemistry between them. They also have a strong structure to step, created by the supporting cast which includes noted names like Val Kilmer and John Voight.<br/><br/>For the connoisseur of cinema this movie is absolutely flawless. According to the mass spectator, however, it has one main disadvantage  ""Heat"" is really heavy stuff, and because of this it is not very dynamic but trying to create strong and complex characters and plot and going deeper into human mind and different point of views. From one moment you won't be able to distinguish who is the bad guy and who is the good one. It is so emotional for it is made extremely close to reality as if making you a reluctant witness of a real event. And then the final will leave you speechless.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is like a gem among the crimes and it is obligatory for anyone being a movie fan."

Sure, there are excellent movies like ""Narc"" and ""The Departed"" every now and then, but for the most part, there is nary a superb cop film to be found. It's times like these where we should hope that filmmakers take extra notice of Michael Mann's crime masterpiece, ""Heat"", which was the definition of the perfect cop movie(or cops and robbers movie). Mann's 3 hour epic was nothing short of brilliant. The casting was wonderful considering that the main stars are Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, and Jon Voight, and the writing was poetic, philosophical, and witty. Plus, the film leaves us in awe. It's ironic how *spoiler* the ending should be a happy one given that the good guy wins, but that is hardly the case since we end up caring for both the cop and the robber. As a result, Mann makes what should be a happy ending on paper, into a tragedy. ""Heat"" is a timeless masterpiece and is proof that poetic dialogue beats generic dialogue anyday!"

"diesel_100","10","2","5","21 January 2006"," Michael Mann at His Best
","Heat is almost a perfect movie. The score, cinematography, attention to detail, research and continuity are flawless. The plot is excellent and the acting nearly without peer. Mann created a picture with not only the protagonist and antagonist providing counterpoint, but also, the supporting characters as well. Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, et al. give this picture an amazing texture.<br/><br/>My plot critiques are minor. First of all, Neil (DeNiro) would have never, ever gone after his nemesis, Waingro. He was too disciplined. Neil would have completed his escape and visited his revenge at a later date. I've thought about Neil's decision from the perspective of the element of a ""tragic flaw"", but that theory does not hold up. Neil's behavior never hinted of such a flaw in the 2 hours and 45 minutes leading up to Mann's bad decision.<br/><br/>The end of this picture should be different, but until the end, the nuance and irony in Heat's plot are fantastic. E.g.: Neil sows the seeds of his own destruction by being greedy. Had he not tried to get more money by selling the proceeds of the first heist we see, in a manner that deviated from his tried and true standard operating procedure, the feud with Van Zant would have never happened and Waingro would have been out of the picture and unable to blow the bank job. Another great plot outcome: by killing Waingro, Neil unknowingly takes a serial killer off the streets. He does Vincent's job for him. What was Mann saying here? Another outcome that is beautifully ironic: Chris is the only thief who escapes with millions from the bank job, but we know that the proceeds from the score of a lifetime will not last because of Chris' degenerate gambling addiction. Chris also immediately loses what he values more than the millions, his wife. ""The sun rises and sets with her []"" he tells Neil.<br/><br/>My performance critiques are minor. Amy Brenneman strained somewhat attempting to affect some sort of regional accent. Also, in the scene where Neil is considering buying the bank package from Kelso, DeNiro is obviously reading a cue card. Later, when he confronts Judd in the motel, the scene was over rehearsed and feels awkward.<br/><br/>Aside from those minor missteps, too many great performances were overlooked by the Academy and critics: Judd, Kilmer and Voight for certain. Recall that in 1995, Kevin Spacey won the Oscar for ""The Usual Suspects"" and Mira Sorvino won for ""Mighty Aphrodite""; none of Heat's supporting cast was nominated. Further, Mann was once again ignored; the director of ""Babe"" was not. The screenplay, cinematography and editing were also snubbed. Should we expect any different? Probably not.<br/><br/>Awards never validate a movie, of course, and in the case of Heat the lack of industry awards and box-office ""success"" does nothing to diminish what may be Mann's best movie. This is a must see."

Also,the ending is way too sentimental and the whole Waingro/serial subplot should have been left on the cutting room floor. Just wondered if anyone else out there thought this film did not deserve the heaps of praise (Collateral is way better in my opinion) Great Moby track though. Also, how realistic was it to have De Niro and Pacino sit down in a coffee shop for a chat--why not just set in the police station?

Good choice, lady.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the movie is interminable: two hours and 49 minutes.<br/><br/>There's plenty of automatic weapons fire, scores of wrecked vehicles, and many gallons of blood, if you like that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Everyone at the time of the film's release was all hyped to see DeNiro and Pacino together as a bad guy and a cop, but to me, there is no chemistry. The one scene in which they meet in a restaurant and talk is promising, but it falls flat. They recite their lines and try to make it convincing, but that particular moment in the film made me realize how little investment they had in these roles.

The movie plays out well, but has so many slow parts that you need to drink beer or wine just to make it through!<br/><br/>It took me 3 days to finish this moving, pausing it once per day.<br/><br/>Warning: Only watch with snacks and beer or wine or spirts."

","If I was told that I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life then Heat would be that movie.For me its an easy answer to a hard question. Why?I hear you ask and these next few paragraphs will answer that question and hopefully entice you to watch this masterpiece if you haven't seen it before.<br/><br/>Thiefs want to steal,cops want to catch thiefs,thiefs plan major heist to end their careers of crime,cops investigate thieves for information on upcoming heists and any other crimes that could put thieves in prison,cops and thieves have showdown during or after heist. That there is the formula used for 99.9% of heist movies its a proved formula that works so no need to change it right?Right!!...Heat follows the same heist structure as those before it so you will know what to expect of the plot and thats where comparisons to movies before and after it end.Now if you're expecting me to talk about the brilliant downtown shootout when Pacino interrupts Deniros last heist which is possibly one of the best gunfights to grace the screen,you're wrong.The actions superb and one reason its in a league of its own and is obvious from the first viewing,what made me decide to move Heat from my 4th favourite movie to #1 spot didn't hit me until my 20th+ afternoon with Waingro. Unlike other cops and robbers movies that grab you firmly by the wrist and drag you around its world,leaving you with the group of characters they want to succeed and want you to feel the same,not letting go until the credits roll but not in the world of Heat.Michael Mann lets us the viewer choose who we want to succeed over the next 3 hours not who he wants us to root andis achieved with a script that takes us into the world of each of thr lead characters,where we get to know and understand them,see them develop for good or bad which is made easy with a script that doesn't favor one lead more than another.Either way the end result of Heat will not have you feeling disappointed or victorious as you put the DVD back on the shelf,that will happen in the upcoming hours when you realise that you had chosen a side without really knowing so because the movie gave you freedom to do so.Well thats what happened to me anyway.<br/><br/>Michael Mann achieved the perfect filmmaking trifecta in 1995,watertight script,sublime directing and a cast committed to bring each character from his pages to life with even the minimalist role played to perfection.An ensemble cast of ACTORS that from memory is yet to be rivalled and I hope no one mutters the Oceans 11 franchise as my retort to that is the use of capitals for the word actors.

","""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.""<br/><br/>In Michael Mann's epic crime drama ""Heat,"" the thin blue line grows thinner by the minute. The centerpiece of Mann's film isn't a showdown at high noon, but a conversation over a cup of coffee featuring two expert tradesmen on opposite sides of the law who satisfy identical impulses through opposing means.<br/><br/>Set in contemporary Los Angeles, ""Heat"" stars Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, a prolific, cold-as-ice career criminal. Al Pacino is Vincent Hanna, a homicide/robbery detective with the LAPD who recognizes the work of professional criminals and spends the film's three-hour duration tracking down McCauley and his crew. When Hanna and his unit of detectives begin to pick up McCauley's trail, a cat-and-mouse game develops between the two men. Two expert tradesmen on opposite sides of the law, a virtual dance if you will, keeping in step with one another.<br/><br/>Neil McCauley has enough money to get away and becomes deeply attached to his girlfriend Eady (Amy Brenneman). Neil decides to leave his life as a criminal in the past and move to New Zealand with Eady after one last major heist. Lieutenant Hanna is now obsessed with taking down McCauley, and his devotion to the case makes his private life a disaster zone. For both men, their unrelenting commitment to their profession leaves the only other people in their lives in a path of devastation and abandonment.<br/><br/>""Heat"" fits the classic definition of a film noir -- the conventions and elements from the hard-boiled detective to the urban setting, the interplay of lights and shadows in the final scene, to the neon lights illuminating the dark corners of Los Angeles. There's a certain uniqueness to the mood of the film achieved by its icy-blue palette which sets the atmospheric tone. Some films are great primarily because of the visuals, others we appreciate for the rich characters, sharp dialogue, or an entertaining story. Rarely do we get a combination of textual and visceral elements fitting the same grand theme of a film, which in this case is loneliness. Both Neil and Vincent are consumed by their work and inherently lonesome, and the same is true for Mann's representation of Los Angeles. It's one we've never laid eyes on before, depicted as a silent milieu of isolation; a car driving along on an empty highway, the flickering city lights on a soundless night, an empty apartment reflecting on a endless ocean, the lights of an airport runway fading into darkness.<br/><br/>When Hanna's incessant pursuit finally catches up with McCauley, the result is one of the most well executed heist scenes in film history. Mann masterfully builds the tension and intensity with the use of montage editing. Above all, the dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking: They are eloquent, insightful, fanciful, and even poetic when necessary.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is a crime drama masterpiece -- stunning cinematography by Dante Spinotti, a cast of characters that speak for themselves, an engaging storyline, and fantastic action sequences. Disregard Neil's advice, and don't walk if you see the heat coming around the corner."

","Real life does not divide all humans into good guys and bad guys and neither does this movie. The cops are a fellowship of dedicated men led by a loser who is so determined to perfect his craft that he has destroyed his three marriages. He has no friends and the only person he does not shout at is the head of the robbers. The gang of robbers are all individuals. They are honest with each other but do not hesitate to murder a guard who saw too much. So who are the good guys and the bad guys? There is a set of characters who are REALLY bad. The women are all individuals with their own hopes and lives. None are cops. One wonders if the fellowship of the homicide squad would have deteriorated if one of their numbers had been a woman. Do not miss this film. I recommend you see it twice, the second time you can appreciate the characters and the events without worrying about what happens next."

The scene itself is extremely realistic as you see the emotion on everyone's face, you see the bullets shredding through everything. The fact that the movie had already done a thorough and quick way of bonding us with the characters so quickly, and immediately putting them in such an extraordinary scene which is ordinarily found at the end of almost every movie... So many perfect performances and production moments all combined, put the viewer in a state of awe at what they just witnessed. This hooks the viewer and pulls their attention for the entire movie.

Both DeNiro and Pacino are exceptional, and fit into their respective roles like two gloves on opposite hands.<br/><br/>This is not one of your run-of-the-mill, materialistic action films intent on impressing its audience with over the top pyrotechnics or car chases. These elements are there, but do not take centre-stage. Instead Mann delivers an insight into the relationships and lives behind the two men, building complex, yet refined characters that transcend their macho persona.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and was completely hooked for all 3 hours. With every scene this film delivers, it takes the simple premise of cops and robbers and expands it to deliver the most accomplished thriller I have seen in a very long time. Watch it, you will not be disappointed."

","When cops and robbers square off in the city there's a deluxe of human intrigue and drama to be on display; when Al Pacino and Robert De Niro face off on-screen in Heat there's solely cinematic bliss. These two Hollywood heavyweights carry their weight to help create a classic good guy vs. bad guy telling. Heat stands as one of our finest crime-dramas. It has great directing, great writing and supreme acting. The acting is as good as it gets. The cast assembled rivals most any movie. De Niro and Pacino are both awesome in their lead roles. Val Kilmer is outstanding, like he often is, Ashley Judd makes her mark here and Jon Voight delivers some polished acting grit. I must mention a young Natalie Portman who reveals her brilliant acting aptitude in limited screen time. Michael Mann does a terrific job behind the camera. His direction is sharp and poignant. Mann's style is very effective for the course of this movie and he really excels during the action sequences. Heat has a very good story. The primary plot is excellent, but some of the supporting plot lines are lacking. There are lingering scenes scattered throughout. Heat's intensity wanes in and out, and it does not quite sustain a desirable level of suspense throughout. Though the good scenes are so, so good. The diner scene presents the greatest clash of actors ever seen, Al and Bobby, toe-to-toe. This thrusts right into the bank heist scene. Be prepared to get blasted in the face as the most captivating and spectacular gun shootout scene ever seen unfolds between De Niro's crew and Pacino's task force. Once Heat picks up, it becomes enthralling. A can't miss. Do yourself a favor and go watch this movie if you haven't already. It's great."

","Oh mama! What a drag this film is. I could only stomach around an hour before I had to switch this off. You just don't get drawn in and it's like being at work watching the clock waiting for 5pm. Sorry but I think Robert DeNiro is the most overrated actor in history. He was great once in a film called Taxi Driver and been living off of that ever since. Not to say he hasn't been in some good films but they were good in spite of not because of him. He is the dullest, flattest, clichÃ©d, wooden, self conscious, one dimensional actor ever. For some reason he's been MADE 'great' and now everyone just repeats what they've been told. Pacino is a great actor but in this (probably his worst outing) he over acts and you constantly feel you're watching Al Pacino. I'm not a film maker and so it's hard to say why this doesn't work but it doesn't. Something to do with an inability to empathise with any of it. It's drama by numbers.

","McCauley (De Niro) is a mastermind criminal, who plans heists around the Los Angeles area, whilst being tracked down by Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) - a homicide detective in the Los Angeles Police Department. Whilst Vincent is occupied with his job, he is also dealing with his wife cheating on him and his daughter's poor mental health.<br/><br/>Based on a real story of a Chicago detective tracking down an ex-Alcatraz inmate, the story retains many elements that make it more believable and real for the audience, grabbing our attention from the very beginning to the end. Although there were moments where the film went on for a bit too long, considering its' 170 minute run time, as the ending began to unravel, the tension and the drama kept me glued to the screen until the very end.<br/><br/>The Dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking, in the well-known diner scene with De Niro and Al Pacino, they just talk about their situation how it is, and they both understand that only one of them is going to survive until the very end. The characters are not trapped within clichÃ©s and the dialogue proves that, showing us that unlike the real world, they are able to tell another person exactly what they feel."

Nothing comes close to Heat, its among my top films, its tough one between this, Braveheart and Shawshank. All movies made in the same time, the 90s were the greatest decades of Hollywood, actors that gave a damn because life meant something, it wasn't about artificial things and popularity, it was about the acting, the times those actors lived, the feelings they had inside, the vision they saw of life.

"Lejink","8","1","2","28 July 2017"," Good cop bad guy / bad cop good guy?
","The attraction of this film is obvious in the star-power of its twin leads Pacino and De Niro. Having both come through the 70's and 80's with many career-defining roles with Al usually on the side of the Angels and Bob down with the Devils, this film can be seen as at least a semi-colon if not quite a full-stop to these actors playing these types of parts again. Myself I wouldn't have thought Michael Mann the director to get them in the same movie (even if they only meet up in two scenes), as my preconceptions of Mann back in the mid 90's pretty much begin and end with TV's style-over-content ""Miami Vice"", meaning I was expecting over-exaggerated characters, extreme situations, improbable connections, loud background music and of course lots of gunpower and violence. Well I got them all, but somehow, overblown and unbelievable as it was, as a movie it still worked.<br/><br/>Mann plays up the duality of these two brilliant but idiosyncratic men, Pacino's Vincent Hanna and De Niro's Neil McCauley on different sides of the law and enables us to look behind the tough-guy personae to at least glimpse their lives away from crime only to discover that these two don't have a life outside the commission of crime by one and the prevention of crime by the other.<br/><br/>Switch leads...? I don't think so. Pacino plays the all-powerful cop in his typical shouty, showy way while De Niro depicts the cool-headed, resourceful crook in his more understated but still highly characteristic way. The main scene where they meet and establish a reluctantly conceded mutual admiration is probably the film's best, two peacocks parading their feathers in front of each other. Of the supporting cast, Val Kilmer makes a big impression as the gun-happy young Maverick in thrall to his boss De Niro and while I don't know much about the two actresses who play the main protagonists' women, both more than hold their own in their scenes with their men. <br/><br/>Of course, with Mann you get big set pieces, superbly staged, with the centrepiece being the bank heist that goes spectacularly wrong and ends up a high-volume shoot out in the shopping mall but there's also De Niro's revenge hit on his gang's snitch and the tense final shoot-out between the big two. Mann's cinematography throughout treats L.A. as almost a character in the movie with numerous night-time city-scapes as De Niro and his new girl seek to somehow rise above what they are and escape their pasts while Pacino is frequently seen in a police helicopter zooming in and out of the city's skyscrapers as he tries to keep a lid on the rampant crime on his beat. Hand in hand with the stylish visuals goes the use of music to add further shade and drama to proceedings with a suitably dense, Gothic soundtrack which almost elevate the film to a modern day grand opera.<br/><br/>It's arguable whether Mann, De Niro or Pacino were ever this good again with all three since then making movie choices they surely would regret in hindsight if they'd thought or cared much about their own legacies. But as late-career artistic hurrahs go, this is about as good as it gets, I'd say."

","At first seeing the almost three hour duration, I thought this movie would take it all up to mostly unnecessary scenes. Yet the story nicely fills all the void that I now understand why Michael Mann took that long for this movie. All the characters, the many of the significant ones, get enough coverage that none of them feels like just a cardboard cut-out. All the interactions feel natural and the criminal craft looks pretty much true to reality. The action looks great; it gets very much suspenseful and also went to a grandiose level few movies nowadays would go to. One thing made the action scenes seem stupid is the perception of how many bullets can an assault rifle carry. With the rate of how the robbers shoot their rifles in full-auto mode, they should be changing magazines more often. The acting is a great job in overall. both Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro did remarkably stunning work, and their face off scenes are the best of this movie. Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo and Tom Sizemore did great also in filling for the story angles."

DeNiro makes a living doing heists with his crew, but it all goes wrong when one of his crew mates loses his temper and kills a couple guards during an armored truck run. In comes Pacino, assigned to the case. The movie becomes a cat and mouse chase as the bad guys keep doing crimes, and the good guys stay just a little behind. The other side to these stories are the dramatic relationship between girlfriends and protagonist. Standard relationship stuff, with Pacino even having a depressed stepdaughter with an absent dad. Unfortunately, though the acting in this film is great, this film suffers from unoriginality. It is tired storytelling with the only redeemable thing being the casting being strong therefore allowing the acting to be there. I was not a fan.<br/><br/>7/10"

This to me was a fatal flaw in the film and I thought (This one's for the writers) De Niro should've escaped with the booty, never to be seen again. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just astonishingly amazing with Al Pacino playing a cop in a strenuous marriage.

","The sorts of characters, and it is mostly low-lives, that inhabit Michael Mann's 1995 crime film opus are serial killers; thieves; ex-cons and gamblers, even those who aren't immediately applicable to those particular tags carry their own traits and flaws, one that'll see them get into hot water at some point in the piece. But to tell someone the film is possessed by these sorts of characters, however true it might be, would still be somewhat misleading as this is not the freak show of circus side-acts and dumbed down criminal caricatures one might initially think. Mann's film deals with some raw content from both sides of the law, content born out of various individuals' relationships with wives, partners and children; content born out of why it is what they do and how it can have as much-an affect on their private lives as it does their own lives.<br/><br/>I read that it took Mann years to get the film made, doing what was perceived as a 'dumbed down' version via 1989's L.A. Takedown in the mean time. This was before Scorsese's Goodfellas arrived in 1990, a film that took the villain of the American crime film genre and fleshed him out to the point of skeletal in his being stripped bare, in doing so spawning a number of American crime films which enjoyed, within reason, deconstructing what were otherwise hard-bodied, villainous archetypes within a genre and getting under their skin in what they do, how they speak and how they operate. Nowadays people come away from such films remembering, indeed either relating to or liking more, the crime-infused villain more than anyone else, particularly if there is a 'just' co-lead. De Niro's character here joins a long list that sees mostly everyone from Liotta's Goodfellas character; to Jackon's in either Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown; to one of the two kidnappers in 1996's Fargo; right the way through to 2008 and Ledger's recent turn in The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>But that isn't to say crime or a criminal lifestyle is glamorised in anyway, particularly in Heat. There is a beautifully observed sub-plot, nothing more than a mere diversion which has about five total minutes of screen time, utilising a character who has just got out of prison and is beginning a crummy job at a burger joint cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Later, they are given a proposition which will lure them back into the world of crime and violence. The point here, in this brief span of sub-narrative, being that everyday work is long and arduous, while you have an initial choice in which career you take - but a life of crime, no matter how appealing or alluring, will take its toll on your life. Although the use of an African-American to enforce this point in the film may have garnered some criticism in the past.<br/><br/>The film centres around a 'crew' of thieves, in which the leader is seemingly Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, as enforced when they stand around following the realisation that the police are onto them and each of them seem to look to McCauley for guidance: a blurry eyed Michael Cheritto (Sizemore) somewhat weakly exclaiming ""Whatever. I'm with you."" to McCauley when faced with a predicament that will either change his life or end it. The others are a gambling junkie named Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) and a Mexican named Trejo, played by Danny Trejo. On the flip-side of the coin, Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a serial crew foiler, attempts to rid Los Angeles of McCauley's crew in taking them down. This is perhaps where the inspiration for the title of the 1989 version of the film derives; harking back to my earlier point, the title of this film: ""Heat"" derives more from the criminally minded of the two sides, in particular McCauley's ideology of walking out on anything and everything if you smell the police (heat) closing in. <br/><br/>This shifting of the title of the film from 'Takedown' (Police standpoint/goal) to 'Heat' (Criminal standpoint/ideology) only emphasises the post-Goodfellas idea of bringing everything round so that there's more of a weight on the fact the 'bad guys' are, at the end of the day, human as well. The film is polished, its mostly night-set cinematography decked out in navy blue, but its idea of a life in crime is quite ugly. The stark, harsh font used in the opening credits is metallic and uneasy on the eye; thus juxtaposing the 'look' of the film. It is a film that'll see the thief interact with a women in a loving manner, whilst at a book shop of all places, in a sequence that is soft and melancholy in its construction, before sleeping with her; but then cut to the police badgering and bullying a scrapyard employee. In another piece of work, the scenes would've stuck but the roles might've been reversed to enforce the inhumane and hard-bodied nature of the gangster and the good-hearted, kind, loving and melancholy nature of the chief cop.<br/><br/>Heat essentially sees two individuals at the peak of their game go against one another, with whatever they have in the form of backup tailing them around. The fates of those on either side range from potential injury during full blown, breath-taking shoot outs with automatic weaponry in the streets of the city to more smaller things, such as a member of a SWAT team accidentally bumping into the side of a truck trailer, thus alerting the thieves to their presence. It's a film about crime, violence and procedure; but it is additionally concerned with genre archetypes as human beings, those whom feel; dream; realise flaws and balance marital issues. As far as attention to the intricacies of both character and plot go, as well as a number of other film-making conventions, Heat is a really creditable effort."
"cybersrfr1287120","10","1","2","22 January 2005"," True cinematic artwork
","I can honestly say that in terms of style, this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The way Michael Mann weaves two sides of the law together and puts in the perfect amount of action, superb performances by Pacino, DeNiro, Kilmer, Sizemore, and every one else, it is just an amazing piece of work. It is simply one of the most entertaining and satisfying movies ever put on screen.<br/><br/>Think I'm exaggerating? Name one other movie that has been able to so stylishly film an action sequence (the bank robbery shootout) that not only is captivating and intense, but is so real in the sounds of the gunshots, the buildings of downtown LA, the routines of the policemen, the reactions of the people, and again the performances of the actors.<br/><br/>Can this even be considered an action film? The action is so stylishly done it is Kurosawa with guns, and is so thrilling at the same time. The only other film in recent memory that has modern gunfights in such a stylish way is Ronin, but this movie has such a deep and rich plot that it far surpasses any other action movie of the last 20 years.<br/><br/>I can say no more without repeating myself, only to say that to claim to be a movie enthusiast, actor, or the like and not see this movie (and the amazing cinematic experience that has made me a huge Michael Mann fan) is like being a sculptor and not witnessing Michelangelo's Pieta."

","Heat's plot can be best summarized when it is compared to a heated boxing match. There is no clear bad guy and good guy; both men certainly do not hold up to practical moral standards and both men are fighting for a justifiable cause. They are merely in a battle because they are doing what they do best; and somebody is standing in the way. And the battle is continued until a victor has been decided.<br/><br/>And it works beautifully. Pacino and DeNiro managed to play off each other as good as the promotions would have you think, though that should be no surprise. A huge list of credible actors add even more to the astonishing mix. Great music (especially in the credits) gave the final touch to a film that should be regarded as one of the best cops and robbers movies of all time."

The ones standing out most being val kilmer, tome sizemore, jon voight, ted levine and a small but powerful part by dennis haysbert.<br/><br/>Alongside the solid cast there is the brilliant storyline that gets you feeling for both de niro and pacinos characters as well as all the other actors.<br/><br/>WARNING FROM HERE IN THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>The bank shootouts is to me by far one of the best gunfights ever. the fact that not many casualties happen makes it a lot more realistic yet casualties are still suffered and sadly its ted levine and tom sizemore that are lost two of my favourites in the film.<br/><br/>Definitely for everyone who likes a good action film with a solid story and cast this film is for you.<br/><br/>Mickey"

","A lot already has been said, so very briefly some lose points:<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie reminds me of the atmosphere in Hemingway's novels: ""You understand this because you are a man.""<br/><br/>The movie looks great. Nice pictures. Real slick. The same goes for the music. Really sets the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>The two main roles are acted out very well. Many other characters are very flat, but that didn't bother me.<br/><br/>The storyline is absolutely not credible, but hey, who cares. I don't think that was a goal of the writer anyway.<br/><br/>The thematics are not nobel prize material, but should be challenging even to an intellectual person.<br/><br/>My opinion: a classic in the action genre."
"A_Coprophiliac","10","1","2","9 October 2004"," Michael Mann in a candy store (Possible Spoilers)
","This movie is excellent. If you don't like reviews that talk about how good movies are then go somewhere else. Let's get the whole Robert De Niro/ Al Pacino thing out the way first. Yes they both give terrific performances but it is near impossible to decide who gives the definitive performance. Al Pacino is on top form in all his Hoo-haa glory, chewing up almost every scene he's in. Robert De Niro also gives one of his best performances, so suitably subtle in the role of Neil. Both characters are driven by obsession, both professionals, both will not stop until the job is done. The character, I feel, that has the most depth is Neil. It is not enough just to get the job done but he feels it necessary to tie up all the loose ends as well, which is ultimately his downfall. He focuses on nothing but what he has to do like a laser beam on a specific point- witness his house, an unintentional post modern, empty, hollow space, much like Neil's life. He wants to have something in his life that can make sense and have meaning, and that's where Eady (Amy Brennemann) comes in. Of course, this doesn't end to well with Neil driven by his principles to leave her. Vincent (Pacino) also has depth but he is more aware of the things that drive him than Neil is of himself. He's your typical cop on the edge but with a twist, he's been married three times, a step daughter with problems (Natalie Portman) that favors him over her real father, again driven by an obsession to get his job done. Rather than waiting for help, he chases Neil through the streets of L.A. when a friend of his, Bosko (Ted Levine) is shot.<br/><br/>Heat is absolutely a character piece, it's the character's that drive heat, not the plot. But let's not forget the outstanding supporting cast, without their supporting character arcs, most of Heat would not have happened. What if Chris (Val Kilmer) hadn't been shot, would he have got away? What if, the aptly named, Trejo (Danny Trejo) hadn't been surrounded by the cops prior to the bank robbery would Neil and the gang have got away? If the problem with Waingro (Kevin Cage) had been taken care of earlier would Neil and the gang have got away? What if Donald Breedan (Dennis Haysbert) had not listened to his girlfriend, would anything have happened at all? What if Neil hadn't stolen the bonds from Van Zant would they have been caught? What if Neil wasn't so driven could he have got away with it? Who knows? Who cares? That's not the point, the point is these characters are victims of fate. Some people might say that this is one of these films that are about the choices we make. Some People are wrong. <br/><br/>This is, arguably, Mann's most stylish movie. A lot of imagery representing what is going on, reflecting the characters and how they feel and think. I'll be frank and say that this movie is blue, it is really, really blue. But hey that's not always a bad thing, especially in a Mann movie, showing the openness of what this movie all about along with the beautiful aerial shots of L.A. It's a real shame that Mann ditched Spinotti (or vice versa, I'm not sure which) as this is the high point of each of their careers.<br/><br/>And of course let's not forget about the action. The opening robbery is just a taste of what is coming next, the greatest bank robbery you will ever see. Guards brutally incapacitated, hostages handled well (""we want to hurt nobody... you're money is insured by the federal government you're not gonna lose a dime... think of you're families, don't be a hero... anybody feel sick or have a heart problem lean against the wall"" to roughly quote Neil- Class) In and out, no time for error. When the inevitable happens, it happens with quite a force it will not be likely that you will ever feel anything like it again. Val Kilmer looks like he is having the time of his life, shooting anything and everything he sees, reloading as fast as a bullet only to repeat what he had just done. The assault rifles used were quite impressive, I'm not a gun nut so I wouldn't know but it looks like Neil and Chris carry M-16's with folding stocks (just recently made legal by Bush) but I don't have a clue what Sizemore is carrying. Just spray cars with ammunition and shoot anybody that looks threatening or gets in your way- that's the way to do it. The sound effects are just superb, top of the range and any other superlative you can attach to it, it really feels like people are firing guns by your head. But what makes this scene extra cool is that De Niro keeps his glasses on the whole time. <br/><br/>You know you are watching a great movie when the music sends shivers down your spine every time you hear it. Gia Lu Testa improves vastly because of Morricone's score. Just buy the soundtrack to Heat, play it at full blast and I dare you to resist watching the movie another time.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think that Heat is a landmark film, a film that should be placed proudly in your collection of movies, if you don't have it already, you have my pity, may god have mercy on your soul. BUY IT NOW!!!!!<br/><br/>96%"

","I really loved the emotional payoff to what was setup in an early scene ... where Vincent and Neil meet face to face - ""The Discipline""; and when we get to the scene outside the hotel - with Neil and Eady, it does get pretty rousing. <br/><br/>The only other Michael Mann film I've seen is COLLATERAL. Just like that 2004 movie, this film has excellent location cinematography of night time in the city and the sound of gunfire just ROCKS you. A round of applause to Mann's sound guys. <br/><br/>You'll also find the tense moments of Hanna and his wife goading, as will you find emotive the scene when Ashley Judd signals to Val Kilmer that she is NOT alone, at one point sequentially; we see the heartwarmed look on Judd's face. She doesn't want to give up Chris no matter how much salestalk about Dominick's future the African American officer tried to persuade her with. <br/><br/>Wonderful to see Hanna and his wife reconciled in their last scene together in the movie, its not a lose end left untied, but its something that's given closure up until the moment Vincent takes off to hunt down Neil.<br/><br/>A lot of rough action scenes to make your viewing of this 2.5 hour movie worthwhile and exciting. <br/><br/>Now, I'm gonna try to find a copy of MANHUNTER and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Michael is the Mann. <br/><br/>Grade A- <br/><br/>10/10"
"espenshade55","10","1","2","22 September 2004"," One of Micheal Mann's best
","Micheal Mann is one of the best crime story director's who has ever lived and this is one of his best if not his best film.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Seizmore, Wes Studi, Natalie Portman, Dian Venora, Jon Voight, etc. This movie boasts one of the best casts ever assembled and it is the first time that Pacino and De Niro, two icons of the film industry had met in a film since Godfather Two and Heat has the first scene that ever featured the two actors together. I'm not going to go into detail because I don't want to spoil it but Pacino and De Niro's scene is so incredible and yet so subtle it has quickly become one of my favorite scene's in any movie.<br/><br/>This film not only tells the exciting cat and mouse crime story, but it also becomes a character study that bores into the lives of the Cop (Pacino) and the career criminal (De Niro) in an incredible depiction of the lives that these men chose and vow to see through to the last regardless of the burden that they must pay.<br/><br/>It has several well done action sequences that are enough to keep anyone at the edge of their seat but again this movie is about the people, their family's, and others that they love and hurt in order to fulfill their duty.<br/><br/>If you ever have three hours of free time make sure you see this film it will not disappoint you."
"chris2749","Null","1","2","1 September 2004"," Absolutely Outstanding!!
","Overall this was an incredible movie.Yeah, it was a bit long, but I think it was worth it. Yeah, there are a few hokey scenes, but the good ones out-do them by a long stretch. Personally, my favorite is the coffee house scene. Not only do you get a true understanding of both Pacino and Dinero, but what really sets it up is the background. As they're both talking, listen and watch the background. You'll notice, at the start, that you hear regular conversations and and the clatter of dinner/silver ware. As the two talk on, you'll notice that the conversations slowly taper off, but the clatter remains the same. There's a point where, over Dinero's shoulder, you can clearly see an Asian woman whispering, and I'm sure that's what Mann had all the other patrons doing. As soon as Dinero says ""Or maybe we'll never see each other again"",everything returns to normal. Between their conversation and the background setup, it makes for the best scene of the movie. The bank heist/shootout would be my number two, although I think Kilmer could have taken his facial expression a bit further. I live close to downtown L.A., and have been on the same streets where they filmed that scene,but haven't been able to find the exact building they used for the bank. The armored car score at the beginning would be number three. The precision and preciseness was great. The ""drive-in on Centinela"" would be number four, although Kilmer should of had his H&K dialed in on the driver from the get go. The ending scene where Pacino shoots Dinero could of been setup a little better, but it worked out overall. If it isn't that obvious, I've damn near wore out my VHS copy watching it so many times. I give it five stars of five. That's my side of it."

"supertom-3","10","1","2","6 September 2002"," Classic! Why no Oscar nominations for Al and Bob?
","One of the finest crime thrillers of the last ten years. Heat boasts an all star cast, some exceptional cinematography, sound and acting. The film has gone for realism in the action department and what you get is some brilliant action sequences, there's no diving through the air in slow motion with doves appearing from nowhere, its more involving on a realism level like Saving Private Ryan was to war movies. The post bank heist shootout is outstanding.<br/><br/>The plot is based around Pacino's character Vincent, a cop and Neil played by Bob De Niro, who is a criminal genius. Both are similar in that their careers are their life. They feel isolated because of the dedication required to being the best of the breed in their chosen profession. Neil and his team want to pull off one last big heist and Pacino's character wants to stop him. Simple. The scripts excellence is that this is an exceptional character movie. The film has so many interestingly written and well played supporting characters, combining with the lead characters.<br/><br/>
The film has flawless acting from everyone. Pacino and De Niro are both on Oscar worthy form with neither quite managing to steal the others thunder. Val Kilmer has rarely been as watchable and Tom Sizemore is also in great form as was Kevin Gage as Waingro. Diane Venora is very good as Pacino's long suffering third wife. Also Amy Brenneman as De Niro's love interest is very good. There are some great scenes in this movie. De Niro and Pacino sharing the screen for the first time in the cafe scene was legendary, it is one of my favourite scenes in a movie ever, and the end was touching. The last scene between Val Kilmer and his wife was good as was the parting of Neil and Eedy. Also Natalie Portman followed her brilliant performance in Leon with another great showing here.<br/><br/>Overall this is a movie that has classic written all over it. The most interesting supporting cast ever and also excellence in direction, acting and the music. This film should have had more Oscar recognition. Pacino and De Niro are both worthy of Oscar nominations but there wasn't really enough room for both of them and you couldn't nominate one and not the other. This is one of my favourite movies ever, at nearly 3 hours it never bores and holds your attention from minute one to the thrilling climax. It is a tale of obsession, solitude and mutual respect. Excellence in film making. 10/10"

Well, i went to cinema again and i saw some movies i liked, but i don`t even dare to compare the tension of ""usual suspects"" or the gunfights of ""LA confidential"" with ""heat"", because it would remind me, how poor those other movies really are. There are people who say that de niro and pacino did not do their best but actually, they did excellent performances: Especially de niro showed a magnificent example of understated acting: You just look into his eyes and you know whats going on. Probably the most underrated film ever... and because Hollywood did not realize this we should take it out as soon as possibly."
"Get-Some","Null","1","2","22 June 1999"," The best film that I have ever seen - mind blowing !
","I first time I saw this film was in a cinema in Dublin. It was the biggest screen in Ireland and when the gun-fight scene came on, my ear-drums nearly jumped out of my head. This is certainly ten times the film Mann's first attempt was - 'LA Takedown'. Watching his pre-'Heat' films is almost embarrassing when you compare it to this mastery of cinematic genius. The characters gel together better than any cast I have ever seen. The opening armoured-car strike is filled with military precision, ex-SAS trooper Andy MacNabb was one of the military technical advisors on this film and special forces tactics permeate it from beginning to end. The gunfight scene is the best I have ever seen, the use of 'fire and movement' is truly breath-taking in it's beauty, even Val Kilmer puts in a good performance despite De Niro's overwhelming presence. MacAuley's turn at being a bank manager should put all other criminal elements to shame, here we see a mixture of undying professionalism and natural compassion intertwined in the consumate crim. Were Mann a woman I would marry him for making this film !"
"chip98","10","1","2","4 January 1999"," A terrific must-see
","Gritty and realistic, with superb turn-outs by all involved.  I couldn't take my eyes off Ashley Judd (as Christine Sheherlis), and not just for her looks.  An intricate plot intertwined with well-crafted action keeps the story going (the bank heist shoot-out is an eye-popper).  DeNiro and Pacino are their usual (if predictable) best, but the surprise is Val Kilmer, playing his role with fine subtlety.  If they ever devise retroactive Oscars for casting, then let Bonnie Timmermann be the first recipient."
"rmax304823","8","1","2","1 March 2002"," Excellent crime thriller.
","This is a long, involved, and generally superior caper movie, something on the order of ""The Asphalt Jungle"" but with a cop thrown into the sauce. In addition, as a kind of subplot, we have a duel of wits between Pacino who represents LA's Robbery and Homicide, and DeNiro as the head of the honorable gang betrayed by a renegade member.<br/><br/>The cast on the whole is splendid. Pacino gives a wide-eyed arm-waving, thoroughly enjoyable performance. As his third wife, Diane Venora with her feline eyes is the sensible spouse who feels she is not sharing her husband's life because he doesn't feel she should know about the rottener side of his work. If this sounds a bit familiar, it may be because you've run into this conflict in so many other movies, including ""Bullit"", ""The Godfather,"" and others. She is the only character who is given lines that make her sound as if she's gone to college -- ""What you do is sift through the debris, then pick up the scent and follow it,"" describing how she views her husband's job.<br/><br/>DeNiro is more restrained, thoughtful, solemn, always seeming to be strangling his passion. His motto: ""Never get involved in anything you're not ready to turn your back on and walk out of in thirty seconds flat."" Until he meets Amy Brennerman, a pretty young woman who turns in an understated performance filled with nuance. Brenneman looks like -- well, if you like Katy Couric, you'll like Amy Brenneman. Val Kilmer's pinched face has now progressed beyond prettiness and has acquired real character, matched by his acting here. <br/><br/>Two performances are absolute standouts. John Voight as the avuncular source of street information, a kind of Mentor to the gang, is flawless in the role. He has turned into a marvelous character actor. And Ashley Judd as Kilmer's love interest has to be one of our more underused and underrated actresses. She has plump lips, darting dark eyes, and a most mobile face and expressive body, able to convey more with a smile or a gesture than imaginable. She is a magnetic presence in this movie and in some others, so much so that when she is on screen she seems to command it without trying. <br/><br/>All the major characters have domestic problems, including an African-American driver recruited by the gang at the last minute. But these conflicts are secondary to the main thread of this complex plot, which involves two big heists, several shoot-outs in crowded streets, and a couple of murders in between, some of them off screen. <br/><br/>The film is as admirable for what it leaves out as what it includes. There are -- this may be difficult to believe -- there are no slow-motion scenes of violence and not a single car chase. A man trying to escape in a pickup is shot while speeding away. The traditional, moribund thriller/action scenario DEMANDS that this vehicle either blow up like a Claymore or end its earthly existence in a spectacular slow-motion crash. But, no. The director has the truck with the dead man slumped at the wheel slow down and roll to bump gently against a cyclone fence. Yes, folks, it's true. See it for this reason if for no other."

Heat is a scene-for-scene remake of that movie, complete with a nearly identical dialogue (in fact, only the ending is slightly different). The coffee-shop scene is even included, word for word.

","The significance of Heat is not that it boasts, perhaps, the greatest shoot-out scene of all time, or that it was a big budget film with top quality effects, or that it had big name actors.  The significance of this film is in the original script written by Micheal Mann.  The characters are REAL people, not some exaggerated freaks or stereotypical one dimensional types.  The characters have good qualities, bad qualities, they do good things, bad things, and have flaws that we, as people in the REAL world, can relate to.  They do not suddenly change, but at the same time are dynamic in subtle ways.  They have distinctive characteristics which define who they are.  The nature of each is responsible for the best in each of them and is the source of their flaws.  These are flaws, which at the end of the day, cause them misery and are responsible for their self-destruction.<br/><br/>If you are tired of artsy, critic acclaimed movies in which you could absolutely never relate to the characters, then its time for HEAT. HEAT will give you characters that are REAL people, in a REAL environment and setting, with REAL problems, that result in REAL outcomes and circumstances.  Michael Mann finally shows us a depiction of humanity that we can relate to and that is the UNREAL power of this film."

","Two men, each a consummate professional in his respective field-- but on opposite sides of the law-- become adversaries in a high-stakes cat and mouse game from which only one can emerge victorious, in the action/drama `Heat,' directed by Michael Mann and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a professional criminal who makes his living by `Taking down scores;' it's all he knows, and what he does best.  Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a Detective with the L.A.P.D. whose main reason for `being' is to stop guys like McCauley from doing what they do best.  It's what `he' does best.  And when circumstances put them together on the same playing field, it becomes a battle of wits and tenacity, a matter of who will outwit whom and when; for each man is adamant in intent, and it becomes clear early on that neither will ever acquiesce, withdraw or concede the game to his opponent.  McCauley lives by a code that allows him to walk away if he knows the heat is around the corner, but only to another space on the same board; and Hanna owns the board.  What follows is an intense study in the dynamics of uncompromising conviction; and the tension begins with the opening sequence and continues to build throughout the film, right up to the very end. 	In McCauley, De Niro has created a character that is more than just a bit disconcerting; a hardened criminal, ready to kill-- indiscriminately-- at the drop of a hat, anyone who gets in his way, but with an outward appearance that belies his true nature.  This guy is anybody's next door neighbor; the software salesman or the manager of the local A&P who would blend in with the crowd anywhere because he is so nondescript.  A man whose life is a ruse, hiding his psychotic, sociopathic instincts behind a facade of normalcy.  And De Niro plays him with such integrity that it makes him one of the more terrifying characters he's ever brought to the screen, not because of what he seems to be, but because of what you know he is capable of.  His portrayal of Max Cady in `Cape Fear' was, by comparison, the outward expression of what McCauley is underneath, and which he conceals so well; With Cady at least you could discern the evil of the man just by looking at him-- a man the likes of which you would cross the street to avoid if you saw him coming.  McCauley is the one you would invite in, never suspecting the truth.  And that is what makes him such a powerful character. 		Pacino's Hanna, on the other hand, is the exact opposite.  He's boisterous, loud, and in all ways larger than life; he swaggers and intimidates.  And why?  Because it gets results. The manner he affects gives him the presence he needs to ferret out the criminal element and to keep them in line; if someone chooses to play in his court, they're going to know he's there, and he's not going to let them forget it.  It's his turf, his rules, end of story.  It's a purposefully over-the-top performance, because that's who Hanna is, or at least that's the face he puts on for the job. Underneath he's just a man looking for a little peace in his life, a part of his own personal puzzle that has so far eluded him, in no small part due to the dedication he brings to his work.  The necessity of dealing with reality at the level he must day in and day out is simply not conducive with the ability to leave the job at the door when the shift is over.  For a man like Hanna, the shift is never over.  And the fact that McCauley-- at the other end of the spectrum-- is made of the same cloth, is what gives this film such explosive intensity. 	The exemplary supporting cast includes Val Kilmer (Chris), Jon Voight (Nate), Tom Sizemore (Michael), Diane Venora (Justine Hanna), Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), Natalie Portman (Lauren), Hank Azaria (Alan) and Kevin Gage (Waingro).  `Heat' is a hard-hitting, memorable film, impeccably directed and delivered by Mann; an entertaining and action-packed character study with an adrenaline rush that never lets you off the hook for a moment.  And how great to see De Niro and Pacino together; that alone is worth the price of admission.  If you're ready for some excitement, check this one out; it'll take you to the edge and keep you there, and by the time it's over you'll be ready for more of the same-- and that is what movies are all about.  That is the magic.  I rate this one 10/10."

","I first saw this in the cinema when I was 14 (Yes, I was underage!), and thought it was a decent enough film, if a little long. I didn't see it again until last year, when I was at University. I had forgotten how good this film really is! There are so many things that you miss out on when you watch it for the first time! Pacino and De Niro, quite rightly hyped as the 'two most electrifying actors in America', are both brilliant, as well as Voight and Kilmer. The shootout scene must be one of the most well directed and suspense filled in the history of cinema. It has been knocked for being too long, and I admit it can drag in places, but watching through these has its rewards. All in all a fantastic film, probably the second best film of the 90's after 'Shawshank Redemption'. Michael Mann can take credit for not letting the films hype detract from a throughly engrossing and entertaining film.9/10"
"Rammstein-2","10","1","2","10 January 2000"," Epic saga with grandiose portraits
","This is probably the best film I have ever seen. The tale of big-time crooks and a lone, obsessed police officer in pursuit, wears a mask of calm and quiet, with some striking portraits. When all hell breaks lose in downtown L.A., the characters get to show just what they are all about - obsessiveness, weariness and plain old doggedness. Beautiful and brilliant."

","yeah, it's a great movie. I like it, it has action, storyline, positively it's a thriller. But, (always there is a but) is a remake of ""L.A. Takedown"" with much more stars. Even the names don't change from ""L.A.T."" (first time i saw it as ""Made in L.A."") I'm sorry for the lack of innovation, despite the terrific work of Pacino-De Niro team."

","I couldn't get passed 40 minutes, I was bored out of my mind. I saw how this movie was highly rated my many people and I thought I'd give it a try and I now regret it. Al Pacino's acting was terrible, I get it he's a famous actor but I didn't like him at all in this, he has weird emotions when acting out scenes, he didn't sound tough or intimidating, more like boring really."
"jaygeuder","4","2","7","29 January 2019"," A marked moment in the Pacino decline
","De Niro is great. Pacino overacts like crazy. Weird mannerisms, lack of eye contact, odd outbursts. Totally unrealistic performance that undermines the whole movie. Too bad. Remove Pacino and sub in a ""fair"" performance from, well...anyone, and my rating goes from a 4 to a 7."
"rat_scabies","2","2","7","12 April 2018"," Embarassing
","Giving this film a two star rating was at least 500% more enjoyable and satisfying than watching it. Heat is predictable and cliche at its best moments and cringe inducing at its worst. Al Pacino gives one of the most terrible, over the top performances of his life as a grizzled detective who is also apparently on the LA SWAT team and does all the door kicking for the department for unknown reasons. Pacino even has a coffee date with Deniro just so they can have their deep ""you and I aren't so different you know"" conversation and cap it off with some threats to eachother that basically spell out the unlikely and ridiculous final confrontation of the film where Deniro and Pacino square off one on one.<br/><br/>Deniro is okay considering what a terrible script he's going off of but his character is little more than a big fat walking cliche. The whole film is about as interesting as a South Park parody of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.<br/><br/>I will say that only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because the guns sound powerful and realistic and the two big action scenes are fairly enjoyable. The photography was also good and most of the film looked pretty cool. If there had been a decent movie with an interesting and vaguely believable plot to connect the big action scenes it could have been pretty decent. As it is it's unremarkable, pretentious and pretty silly. I'm a little mystified at how highly rated this movie is."

","Good from far but far from good. Better than your regular policeman vs bad guy movie, but this movie falls short of being good because of two aspects: 1. Although it is a long movie, it does not allocate enough time to develop the ""sensitive"" side of the story, although it keeps us up-to-date with what's happening outside the main storyline and tries to involve us. 2. The ""action"" parts of the movie, such as fights, shootings and so on are filmed OK but are completely unrealistic and I couldn't stop noticing that. *** SPOILER FOLLOWS DOWN***<br/><br/>This culminates with the extremely annoying ending, where the supposedly smart and smooth and experienced criminal childishly exposes himself through his all too obvious shadow and gets killed. Except for some annoying parts, though, the movie is OK. If you're into the classic happy Hollywood ending then you'll get over it in a minute. Me, I didn't."

The film does a great realism in every scene. Full of expectations every second that makes you can not stop trying to guess what's coming. Valor, betrayal, courage and selflessness involved in a host of challenges to meet. Nobody like Michael Mann so beautifully exposes the individual lives of the characters to create this work of art, recreating with certainty the role of villain and defender of the law, accepted by each of the protagonist as their way of life ... and die!"

"kenjha","6","2","9","5 June 2008"," Not So Hot
","This cops and robbers film has a stupid script but boasts an impressive cast. Pacino has some good moments but generally chews the scenery as a cop trying to nab the bad guys while dealing with family issues. DeNiro plays pretty much the same role he played in ""Goodfellas."" While Pacino screams, Kilmer and Voight, both sporting long blonde locks, mumble their lines in such low tones that they are barely comprehensible, causing the viewer to constantly adjust the volume. Mann directs with the slickness of a video game, but the film becomes tiresome because there are too many characters and plot lines. It is much too long; the quality of a film is not measured by its length."
"andrewdaniel-43118","6","1","3","21 May 2018"," Too many unnecessary characters
","Part of the reason that this film felt boring was the unneeded development of minor characters. And they do it in such a manner that does not feel natural, or which flows with the storyline. Pacino and De Niro are good actors, but this is far from either's best work. It's a long movie, which I don't have a problem with, only except that filling it in with romances that have nothing to do with the story makes the pace kinda crappy. The action scenes aren't great, but their OK. It's worth watching, but it's not that great."

","The face off of two iconic actors, Al Pacino and Robert Deniro! The movie had plenty of action and also the two squaring off, but it lacked something I can't put my hands on, perhaps it seemed rushed or not authentic to me. It felt like the movie didn't capture the full potential of putting these two icons together on the silver screen. I wish it drew out the characters better and had more development beyond big action scenes."
"TheBigSick","Null","1","3","6 September 2017"," Career-best performances from Pacino and De Niro
","The movie succeeds in a spectacular fashion. The gunfight outside the bank is absolutely stunning, which is among the bloodiest and the most violent shootouts in the history of cinema. The cinematography is simply amazing, especially the long take at Charlene's house. <br/><br/>More importantly, the two lead stars, Pacino and De Niro, give the finest performances of their entire career. As we all know, Pacino and De Niro are two of the best actors of all time, and both of them are specialists on crime films. Most notably, Pacino appears in crime movies like ""The Godfather"" franchise, ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Scarface"", ""Carlito's Way"", ""Donnie Brasco"", and De Niro has played in ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather 2"", ""Once upon a time in America"", ""Goodfellas"", and various other crime thrillers. And it is in ""Heat"" that their acting is the most poignant and gripping. <br/><br/>For the shortcoming of the film, I think it should be that the film is too long. Some characters are not necessary. Some scenes are distracting. If the film is more focused, I think it could be better."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","22 April 2017"," Michael Mann's Magnum Opus
","Bringing two icons of yesteryears face to face in a deftly scripted & expertly directed crime drama, Michael Mann's Heat is a defining work of its genre that's envisioned, executed & presented with finesse, is led by compelling performances from both Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and, despite its daunting 3 hours runtime, it manages to be a thoroughly engrossing cinema that's as smart as it is satisfying.<br/><br/>The story of Heat follows a career criminal whose latest heist mission goes wrong when his team's hired help impulsively kills an unarmed guard, thus turning their planned robbery into a homicide, and brings veteran LAPD Lieutenant & his crew into the picture who then take over the case and hunt for the perpetrators. What unfolds next is a series of close encounters where each team tries to outdo each other.<br/><br/>Written, produced & directed by Michael Mann, the film opens with a thrilling segment that sets up the premise and puts the story into motion. Mann's direction is absolutely top-notch, for he offers ample screen time to all the characters that inhabit this tale, and his script is just as accomplished as every character is embedded with a well-defined arc and the consistent flow between its events keeps the interest alive & kicking.<br/><br/>From the technical standpoint, Heat is a masterwork of first-rate craftsmanship as almost all the element work in tandem with the rest to significantly uplift the whole look & feel of the story. The decision to shoot everything on location gives it a realistic vibe, Camera-work is controlled and its handling is smooth & flexible in both close-up & wide panning. Editing moves the plot forward at a steady pace while Sound is skilfully utilised.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Heat features a fabulous ensemble in Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Tom Noonan, Natalie Portman etc, and although the supporting cast plays their part well, all of them are overshadowed by the stellar inputs of Pacino & De Niro, and the moments between the two are the highlights of this feature. Pacino definitely has the upper hand here but De Niro isn't far behind.<br/><br/>However, despite plethora of positives, Heat isn't without its shortcomings. Its 170 minutes runtime carries a lot of fat and could've been trimmed into a lean narrative by editing out nearly everything that doesn't play a key role in the final outcome. The numerous subplots dealing with the turmoil of our relevant characters' personal lives do help in adding more depth to their arcs but most of them are unnecessary and should've ended up on the editing room floor.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Heat scores high marks in both storytelling & technical departments, and has played an influential role in the world of filmmaking over the years. The magnetic screen presence of Al Pacino & Robert De Niro as well as their strong chemistry alone makes it worth a watch but it is Michael Mann who cements his own legacy with this crime drama, for Heat is one of his finest directional efforts, if not the finest, and presents the notable filmmaker in complete control of his craft. Highly recommended."

"ironlion106","10","1","3","15 March 2017"," A Timeless Film
","Enough just can't be said about this movie. Heat is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a nearly three hour crime epic that simultaneously leaves you wanting more and makes you feel completely satisfied. There is really nothing about this film that isn't perfection. The story unfolds beautifully, never dragging. The characters all feel fleshed out, and the actions of every character effect the stories of every other character. On top of this the performances are all as great as you'd expect from a cast like this one. The dialogue is cool, fast, and entertaining without falling into the trap of needing constant one-liners or jokes to keep the audience engaged. It'd be a sin not to mention the score which features everything from rock, to electronic, to classical, to choir. All of it beautiful and minimalistic. As far as the technical aspects go, well, it's a Michael Mann crime thriller. Every scene is shot and lit to perfection. Mann's style is so distinct because of how his films manage to be incredibly stylized and realistic at the same time. No eccentric camera movements, no cool editing tricks, and no cute transitions. Just perfectly executed storytelling. Heat is an absolutely timeless film."

","I think the movie was fine, although I do expected a better script when I saw that two of the greatest actors, Al Pacino and Di Niro, are in the movie. The movie may look to be quite long, especially in the beginning. But anyways, the performance by both the actors was great. The shootout scene was one of the finest I've seen. <br/><br/>I loved the way Di Niro played Neil Mccauley. He was obviously the best choice for the character. Al Pacino played the role of Vincent very well too. He described his life as a ""disaster zone"", and the film was able to show it. His inability to help sustain his relationship with his wife. The ending was nice, I felt at first it to be a bit stretched out, but I realized it was just fine. The ending moment was nice and was able to get me on the edge of my seat."
"The-Social-Introvert","9","1","3","6 November 2015"," Far more than a simple cops-and-robbers flick
","Ahhh, heat. One of my favourite crime films. Being a hardcore Pacino and De Niro fan I was shocked upon realising a couple of years back that the two had starred in another film together other than The Godfather Part II. How I missed it I don't know. I found out about it watching Pacino on Inside the Actor's Studio. Having the two in the same movie was a dream come true. Coincidentally Heat was on TV a few days later. After watching it I believe films of its kind have never been bettered, for me at least.<br/><br/>The film follows two main characters – Vincent Hanna and Neil McCauley. Hanna's third marriage is on the decline due to his obsession with his job as a cop. His attention-deprived step daughter is falling apart and, as his wife states, he spends more of his life among the ""remnants of dead people"" rather than with the living. Hanna's story is that of a man trying to succeed in his professional career, something he values over his home life. The head-in-hand moments throughout the film gives the viewers understanding of Hanna's frustration at his own failure to keep his life together and to cling on to his personal life. He knows deep down, as does his wife, that he enjoys his job more than he enjoys the company of his family – it's what makes him ""tick"", what keeps him on the balls of his feet. Need I say that the role is perfectly played by Al Pacino? From the cold, and hard 'Ima talking' you down' stares to the hilarious improvised rants (""SHE GOT A GREAT ASS!""), no character is more entertaining to watch in this film, except maybe...<br/><br/>Neil McCauley. Here we have a man hardened by his time in jail. A man only interested in the next score, whether it be large or small. No mistakes, no taking chances. Full-on goatee-flexing coolness. McCauley shares a strong relationship with the other members of his crew, and is the only person without a wife or girlfriend. Though tough as nails, his humane side comes through many time, like how he never kills unless he can't help it. The reason for his distant nature is revealed as someone told him to ""never let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you feel the heat coming round the corner"". This motto could be seen as the explanation for his success, making it ironic that when he does find someone he cares about, McCauley meets his demise after having broken his own thirty second rule. De Niro does an excellent job, he really does. It's definitely one of his most underrated performances. Actors just can't act cool nowerdays like these guys could. The two actors lead an all-star cast, consisting of the likes of Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, and Tom Sizemore. The supporting cast, especially Kilmer, do fine jobs at handling their characters. This is what essentially makes Heat such a successful movie – the characters. None of the characters are cardboard, only there to increase body counts. All the characters have their own personalities, their own stories, and the movie feels like you've been dropped into a time period of these people's lives, making Heat definitely one of the greatest character films of all time. Take Donald Breedan (Dennis Haysbert), a recently paroled ex-convict determined to start fresh in his life. Sure, by the end of the film no- one remembers probably him but in the character's small amount of screen time he manages to represents the tragic tale of how many people don't want to give ex-convicts a second chance to start fresh, often causing these people to get coaxed or forced back into a life of crime. As is the case with Breedan, whose agreement of taking another job with Neil over a dead end job at the grill with an arse as a boss provides too tempting, but results in his death. What Heat is about is men. Strong men, and the women who play supporting roles in the relationships, much like how society works now. The first half of the film is like watching two different movies, one following the life of Hanna and the other of McCauley. That is until the two tales start to string together via a certain famous coffee shop scene - the first time my two movie heroes were on the screen together. Well, technically that's not true. Sure, there's a very cool highway scene that precedes the coffee shop one.<br/><br/>Some people complain that De Niro and Pacino don't share enough screen time together, but I don't agree with this. I think Mann perfectly balanced the amount of time they got together, and didn't overdo it. The clash of the two titans would be one of the most anticipated scenes in cinema history, and yet did anyone think that it would take place over a coffee table? I sure didn't, but it's perfect. It's beautiful. Seeing the two sparring off against each other, competing with talk of their jobs, their personal lives, and their manliness. The dialogue is mouth-wateringly suggestive, as the two slowly gain a mutual understanding of one another. The line ""flipside to that coin"" symbolises how the two characters, and even the actors, are different sides of the same coin.<br/><br/>See my blog (you can get to it from by boards profile) for the rest of the review"
"darrenchaker1","10","1","3","28 October 2015"," HEAT is loved by Darren Chaker
","HEAT has been out for years, but its plot and the cast remain perfected to date. The LAPD Robbery-Homicide unit is assigned to the case. Headed by Al Pacino, he seeks out a cut throat band of criminals. Better yet, a crew of sophisticated criminals who take down armored cars to banks. A true shoot out in downtown Los Angeles that cannot be emulated. This is a perfect love story, mixed in with cops and robbers, with the backdrop of Los Angeles and directed by Miami Vice legend Michael Mann. The movie keeps you anticipating what will happen next. What is especially great is you know one of the mega-stars will die, but do not know who. And I will not tell. If of age to watch - don't miss this movie!"
"owen9825","10","1","3","19 September 2015"," A fitting rendez-vous for two titans of cinema
","This film is exceptional. Almost all crime films are biased in their portrayal of cops vs robbers. If the cop is the main character, the criminals are snatching babies or just generally being evil and *incompetent*. If the bad guys are the main characters, it's a horror movie. Finally, this is a movie where both sides are experts and they're both like-able. As such, I never knew which way the film was going to end.<br/><br/>Both sides have just as much likelihood to win in the end and I could realistically get behind either side. This film kept me on the edge and seemed so much more realistic about the criminals. They weren't just bad guys for the sake of it. They didn't have the clichés of having ""henchmen"" and having a taste for fine art. This movie is absolutely compelling; it still gives me goosebumps just seeing the trailer."
"Rawal_Afzal","8","1","3","11 August 2015"," Too long, but still a very good film!
","It is a good film, no doubt about that, but one thing lacking in the film was pace. It takes too long for things to materialise and get going. The first half is painfully slow and coming to the point in short, the overall length of the film was an issue. This is one aspect that annoys me the most about a lot of films and it is hard to get me look past this point (of too long films), unless it happens to be a film with great pace throughout or highly entertaining from minute to minute. This is a point in general that I think should be amongst priorities for a film-maker. I am sure that like many of those excessively long film, this too must have had scenes which they could have done without. What really is the point of making an otherwise a very good film that is going to have scenes that the viewers can easily afford to talk to each other through it?<br/><br/>Another point to raise would possibly of not showing what happens to the only guy left, Chris. But I would just add that it would have been nice if they had shown, instead of saying it was a must.<br/><br/>But, overlooking all that, it was quite a brilliant film, full of great performances from all the actors."

The criminal or ring-leader Neil McCauley (De Niro) is leading a group of men to perform various heists. However, the time has come for him and his team to call it quits, but before that, they have plans to perform a massive heist for one-last-time! But, unfortunately for them, the Cops led by Lieutenant Hanna (Al Pacino), have been on their trail lately, so the criminal gang have their work cut-out, and need to watch out for their backs very closely.<br/><br/>Heat was simply a brilliant movie.

Other than a prolonged boring scene (almost irrelevant to the plot), this movie is perfect. It has one of the best shootout action scenes ever. Right up until the very end, it stays at a high level.

A film featuring two past Oscar winners in itself is a good enough reason to watch this movie. Both of them give stellar performances and the rest of the cast give a decent support to these two powerhouses. The screenplay is smart without being self indulgent. A truly spectacular movie that demands repeat viewing."

I do recommend this film because although slow in some scenes, HEAT is a good film overall, and when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino square off it is not to be missed.

","One could hardly ask for more than to see Al Pacino and Robert De Niro perform together in an engrossing action drama, and Heat definitely provides the thrill that is expected from a film with such a star-studded cast. Along with the two very strong leading performances, this crime drama also puts on display the terrific filmmaking abilities of Michael Mann, who manages to bring a great deal of passion and the feeling of sensation to the genre. The story is rather typical, but the unexpected emphasis on character development lifts the film, as interpersonal relationships are explored in a very compelling way. Although the film is perhaps a bit too long, and as a result feels slightly flat at times, it is carried by tremendous acting and ultimately does offer the audience a very solid ending. Heat succeeds in presenting the duality between the police and the criminals, while also providing the necessary action alongside it, which ultimately does differentiate the film from others in its genre."
"Red-Barracuda","9","1","3","26 July 2012"," Drama and style aplenty here
","This crime-thriller is the story about a cop and a robber who mirror each other. The robber (Robert De Niro) has sacrificed a home life in order to maintain his life of crime, while the cop (Al Pacino) has a disastrous domestic life as a result of his work pursuing men like De Niro. The film follows both of their paths until their ultimate showdown.<br/><br/>Heat is a well written film, even if the story isn't especially brilliant. Where it scores is in its presentation. The acting personnel are extremely good. Apart from the two leads we have a very good support cast compromising the likes of Jon Voight, Val Kilmer, Henry Rollins and Tom Sizemore. But what Heat is primarily celebrated for is in its pairing of De Niro and Pacino. Up until that point these two titans of the screen had never shared screen time together. In this film they do, although it is very sparing. They meet in the middle of the film at a diner and at the end at a night-time air-field. Their encounters are certainly powerful and mean that the sparsity of them makes them all the more potent.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann is the one who of course holds everything together. He controls the dramatics and injects the story with some very well staged action scenes. The shoot-out in the streets of L.A. being the most obvious example of this, it's a very finely choreographed sequence. And overall, the film has a very stylised look and feel. The photography is very good and visually the movie matches the dramatics on screen. Another Mann trademark present is the low-key soundtrack. In this one we have well-chosen electronica from the likes of Kronos Quartet, as well as a great original score by Elliot Goldenthal.<br/><br/>It may be slightly on the over-long side but aside from this Heat is a great combination of grade A acting and cinematic style. It's one of the best crime-thrillers from the 90's."
"antonjsw1","Null","1","3","6 July 2012"," A captivating crime saga
","After developing the proof of concept with the TV movie LA Takedown, Mann takes the idea to new heights in a nearly 3 hour crime epic. Within the confines of a mainstream, big budget Hollywood movie Mann's story is told from the perspectives of a group of bank robbers, the key policeman leading the hunt, and the wives/girlfriends of some of these characters, and the impact that the men's lifestyles has on the women in their lives. <br/><br/>Al Pacino, while playing his role a touch theatrically at times, is compelling as the flawed hero dealing with the impending disintegration of his third marriage to a highly troubled and depressed wife(Diane Venora), while at the same time taking on an emerging antagonist in the form of hardened but analytical bank robber McCauley, played brilliantly by Robert De Niro in a realistic and grounded way. However, an interesting extra twist is that while Hanna's marriage is in trouble, McCauley hardened exterior hides a fact that inwardly he is falling for a female artist Eady (empathically played by Amy Brenneman) who is nevertheless not initially aware of McCauley's 'job'. The interplays are further layered by interesting dynamics playing in the film which include the other bank robbers, notably gambling addict Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), as well as the rest of the robber 'crew', and how events in the story impact on the crew and their relationship with other criminals who the viewer comes across in the story. I was particularly taken by a small but emotionally involving subplot that involves an ex-con (Dennis Haysbert.)<br/><br/>This layering could have severely crowded the narrative of this film, but amazingly Mann pulls it off, producing a film that carries the viewer through the many effective subplots without losing sight of the main thrust of the story, which is a showdown between DeNiro's and Pacino's characters. This is beautifully set up through the much commented upon diner scene, which works brilliantly and prepares the audience for a terrific final two acts, which includes a truly remarkable shoot out in Los Angeles, that leaves the view horrified and captivated all at once. <br/><br/>While Mann's direction is outstanding, he is ably supported by several technical contributions, notably photographer Dante Spinotti, and the fabulous editing by Dov Hoenig, Pasquale Buba, Tom Rolf and William Goldenberg. Elliot Goldenthal's music, together with other musical collaborators, creates a fantastic mood and atmosphere for the film, rather than accentuating particular dramatic moments in the film, and is an evolution of the work both Jan Hammer and Tangerine Dream did in Thief and the Miami Vice TV series. Neil Spisak's production design, together with Mann's own attention to detail in prepping the cast, leads to great verisimilitude despite the very slickly shot action sequences, albeit the character development is still allowed to shine through, leading to the films emotionally satisfying if tragic finale. <br/><br/>An outstanding and landmark achievement, and together with The Insider, is one of the two best films from Michael Mann."

","Al Pacino and Robert De Niro star in Michael Mann's 1995 crime drama.

","After watching this movie, my breath was taken away.<br/><br/>Heat is that good. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this classic. If you want to see two brilliant actors at the top of their game, then you have to see this movie. It is perfectly written and directed by Michael Mann, one of the best film makers today. Mann picks and chooses his projects wisely (note: he has only directed six or seven Hollywood movies in the last twenty or so years), and they almost always differ in content (ex. this is the same guy who directed one of my personal favorites ""The Last Of The Mohicans""). A great all around film, and certainly a classic in the cops and robbers genre, Heat certainly makes the grade as far as I am concerned."
"fredericksmith1952","10","1","3","5 February 2012"," I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann
","Okay, I have to preface this by telling you I am a huge fan of Micheal Mann, so if my praise for the man seems a bit over the top, you know why. Al Pacino has figured prominently in many of my reviews, so no surprise he delivers another stellar performance in this epic that reunites his with his Godfather II costar, Robert De Niro, who also delivers in his best ""tough guy"" style. The cast list above may seem a little long, but it could be longer, since there are a few other superb actors in the film, such as Martin Ferrero, Henry Rollins, Hank Azaria, and Jeremy Piven. The list above represents a powerhouse of a cast, though. Ferrero and Noonan have worked with Mann many times before, and I would imagine their inclusion represents a strong suggestion on Mann's part, but they both perform their roles well. This is one of those films where we see the entire canvas, not just one or two parts of the painting. We discover what drives these men, and their women. The settings are perfect, the photography Oscar worthy, and in spite of a run time of just over 2 hours, keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat. Lots of gun play and bad language, a few scenes of with implied sex, so no need to watch this when the kids are up and about. Definitely a collectible, one you will love to watch over and over again."
"JoeC345","10","1","3","31 January 2012"," More than a crime drama
","There are rare occurrences that elevate a director, into a great director. This can be seen in ""Taxi Driver"" by Martin Scorsese, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" by Steven Spielberg and ""Magnolia"" by Paul Thomas Anderson. These are movies in which people begin to realize the true talent that these directors have in making their films.<br/><br/>Watching ""Heat"" for the first time years ago it was obvious that this film had more then what you would expect from a crime drama, but it's only after a couple viewing that you can begin to really appreciate what this movie has to offer. Which is the experience of watching the world that cops and robbers live in.<br/><br/>When this was first released it was promoted strongly on the fact that it was going to be the first movie where Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro were going to share screen time (I'm aware they were in Godfather Part II together but they didn't have any scenes together in that). After all the promotion of this some people were disappointed to have to wait for more then have the movie for them to have a scene together, but honestly I preferred it the way it is. There are far to many movies that have cops and robbers sharing numerous scenes together and after so many it's just hard to believe that it's real. In this they share a couple scenes and only one real conversation which is perhaps the best scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is something that you've heard before, where the movie flourishes and excels beyond the commonality of these sorts of movies is in the dialogue and emotional input that is put into each scene. There is really no scene that seems ""scripted"" or ""fake"". There are certain points in the movie where DeNiro pauses for a moment as if he's trying to think of what to say in that situation instead of just regurgitating what the screenplay tells him to say. This is one of those extremely rare films where you can literally see no one else in any of the roles that are cast, it's easy to tell that they went into real casting calls and picked the best person for each and every role.<br/><br/>Even with all the beautiful dialogue and conversations that go on throughout the film, I have always been and will always be a fan of the silent parts where we all know what's going on and the director has enough faith in the audience not to insult our intelligence by dumbing down any of these parts at all. There is one particular scene between Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene Shiherlis (Ashley Judd) that is perhaps of the best examples of this. Instead of words there is music in the back round of this scene that gives away the emotional feelings that are occurring during this scene. There is another scene involving Lt. Vincent Hanna's (Al Pacino) stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) that is along the same lines and is another one of those unforgettable scenes that lesser movies would not even bother to incorporate.<br/><br/>There is everything right about this movie, there have been movies which after a couple viewings they begin to lose their enjoyment. This is not one of those, this is one of the rare movies that will end up being a classic crime drama along the same lines as ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Key Largo"".<br/><br/>It's hard these days to find anything with the same kind of impact as the older crime dramas but that just might have to do with the less and less attention that writers are giving to the characters in these sorts of movies since their target audience it seems doesn't want to be intrigued by complex plot points, they just want to see stuff blow up and cars chasing each other around the block for half an hour. However when a movie like this comes along it's hard not to appreciate it's courage in taking a kind of movie like this and elevating it to greatness.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is Michael Mann's masterpiece."
"witster18","8","1","3","23 January 2012"," Very good, but not great.. here's why...
","First of all, I'm a huge Michael Mann fan. ""Heat"" is a really good cat-and-mouse, cops versus robbers fare that thrives off of many of the directors trademarks.<br/><br/>Of course most of the film is shot at night. Of course there's the Mann-trademarks of blue-hues/lights and stylish direction and music.<br/><br/>Deniro's enigmatic performance went practically unnoticed. Robert's character seems much deeper than the script divulges, and he's the perfect ring leader. Great performance from Deniro here! Al Pacino is his cop-adversary in an over-the-top performance. I still haven't decided if Pacino and Mann went a little TOO far with his antics in this film. Pacino is just as on edge as Deniro - only he isn't afraid to vocalize it. This performance is like Pacino on steroids.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is that cat-and-mouse action. The interaction between the two groups is fascinating. One scene in particular where Pacino pulls over and invites Deniro to sit down and have a cup of coffee is fantastic. In another great scene involving the two Pacino says,""you know what they're watching? They're watching us"".<br/><br/>The film moves at a nice pace, and doesn't seem like a 170-minute movie.<br/><br/>I really didn't see any point in the relationship subplots here. These bad guys will obviously put just about anything behind their work:the threat of jail etc. I almost wish Mann had left all of the relationship stuff out of the script. It would have been different if he had established some genuine chemistry between some of these couples, but to me, it just seems more realistic that these women would have been kicked to the curb for business reasons. That's not to be sexist in any way. It's just an aspect of the film that really didn't work for me. I think the film would rank higher on my scale if Mann would have just eliminated all of that nonsense in exchange for more of the cat-and-mouse situations between the good guys and the bad guys. It also could have been a way to tighten this whole thing up and shorten it as well.<br/><br/>Good movie, but not fantastic. I actually enjoy ""Manhunter"" more, and think this is probably more on the level as ""Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Collateral"" in terms of quality from Mann. I don't think this film deserves a spot in the top 250, but it is extremely entertaining none-the-less.<br/><br/>84/100 You'll like this if you liked: Collateral, Manhunter, Inside Man, or William Friedkin cop and robbers fare like The French Connection or To Live and Die in L.A."
"vinitbhardwaj","10","1","3","2 January 2012"," ...and it did not win even a single Oscar.
","Although its a movie about a cop chasing a criminal, the two focal characters are beyond the judgment of good bad evil. No matter what they are doing, how or with whom i am not experienced, qualified or arrogant enough to pass a judgment on their actions. They believe in their karma and they are following it if people whose lives they are touching can accommodate good otherwise these two will let them go. To them purpose of life is not to just be born, populate and then die not knowing or feeling what they wasted their lives for. So pure is their pursuit that other emotions can confuse people. eg Love. They will not stop for their loved ones but their love is pure. Its a life story of two monks, who kill people, love a woman , get angry too. Conjuring up two of the strongest characters ever to be portrayed ever on silver screen is a feat in itself. Hats off to Michel Mann for accommodating them in one story. In my opinion if you ask De Niro or Pacino if they want to switch their roles, they would happily do it such is the equilibrium. Music one the best ever. Breathtaking scenes. Some unforgettable dialog. When the movie starts look at the name of cast carefully, you will hardly find an actor/ actress as talented as Portman getting his/her mention after a dozen. Non of them out of place, non of them without taking the movie forward.<br/><br/>Its like an art having numerous dimensions everybody will look at it differently. Its drama. Its thriller. Its love story. Its Action. I can go on and on but all i wish for is everybody to watch this movie at least once. I have seen it hundreds of times and yet I find this movie an endless space of brilliance. So please watch it and enrich yourselves."
"jantoniou","10","1","3","9 May 2011"," What else can be said about this perfectly conceived and executed crime drama?
","I would like to think there is something to add to the accolades this ultra-violent, deeply character-driven crime drama has received over the 15+ years since its release, but it should be enough to say this is a movie that has to be seen, to be watched, to be studied and examined as an example of truly artful direction and powerfully delivered film-making. All the actors and the director are at the peak of the creative power and authority here, never missing a beat, never chewing on a scene too long, never overstaying their welcome.<br/><br/>Mann engages us intimately with the characters. We grow most sympathetic with DeNiro's Neil Cauley, an anti-heroic bad guy we can't help but hope will get away and get out of the game (even though we know they never do) but we are given an almost equal treatment of Cauley's nemesis, an over-achieving major crimes homicide detective, Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a cop who never sleeps, never stops thinking, never gives up. He's a gum-chewing New Yorker ADD case transplanted to the L.A. underworld he must deal with.<br/><br/>The violence and the heists is crucial - this is the criminal underworld we're looking at here after all, one full of treacherous, twisted, and thoroughly untrustworthy people - but Mann goes a step further and makes them knowable, sympathetic, three-dimensional people with real problems (not the least of which is the lifestyle they've chosen for themselves).<br/><br/>Much as I found ""Reservoir Dogs"" initially breathtaking in its depiction of hardcore violence, violence that was bloody and terrible and full of complications - not the Cowboys-and-Indians gunplay of the '50s and '60s where a gunshot to the gut didn't seem to really do much - I found the violence of ""Heat"" equally breathtaking. I'm not sure if it was the choice of guns or simply the way they were recorded, but the semi-/full-auto Colt rifles used in much of the movie are astonishingly loud. Even the sound of the guns makes them a part of the cast and gives a realistic scope to the violence, a nearness and a real impact that makes ""Heat"" unique among its counterparts.<br/><br/>""Heat"" and its fully-rounded characters are an amazing achievement that is rarely seen in film: We care about the good AND the bad guys, we want to learn more about them and the director and cast delivers, again and again and again. The film MAKES us want to know more about them. I suppose there are some visual and film and plot clichés common to many crime dramas, but it doesn't feel clichéd, doesn't feel time- or tread-worn.<br/><br/>If for some crazy reason you haven't seen this movie - and I can't imagine you haven't - be sure you do. And, if you haven't seen it in a while, please watch it again. Really watch it and observe what a fine film ""Heat"" is."
"novak-86","10","1","3","29 April 2011"," Truly a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time
","HEAT is nothing short of spectacular.<br/><br/>This was the first movie i purchased on DVD way back in '96' and I'll explain why, not only are the action sequences shot in cinematic brilliance, the plot really makes you care about each character and lets not forget standout performances from Robert De Niro, Al Pacino (the first movie in which both actors are in the same scene) Val Kilmer (possibly his best role since Top Gun) Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman the list goes on, the acting is nothing short of brilliant I cant stress this enough – the casting crew knew what they were doing here.<br/><br/>The basis of the story is an oldie but a goodie – Cops and robbers. Vincent Hanna (played by Pacino) leads a squad of robbery/homicide detectives on the trail of a new ""crew"" of criminals lead by Neil McCauley (De Niro). This begins a game of Cat and Mouse which sees the tables turned on each of them throughout the movie, add to this the personal issues they have makes these two characters relatable and this just ads to them becoming more interesting. To say anymore would give the film away.<br/><br/>The action, unlike most films isn't over done, even though they are awesome to watch, this gives the film a better sense of realism and inturn makes the plot more believable. A special mention here is the shoot out scene – you'll know it when you see it. Add to this the best sounding film I've heard everything just makes it real, the echo of the shootouts, the way glass cracks and wood splinters all are fantastic. The only other film that would compare is 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>At just over 3hrs long this epic crime drama has to glued, I must stress if you are going to watch this film make sure you have a decent surround sound system and a good widescreen and do it the justice it deserves.<br/><br/><ul><li>Novak</li></ul>"

I have had reason to think about it many times since I first saw this movie. (Though fortunately I have had no reason to act on it, yet.) <br/><br/>For sure, there are other good things about the movie. There are the action scenes, some of which have a connection to the ""30 seconds flat"" message. Wrapped around that, there is the drama; depending on taste, 3 hours of it might be too long, but it felt just right for me.<br/><br/>On the negative side, it is hard to sympathize with any of the characters -- but is that really a negative? maybe it is better to watch the movie with detachment.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is that it all comes together: the plot; the action scenes; and the message that, just possibly, you might have to give up on anything you hold dear: not just for your own good, but also for the good of the very people you hold dear."

He's a pretty despicable character. I found myself rooting for the 'bad guys' the whole time. They're only 'bad guys' mostly out of desperation. Pacino's character is willing to sacrifice everything for his job... his family, his wife, etc.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer was put in a pretty weak role in my opinion.

The rest of supporting cast are good in their small roles but aren't given much to do. The movie is a bit long with a running time of almost three hours and it could've been much shorter. The pacing was kind of slow at times too but everything else more than made up for it's few flaws. The opening heist sequence is well done and the same can go for the intense shoot out in the streets of Los Angeles.

","A brilliant epic crime drama about a criminal played by Robert Deniro who is pursued by a cop played by Al Pacino. This is a multi layered film which can be appreciated on many levels and has so many deep themes. One of the common themes found that most people point out is the similarity between the lives of the criminal and cop. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. The main message that I got from this film is how life is full of choices and how every choice sacrifices something else. You might get a different message. This film sparks a lot of real emotion and the ending will surely bring tears to your eyes. In my opinion it's just as great as Godfather and it's a strong mystery at how it was overlooked at Oscars and is probably a perfect example that Oscars mean nothing. Lastly this is not just a masterpiece of storytelling but also a technical masterpiece and the sound effects and action scenes are spectacular especially highlighted by a famous street shootout scene. Lately many movies like Departed, American Gangster, Dark Knight were clearly influenced by this film but they are much inferior. Heat is a true classic. 10/10"

","People were wondering will this movie live up to the hype or suffer being just a major letdown.NO WAY!!!This is truly an amazing piece of art that stands up to the best movies in the genre.Some many fine actors but only two legends-Pacino and De Niro.These guys just stood out and gave the best they've got to outshine one another and the competition has never been so interesting.One is the brilliant cop the other is the mastermind of all robbers each one the best at what he does.The scene where the two are outplaying each other is one of the best on film.The two giants are just amazing and standing before one another was truly a great moment.Throughout the movie I personally sympathized with Mr De Niro seeing that he was actually very human and more noble than Al but that was probably director Michael Mann's idea.The end is simply powerful.I cried the 1st time I saw Neil getting shot but that was part of the magic.Be sure to see this right away if you haven't yet."
"blaker22","10","1","3","17 October 2007"," Crime Thriller with Heart and Brains
","Agree with all the other comments about its greatness, this might be my favorite film ever. But aside from that I'd just like to offer a comment that I didn't immediately come across in my perusal of the others, but one that seems pretty obvious to me upon viewing this movie recently for the 5th time: above all this is a movie about meaningful human connection.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** Is there any scene in the movie that doesn't pertain to this theme? You have the domestic scenes with Pacino, his wife and their daughter which are the most obvious. The woman just wants some attention from Pacino and because she doesn't get it, gets too stoned on prozac to realize her daughter is desperate for the same love. None of them can even have real meaningful conversations. The same goes with Kilmer and Judd. DeNiro is missing a connection of this sort and only now beginning to realize it, evident in the dinner-celebration scene in which he calls Edie. Edie herself is a naive and sincere midwesterner getting eaten alive by the disconnect running rampant in L.A. She's starved for some sort of meaningful interaction which makes her primed for even a dysfunctional relationship, one that she finds with McCauley.<br/><br/>Even the smallest scenes run rampant with this theme. You have Tom Sizemore with his apparent bimbo, a ""relationship"" that he's willing to sacrifice in the end probably because there's nothing real about it. He receives his due. There are the 2 or 3 scenes with the new-guy driver and his girl, which seem superfluous until the part where DeNiro approaches him in the diner and the viewer can witness exactly the torture that this character is going through as he sacrifices the one good thing in his life.<br/><br/>The end only makes sense when viewed through the lens of human connection. Otherwise the lingering shots on Edie as her heart is broken mean nothing, nor the pained indecision on Deniro's face as he has to drop everything in 30 seconds. The hand clasp at the end, is both characters' fulfillment of this need for a true companion. They are, after all, the two most similar characters in the entire movie, the only true compatriots, two men who sacrificed everything that matters to satisfy the needs of their careers. Goddamn this is a good movie."

","When you see the the great cast listed in this film, you know it is going to be good. And, your first assumption is that the acting will be top-notch. You assumption would be correct. However, it is the film's direction that makes this movie a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mann sets the story up for Heat very artistically. Pay close attention to the scenes that involve the men and the woman that man is romantically linked to. These scenes are shot consecutively with different couples and have a great impact as to what will happen next in the story. A truly masterful way to tell a story! Mann also makes the city of LA an important character in the film. His locations and cinematography are tops.<br/><br/>And this is not yet mentioning the great acting by Pacino, De Niro, Haysbert, Kilmer and the rest. This movie is a superb character study that propels the cat and mouse game between Pacino and De Niro forward.<br/><br/>Again, if you haven't seen this film, read my comments about the scenes between the couples that run consecutively. These scenes are extremely important. For those that have seen this movie, you should know what I mean.<br/><br/>This film is a classic. Not to be missed. Rating 10 of 10 stars."
"Benjamin_Cox","10","1","3","17 August 2007"," An outstanding crime film and certified modern classic - 94%
","Man, it's been a long time since anything impressed me as much as this stunning film from the brilliant Michael Mann. For a director specialising in stylish crime flicks, this is a fantastic film from a man clearly at the very top of his game. If you thought ""Collateral"" was good (and trust me, it is) then this will blow you away completely and not just because of the much-hyped meeting of Pacino and De Niro. It's searing realism and authenticity should mean that this remains one of finest examples of a cop thriller this generation has ever seen.<br/><br/>""Heat"" starts with the professional robbery of an armoured truck on the streets of LA which quickly turns into a triple homicide. Led by career criminal Neil McCauley (De Niro), they quickly regroup and prepare for the next big job - the one that will mean their retirement. But tracking them down is Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino), as driven and determined to catch them as McCauley is to see it through. As they each strive to gain the upper hand, their lives run parallel as each struggles with the demands of their partners and become ever more focused on their goal.<br/><br/>Despite dominating the film between them, Pacino and De Niro are the chocolate sauce on top of a knickerbocker glory of acting talent (if you know what I mean). Career-bests from Tom Sizemore and Ashley Judd as well as able support from Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman... actually, to good through the entire cast would take too long but suffice to say that the casting is almost universally spot-on. Kilmer is shown up for what he really is next to the greatness that surrounds him but even he can't detract from what is a brilliantly written and sharply executed action crime thriller. Captivating from start to finish, it is almost refreshing to see a crime film that relies on brains and acting instead of bullet-ridden set pieces to see it through. Not that ""Heat"" is a slow, plodding drama - the action sequences are some of the best I've seen, full of adrenaline and yet still able to tell a story without resorting to tired Hollywood clichés like a car chase or a fist-fight in front of some grand scenery in the background.<br/><br/>I find it staggering that more films don't mimic ""Heat"" more closely as this must be the template for future crime dramas in the years to come. Despite running for three hours, your attention never wavers and you're never entirely sure which heavyweight actor will come out on top. The confrontation in the diner between De Niro and Pacino is rightly recognised as a classic but it's just one scene of this faultless master-class. Assuming you're the forgiving sort and you can forget about Kilmer (who's merely OK instead of outstanding), ""Heat"" is the sort of film that reminds you why you watch movies. No CG, no animated creatures from Middle Earth - just good, old-fashioned, proper movie-making. Mr Mann, I salute you!"
"jzappa","10","1","3","15 June 2007"," Up There With GoodFellas, The Departed, The Godfather, and Scarface
","I had never realized Michael Mann was a genius before re-watching this film recently. I had seen Thief, Collateral, and Miami Vice, and though they are decent films, especially Collateral, I'd never thought of Mann as a master of his craft. When one sees Heat, they see the work of an ingenious filmmaker. The script is perhaps one of the most brilliant contemporary screenplays, because Mann as the writer is so honest with his material and characters that everything plays as naturally as one could hope for. Nothing is contrived, even the most complex symbolisms and the clearest testaments to the characters. We feel like we may have before seen the cops-and-robbers chase film wherein the hero and villain bond, and who knows? Maybe we have. Little of that matters because Heat is so well done. There is so much more to it that can be found from viewing to viewing to viewing. De Niro's stern, wary bank robber and Pacino's fixed, passionate cop feel more throughout the story than just an interest in each other. The film isn't just about the complex and wholly realistic connection that they feel. It's also about the objective statements pertaining to the audience, as we view the lives, in action and at home, of both cops and criminals, and we see how despite occupation, family life depends on what is offered by that cop or that criminal and the outcome is according to those projections.<br/><br/>Pacino and De Niro on screen in the same frame together was certainly a big deal when this film was coming out in 1995, and who could resist that concept? An idiot, yes, but hardly anyone else. But, between fanatics of these two unmistakably wonderful contemporary actors, let's just face it: They love themselves, and they nearly always play themselves. But the positive outlook on this fact, which it is, is that they still convince us that they thoroughly understand their very complicated characters. When people say that an actor plays himself, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are actually replacing a written character with their own personality. That's a cop-out. Many of the greatest contemporary actors ""play themselves,"" so to speak, and we still love them and believe them. Pacino and De Niro are two of these actors, their presence always being the same swaggering, short-fused leonine tough guy, but being such fine actors they are masters of channeling facets of their presence to convey the people they are portraying. The scene in the restaurant where they meet and talk to each other over coffee is a perfect example of two actors who play themselves yet it's so terribly hard not to understand what every nuance of their facial expressions and verbal inflections mean and how subtly they communicate.<br/><br/>The two leads may overshadow for some fanatic filmgoers a few smaller performances. Val Kilmer, another actor with an irrepressible presence, is thrilling to watch as one of the hardened criminals in De Niro's heist crew. The opening armored car robbery shows each member of the crew in a cold, machine-like mode wherein they are nothing but armed raiders, everything else removed. The script cleverly gives them introductory scenes afterwards, and in Kilmer's, we immediately get an overall feeling of the dynamic, quick-witted, selfish, short-tempered, impatient daredevil he is whose weakness is impulse, which serves as a clever antithesis of his partner De Niro's rigidly scrupulous and organized way of living the criminal life. Also in the same scene, which is actually quite brief and not even one of the best in the film, Ashley Judd equates her side of the screen with the same density of presence and communication of character, a fiery but practical wife with convictions for her own strong, deep thoughts.<br/><br/>I used that scene as an example to display how surreptitiously the film's writing and acting coincide to make such an effective film despite the weight of the attention given to Pacino and De Niro against such a large remaining cast. A scene that I'll mention simply to get all jumpy like an action-loving teenage guy is of course the extensive, beautifully paced, extremely intense downtown Los Angeles machine gun shootout. What a work of art! I haven't been this dazzled by an action sequence in a long long time. And if it is not one of the all-time greatest, most well-directed and exciting action sequences ever put on film, then there's no such thing as a well-directed, exciting action sequence, because, friends, this gunfight is the example any dictionary would use if defining one. Not only does it send your heart straight through your head like an exit wound from a bullet, so much happens in that scene for so many characters that the film is much intensified from that point on.<br/><br/>And you know, the fact that by now, you've surely thought that maybe constructive criticism would do well in a review, since that's generally what reviews are for and because reviews don't sound very convincing unless they have it at some point. So, I should clarify that Heat is completely my kind of movie. It has heists, it has beautifully directed action sequences, and it stars two actors whose careers have garnered this sort of film as a staple. However, this is why one should take into consideration that my opinion is of some value when I say that Heat has a place very high in a genre that holds such classics of the past thirty or forty years as GoodFellas, The Departed, The Godfather, and Scarface."

","This was a truly amazing film, with great dynamic intriguing acting to grip the audiences attention. Michael Mann has done a fantastic job upon the directorial side, assembling a great cast, this all pays of with a great film. De Niro and Pacinos first clash together on a film is superb. The hunter (pacino) is chasing the hunted (De Niro.) Niel Mcauley (De Niro) is a thief on the loose, and Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is the one to stop him. This epic chase puts Hannas family at risk. But none the less this is a true crime/cop thriller, which is right up there with the best of them including Dirty Harry and others.

"capitalzombie","10","1","3","29 April 2007"," One of Micheal Manns greatest stories PERIOD
","Heat, one of my personal favorites is a powerhouse of emotion and is a haunting and beautiful crime saga. when people first see the film, Mann fans expect them to talk about the heist and that what happens. besides the robbery being one of the greatest heist scenes in American cinema history, everything surrounding that is twice as great. First the story,a group of professional thieves are forced to pull a big one after the last job went stale. Apart from them, the cops who are tracking them are on the constant move when their thieves make a move. Second, the character build up is by far the deepest of any movie I've seen. Al Pacino plays a detective who is struggling to keep his work out of his personal life. Robert De Niro is a thief who plays the cool and composed professional but yet is isolated from everyone else. The movie's final comedown is simply beautiful and brings a tear to my eye as Al Pacino grips his dying enemy's hand as they realize that they are not so different after all."

","I hated this picture when I first saw it in a theater, hated it again on video when I was trying to like it, then saw it on cable one night when there was nothing good on (!) and fell in love - all the family background that I once hated finally clicked for me. That, and the length it adds, may be what turns some people off, including several of my friends. (That and feeling that Pacino is over the top here, which I have also learned to love - he's the last romantic left in acting.) In the end, there is no denying that Heat is a 10 out of 10 in these times in film, maybe better than The Departed, if not as culturally relevant as Goodfellas. Miami Vice fails because Mann did common themes of that film and Heat already in Collateral, and with more detachment than in Heat - so by the time he washed out in Miami Vice, passion (or ""heat"") had drained, and Farrell and Foxx had nothing to replace it with. I hope Mann makes one as good as Heat again, and collects an Oscar like Marty. Where he'll get the talent, I don't know."

","Heat. I saw this movie about two years ago, and honestly I cried at the end, that's how good it was. This movie gets NO credit whatsoever. Al Pacino plays a fantastic role as a cop who is trying to deal with his over-emotional step daughter and whore girlfriend. Throughout the whole movie, you keep seeing scenes of De Niro and Pacino back and forth, waiting until they actually meet. When they do, I think it's one of the greatest action scenes ever. De Niro running out of a bank, Pacino chasing after, you wonder who's gonna win. Most of the time in the movie, your rooting for Pacino, although De Niro (since he's just an outstanding actor) you sometimes feel the same about. Honestly, no one really gave this movie any credit, but how can you not? Pacino and De Niro on the same screen? Why didn't this movie get as much attention as it deserved? No Academy Award or Oscar nominations, that's pathetic."

","Michael Mann's thrillers are almost unmistakable. Even if the plots are different, you can feel it's a Michael Mann-movie by this strange mixture of melancholy, violent and urban atmosphere he creates. ""Heat"" is definitely one of the best thrillers of the nineties. What's so special about it are the characters (like in nearly all of the big movies). The two men on opposite sides of the law, who fight against each other until one of them dies. It's inevitable. They don't really like what they are doing, but are doing what they have to, because that's what they are good at. When this seemingly vastly different men finally meet, it's an unforgettable moment. One of many in ""Heat"". I'm impressed with the way the two players are being shown failing to maintain the relationships with their wive/girlfriend. And when there's action, it's a blast. All of this brought to screen by gangster-film legends Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, with the direction and writing of Michael Mann. (Nearly) Perfect."

","For me, this is Michael Mann's masterpiece. That's saying a lot, considering I find all of Mann's films to be excellent. It's a very interesting character piece that contrasts the roles played by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino.<br/><br/>Two scenes define this film for me and make it memorable. The first deals with the characterization, the second does not. The coffee shop scene is one of the best in cinematic history. Here you have DeNiro and Pacino, arguably two of the greatest actors of all time, sitting across from each other at a table, each discussing how they think things are going to play out for the other. The scene is as perfect as it can be, and is worth the price of admission in and of itself.<br/><br/>The second scene that will always be memorable for me is the gunfight in the street after the bank robbery. The first time I saw this, my reaction was, ""Wow"". I had never seen anything like that in a film before. The Wow factor has not deteriorated with subsequent viewings. The whole fight is staged perfectly, and one gets the sense of actually being there on the street in the midst of it.<br/><br/>As crime dramas go, they don't get any better than this."

Intricate plot details had to be caught in order to fully understand this movie. I fell in love with Chris (Val Kilmer) and his warm, dedicated love for the woman he loved. Robert De Niro enthralled me as Neil, he was sexy and strong, with an air of sophistication not usually associated with a cocky crook. Pacino was a ""spirit of the law"" cop that knew he had a job to do.

So if you're more the fast paced action movie viewer, there's a chance that you won't quite enjoy this movie that much.<br/><br/>Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn't been that good in a movie since Doc H. in ""Tombstone"" and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...<br/><br/>The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can't say I don't enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie.

"romankad","10","1","3","27 October 2006"," Masterpiece
","One of my MOST favorite movies. It lasts as long as it should, every second of it filled with the unique atmosphere of the approaching outcome. ALL of its characters are worth talking and talking about... But the confrontation of the two men is absolutely thrilling; awesome acting by Pacino and De Niro... Hanna and McCauley are almost twins, two 'aces' in everywhere but private life, it's shown throughout the whole plot, and is confirmed in that fantastic restaurant scene. What a dialogue between two enemies who suddenly understood each other so well...<br/><br/>Vincent: I don't know how to do anything else. Neil: Neither do I. Vincent: I don't much want to either. Neil: Neither do I.<br/><br/>And, though one of them finds his end before closing titles, the other barely has a future, too. Indeed, both of them live this 'disaster zone' existence which Hanna talks about - on both sides, professional (willingly) and private (NOT willingly, but...). ""Picnics"" :) Yeah, that (or almost that) actually IS the very future, the very normal life that both of them (Neil too, though not openly) greatly desire, but just CANNOT achieve - they would then have to change what for so long had been the basis of their personalities. As they both say, they don't' much want to... Moby's theme starting to play... The airport; landing airplanes carrying hundreds and thousands of people with normal, more or less happy lives, and there Vincent is, standing under them with a gun beside his finally defeated alter ego, with nothing but his 'disaster zone' ahead... Kilmer's Chris is the only one from the gang who did manage to escape from the Heat, he, his faithful and loving wife and their child may still hope to reach some future, at least better than Vincent's - but only if he WILL 'much want to'. My great respect and gratefulness to Michael Mann and ALL of the cast. The soundtrack is a gem, all the tracks adding a huge lot to the overall atmosphere. I find Moby's 'God Moving Over the Face of the Waters' theme marvelously enriching the final scene's impression; after I watched the movie several times I couldn't resist searching the web for info on the OST and getting me this magic-like track. I wholeheartedly recommend the film to everyone. To me, 'Heat' is a pure masterpiece."
"gavin6942","8","1","3","2 October 2006"," The First Great Matchup of DeNiro and Pacino
","This film is credited as the first great meeting of DeNiro and Pacino (in the Godfather films, they never shared screen time). And both men are quite exceptional in this piece... if only there were more screen time. Other than about 30 seconds in a diner, you can't see both men on the screen at once, so there's no guaranteeing they were even filmed on the same day.<br/><br/>The story is of a cop (Pacino) who puts his full energy into the capture of murderous thieves (DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, and Ted Levine). But doing this destroys his family life (with stepdaughter Natalie Portman). The goons, as well, find family life is hard to maintain when you're a murderous thief.<br/><br/>You already know Pacino and DeNiro can deliver the action, and you know Kilmer can too if you've seen ""The Saint"". And Tom Sizemore? Try picturing him in a romantic comedy... no, he was born for roles like this. So the action is a given.<br/><br/>But the emotional tears are also important, and they are what makes this film unlike other ones in the action genre. We actually care that these families are shattered. Also, we have the two main opponents sharing coffee, discussing their motivations and we see they are the same man on the opposite side of the coin. One man not only respects the other, but can completely sympathize with him.<br/><br/>I should note this is one of Natalie Portman's earlier roles (alongside ""Leon"" and roughly the same time as ""Mars Attacks!""). Her acting is not fully developed yet, and while she can carry most films, I'm pleased her part was so small because she was a weak point. In all honesty, her subplot could have been cut and the movie 10 minutes shorter and there would have been no loss.<br/><br/>All this from Michael Mann, perhaps best known for ""Miami Vice"" or ""Manhunter""... but thankfully his cast left their bright colored coats at home for this one. If you like bank heist movies, you're going to love this one. More action than ""Ocean's 11"" and much more depth than ""Dog Day Afternoon""."

Shooting scenes are as if you are personally in the middle of the shootouts. No bursting cars after 1 pistol shot, however, sorry guys to disappoint you. but that simply does not take place in reality. <br/><br/>well, this film surpasses its time, moves above the small, trivial and fashionable at the time things that may increase sales or put it in a higher box office place. That is why its a true rarity - it has all the unique characteristics to be the strongest film I've seen so far (and trust me I've seen a lot) and at the same time to be a box office hit. <br/><br/>Anyhow, it seems that the public is not always right on many things. What I mean is - why don't you look at the the greatest film listings for Action for example. Heat is not there my friends. I nevertheless find some interesting films in the top list - such as V for Vendeta, Batman Begins, King Kong (can you believe it?????), sin city, and the like. Unbelievable. Speechless. Dumb. <br/><br/>I am, however, quite interested to see how this list will change down the line, lets say 11 years from now. Why eleven years? Well, because Heat was done in 1995. Lets wait how Batman, v for whatever and sin city will score 11 years down the line from now. I bet they will not be there at all."
"haasxaar","10","1","3","2 September 2006"," A film of great humanity and skill
","After watching this film last night for the 4th or 5th time I now have to unpack one very old, yet true cliché. A great film never gets boring or repetitive. Maybe its because its so stylish, maybe because its so well acted, maybe because its so well written, maybe because its the perfect balance between escapism and reality that it makes it a pleasure to watch time and time again while always gaining something new from it.<br/><br/>Mann's talents are obvious. He masters atmosphere very very well. He can control the pace and mood of a film with much subtlety without seeming clumsy and unintelligent. De Niro's talents and Pacino's skills need not be discussed. However, while many films have a talented cast and set of people that does not always entail a great film. The basic ingredient is always the script. Here Mann excels to a height he almost eclipsed in 'The Insider' and 'Collateral' but never truly matched. Here its much more nuanced and focused on small details that really managed to convey the film's power better than just simply having big reputations attached to the billboard. 'Heat' succeeds were so many other crime thrillers don't even fail, they don't even accept the truths and depths that Mann reveals.<br/><br/>At first 'Heat' just seems to follow the traditional concept of cop vs robber formula. However, it differentiates itself from other crime films by depicting a humane, yet realistic criminal and a flawed, yet dedicated cop. Instead of forcing us to take sides Mann leaves it up to us to decide. The genius is that Mann dramatises it, he does not just simply articulate it and make it plain to see. Like life, its up to us to decide eventually what path we take, what course we choose is our responsibility. 'Heat' is easily Mann's best films and one of the very best it its genre and of the 90's altogether. It never becomes too tedious, or too fast, too flashy or too plain. Its humanity and objective look at characters is what places it above its competitors and never makes it simply just another crime cop thriller.<br/><br/>10/10"
"MovieAddict2016","10","1","3","17 July 2006"," An epic crime film.
","At the center of Michael Mann's ""Heat"" is a simple cop-and-robber story, but the film's understanding of its two leads, and their deep affinity and respect for each other, is what essentially propels the film into greatness.<br/><br/>It stars the two biggest names in Hollywood, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. For over thirty years, their performances have created critical milestones in acting. Although they both starred in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Godfather"" series, chronology prevented them from appearing on-screen together.<br/><br/>Over the years, their performances stirred the entire world. Pacino electrified with ""Serpico,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Scent of a Woman,"" ""Donnie Brasco,"" ""The Insider""; De Niro impressed audiences and critics alike with ""Taxi Driver,"" ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Once Upon a Time in America,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""Cape Fear,"" ""GoodFellas,"" ""A Bronx Tale,"" and ""Casino."" Both actors have won Best Actor Academy Awards, and have attracted fervent die-hard cinema fans. ""Heat"" marks their first -- and, to date, only -- film where they actually appear together in the same frame.<br/><br/>Their first meeting takes place in a small diner off a freeway. Their calmness and mutual respect is what separates it from a similar story that might have them involved in foot-and-gun chases for the entire running time. This diner confrontation is ultimately one of the major reasons the film impresses.<br/><br/>Pacino has been playing the same characters since ""Scent of a Woman,"" frequently yelling, ""Hoo-hah!"" and randomly shouting. His recent role in ""Angels in America"" was the perfect example of this tiresome persona -- a great actor who is starting to become lost (De Niro still has it, as far as I'm concerned, but Pacino needs to be careful). But if it's any consolation, this sort of frantic performance works well in ""Heat,"" resulting in the appearance of a tired cop who's been working on similar cases for far too long. Neil (De Niro), a criminal genius, is his perfect nemesis. Once he brings him down, his agenda will be fulfilled.<br/><br/>The film is described on the posters as a ""Los Angeles crime saga,"" about a cop on the trail of a smart villain. The cop is Vincent (Pacino), a newly-married LAPD officer who takes great pride in his job. ""It keeps me sharp,"" he tells his wife after she complains that he doesn't spend enough time with the family. To Vincent, there is no other life apart from his job.<br/><br/>Neil is planning to rip off a bank for millions of dollars. His last heist. He plans to settle down and raise a family, like his partner in crime (Val Kilmer) has already done with his wife (Ashley Judd). But you can't escape your past. Neil can only get so far before everything catches up with him. And, like a trapped animal, his only chance at survival is to attack the pursuer, which in this case happens to be Vincent.<br/><br/>It is rather unfortunate that Pacino and De Niro are compared to each other so often, since each actor brings something unique to their films. Pacino, with his increasingly raspy voice and occasionally over-the-top performances, is wilder than De Niro. His portrayal of Tony Montana in Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" was intense, and that same raw intensity he displayed there is brought to every role he has played over the years.<br/><br/>In ""Heat,"" he plays another intensely breezy, confident character. De Niro is once again the quieter, reserved character, saying little, observing, and controlling everyone around him with those penetrating eyes. He has a face that says, ""I own you,"" and his intimidation is greater than anything he could ever express in words.<br/><br/>The ending of ""Heat"" is absolutely brilliant, touching and moving. Suffice to say, I will resist spoiling it -- but it's far more tender than you might ever imagine. The film is based on an earlier work of Mann's, called ""L.A. Takedown,"" which is rumored to be included on the similarly-rumored Special Edition DVD.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is masterful in the way it manages to balance the two most colossal stars of our time in a film that goes beyond the boundaries of crime thriller and into the realm of cult masterpiece. I do not know if Pacino and De Niro will ever team up again, but if they do, I'd be satisfied if the result is only half as good as ""Heat."""
"golem3","9","1","3","31 March 2006"," Heat  Undoubtedly
","Heat is a classic thriller film  no, it's not just that, its one of the best cop-action films ever. Story takes place in crime ridden LA  what else does one need to know? With an all star cast, Heat presents a scenario where the robber maxima (De Niro) needs to pull off various heists when he's up against the worst enemy  a cop who's practically his theoretical twin (Pacino) and the heat is on.<br/><br/>What makes Heat so wonderful is that it's a throwback to the eighties, the thirties, and other eras of American history where mobs and gangs ruled the street. Where shootouts and raids were common and where cops had to be on top of things to do their job. The major shootout-getaway scene from the film can only be relived now in video games, such as the Grand Theft Auto franchise, which is reminiscent of another era of raw power, greed, and corruption.<br/><br/>Of course, people are dying for it, so much that they relish the vicarious pleasures of video games and film.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a movie that is filled with relationship difficulties as well as your normal action theme. This movie takes a humanistic perspective on action, which is unusual. Michael Mann has the good cop constantly forming relations with all people, especially the bad ones. In this way, we never feel bad about his actions, regardless of their moral or ethical basis.<br/><br/>Of course, there are the more classical relationship struggles that has been neatly elevated to the point of 'struggle' so rare for this genre of films, where the usual ""fuck and flee"" formula is followed. We see that all sides of the cop-villain fight is plagued with problems  everything begins at the home and ends at the workplace, and Mann clearly sees that there is no special treatment for the rich or infamous.<br/><br/>RATING 9/10 ""Never get attached to something so much you can't leave it in 30 seconds"""
"dhponder","10","1","3","20 September 2005"," Wholly original and fascinating post-modernism
","Michael Mann's Heat is truly a perfect movie. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, editing, and musical score tie the movie in together creating a movie experience unlike any other. The complex interdependence of the character's lives gives the movie realism and meaning to the post-modern audience. The script is taut and acute creating tension paralleled in a beautifully tragic and violent epic tale. Each time I re-watch the movie I feel I gain a deeper glimpse into the character's lives. The catch to this movie is understanding that in the post-modern universe no one is essentially in control. Here is the tragic irony because each character goes to great and costly lengths to maintain control however fails to keep it. Loneliness is a very deep and reoccurring theme that menacingly unnerves the characters and the audience alike. L.A. is a perfect setting because of the complexity of her society: economic, social, and political. Two top actors at the top of their careers giving a top performance. Essentially, there is no way further up except down and there is the beauty of the film."

","The master thief versus the master thief catcher. A classic tale of cat and mouse- continually swapping roles as the story develops. Who is hunting who? Robert De Niro is excellent as Neil McCauley- a professional criminal whose outlook on life is to ""Not become attached to something where you can't escape in 30 seconds when the heat comes 'round the corner."" But he disobeys his own law- and falls in love with a young woman in called Edie, thus, putting his priorities in jeopardy.<br/><br/>His arch rival, Vincent Hanna, played by Al Pacino- is almost a mirror image of his counterpart. A pill-popping partner, complete with estranged husband, and dysfunctional daughter to boot. His work is his life, and often serves as an unassailable barrier between both parts of Hanna's life- restricting him from continuing a fruitful relationship.<br/><br/>The poignant scene in this film is when both men come face to face, and vow to stop one another dead. Literally. What ensues is a deadly game of cop v robber, a high-stakes decision for both men, as to where their loyalties really lie In my humble opinion one of the most enthralling films of the mid-nineties, and a masterpiece on Michael Mann's account. Both leading men are at their best, with both acting in roles which they seem to revel in every time. A must-see by all definition! 9 out of 10"
"movieman_kev","9","1","3","1 September 2005"," can't beat Heat
","Al Pacino and Robert Deniro are two sides of the same coin as cop and robber in this brilliant character action drama. Deniro is a master thief who s looking to put together one last huge score with his crew, while Pacino, a masterful detective is hot on his trail with his own crew attempting to take them down. Each is extremely dedicated to their respective jobs Each's life pretty much mirrors that of the other. Ying and Yang. Good and evil. With shades of gray in between. Every character in this film is given a back story and the plot is both fairly simple and intricate in it's fine details. Even at almost 3 hours, one never feels that the movie is ever dragging, because it doesn't. And yeah, you more then likely know how it's going to end before even sitting down to watch it, but it's not really about that. It's much more the journey that the destination. Highly recommended <br/><br/>My Grade: A- 2-disc special edition <br/><br/>DVD Extras: Disc 1) Commentary by Director Michael Mann; and 3 Theatrical Trailers Disc 2) ""The Making Of Heat"" 3-part documentary; 2 featurettes (Pacino And De Niro: The Conversation, & Return To The Scene Of The Crime); and 11 Deleted Scenes"
"kevin142","9","1","3","28 July 2005"," Passion
","The movie happened just like in real life. It did not glorify the cop and did not qualify the gangster either. If Vincent and Neil were not opponents, they could become good friends. Both of them were astute and firm. Once a goal was set, they would go all out for it. As the gap existed, the tragedy could not be avoided. Of cause the movie had a positive ending. Righteousness triumphed over evil. That is also what we expect to see in reality.<br/><br/>In fact Vincent was a responsible man, though he had no enough time to take care of his family. His marriage was on the edge of breaking down. He took too much pressure. Although he looked tired, his passion on work never faded. I appreciate it very much. I think passion is the assurance of success. If we lose it, we can do nothing.<br/><br/>As to acting, the wonderful performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro was unforgettable. Although they appeared in Godfather2, they did not act face to face. Heat was their first co-operation. Really hope they can work together again.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of DieXueShuangXiong(English title is The killer, a good HongKong movie directed by John Woo). There was similarity between them, though the background was different. But Heat was deeper than DXSX on the depiction of the role. So Heat can become a classic.<br/><br/>One of the best gangster movies. 9/10"
"writerasfilmcritic","9","1","3","10 July 2005"," Less Noted Aspects of ""Heat""
","It must have been about 1996 or so when I remarked to a young clerk working at a video store what a great movie I thought ""Heat"" was. He enthusiastically concurred. I realized at that moment where Generation X got their obsession with the goatee -- from Robert De Niro's character, Neil McCaulay. Almost everyone in this flick hands in a good performance, with one notable exception. Al Pacino's unsympathetic wife, Justine (played by actress Diane Venora), really spoils the movie for me and she unfortunately has the most prominent female role. I couldn't stand the same actress as Clint Eastwood's wife in that movie where he's a boozing, irresponsible newspaper reporter trying to save a wrongly convicted death row inmate from execution. In both flicks, she is a whiny, self-absorbed, thoroughly annoying broad. In reading the first few of the several hundred comments about ""Heat,"" I have yet to see anyone remark about the character, Waingro. Geez, what a scumbag. The actor who portrays this evil serial killer/sociopath (Kevin Gage) does so very convincingly. Right from the start, you see what a bastard he is as he almost casually executes the bank truck guard for no apparent reason, an act of senseless brutality which causes the deaths of other two guards, as well. Afterward, in the coffee shop, he downs a piece of apple pie, completely unaffected by what he just did. Those hard, squinting blue eyes just exude pure evil. This is most evident when he intimidates the young black prostitute he has just had sex with and is about to murder, and even more so when he advises money launderer Van Zandt that he's got ""some moves"" he can make that ought to help him get rid of De Niro's character, McCauley, who has threatened to kill him. Two women in this movie deserve special mention simply because they look so good in it --Ashley Judd as Chris's wife and Amy Breneman as Neil's girlfriend. The latter never looked better (and unfortunately never looked quite this good again) while the former certainly did have ""a great ass,"" as Al Pacino noted. <br/><br/>Of course, the best part of the movie is the bank robbery in downtown LA, where Val Kilmer's energetic wielding of his automatic rifle steals the scene. It apparently inspired some would-be robbers who later also faced off against the LAPD with automatic weapons. Tom Sizemore as Michael, the electronics expert, is a sympathetic character who always gets the job done, whether it be efficiently neutralizing an alarm system or methodically dispatching an escaping assassin with a pump shotgun. Also likable is the grill man who in the blink of an eye decides to accept Neil's offer to fill in as wheel man for the bank job just because he is sick of his obnoxious weasel of a boss. This long movie (almost 3 hours) is nothing if not entertaining, a definite must-see."

","Los Angeles at night is a strange sight. From a distance it looks almost ethereal, but at the same time it's all just streetlights and buildings. This city is the landscape of Heat, Michael Mann's well-crafted 1995 film about cops and robbers. The fact that Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are both included in the cast has been much-ballyhooed, and for good reason. This isn't the first time they've both appeared in the same movie (that distinction goes to The Godfather Part II), it is the first time they've acted together on screen. Even if just for Pacino and De Niro's inclusion, Heat would still probably be worth seeing once. But Michael Mann has made a film here that is both tight and truly tense.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting aspects of Heat is how it seems to suggest that cops and robbers need each other more than they may let on. The restaurant scene works so well because you get the sense that other than their job descriptions, cop Vincent Hannah (Pacino) and criminal McCauley (De Niro) have a lot in common. They're both middle-aged, completely devoted to their work, and as both concede, don't know how to do anything else than what they do. Now is it unorthodox for a cop to offer to buy a criminal a cup of coffee? Maybe, but it works. Over time, something of an uneasy attachment grows between the two. I'll admit that it feels a little forced at the ending, but otherwise I thought it was really well done.<br/><br/>The other topic that Michael Mann explores at length is the women in their lives. Vincent's wife (Diane Verona) is concerned about his obsession with his job. Vincent doesn't really live with her, in her mind, but ""among the remains of the dead"". And their daughter (played by Natalie Portman before she became a star) is troubled by her other father's failure to show up. McCauley on the other hand falls in love with a woman who he initially is aloof to (Amy Brenneman). Actually, falling in love probably isn't the right phrase, as he too is committed to his work above her. Thrown into the mix are McCauley's accomplice (played by Val Kilmer) and his wife (Ashley Judd, also before she became famous). These relationships could easily be clichéd, but Michael Mann manages to make it something more insightful.<br/><br/>Some of the technical aspects are worth mentioning as well. The glossy cinematography in particular complements the slick narrative, even if Mann's own Collateral looks static in comparison. The heist scenes are also well edited. Instead of lingering on the carnage like someone like John Woo might, it's chaotic like an actual heist would probably feel. The film does admittedly lose some momentum after the bank heist.<br/><br/>All in all, Michael Mann's Heat is more intelligent than many films of the same genre aspire to. Come for Pacino and De Niro, stay for the film."

If you don't like this movie...you don't like movies. Working in a video store for 3 years, I saw a lot of movies...but this movie was the one I recommended the most, to all ages, and all types of movie watchers. I don't think one person came back and said I was wrong. Deniro is hard, cool perfection in a role that was tailor-fitted to his acting strengths. Pacino's portrayal of a cop at the edge was done with the bravado only Pacino gets away with because of its consistency and power. The story is well developed, dramatically flawless and beautifully directed by Michael Mann. It truly lives up to its adline: An L.A. Crime Saga. I don't throw the word around easily...but Saga this was. I've yet to see a film so masterful in its execution...not sayin' its the best movie of all time...but I think you could make an argument that its one of the best crime dramas ever put to celluloid and FEW would have grounds to argue."

","Michael Mann's Heat is without doubt in my mind the best film of 1990's and due to its atmospheric prowess and clinical precision one of the best films ever made. Despite the obvious might of the worlds two greatest actors De Niro and Pacino pitched along side each other, it is the vision and impeccability of Mann's professionalism that propels it into a league of its own. Never mind frivolous remarks that it is too long, the film has a perfect length as it requires to make it such an epic tale. The supporting cast cannot be knocked as they all play out their roles with dedication. A major element of the film which is often overlooked is its magnificent score. With many people performing for the films music most notably Terje Rydal, Eliot Goldenthal and Moby the 20+ tracks are a music delight expertly capturing the mood of Mann's vision. A well made, enjoyable crime film at worst and the greatest cinematic excursion at best, Heat cannot be knocked and cannot be praised enough. Perfect!"

","This is one of those movies that has it all...outstanding acting, o/s directing, tight writing / dialogue, EVERYTHING! From the incredible performances of De Niro & Pacino - both Oscar-worthy, to the same level of acting / depth provided by Kilmer / Voight / Judd / Sizemore / Studi / Trejo / Haysbert....all of them. Michael Mann's direction, use of light and sound, tight shots and ability to present 'the whole story' with such an efficiency of words and the use of body language / other details is simply how it should be done. His script just crackles with tension, bravado, angst, emotion, it's so easy to get caught up in this film. This film is mandatory viewing for anyone man, PERIOD. It includes (perhaps) the BEST cop / bad-guy, shoot-'em-up dramatic action scene ever (clearly the best of the '90s) and just does such a good job of giving the viewer a glimpse into both sides of the law, without playing into such trite and tried cliché roles of cops-and-robbers clone films.

The action scenes of the film were quite amazing!

","All those who expect a great action flick will not be disappointed by Michael Mann's excellent gangster-film 'Heat'. Those who wish a little more will not be let down either. After a slow and rather conventional, and therefore pretty uninteresting beginning, the movie's rhythm gets faster and tries to tell the story of several characters (De Niro, Pacino, Kilmer, etc.) at once. The consequence of this is that the film lacks a little bit a precise focus, while the structure still is excellent. How well the different elements eventually fit together is amazing and, especially for an action film, brilliant. The two protagonists are extremely well drawn, which is mostly due to the excellent performances by Pacino and De Niro, but the cast in general (Voight, Levine, Portman, ...) is breathtaking. And let us not neglect the most important part of an action movie: the action scenes. Their choreography is an example to follow for other directors. So, all in all one of the best action films of the 90s whose acting and direction are marvelous.<br/><br/>Rating: 84<br/><br/>MarSco"

","Heat is an extremely underrated film. It is probably Michael Mann's greatest film, and Michael Mann is one of the finest contemporary directors.<br/><br/>Heat is a sprawling, intelligent, and action packed movie about a gang of thieves and the cop (Pacino) who is determined to take them down at all costs. The film is unique from other movies of the same genre and of the same subject matter, as it is not just a brainless shoot em up flick (although there is plenty of gun-play here) but it is an intelligent character study. The film is like a finely woven quilt, each piece has been artfully put there and lends itself to the image as a whole.<br/><br/>The story follows Neil McCauley (DeNiro) and his gang of thieves, which include Kilmer, Sizemore, and Danny Trejo. They plan one final heist together, and along the way catch the ""Heat"" who in this case is Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and his gang of LAPD cronies. They stumble along onto McCauley's plans and try to take them down. However McCauley is wise to the trap and decides to take the score anyway. Well anyway from here the film steamrolls towards the climax, which includes one of the most spectacular and most realistic gun battles ever captured on film. <br/><br/>Mann's artful direction has the film straddling the line between action masterpiece and great emotional human drama. DeNiro is excellent as McCauley, a professional thief who is torn between love and his credo: ""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" He is just looking for one more score, and then he is willing to walk away from it all, but he finds that you can't plan on everything, (just like in ""Asphalt Jungle"")even the loose ends and variables can bury you. Kilmer and Sizemore are terrific as McCauley's cronies, and Trejo adds the L.A. urban flavor to the film and a touch of authenticity. Pacino is excellent, as a workaholic cop who has sacrificed his personal life in order to take down crews like McCauley's. His devotion to his job, has blurred the lines between his career and an obsession. <br/><br/>The film is thoroughly enjoyable to watch if you do not mind the over 2 1/2 hour runtime. But the film is definitely worth it, you are treated to more than one great performance, witty and intelligent dialogue and some great action sequences and any chance to see a Michael Mann film should not be missed."

But this is not one of the great cop films of all time. Call me old fashioned, but I appreciate the gritty, grind it out cops like Popeye Doyle,Frank Bullitt, and even Harry Callahan to Vincent Hanna.  Somehow, I have difficulty envisioning Hanna staking out the front of a restaurant in NYC on a very cold and damp evening.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that try as hard as Mann did, I was never convinced that Vincent Hanna was a blue collar cop.<br/><br/>Michael Mann churns out very stylish films, and this one is no different. He's got two great actors and a fine ensemble cast. I particularly admire Tom Sizemore's performance.  This could have been a far better film had Mann made his cop and robber a little less ""Hollywood"" and a little more believable.  These guys are just a little bigger than life.<br/><br/>Comparing this movie to French Connection is like comparing Miami Vice to Kojak.

The pacing is bad and it's overly long because of that. In one scene, an entire police squadron is wasted by a few criminals. It's so utterly laughable. Lazy storytelling and more moronic titillation for the mindless and easily pleased.<br/><br/>There really isn't anything here to get worked up about or find intellectually stimulating. It's just your run-of-the-mill action / shoot 'em up. Al Pacino can act, but we knew that already. If you want a quick bit of entertainment on a bored Sunday, this is the film for you. Otherwise, don't bother.<br/><br/>5/10"

","A truly great idea for a 1990's blockbuster, made all the more bigger by announcing it would finally feature two of the finest American actors to ever grace the screen (Robert De Niro & Al Pacino). ""HEAT"", is a powerful movie with many meaningful moments, and a downtown L.A shootout scene regarded as one of the very best.<br/><br/>We follow the life of professional thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), who frequently commits high profit crimes with him gang (Among them is Val Kilmer, who is also fantastic). As they prepare to go their separate ways they decide to commit one final heist, before some face the challenge of settling into their new kind of ""Retired"" lifestyle. At the same time we cut to the lifestyle of Police Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), facing heat (Pun intended) from both his wife and work life. All this and more while trying to help his young severely depressed step-daughter (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Throughout the film which is admittedly quite lengthy, it shines most of all when De Niro and Pacino meet. Their first tense confrontation starts at the coffee shop as both find themselves being not so different from each other, to the next time when they're shooting away at each other senselessly. All in all, the film builds to an obvious yet satisfying climax that makes you wonder all along who you were rooting for. ""Heat"" is very admirable. Michael Mann obviously had great affection for his story, and he executes the style perfectly. Watching that iconic shoot-out on a big TV with a loud surround system, is an experience every action film lover has to witness.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Add the family morales that John Woo would incorporate, along with the suspenseful face-to-face moments you would swear Hitchcock influenced them. All makes ""HEAT"" one hell of a force to be reckoned with. 9/10."
"ArthurJimbo","8","1","4","28 April 2014"," Heat stands out / Nay-sayers are pretentious laymen
","I am reading all the people here who have rated this movie a 1 and the sheer audacity of their two sense is simply ludicrous. Laymen have an opinion that is obviously valid to them but it carries no weight and is hardly notable.<br/><br/>People are attacking this movie and finding a great deal of faults. You would think this movie was on the level of ""gigli"" or something awful of that nature. If this movie is a 1 rating, then what in Gods name is ""gigli""...minus 5!? Some people talk of Pacino as if he knows nothing of what he is doing. Yeah, sure, lets reduce him to the level of Britney Spears entering into the world of acting. One reviewer went as far as to say a dog could have been cast in his part considering how he barks out his lines. What? I say to this person..there is absolutely nothing wrong with an actor being ON his voice. Nothing wrong. Others have said he is overrated and he overacts? I say to them..have you ever performed on a world wide stage a day in your life? NO, I didn't think so! People throw around ""Over-acting"" or ""over-the-top"" way too much.<br/><br/>Over-acting is underlining the obvious. Over-acting is showing something in ignorance that is not there. Overacting is a trap something novice wanna be actors in acting classes throughout America fall into when they are nervous and have no idea what they are doing. <br/><br/>Every negative jerk who is simply just tired of watching Pacino accuses him of being over the top. But, hes not playing the anti-hero here. He s not playing the introvert. Hes playing a type A personality cop. A very out going hardened cop who has a bit of a shell hes built up around him. Hes a serious minded cop who is on his voice and uses it to his advantage to get things done. Unfortunately, it bleeds over into his personal life even though it seems as if he doesn't truly desire this, ultimately<br/><br/>Come on people. If you are tired of watching him, don't watch! But don't come on here and try to sound all smart and studious about the performing arts when you clearly have no effing clue what you are talking about! And, by god, don't attack a man who is serious and seriously good at his craft. Its his life-time work. How about I come as a laymen and attack you on your job when I have no clue what it means to perform a day in your shoes in that profession. <br/><br/>Pacino overacting!? Get outta town. That's plain stupid. The man has proved he is among the better film actors we have had. Period.<br/><br/>Heat is a very interesting movie. It has action as well as actors who make the story come to life with a touch of reality and truth. I think what is exceptionally interesting is that Pacino is the ""good"" guy but he doesn't have his life together and he is NOT much of family man. De Niro is a ""bad"" guy and he seems to be more pure at heart and has simplified his life with a nice lady. He has a much healthier outlook and perspective. I think those opposites alone make this movie head and shoulders above much other drivel for action movies.<br/><br/>People rate movies a 1, I think, because they feel the movie is overrated and they take it upon themselves to balance it out. What pretense they must have to take it upon themselves (laymen) to play god and balance things. I really feel that these people completely skew the true rating of all the movies on here. A 1 rating for a movie should be relegated to something truly despicable and novice. Like, say, a student film that was slapped together at the last minute by someone lazy just to get a grade.<br/><br/>If you want to get away from your day and you don't have your head truly stuck up your a$$..I think you will enjoy this film."

Al Pacino and Robert De Niro is another reason why this flick shouldn't be missed at all cost. Michael Mann is a genius when it comes to creating characters like ""Neil McCauley"" (De Niro) and he has put hostile to be a hero and we see him in the shape of Al Pacino, the final product is adorable, its so fascinating that one will watch it again and again.... and again.. Heat is among one of those films that you watch but can't stop thinking about, remember what John Keats said once? ""A thing of beauty is a joy for ever"" that is exactly it, a haunting beauty. De Niro is Neil McCauley and he is unstoppable along with his team, they are professional enough to face even a 100 degrees heat from Cops."

","HEAT was a great movie with fantastic acting from Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, the storyline was well thought out and very interesting. The bank robbery scene and the shootout following were one of the best scenes in the movie. The climax was incredible and the acting of De Niro and Pacino was extremely appreciated. The director made a very good decision on the casting role seeing as how he got two legends to work together in the same movie.

"RyanCShowers","Null","1","4","14 July 2013"," A slick, polished thriller
","Movie fans and film snobs already acclaim Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino as two of the best actors in the history of entertainment. From the past experience of putting them in the same movie, The Godfather Part II, magic is bound to spark. While Heat isn't quite what one would assume it to be, it succeeds at being a mature, emotional experience that defines itself at the top of the action genre for years to come. Robert DeNiro has a beef with politicians during elections: they tear their opponents down and sacrifice their dignity instead of trying to prove themselves to the American people. Heat is an action thriller with dignity. While other action movies are concerned with what neat stunts can they throw at the audience, Heat internally speaks to the viewer as well as bringing well choreographed action scenes.<br/><br/>Director Michael Mann, makes Heat more personal than most action thrillers. In fact, Mann doesn't tell the story as if it were a action movie at all. He tells a story centering in on the lives of two men who are connected by a few pieces of action. Mann delivers the film with a tense feeling, and establishes a gloomy tone. The engrossing score is cautiously placed the in the correct places. Heat succeeds technically, as well; the sound quality that adds to the excitement of the action scenes. The suspense is successful because Mann creates the film's tension sensitively. All the action and suspense is met perfectly because of the tender touch of Michael Mann. <br/><br/>DeNiro and Pacino lead the adept cast creating one heck of an acting ensemble. Al Pacino has moments of greatness, but those are contrasted with some cringe-inducing moments. His highs are pretty high though and make up for the brief moments of instability. DeNiro, playing the darker character, is solid and consistent from his first scene to the last, giving him DeNiro the slight edge over Pacino. Both are great actors doing great work. Like their first appearance together, The Godfather Part II, they each lead their own section of the film, but in Heat they come into one-on-one contact half-way through the movie. It's a rare scene when the cop and the bad guy sit down for conversation and coffee.<br/><br/>""Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you the heat around the corner,"" is a line said by Robert DeNiro's character that resonates a lot of what the film is about. Heat is a slick polished thriller that holds carefully plotted action scenes while packing a powerful punch in the topics of abandonment, life, and admiration. The last scene's poignancy solidifies Heat as a movie to remember.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

The desire of seeing the 2 best actors of contemporary cinema remained till 1995 when Michael Mann decided to have them in ""heat"" together. Mann, completely aware about people's expectations, keeps 2 actors away for first 90 minutes of the film. When Pacino as a police officer faces gangster Deniro in a café, the masterpiece begins. What would a police officer say to a gangster who is trying to arrest while He does not have enough evidence? What they talk about is the complete brilliance; life issues, their women and their jobs! Pacino and his hilarious body movements against Robert Deniro who only nods his head! It looks like to be a calm friendly conversation which is not. It's full of sarcasms. They both know one will have to kill the other but they are considering different possibilities. The scene finishes when both characters threaten each other enough.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","4","6 February 2013"," A modern crime classic
","At the time of its release, ""Heat"" was notable for being the first meeting of Al Pacino & Robert De Niro on the big screen. True, they'd both been in ""The Godfather: Part II"" but their stories were set in different time periods so they never shared any scenes.<br/><br/>Here, De Niro plays professional bank robber Neil McCauley while Pacino plays his nemesis, lieutenant Vincent Hanna. Most of the movie is a cat and mouse game as Hanna links McCauley and his crew to a recent heist and begins to anticipate their next move. Meanwhile, the personal relationships of several of the principals are explored as the events of the movie unfold.<br/><br/>As you might expect, the cast is one of the film's greatest assets. In retrospect, it's amazing how many recognizable actors are present here. Then again, who wouldn't want to take part in a movie featuring both Pacino & De Niro? That being said, I don't know if I really consider any of the performances to be particularly outstanding. Pacino can be a bit over the top at times and while De Niro's as solid as always his performance here doesn't rank up there with the likes of ""Taxi Driver"" & ""Raging Bull"". The third-billed star, Val Kilmer, is satisfactory but ultimately forgettable.<br/><br/>Michael Mann's script & direction deserve praise but, unaccountably, the movie received very little notice from awards bodies. The film has a vaguely European feel that distinguishes it from most American crime movies. The criminal elements are balanced with interpersonal drama that invests the simple premise with unexpected depth. The film's hefty runtime is justified and, if anything, the movie only becomes more riveting as it goes on.<br/><br/>Dante Spinotti's attractive cinematography is another unheralded aspect of the film. The film's music is also distinctive, with the soundtrack/score having a modern, ambient feel by virtue of featuring music from Moby, William Orbit & Brian Eno, among others. That being said, being unconventional, it may not be to everyone's taste.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Heat"" is definitely one of the better crime dramas to come out within the last 20 years or so. It's frankly amazing that it was completely ignored by Oscar, Golden Globe & BAFTA voters back when it was originally released. It deserved better, as is evidenced by the continued respect that it receives today."

The only thing I felt the film was missing was more scenes between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, obviously they are the stars of the movie but they aren't seen together very much at all, the part in the coffee shop was amazing as we got to see two acting legends play off each other, and I would have loved to have seen more scenes like that, the chemistry between them was pure and natural. One thing I really love about Michael Mann's writing is that he gets the audience to follow, and also feel for, the antagonist just as much as the protagonist, it isn't just about the movies hero trying to capture the villain, we follow the bad guy as well, we learn about his motives and we actually feel sympathy for him, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both do an outstanding job as both characters, they are both very flawed but also likable, no matter who wins in the end, we are left feeling remorse for the other. Thrilling, action packed and many outstanding performances, I would recommend Heat to anyone looking for a good drama or crime film. <br/><br/>When a bank robber leaves a clue behind after his last crime, he begins to feel the heat of the law on his track, while the main detective on this case develops an obsession with finding him. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Al Pacino Worst Performance: William Fichtner"

"starlit-sky","7","1","5","25 October 2010"," Heat doesn't provide much heat
","I saw Heat when it first came out to theaters back in 1995. I also recently saw The Town. Many people claim Heat is the better picture and that Town took its story and basic plot elements from Heat.<br/><br/>Even though there are similarities, I think The Town doesn't deserve most of the criticism and Heat doesn't deserve most of the acclaim. In my opinion Heat is way too long. The director (Michael Mann whom I like) wanted to show too much about the personal love affairs of the characters. I know this was done for the purpose of character development but it was too shallow and didn't develop anything. It was too shallow because the problem of each love affair was the same: character's job (either police or criminal). And the same thing was repeated for all 3 characters, Vincent (Al Pacino), Neil (Robert De Niro) and Chris (Val Kilmer). They all have problems in their relationships. I think the movie is trying to do too much; it should have either focused on the relationships of characters and made it a drama or should have focused on the crime aspect and made it action/suspense. For example, in the beginning we see Al Pacino making love to his wife, taking a shower, all long scenes, and then there are scenes where his step daughter Lauren (Natalie Portman) is arguing with his mother because she is unhappy about her father. I thought these scenes really didn't add anything to the story.<br/><br/>I also think the some scenes in Heat is too much Hollywoodized - it's funny because most people actually make this accusation about the Town. My examples are ******SPOILER ALERT*****: Robert De Niro is supposedly a very disciplined character (so disciplined that he can leave everything behind if he senses the heat around the corner). But then we see him slapping one of his team members in a diner where everyone is watching. Tom Sizemore gives a dirty look to one of the patrons. I thought this scene was totally Hollywoodish to show they are really tough guys. Why would a disciplined criminal would beat up his team member in a diner? That would draw attention and is risky. Later we see them outside the diner trying to finish up the job. They are about to take care of the guy but they lose him, right in front of their eyes. All these scenes made me dislike The Heat. Also at the very end, it is the wrong guy who gets shot. It is the wrong guy because he had major advantage over the other guy who should have been the one to get shot. That scene was poorly designed*******.<br/><br/>There are good things about heat. It is a fine crime/drama. Robert De Niro is great although I find his romantic affair to be unrealistic and lack of feeling. I think Heat probably deserves a rating of 7. I also predict that within a year or so, The Town will surpass Heat's rating."

","The narrative of mental and physical duel between Pacino and De Niro is expanded to include needless subplot of other robbers' private lives. It becomes more and more boring except that memorable shootout in the street after bank robbery.<br/><br/>Pacino spends the whole picture chewing gums and shouting at everyone in sight; Kilmer is as stiff as usual. Diane Venora, as Pacino's wife, always speaks in a low tone while Pacino's voice over the top. It's irritating to watch these two actors in conversation, because the viewer has to adjust the sound volume continuously.<br/><br/>On his way to the airport, De Niro suddenly drives off the highway and gets to the hospital to eliminate a traitor who worked for him. After he finishes the job unconvincingly, Pacino finds him on the street and chases after him. It's absolutely ridiculous that they can run from the hospital to the airport without cars. More silliness in the final showdown: De Niro is stupid enough to jump out of his hiding spot to be shot by Pacino. I wouldn't say the film is a masterpiece."

","OK...I like this movie. I like Michael Mann in general. But the idea that ""Heat"" is some kind of definitive crime movie is pretty silly.<br/><br/>It does get lots of points for being a very long movie that never really drags at all. But it would still have been much better with a half-hour (or more) cut out of it. The film school touches intended to produce an ""epic"" nearly all misfire; the VERY strong supporting cast somehow keeps several of them from turning into major LOL moments.<br/><br/>The performances of the leads are wildly overrated by IMDb members. Pacino mugs his way through this, as he does most of his films since ""Scarface."" DeNiro is much better but nowhere near the top of his game. People always praise Val Kilmer for ""keeping up"" with these icon guys, but the reality is they aren't running all that hard to begin with. That said, Kilmer is good here, as is the entire supporting cast.<br/><br/>Crime movies don't have to be realistic to be great (see ""Sin City"") but it's incredible how many people think Michael Mann makes ""realistic"" action films. Yeah, he's obsessed with technical details and gets them right more often than most directors. But there's just about nothing realistic about ""Heat"" or ""Collateral""; they both exist in a make-believe LA populated by make-believe good guys and bad guys. Frankly, if you think Mann's crime films are true-to-life, then everything you know comes from movies and TV and headline news.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here; I highly recommend you see ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"" - they are both extremely well-made and pretty damn riveting.

","This ""De Niro Vs Pacino"" showdown could never possibly live up to the the hype surrounding such a movie. And this is basically the problem. For huge De Niro and Pacino fans (such as me) the two of them on screen together could never meet my expectations.<br/><br/>This cops'n robbers movie feels like less than the some of it's parts. There is a slow, almost romantic, feel to the movie. Pacino's performance feels tired. De Niro looks uncomfortable with the two of them on screen together and even a little intimidated by the prospect. I think Michael Mann must have had a hard time deciding who would play the cop and who would play the robber. Watch the film and find out.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast includes Jon Voight, who's character is supposed to be some sort of sleazy criminal master mind. Voight however looks extremely old and you get the feeling the director just wanted another big name to place on the poster. Val Kilmer's performance is surprisingly good, considering the titans he's sharing the screen with. You immediately feel sympathy for him.<br/><br/>It is however a little-known actor (in comparison) by the name of Dennis Haysbert who steals the scene with the few minutes he has on screen. He plays an ex-con who's decided to go straight and is heavily supported by his wife. There is a scene between them that brought a tear to my eye when she tells him she's proud of him and doesn't understand why.<br/><br/>What Michael Mann does get right is the depth of the characters. Each character's life is explored in every area. The effects of their chosen profession on their personal lives is a central theme. As a result you feel sorry for both criminals and cops alike. All characters are shown with flaws, even the good guys.<br/><br/>The problem with pitching Pacino against De Niro is that one of them has to win. Throughout the movie I hoped that both would. You'll have to see the film to find out.<br/><br/>All in all, I really hope that Pacino and De Niro team up again on screen, although it's probably unlikely. If this is to be the only movie where they share on-screen time then it's a disappointment.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If it wasn't for the cast, this film would have gone straight to video. It is a fine piece of work but not fitting for kings of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I recommend watching it if you're die hard fans of Pacino and De Niro. If not, then it's just another Cops'n robbers movie."

","""Heat"" was recommended to me for its supposedly original and fascinating storyline. However, just having spent 3 hours of my life watching the DVD, I'm somewhat surprised to report that story & characters are by far the weakest link in the movie. Like other reviewers have reported, the film is overly long, mainly because Michael Mann tries to cram way too much subplots in, none of which work since the characters are all tragically generic, the women especially. Also - and I always hate it when scripts do this - much is made of the supposed cleverness and intelligence of the Pacino and De Niro characters. So why do they make one stupid decision after the other? Aaah, that's probably what their mutual attraction is all about, punctuated by a terribly boring coffee scene and culminating in a hysterical manly handshake before the credits roll.<br/><br/>Anyway, see this movie for the great sound, hardcore action and, probably, if you like Pacino and De Niro."

","Is there anyone else who thinks this movie is over-rated? Yes, the crime sequences are memorable and done with skill, but the domestic scenes are painfully bad, not to mention entirely unnecessary. Every time either Ashley Judd or Natalie Portman enters the picture, the story just grinds to a halt. And while Michael Mann may have a keen visual sense, he can't write dialogue to save his life (not unlike George Lucas). And the characters? What characters? The criminals, in particular, are devoid of personalities. If someone asked you to give a brief description of Deniro's character, or Kilmer's, or Trejo's, what would you say? At the end of the film I never felt that I got to know any of them in even the slightest way. Eliminate the domestic scenes, infuse the characters (the criminals especially) with some personality, and you've got a great film. As it stands, though, ""Heat"" is a mediocre film with some great scenes."

","I accidentally set up an interesting juxtaposition with this film: the day after watching ""Heat"" I watched ""Notes on a Scandal"" (Cate Blanchett, Judith Densch). ""Scandal"" was twice as riveting and tense as ""Heat"", and this while being centered on two women schoolteachers and no guns. (I'm perfectly into cop movies, but it seems worth noting).<br/><br/>Al Pacino mostly acted like an impressionist doing Al Pacino. Robert De Niro was much more subtle; he gets the higher grade here. Supposedly this film is a little deeper than others like it because we get to know the domestic lives of the characters. Well, not really. By the end of the film we have no idea what the attraction is between Val Kilmer's and Ashley Judd's characters or what her loyalty is to him. Given some hints of Al Pacino's character's backstory, I can't imagine why his current wife, to the extent we know her, married him. At any rate, it's the usual cliché of the detective too obsessed with his work to be present for his family. Old.<br/><br/>Nearly every scene involving De Niro and his gang is worth watching. Nearly every scene with Pacino in that over-the-top mode of his is irritating and standard-issue for a 1970s gritty urban cop movie (except that this happens to be filmed in 1995). That includes the usual suspects, no pun intended, who people the gritty urban detective squad. So, figure 90 minutes not bad, 90 minutes irksome."

All the leading players have wives/girlfriends who want them to settle down and be there for them all the time blah blah blah. Way too much senseless chatter in what should be a taut crime flik.<br/><br/>I'm not a big de niro fan but here i liked him. He plays a truly tough guy who can kill with the best of them but only when necessary. The Pacino character didn't work for me cause of the way he bullied everyone around in this film.

Way too many women for a cops and robbers movie. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore trying and failing to act. Enough black characters to qualify for some kind of NAACP award. The same five doofus cops working every shift, day and night.

"DeuceWild_77","9","0","1","28 May 2019"," Grim, stylish, sophisticated, well written, photographed & directed, surely among Michael Mann's best work !!
","""Heat"" was publicized as the first movie featuring Pacino and De Niro in the same time frame (excluding of course ""The Godfather - Part II"") and was often criticized as not being as memorable as it should have beeen the few scenes they shared in the wide angle shots.<br/><br/>First of all, ""Heat"" is a brilliantly written film, a modern day tragedy, a crime / thriller epic of great proportions, featuring one of the best heist scenes ever put on camera.
Michael Mann's sense of streets' reality with his stylish visuals was well-known back then, he had already created two of the best TV Shows from the 80's Era: ""Miami Vice"" and ""Crime Story"" and directed ""Manhunter"" ('86), the first ever adaptation of a Thomas Harris' novel featuring the Hannibal Lektor / Lecter character and ""L.A. Takedown"" ('89), a pilot for a new TV Show that was not acquired by the network and became a TV film. This flm became the basis for ""Heat"". What Mann could not tell in just hour and a half, he made it again, only this time the way he envisioned with a much larger budget and an all star cast.<br/><br/>De Niro was the first joining the venture and convinced his friend and acting rival, Al Pacino of the possibilities of the well-written screenplay under the sophisticated direction of Mann and with this two Oscar winners on board, every actor performing in the 90's wanted to be part of ""Heat"", including Val Kilmer, that shot his part on a break of filming ""Batman Forever"" ('95), and another Oscar Winner, Jon Voight, in his comeback role.<br/><br/>The cinematography is top notch, full of aerial shots, showing nice L.A. locations (some of them were the first time ever captured on film, great job of scouting those locations) and during the action sequences make us, the audience, almost being part of it, due to its extreme realism and the way that was shot.
Los Angeles never looked this good since William Friedkin's lost masterpiece of the same genre, ""To Live and Die in L.A."" ('85).<br/><br/>The music by Elliot Goldenthal is phenomenal and perfectly adequate to the Michael Mann's visual style and the events on the screen.<br/><br/>The work in the editing proccess, supervisioned by Mann himself with the help of 4 editors, ties the movie all together giving it a frantic pace, time for the characters to develop and turning an almost 3 hours film in an unique experience in this genre, it keeps the viewers on the edge of their sits and never gets boring.
Eventually, some scenes needed to be left in the editing room floor due to its length, including some more background on Tom Sizemore's Michael Cheritto character and the cocaine addiction of Pacino's Lt. Vincent Hanna that explains his over-enthusiastic behavior through the film.<br/><br/>In terms of the supporting cast, it's one of the best ever assembled, amazing work from such charismatic character actors as Amy Brenneman (a few years before her hit TV Show, ""Judging Amy""); Ted Levine (""The Silence of the Lambs""); Mykelti Williamson (""Forrest Gump""); Kevin Gage (his villanious Waingro entered straight to the pop culture as one of sleaziest ever); Wes Studi (re-teaming with Mann after ""The Last of the Mohicans""); Ashley Judd (in the same year that she starred in ""A Time to Kill"" playing a very similar role); the beautiful and underrated Diane Venora (""Bird"", ""The Jackal""); Dennis Haysbert (""Major League"", ""Navy Seals"", ""Love Field""); Tom Noonan (re-teaming with Mann after ""Manhunter""); William Fichtner (""Black Hawk Down"", ""Albino Alligator"", ""Crash""); punk rock star from ""Black Flag"" & ""Rollins Band"", Henry Rollins (""The Chase"", ""Johnny Mnemonic""); ex-convicted turned actor, Danny Trejo (""Runaway Train"", ""Desperado"", ""Machete""); Hank Azaria (""The Birdcage""); ex-stuntman & martial arts performer, Jerry Trimble, in his first mainstream role and even a young Natalie Portman (in her only second film after the outstanding debut in ""Léon"" one year before). Jeremy Piven (""Entourage"") & Xander Berkeley (which played Waingro in the original ""L.A. Takedown"") appear each one in one scene.<br/><br/>The central characters of Pacino and De Niro have many layers and even if playing opposites as the cop and the robber, they are almost similar in attitude and that passion of ""get the job done"". The two characters (also the two actors) respect each other so much that they even bond on screen.
Pacino owns the show defying even his own Tony Montana's outbursts, with De Niro playing his role more restrained.<br/><br/>Val Kilmer is solid, sporting an acceptable wig; Tom Sizemore is always a joy to watch and Jon Voight is playing the part of another ex-convict turned actor (& writer). Eddie Bunker (Voight's co-star in ""Runaway Train"", ""Reservoir Dogs"") .<br/><br/>In short, ""Heat"" is one of the best films that came out on the 90's Era, a great way to spend an after diner night at the movies. Grab your popcorn and beer and watch or revisit this masterwork of heist films.<br/><br/>I give it a 9 close to 9.5 !!"

","The movie has been on my mind long before I've decided to play GTA V, but then my friends mentioned the connection between these two magnets for humans, so it was time to check the roots of heist for dummies. Imagine my amazement seeing a top bill cast in one mash up: this instantly boosts up the value, but what about the plot and actors' commitment?<br/><br/>The temperature was unstable through the course of the film: started bright and sparkly, then for an hour or so got a chilling breeze of placidity, which could have been simply cut from 2h50 span. Nevertheless, the chemistry of characters was so poignant that I wasted the whole box of napkins wiping my face from all the testosterone splattering from the screen. The drive from a gorgeous shootout scene still pumps the blood on a single jog of memory: the vastness of skirmish blows all existing limits of imagination.<br/><br/>Another great side of this crime drama, as mentioned before, is the cast. Robert De Niro with his goatee melts hearts and presents the ideal of masculinity. Val Kilmer shows off imposing hair and not less cool performance that enchains a viewer to his character. For the desert we have a cat in the bag - Al Pacino. Unpredictable behavior varying from drama-to-the-bone to take-me-to-asylum says for itself; you might like it or not, but this is Al as good as it gets.<br/><br/>Cooling off the product I would say that the picture must be seen at least once in a lifetime but still clinging to the thought that almost 3 hours is too long - a little trim would have been a wise choice."

","4 February 2009. ""Heat"" when it came out in 1995 had it all, the action, the in your face cold bloody killings, the twists, and most important of all the relational character subplots, including husband and wives, father and daughter, and first loves. What this movie had back then, however, has lost some of its elegance, its sharp delivery and insightful directed scenes. Now, ""Heat"" seems to offer some overly dramatized scenes, characters, overly literary dialogue that is more for dramatic impact than reality-based conversation.<br/><br/>Since 1995, we have improvements in a number of genres that may offer tribute to this movie's influence, though, ""Heat"" takes a lot from ""The Godfather"" (1972) in terms of the layered depth of familial and relational elements of crime thrillers. ""Shadowboxer"" (2005) has strong criminal character performances. ""Bourne Identity"" (2002) for sharp and intense action scenes. ""A History of Violence"" (2005) for relational and graphic violence and sex. ""The Aire I Breathe"" (2007) for hard core criminal evil and emotional life and death catharsis and twists. ""Matchstick Men"" (2003) for the ultimate betrayal and haunting loss. ""American Beauty"" (2000) for dysfunctional family relationships. ""Collateral"" (2004) and ""The Matador"" (2005) for a more fascinating badguys. ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007) for a more convoluted crime thriller.<br/><br/>**SPOILER** Today, in hindsight, like a director's cut, what if De Niro actually got into the car? Based on the script, he would have likely gotten away. Why didn't the the airport landing lights blind Al Pacino like they did De Niro when he was shooting at De Niro?<br/><br/>Unfortunately the subplots were underdeveloped. The relationship that De Niro has doesn't offer sufficient relational bonding, connection moments. Al Pacino's daughter isn't given sufficient screen time to develop her behavioral performance that led up to her climatic scene.<br/><br/>Some of the amazing elements to this movie was Jon Voight's performance that was great acting in character. Amy Brenneman goes onto star in the television hit show ""Judging Amy"" and then ""Private Practice."" Ashley Judd continues to perform and recently premiered in ""Helen"" at the Sundance Film Festival (2009). Dennis Haysbert goes onto to become the President of the United States in the hit show ""24"" and then star in ""The Unit"" both on television. Natalie Portman continues on from this her third movie to star in a number of major film features, including ""Star Wars: Episode Two."" Tom Noonan continued as a character actor to too many movies to mention (but my favorite was his performance in ""Manhunter"" (1986). William Fichtner goes onto the television hit show ""Prison Break."" Even Xander Berkeley went onto play in ""24"" and probably one of the most prolific characters actors today. Even Jeremy Piven had a role as Dr. Bob went on to win television Emmys.<br/><br/>""Heat"" may be considered a benchmark crime thriller loaded with a number of memorable actors and actresses."

","Two of the modern era's quintessential actors on display here in a compelling one on one as kindred spirits on opposite sides of the law. Their conversation in the diner was classic, as if they were sizing each other up as consummate professionals, yet jockeying for position as to convince the viewer who was the better performer. For me it's a toss up, and the casting for the picture could have gone either way. DeNiro could have portrayed the character of Vincent Hanna, and Pacino could have been McCauley.<br/><br/>One thing about Pacino though. Whenever he went over the top, like arguing with his wife or in that scene with Ralph (Xander Berkeley) and the TV, he looked like an out of control maniac. In other words, he was acting crazy for the sole purpose of looking like he was crazy, while maintaining an inner composure so he wouldn't do something he'd be sorry for later. It was interesting how he developed the character of Sergeant Hanna.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the principal villain of the piece, McCauley, seemed to have a level head all the time, except when dishing out punishment to henchmen like Waingro (Kevin Gage) when they stepped out of line. Personally though, the disparity in ages between DeNiro and Amy Brenneman as Eady detracted a little from the story for me. I didn't take their sudden relationship to be credible but I know stranger things have happened, so that's easy enough to overlook.<br/><br/>The final confrontation as well bothered me a little bit. For a good part of the time that Vincent was tracking Neil, he was right out there in the open and unprotected while McCauley was hidden behind a barricade. Why McCauley couldn't have picked him off seemed somewhat dubious to me. But over all I thought this was a satisfying gangster flick with the Bogart and Cagney of their generation in top form. Good work by all the supporting players too, especially on the bad guy side. Particularly good was Jon Voight in a limited role."

","Michael Mann made one of the greatest crime movies of the 1990s when he brought us Heat. He was helped in this venture by securing an absolutely stellar cast. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are flawless in this film where they play opponents on the opposite side of the law. It is a complex game of cat and mouse where Pacino plays LA cop, Vince who is investigating the violent gang lead by De Niro's character, Neil. The two share the screen only fleetingly but there's a pivotal role where they meet over a coffee and the atmosphere just crackles with electricity. Being a Michael Mann film, it naturally looks amazing. As slick as a 1980s Athena print. It also has some of Mann's hallmark action sequences which are at times rather violent, but not gratuitously so. There's a scene of a bank heist which, when I first watched this movie back in the 1990s, was I thought the best such scene I'd ever seen. Twenty years on it still looks amazing, if rather OTT. Heat remain a slick, intelligent, stylish movie. It is elevated above merely looking good by a great script, superbly delivered by an ensemble of great Hollywood actors who were directed by a terrific master of his craft at the height of his game."

","Heat is the pressure from the cops and of course of getting caught. If you live a simple honest life, the only heat you will get is from your oven or the sun. If a criminal, it never goes away thus this movie of professional take-down thieves who as Pacino (the cop) puts it will rock and roll on a dime. Most excellent entertainment for those that have to have their get a way heist, crime thriller tense drama flick fix. All the great actors strutting what they do best with a subject no less intriguing i.e. ill gotten gains. Once you start down this path of easy money, a rule of the Universe kicks in. Whatever you get into gets into you! Its like the old lays potato chip commercial where a guy pulls out of the Lays bag a perfect good-sized chip and says ""I bet you can't eat just one"". Same with crime or anything illegal or that we shouldn't do or have. Once you engage it, it engages too. Lots of human nature at work in this movie and it is true to life too. One interesting dynamic is the ""greed"" gene. When is enough well enough? The old we will never get caught or just one more never holds true. The funny thing about lying, cheating and stealing is that it works until you get caught. Getting caught ruins everything! LOL This is the type of movie you want for your DVD collection and it has so many memorable scenes that you don't tire from watching it. Another dynamic that visits with the viewer is the point made via hindsight in this movie. Both the characters and viewers see what could have done and should have been done but wasn't. The question remains as to why people don't listen to hindsight which is a clear convincing message as to how we did not know in the moment what we do. The real question is why don't we? Ponder that! Great movie to eat a meal with a tasty drink and a nice snack. Popcorn or sunflower or pumpkin seeds will do nicely to keep the fingers busy and the adrenaline under control. Now why doesn't Hollywood figure out by now as to what works and what doesn't? Enough talk! Feel the HEAT...now"

","The in-general COP and THIEF movie showcases the one sided affair of the COP nabbing the thief with various skill sets and expertise. Heat in this case has the similar setup, but at heart the movie is at a much deeper level. Heat talks about the relationship the Cop and Thief have and their inter dependency to a good extent.<br/><br/>A gang of four men prepare themselves to rob a vehicle(secured by 3 policemen) of some protected valuable information. They block the vehicle in the middle of the road, break open the back door, and enter into the vehicle. The robbers act fast to finish off and leave the place within 3 minutes(reaction time of Police force). They do everything correct and near perfectly have finished the job right at the time, but with one of the gang man being a freak, the job is yet to be finished perfectly. This freak has the 3 policemen in gunpoint, just having them in their toes, but freaks out and shoots a policemen in the heat of the moment. Consequently now the remaining two policemen are also killed to eliminate any valuable witness. The gang escapes. Heat begins with this robbery.<br/><br/>Very less movies stage a robbery with malfunction at the first scene, most others have a robbery that is nailed, but in Heat the shooting of the police shows the false execution by the robbers, creating interest in a different way at the very beginning.<br/><br/>The main cop-man who is gonna search these criminals is Al Pacino, and the main criminal here is Robert Di Nero, two actors who have given so much to the movie world with their talent. Its a treat to watch them handle their situations and the confrontation scene in the restaurant is of pure class, watch it to feel it.<br/><br/>The main motive here is whether Al Pacino catches the Criminals or do they escape, and how it happens. Please watch it to know it.<br/><br/>The family and lover relationship that the cops and criminals share is portrayed with more emphasize and shows how it affects their public life. Al Pacino's wife does not like his day and night works as a cop-man, and many a times seems to be wishing that he works in some other job rather than being a cop-man. One of the criminals, Val Kilmer is having a troubled wife who wants to separate from him, she in-turn has interest in a different man and seeks a divorce from Val. Robert Di Nero gets attached to a stranger he meets, falls in love with her but hesitates to marry her for life. All these men cannot have the comfortable families as any others could have, they are meant to be alone, meant to be in the streets. Even Di Nero emphasizes this while advising Val Kilmer in a scene:<br/><br/>""You Wanna be making moves on the street, have no attachments, allow nothing to be in your life that you cannot walkout in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner"" Di Nero's relationship with Amy Brenneman shows his fear of getting attached to her and his lack of clarity in choosing either of the ways.<br/><br/>Al Pacino makes you believe that he is a bad-ass cop, with a lot of attitude, but still in few scenes the performance seems to be overdone, especially in the initial scenes, but then he is into his own. Di Nero nails it where ever and what ever he does, so good to see them on screen with not much fuss and still lot of command in every shot they appear.<br/><br/>Heat is more of an experience rather than entertainment, cop and thief character studies that are to be absorbed as an audience. The complex story-line is simple to understand, but still strong in nature. Michael Mann has already been known for his movie ""Thief"", and in Heat he just added the cop factor equally. Mann stretches the climax effectively in such a way that it strengthens the string to the end, giving the audience few surprises. The music score is so apt, especially the robbing sequences and high tension scenes.<br/><br/>Heat is a definite must watch for every movie fan, it brings a different flavor to the storytelling table which a movie watcher will definitely remember for sometime. Note: Please watch-out for the gun fighting sequences."

","Michael Mann has a special way, like no other, to create a special edge in every scene. He creates a presence that you can almost touch. I remember the first time i saw this complete masterpiece of a picture. I was fifteen years old and watched it in the finest cinema available in Stockholm. The movies I usually consumed at the time were significantly simpler and suffered from the lack of a manuscript with substance or lack of acting worthy of the name.<br/><br/>Here I met, in my opinion, movie perfection for the first time. We'll see Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Sizemore and company deliver first- class acting throughout the film. The police, the good, In search of the bank robber, the evil one. A classic layout but with a finesse that was unprecedented in the film world.<br/><br/>You are sitting with a high pulse throughout the entire movie and into the final scene (despite that some consider it to be American style predictable). According to me It's impossible to give this movie anything less than the highest of ratings and I still to this day hold this film as my absolute favorite of all times."

","Michael Mann is a fine filmmaker worth getting excited over when he releases a new film. Granted, he's had a few misfires in his career but he often gets a film so right. Case in point: Heat. I had to recently go out and get the two disc re-release of this film on Bluray because its honestly a classic and something that every cinephile should have. A heist thriller starring two of the greatest actors of all time in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro, what more could you ask for? The film is about a thief Neil McCauley and his various acts of crime involving a team, which involves robbing banks and settling scores violently with enemies. On the other hand, Vincent Hanna is a detective that is endlessly hunting McCauley down. We get a wonderful game of cat and mouse and plenty of action to boot. Both Pacino and DeNiro previously collaborated in The Godfather II, but weren't really on screen together. In this film the two leads are on screen together for a limited amount of time but boy is it fantastic.<br/><br/>I don't have many complaints for the film. The characters are well thought out, the film is inherently simple but the delivery is complex but quite structured. DeNiro/Pacino deliver in their performances. As a matter of fact I'd say this is collectively one of their last great films (as they both have had career downturns shortly afterwards). I'd say the only negative I can draw out is ropy graphics in two scenes that involve a backdrop of the city. Otherwise, its really clutching at straws to find any negatives.<br/><br/>The film has has a few other stars of the time littered throughout the film which is pretty awesome. Its one of the few Val Kilmer films that is genuinely good! Its sad that we couldn't get another DeNiro/Pacino film while they were in their prime (to no ones surprise Righteous Kill was disappointing). This was the best Michael Mann effort and a very fine film that I'm sure was influential for films that came after. You can't really be a movie buff if you haven't seen this one.<br/><br/>8/10"
"xenazues","10","0","2","10 May 2017"," If you are looking for a gangsta movie this ain't it
","I rarely give 10 out of 10's on movies. I'm not even sure if the godfather got a 10 out of 10 on my review and that to me is the greatest movie. But there are a lot of gangsta movies out there and to be honest I love the godfather 1 and 2 but I also love casino and goodfellas (yeah im a mafia fan). <br/><br/>With that said let me explain why I gave this a ten. This plot is so old. It doesn't get older than detective who a little crazy and out spoken going to arrest career criminals. But this added so much to the movie. It almost was like you were rooting for the bad guy and the cop. Which is rare. Usually its one or the other. <br/><br/>Ill explain in more detail what makes this movie great. The characters also seem like real criminals. The actor seem like they had some training. From the way val kilmer reloads his weapon to how all them hold their weapon when shootings. Ashley Judd had a great performance. I mean great.<br/><br/>I guess i could have taken a point off for robert deniro's girlfriend but seriously it didn't matter. Every male in the movie had some kind of relationship and ties to them. Just made you feel like these robbers had families. It made them so much more personal. As well as they playing into the cops life about his step daughter is 3rd marriage. I mean who hasn't got into an argument about ""being your girlfriend/wife after thought"". Or the ""i had dinner ready and was waiting on you but I'm going to bed"" Talk about realistic. Plus they added the daughter cutting herself. Didn't see that coming.<br/><br/>Some people may have a problem with a lot of things in this movie. Cops aren't going to shoot it out while that many civilians are around. I mean the 1997 robbery in cali didn't have that many civilians around. But with that said this movie was great and yes the coffee seen was great as well. 3 hours is a tad bit long. But if you were thinking this is some gangsta movie you are terribly wrong. Its just a movie based on some real life criminals. My favorite part is they actually went to go talk to real criminals to get an idea."

","Whenever the far majority loves/respects/raves about a movie that I cared little for, chances are, I'll give it another shot. I must've missed something, I figure and even after years, or in this case decades almost, I've been yearning to revisit the film. My original thoughts was that it was too slow – which is one dislike I generally have for Michael Mann's films, and that I was thoroughly disappointed in the first ever meeting of two legends, Pacino and De Niro, was a 5 minute scene in a 3- hour film. That's all I could recall of this, except, again, I didn't care for Mann films or Val Kilmer. <br/><br/>2015, almost 2 decades since I've seen this and BOYwas I off. This was a fantastic, interesting and, yes, well paced yarn. Incredibly intriguing, enjoyable action and deep characters. Even Kilmer. While I liked Pacino, I wouldn't count this as his best. In fact, I loved De Niro way better. And his character was one of the best aspects of the film. Incredibly, I wanted him to succeed and get away with it. That, to me, is always a sign of a well-made feature – when we actually root for the bad guy.<br/><br/>Certainly, I won't wait another 20 years to see it and only regret I the last two decades I was stubborn to return to the Heat.

","For such classic scenario, the greatest strength of ""Heat"" is that it takes itself seriously. It never makes the mistake of derailing from its purpose. Too many films at the time depicting similar cop-thief story lines tried flipping the mood at any given chance (humor or comic- relief characters) just so they could separate themselves and often offer surprise (something that happens until today). Micheal Mann is not the best director, but he made sure his movie's standards to be set high and be focused. Focus that's excellent, leading to a movie that is not driven by the plot alone or the strong performances; it is driven by both.<br/><br/>Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Val Kilmer portray three men with very different lives. Vincent Hanna tries to balance between his life as a detective and his time as a decent husband. Neil McCaley is a master-thief who knows nothing but crime as his whole life. And Chris Shiherlis is a younger, confused man as being somewhere in between. Addapting to stealing and lying, he wonders of the tempered impact this way of life will have on his family and has to constantly face dilemmas. Each one of these people appears as troubled and indecisive. Their occupation is their relief and at the same time the reason they suffer. At the bottom line, no matter the effort they all appear stuck and failing on whatever their goal. Even De Niro's character (McCaley), the man dedicated to stealing and killing, now in a weird way, finds a person to connect to and now is offered a chance to make the last business and find a true and clean life. But can he really give up his world and change himself? Can he simply forget and move on? The captivating final scene will give you the answer.<br/><br/>I made the mistake of watching this film too long after its release and I deeply regret it. Al Pacino and De Niro are two of the greatest actors ever and in the one and only scene we see them together, we get why. The accusations to this movie are many, including the ""performances being forced for no reason"" and ""the screenplay being poor"". I disagree. I think no mistakes are accepted in this one and if anything, the performances are unique and the slow pace demanded heavy screenplay with no rush.<br/><br/>I would further my comments on a great degree since the movie reaches 160 minutes screen time but I think the point's been made. ""Heat"" is a must-see movie either if you're just a movie fan or fanatic."
"orionschwert","9","0","3","9 March 2015"," Near to perfect and suspenseful heist action !
","Heat is definitely one of my all time favorite policiers. It is not flawless but the positive sides outweigh easily the negative ones.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie now at least 15 times, but from the 10th time onwards, I'm skipping the last 10 minutes. The ending is not well done. At least not good enough for this fantastic movie. The story is leading us to such kind of an end, but still, for me it's badly made. One other down point is the acting in some scenes of Al Pacino. Nearly funny how he screams and articulate. But I think we know this from other Al Pacino movies as well. He is simply overdoing it. It is his personal style and you may go along with it or not. Still, the acting and interacting of both main characters is very interesting and entertaining. Only real bad acting is coming from Natalie Portman. But hey, she was young.<br/><br/>I like specially the very realistic heist action, the music which makes a big part of the suspense, Spinottis shooting, the sound effects and the under the line in all damn good work of Director & Writer Michael Mann.<br/><br/>It sums up to a one of a kind heist movie, loaded with suspense, action, violence and a story with many interesting plots where you are always willing to follow.<br/><br/>Go, and see this one, If you haven't yet !!"
"GanzEhrlich","10","0","3","17 February 2015"," Favourite Crime Movie Ever
","Heat is practically a masterstroke. It is a timeless crime movie unlike any other. While the plot at first glance feels standard, writer/director Michael Mann, remaking his 1989 TV movie LA Takedown, takes the story of the pursuit between a group of professional thieves and a police unit chasing them around Los Angeles and dissects it in a near unparalleled manner.<br/><br/>He not only gives you a series of great, powerful scenes but these are interspersed with the stories of the personal lives of the two lead characters and just about all of the supporting ones too, bringing yet more life and diversity to the finely written story. For example, we see that Al Pacino's detective Vincent Hanna is suffering through a disintegrating third marriage with a depressed step-daughter. We also see that Robert de Niro's (very) thoughtful and slightly sociopathic crook Neil McCauley has a soft side to him, as he descends into a relationship with the beautiful and lonely Eady (Amy Brenneman).<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic, even if hardly any of the actors actually shed tears to add realism. Most likely the one thing that hyped up everyone up when Heat came out was that for the first time Pacino and de Niro, two all-time greats of American cinema appear in (two) scenes together. Their 5-10 minute discussion in a coffee shop is brilliant and awesome to watch. Both actors add features to their characters that make them even more likable, such that Pacino adds some comedy and de Niro adds a little warmth, so that you want to root for his character as well. Behind the two main men, just about every supporting cast member puts dedication into their character such that it is impossible to decide who did the best job. And the cast includes familiar names and faces such as Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs), Danny Trejo(!), Diane Venora, Hank Azaria, Jon Voight and a young Natalie Portman, who appears in this just a year after her unbelievable film debut in Leon.<br/><br/>The cinematography in Heat is simply astounding. Michael proves to be the king of urban directing and Los Angeles is filmed in a way that it feels like a main character itself. Often the shots used will leave you gasping in amazement. And since Heat is a crime movie, when the action gets going, it is some of the most memorable and dare I say, enjoyable you'll witness in a film.<br/><br/>There are several heist scenes, but nothing tops it like the downtown heist in the middle of the film, followed immediately by the earth- shattering shootout in the streets. It is noted that Michael Mann decided to have no music in this scene, which helps to leave you on the end of your seat unable to comprehend what you are watching. What helps is that Mann also minimised the explicitness of the violence. Although it is still surprising and sometimes momentarily disturbing, it is bloody but usually never graphic or gory. When it is, it is shown from a distance or off-screen, so that the viewer has less chance of their head spinning.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending. Regarding the way the plot unfolds, it is a near-perfect way to finish off the near 3-hour epic, although I found it so heartbreaking, combined with the soundtrack God Moving Over the Face of the Waters by Moby, I almost cried the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>Overall, Heat is a very well written, acted, shot film that makes you wonder how it didn't win a single major award, yet regarding its status today it should have been a contender for Best Film at the Oscars, especially since it came out during the awards season. A multi-layered crime saga with the complexity and genius of a Christopher Nolan film of today (despite not being non-linear in any way). Definitely a movie you must watch before you die.<br/><br/>10/10"

It takes its time to build the atmosphere, lays the ground, the action scenes are calculated and well thought, the soundtrack is brilliant, it features some great psychological moments of suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat, particularly the scene where Vincent and Neil meet face to face and the great ending of course. <br/><br/>While the movie is about crime at its heart, it also has strong characteristics of excellent drama and manages to surprise with it's outstanding dialog, you get to dig a little deeper into the characters and get involved in their personal life in a way that's different than most other movies, it's quite hard to explain and needs to be experienced as you watch. And while it's well known who the criminals are, the script invests so much time into building and developing the characters in such a way that you as the viewer will have a hard time figuring out who's the good guy and who's the bad guy, emotionally speaking of course.<br/><br/>While significantly more modern, Heat sits right up there with great crime titles like The Godfather, The Usual Suspects & Goodfellas and in my opinion may well be the best Crime Thriller movie ever made.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a must watch.<br/><br/>10/10"

"timothy-devereux","9","0","3","15 January 2014"," Masterpiece! Great movie about the human condition
","On the surface, the movie is a crime movie. At it's core, it's a movie about the human condition. I first saw the movie when I was in college. Initially, I was impressed by the action. The shootout in downtown L.A. still ranks as one of the best action sequences in history. As I got older, the relationships and personalities contrasted with the city gave me a whole new appreciation for the movie. <br/><br/>A common character thread with Neal McCauley and Vincent Hanna is obsession. Both are obsessed with their jobs because in a sense, it is a total reflection of who they are. McCauley's life stresses mobility while Hanna's emphasizes isolation. These attitudes, they believe, keep them one step ahead. Of course, these attitudes also leave their respective personal lives a mess, which they both readily admit to. <br/><br/>In spite of this, neither refuse to change because they are so obsessed with their respective jobs that no relationship can get in the way. The chemistry between Hanna and McCauley feels so genuine. After the diner scene, another masterpiece in my opinion, you can see that they both gained an appreciation for one another in spite of their lives being diametrically opposed to one another. <br/><br/>The end scene is so powerful. The diner scene foreshadows an eventual showdown where they both agree that only one will come out alive. When Hanna shoots McCauley, Vincent holds Neal's hand until he dies. For me, this made the movie. The act of Neal and Vincent embracing symbolizes so many things. In a way, Vincent and Neal are showing a sign of mutual respect for one another as competitors often do when they shake hands. It also symbolizes loneliness and isolation. McCauley's lifestyle has bought him to this point and he knows then that he will die alone with no attachments. Hanna in a way sees this and as he looks out at LAX sees a similar fate is in store for him. Hanna, in spite of shooting and fatally wounding McCauley, does not want him to die alone because it is such a cruel fate. So he does the human thing and does not let Neal die alone. I also get the feeling that Vincent shows not a sense of remorse but a sense of loss after Neal passes. This is because they were kindred spirits who understood each other. A tragic but profound ending. <br/><br/>This movie has been in my top 10 for over a decade and will probably remain for a while. Mann is an amazing director and Heat is one of his many crowning achievements."
"Rickting","10","0","3","11 January 2014"," One of the best action films ever made
","I am a huge fan of action movies but they are often unaffecting and emotionally void. With Heat, this definitely isn't the case. I watched this out of interest because it was well regarded, on the IMDb top 250 and it sounded enjoyable but this story of a angst filled cop pursuing a skilled bank robber (Robert De Niro and Al Pacino- together on screen at last!) was thrilling, moving, complex and blew me away. This is one of those rare movies which is virtually flaw free. The length is a bit excessive but not a minute is wasted and the running time is full of blazing action set pieces containing one of the best shootouts of all time but the human drama is jaw dropping. Every single character is developed. The film is incredibly powerful, with the ending being genuinely tear jerking and frequent emotionally intense scenes, but what's the show stopper? 2 men having a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>Pacino and De Niro are both amazing, while Michael Mann's cinematography and suspense scenes are mind blowing. The most confusing thing of all is why the academy didn't give this a single nomination. Even if you're not an action fan, this isn't really an action movie. It's a character study that happens to be about cops and robbers. Heat is a film so powerful yet thrilling the experience of watching it is slightly surreal and despite being almost 3 hours long it felt a lot shorter than that. Some of the characters are slightly cliché (Although developed ones) and the film could have been shorter, but it is the sort of movie which many other action directors (Michael Bay) won't be able to dream of living up to, and even though it's an action movie, it contains some of the best shootouts, character studies, LA visuals- and the best conversation over a cup of coffee- in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>10/10"
"zardoz-13","10","0","3","8 January 2014"," One of the Best Crime Thrillers Ever Made!!!
","""Miami Vice"" creator Michael Mann made one of the best heist thrillers of all time with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. ""Heat"" pits a seasoned LAPD detective against a hardened criminal in an intelligent but exciting cat & mouse crime epic that considers the public and private aspects of the lives of the heroes and the villains. Indeed, we get to see how the cop lives after hours and how the criminal survives when he isn't committing crime. Clocking in at 172 minutes, ""Heat"" blazes up more often than not when it isn't smoldering with suspense. Pacino and De Niro make terrific adversaries, while Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ted Levine, Wes Studi, and Kevin Gage round out a first-class supporting cast. Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, and Ashley Judd play the romantic interests respectively for Pacino, De Niro, and Kilmer. Of course, if Mann had left out the soap operatic elements, ""Heat"" would have been even better. Basically, Pacino and De Niro are at each other's throats for most of the 172 minutes, and they have one scene together in a diner where they read each other the riot act about what they will be compelled to do if they encounter one other in the line of duty. The De Niro character has a great line involving 30 seconds when you know everything will change. A shady entrepreneur William Fichtner takes up about a third of the action in a subplot that grows out of the armored car robbery at the outside. The way that De Niro and company knock over the armored car company is flat out neat. They ram the armored car with a huge tow truck. Everything looks authentic in this urban western. The bank robbery and shoot-out in the streets of L.A. is choreographed beautifully with most of the cops armed with automatic weapons. The big finale at LAX reminded me of the conclusion to ""Bullitt"" when Stever McQueen ventured out onto the airport runaway to catch a killer. Elliot Goldenthal furnishes Mann an orchestral score that underlines the tension, suspense, and heartache in the narrative. Lenser Dante Spinotti makes everything look larger-than-life and gritty."

","Tom Sizemore was amazing as we was in the 'Genius Club', 'Saving Private Ryan, etc' Most of the comments I've read here agree that this is a great movie. I have the same opinion. The coffee shop scene tells everything about this film: 10/10. The human side of the characters is perfectly explored, especially concerning De Niro's character (Neil). His personal conflicts are as strong as his determination and skills as a gangster. This is the magic of this film and only two fantastic actors like Pacino and De Niro could represent it so totally. Congratulations to Val Kilmer that shined and performed exceptionally well under the huge shadow of Pacino and De Niro. A must see !"
"tonycossey","9","0","3","12 November 2013"," Classic Heist Movie
","I saw this Michael Manning directed film on release in 1995, the story, cast and script make this such a classic of the heist genre. DiNiro, as Neil McCauley, just blows everyone away in every scene he appears and dominates the whole film with his performance as the good but bad guy. DiNiro just does 'intimidating' so well, the scene with Annette Benning when he confronts her after discovering she is having an affair behind his best friends back is just a perfect example, he gives Benning an ultimatum in a style that does not even give her a chance to respond in any way but in the affirmativegreat acting by both of them in a short but important scene in the film.<br/><br/>Pacino, as Vincent Hanna, also hits the spot with his portrayal of the over committed cop, the scene in which his wife complains about his lack of communication and his response that ""angst keeps him on edge"" says everything about the character he portrays.<br/><br/>However there are a couple of performances which also demand a mention. Kevin Gage playing the bank robber/serial killer Wainegrow gives a darkly sinister performance that sends a shiver down your spine. However one of the more subtle performances that adds so much to the films feel on authentic crime drama is the role played by John Voight as Nate ""the fixer"", his portrayal of the professional no nonsense crime professional gives the whole crime underworld in this film a realism that gives the rest of the film credibility. Also watch our for a very young Natalie Portman as Hannna's stepdaughter, an accomplished performance at such a young age.<br/><br/>The major scene that everyone recalls from HEAT is the final city bank robbery high powered machine gun shootout with the bank robbers showing obvious military tactics when cornered. However the film is so much more than this one memorable scene, the building of the two main characters Pacino and DeNiro culminates in the meeting of the two in a roadside coffee shop, this scene was based on real life events as The plot is based on Detective Chuck Adamson's pursuit of serial criminal Neil McCauley in the 1960s. The scene in which McCauley abandons a sneak robbery after hearing a noise made by policeman's dropped rifle in a truck, was also based on a real event.<br/><br/>In summary the film is free of crime drama clichés and really builds the characters and makes the viewer engage in various ways with the range of characters the film shows..which is the key to this classic motion picture"

","If I had to choose just one movie to watch again before I die, it would be Heat. There are better and more accomplished movies, many of them to be exact, but Heat just reaches in and touches me on an emotional level, and in a way that no other movie can match. It many ways, large and small it explores what it means to be alive, and to be worthy, as a man. It's very personal. Honour, duty, loyalty, excellence, sacrifice, commitment, integrity and compassion is displayed under extreme and often tragic circumstances. The combination of the cinematography, the music and De Niro and Pacino at the absolute height of their powers is magnificent. I just love it."

","Heat is an excellent,epic,unforgettable and powerful Crime Drama Masterpiece that combines amazing direction,brilliant performances from Al Pacino,Robert De Niro and a great ensemble cast,thrilling Action,a fantastic script and a memorable score make Heat one of my favorite films,Michael Mann,Al Pacino and Robert De Niro at their best and a Masterpiece of cinema.<br/><br/>Set in Los Angeles,California,Heat tells the story of Vincent Hanna(Al Pacino),an L.A.P.D. Homicide detective who's investigating a heist and the homicide a heist that was lead by Neil McCauley(Robert De Niro),an expert thief and robber that's in charge of a crew that helps Neil rob and steal and is really good. When Neil and his crew continue to rob and steal,Vincent is determined to take down Neil and his crew at all costs.<br/><br/>Heat is a brilliant,unforgettable,epic Masterpiece that saw the paring of two amazing actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro going head to head and although the two co-starred in The Godfather Part II(1974),Pacino and De Niro never appeared on screen together. From beginning to end Heat is an unforgettable Masterwork that gives viewers a film of cinematic power a movie that is a mixture of Crime Drama,Action movie and character study giving viewers a film that is unique and fresh making Heat one of the greatest Crime Dramas of all time but also the greatest Cops and Robbers film ever made. Heat is a movie that keeps you glued to the screen and is a film that is intense and thrilling,dark and gritty and at the same time vibrant and powerful with a tight grip that never lets go until the end. Heat is an epic film in the truest sense of the word not only in length(170 minutes)but the way it is shown with lots of characters and great storytelling and while the film is long you are Like most Michael Mann's films Heat is a movie that combines great style and substance the style is in the film looks thanks to Dante Spinotti's visually stunning photography using the colors blue and gray that gives the film a stylish look almost like a stylish but realistic Film Noir where the characters are surrounded by a darkness. The city of Los Angeles also plays a huge part Heat's style and look because the way that L.A. looks in this film because while there is still bright lights and great sunlight in the background it's very atmospheric and gritty not just at night but also in the daytime too. Mann loves filming in Los Angeles and it shows with this movie. The substance in Heat is the way Director Michael Mann approaches the Cops and Robbers movie and the main characters because what makes Heat rise above other Cops and Robbers movies that Mann not only focuses on Vincent and Neil professional lives but also their personal lives and the personal lives of most of the characters around them which makes Heat a unique film in it's own right. Vincent and Neil are two amazing characters and are two of the best characters Michael Mann have ever created because while the two characters are on the opposite sides of the law(cop and thief),Vincent and Neil are mirrors of each other in the way they do their jobs and are obsessive with what they do. Vincent and Neil are also characters with great depth and complexity and when you look into their personal lives you will relate to the two and realize are multi-dimensional characters. Vincent and Neil are two characters you will never forget The screenplay by Michael Mann is brilliant and memorable with dialog that is tough and gritty while at the same time intelligent and powerful with characters that are unforgettable. The prime example of Mann's great writing is the classic,famous and iconic restaurant scene between Vincent and Neil. The Heist and robbery scenes are fantastic and done with great detail and realism that you would probably see in a real life robbery. The Action scenes in Heat are great and thrilling and the most exciting Action scene in Heat is the big shootout that happens which is one of the best Action scenes in movie history because it's so intense and powerful and done with great realism and will just blow your mind. The ending of Heat is one of the greatest endings in film history because while the ending is simple it is just so amazing,effective and done with so much emotion and depth. The ending is amazing and unforgettable and is one of the things that makes Heat a Masterpiece.<br/><br/>The whole cast is terrific. Al Pacino is excellent and at his best as Lt. Vincent Hanna,with Pacino bringing emotion,depth and intensity to role. Robert De Niro is brilliant and at his best as Neil McCauley,with De Niro bringing power,grit and emotion to the role. Val Kilmer is fantastic as Chris,the right hand man on Neil's crew. Jon Voight is wonderful as Nate,a man that gives Neil information. Tom Sizemore is great as Michael,a member of Neil's crew. Diane Venora(Justine Hanna),Amy Brennemann(Eddy)and Ashley Judd(Charlene)do wonderful jobs as the main female characters. Mykelti Williamson(Sgt. Drucker),Wes Studi(Detective Casals),Ted Levine(Bosko),Dennis Haybert(Donald),William Fichtner(Roger Van Zant),Natalie Portman(Lauren),Tom Noonan(Kelso),Kevin Gage(Waingro),Hank Azaria(Alan),Danny Trejo(Trejo),Henry Rollins(Hugh),Jeremy Piven(Dr. Bob),Bud Cort(Cook),Ricky Harris(Albert Torena)and Tone Loc(Richard Torena)give good performances as well. <br/><br/>The direction by Michael Mann is brilliant and stylish,with Mann always moving the camera and giving the film a great visual style while also doing a great job with the Action scenes and Heist/Robbery scenes. Wonderful direction,Mann.<br/><br/>The score by Elliot Goldenthal is fantastic,powerful and intense and fits with film's tone. I also loved Goldenthal's version of Moby's song God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters which is perfect for the final scene. Great score,Goldenthal.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Michael Mann,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro,Crime Dramas,Action films or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Heat,an excellent,unforgettable epic Masterpiece that is Michael Mann,Al Pacino,Robert De Niro at their best."
"gradyharp","10","0","2","28 February 2013"," Another look 17 years later
","HEAT made a big splash in 1995 and there was a lot of controversy about the amount of violence in the film. Now 17 years later the film still remains a strong hallmark of cops and robbers genre films but the violence pales in comparison to what we are exposed to at present. Michael Mann who both wrote and directed this suspenseful thriller went on to direct and produce such films as Public Enemies, Miami Vice, Collateral, Ali, The Insider, Texas Killing Fields, Hancock and The Kingdom and he hasn't lost his touch with action cinema. Another entertaining aspect of looking at these big films of the past is seeing the beginnings of the careers of some young actors and observing the work of the solid character actors at their prime.<br/><br/>One summary of the plot that briefly lays out the story follows: Neil McCauley is a thief... an expert thief... one of the best. His philosophy in life - become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from in 30 seconds if you spot the ""Heat"" around the corner. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of Detective Vincent Hanna. But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime, and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.<br/><br/>The superb cast includes Robert DeNiro as McCauley and Al Pacino as Hanna and the multiple supporting roles are filled by the likes of Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Kevin Gage, Hank Azaria and Jeremy Piven. The cinematography and special effects are ahead of their time and the movie plunges the viewer into the underbelly of Los Angeles like few other films have been able to match. It is still a viable contender for one of the 'famous cops and robbers' films. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"Mr-Fusion","10","0","2","25 January 2013"," One hell of a cop movie
","What makes ""Heat"" one of my all-time favorite movies is that the characters are so well-developed. And not just Pacino and De Niro, but also the supporting players. (Almost) everyone here has a backstory, something to make you really care about them. This works like gangbusters for those that don't make it, but equally so for those that do.<br/><br/>And one of the characters in the movie is the city of Los Angeles. It's such an urban sprawl that it can stand in for pretty much anywhere (and in some ways, it has). But Mann takes us from the upper-crust designer houses to the workaday neighborhoods and really gives this place some personality. Not always a pleasant one, and that's what's great about it.<br/><br/>This is the movie that screams Michael Mann to me: the expert weapons-handling, a spectacular bank shootout, clearly defined characters on opposite sides of the law, an engrossing story. It's a movie that puts every minute of it's almost-3-hour runtime to great use, and one that leaves you (me, at least) floored when the end credits roll.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Not the Director's best film, it is a complex coupling of two mega-stars in an action/character study that ends with mixed results. The stylish shootouts and the sprawling landscape are really the attraction here with the threading of streetwise cops and hoodlums holding it together in a rather long expose of a cat and mouse game of life and death.<br/><br/>The much talked about talk in the diner between the two stars comes off as rather ho-hum and the ending is not fully satisfying and seems elevated to an unnecessary mythical status. <br/><br/>The best parts are better than most films of this type but the inclusion of the home lives never elevates the story, in fact it seems an addition rather than an insightful inclusion. Not a bad try at adding some humanity to the genre but some of it doesn't click and the film is lesser for it.<br/><br/>Overall, forget the hype about the actors and settle in for a long story that may or may not be too much depending on your expectations and anticipations of the expansive underpinnings of humanity that is not usually served with this type of offering."

","Mick Gould is the technical director and consultant on this movie. Michael Mann is a careful student of his, and has let him shine in every action movie he has made since Heat. I greatly look forward to the day that Michael Mann learns the basic principles of objectivism, and makes ""Unintended Consequences"" into a movie, with as much respect for detail as ""Heat"" contained.<br/><br/>Mann's other movies are also excellent, with the possible exception of Miami Vice, since the ""heroes"" in that movie are so evil.

It's an interesting commentary on the current reality of prohibition.<br/><br/>Since ""Heat"" and ""Manhunter"" I've watched every movie made by Mann.

The movie shows both the characters personal lives as they both have struggles and strive to be the best at what they do. This movie does move at a slow pace at times, but a few action sequences make up for it. I also liked the score to this film. I think that plays a huge part too.

","I've often said one of the traits of a great film is that no matter how many times you watch it, you're just as captivated and moved the 10th time as you were the first. There are very few movies that do that and Heat is one of them. Heat is the story of two men who lead very separate, yet strangely similar lives. Both men are driven by what they do best and other aspects of their life suffer as a result. One is a career criminal who's lifestyle forbids personal connections that cannot be easily severed at a moment's notice (for obvious reasons). The other is an obsessive, workaholic cop who is dedicated to getting his man, even at the cost of his family life.<br/><br/>Circumstances reveal they are on an inevitable collision course. Both men know this, but are unwilling to waiver regardless of circumstance, simply because it's just not in their nature to do so. This leads to an amazing dialogue scene that must be seen and eventually a very tense and suspenseful confrontation that only one will survive. The characters are all very strong. Their are no cliché bad guys here, just men who've made tough decisions in life and do what they have to. These characters are created in a way where they are complex shades of of grey, you know what they do is terrible, but you empathize with their plight regardless. Pacino and Deniro are at the height of their powers here and Val Kilmer also puts in a solid performance. <br/><br/>This film has everything. An engaging story, a fantastic cast with excellent acting, the best shootout sequence I've ever seen to this day and great pacing. I've recently seen The Town and while it's very good, I always say it's just a poor man's version of this. One of the best crime dramas ever made and one of my favourite films all time.

","De Niro and Pacino share the screen for, somehow, the first time ever in this mature, complex cops-and-robbers saga. Excluding an explosive, high-powered gunfight and a dramatic, suspenseful standoff of a finale, Heat is almost entirely interested in playing up tension and exploring character motivations. Its powerful cast is astoundingly well-rounded, with a complete lack of black-and-white personalities. Villains show their soft sides, heroes bare their dark underbellies, and in-betweeners continue to straddle the chasm between fates. Devoting the vast majority of its running time to the careful, calculated dance between law-saddled feds and their spooked targets, it applies the same flirty mentality to the inevitable rendezvous between the two big-name stars. It's a film that constantly teases its viewers with promises, only to yank them out of sight at the very last moment and resume playing hide-and-seek. That persistent devotion to delaying the shrapnel in favor of more character-building does result in a tremendous ensemble of players, and ultimately we care about the fate of every one of them. It also causes an already-long three hour duration to feel more like five or six."
"hnt_dnl","5","0","3","21 April 2012"," Decent effort by Mann, but frankly not nearly one of his best!
","HEAT (1995), while an ambitious, competent offering in the Michael Mann collection of films, I frankly feel like it's very overrated. A daring undertaking by Mann, an epic crime drama clocking in at over 2.5 hours, populated by a large and diverse cast, it is a by-the-numbers tale of police procedure and high-level criminals, and starring acting legends Al Pacino (as robbery-homicide Lt Vincent Hanna) and Robert DeNiro (as master thief Neil MacCauley). <br/><br/>Frankly, I kind of think that this is one of Pacino's weaker acting efforts. And around this time (mid 90s) he was nailing every role in sight, just coming off of winning the Best Actor Oscar in 1992 for Scent of a Woman, giving one of his best performances in 1993 for Carlito's Way, for which he SHOULD HAVE been nominated Best Actor, and delivering a magnetic performance in 1994 for The Devil's Advocate. But Pacino seems very bored here, like he can't get a handle on this role of Hanna. Maybe it's because he was drained by this point. Pacino's dialog alternates between choppy monotone sentences and annoying rants that I feel detract from the film. While I don't think that his performance is all that great either, DeNiro really doesn't fare much better in his low-key role of criminal MacCauley, underplaying it to the extreme, perhaps attributable to the fact that his character has to display a lack of emotion because he can't establish connections and his level of maturity in relation to his younger cohorts. So Pacino overacts and DeNiro underacts...2 huge negatives for this film!<br/><br/>Ironically, while Pacino as the lead cop kind of mails it in, I was very impressed with the work of the actors on his team of cops played by Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson, and Ted Levine, who sublimely essayed the roles of dedicated, overworked robbery-homicide detectives. Interestingly, I have the opposite feeling about DeNiro's criminal team. I thought the actors playing his team (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Danny Trejo) were kind of lifeless, actually underplaying their roles even more then DeNiro did. Most of the female characters are a aren't very good either, all pretty indistinguishable, other than the standard Hollywood trick of making each one a little different: Diane Venora (as Pacino's wife) plays the worrisome cop wife, Ashley Judd (as Kilmer's wife) plays the bitchy criminal's wife, and Amy Brenneman (as DeNiro's flame) plays the innocent young oblivious girlfriend. They were all much too mannered in their performances, just surface roles. Interesetingly, the best female performance came from the (then) teen-aged Natalie Portman, who really showed some early acting chops as Pacino's troubled stepdaughter. Portman really outshined many of her adult acting peers in this film.<br/><br/>I thought some of the minor roles were much better written and more notable, namely Kevin Gage (as the psychotic Waingro, who screws up the initial heist and ends up on Neil's hit list), William Fichtner (as a shady high-level businessman who double crosses Neil) and Dennis Haysbert (as a frustrated parolee who joins Neil's gang last minute). I wasn't very enamored of Jon Voight's turn as a disabled retired criminal who was giving Neil the plans for his various jobs either. Again, another rather too-mannered, monotonous performance. Unfortunately, most of the characterizations lacked a certain amount of depth that really could have made this film better. The characters in general leave me cold. The film is so low-key that when the major dramatic moments happen, I don't feel as invested as I should.<br/><br/>A major complaint I have about this movie is that at around the 1- hour point, Hanna's team have the drop on Neil's gang as they are performing surveillance on them about to pull a major job, but Neil can tell he's been made and tells his team that they are walking. Hanna opts to let them go because they'd get only misdemeanor charges, thus the need for the film to go on for another close to 2 hours! The thing is that the film started with the gang pulling a major job where they robbed a federal bank truck and KILLED 3 armed guards! And Hanna knew they were behind it. So why couldn't they nail them on that after they arrested them, for armed robbery and attempted murder! You have to WAIT for them to pull another job and catch them in the act with innocent people involved? Major plothole. <br/><br/>Another is that late in the film, Kilmer's character basically gets away on a rather absurd plot point. The cops had already known what every member of Neil's gang LOOKED LIKE as they had police records on all of them. When the cops stopped Kilmer on the street to verify his identity, why didn't they have an actual PHOTO to see if it was him and not just go by fake IDs and driver's license? Pretty thin.<br/><br/>Of course, being a Mann film, it has a cool look and atmosphere and the robbery scenes are very tense and involving. The big shootout at about the two-thirds into the film is definitely a keeper. Also, I actually think the lack of a true score and music give the film a more realistic edge. Plus, the action scenes generally ring true as realistic as cars don't just explode randomly like they do in most action movies. <br/><br/>But it's really hard to get into any of the army of characterizations that really stretch and thin the movie out to being an overlong, somewhat self-indulgent essay on cops versus criminals. Commendable effort by Mann, just not one of his best!"

","An incredible battle between two obsessed careerists and their neglected loved ones in a world of high-stakes crime.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro plays a brilliant thief and Al Pacino plays an equally clever detective out to track him down. Both men are highly principled and protective of their crew, but each is addicted to their chosen professions to the point that nothing is allowed to get in the way. Michael Mann delineates the alienation felt by the detective's family and the thief's girlfriend in scintillating dialogue and rich performances. The overall effect is haunting and stayed with me many hours after the film was over. Quite separate from the cops and robbers story, it reflects our modern age of success-at-all-costs and tallies the damage left behind in broken lives."

","Heat is simply one great film. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this classic. If you want to see two brilliant actors at the top of their game, then you have to see this movie. It is perfectly written and directed by Michael Mann, one of the best film makers today. Mann picks and chooses his projects wisely (note: he has only directed six or seven Hollywood movies in the last twenty or so years), and they almost always differ in content (ex. this is the same guy who directed one of my personal favorites ""The Last Of The Mohicans""). A great all around film, and certainly a classic in the cops and robbers genre, Heat certainly makes the grade as far as I am concerned."

",", I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry."

","So when did IMDb finally change their mind and re-classify this as Action? Yay! The gun battle in the streets is the stuff Action Movie Freaks live for, and nothing like it had been seen until The Town starring Ben Affleck, or maybe Takers starring Chris Brown. If only the ending wasn't so long, this movie would have been one of the greatest ever. The cast is superb and I think De Niro is better than Pacino. Although it has a lot of drama, it adds to your being invested in the heist. I love the fact that instinct and experience play into the technical aspects of the 'job'. It's a fascinating glimpse into the life and the mindset of characters who live a life of crime."

","Heat is easily without a doubt one of the best crime thrillers ever released. It is also Michael Mann's best films. Director Michael Mann is really at the top of his game. You also got Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, two of the best actors around, in a film together for the first time. What more could you ask for? Especially Al Pacino for his role as the police officer who is having strains in his marriage because of his job. And Robert De Niro as the career criminal who is trying to get out of the life. Every actor in this movie, including the supporting roles, were very well played out Every scene is very well shot and planned out. Heat is a very fun thriller that will keep you absorbed from beginning to end. It is a must see."

","Trying not to be over the top I watched Heat last night for the first time in a while and when it finished with Al Pacino taking De Niro's dying hand and looking out into the shimmering airfield I was filling up.. the touching and euphoric music swells as Pacino's sad expression gazes out into the night...weird eh? A supposed crime tale of a crook and a cop both sublime in their daily jobs at the expense of family life should not make me feel all emotional at its climax. Heat though manages, in its sprawling run time, to bed in the characters and if you have the patience (as it is quite talky and has a lot of characters) you will be rewarded with a monumental shoot out on the streets of LA and a tense finale which like I said left me at least feeling melancholy. <br/><br/>I won't go into details about the story as it has a few plot lines that all come together but I must mention the style and the photography of the film. Some of the scenery and the locations are just stunning and beautiful and really set to mood and the focus on the loneliness of the De Niro and Pacino characters. <br/><br/>How can I do an opinion of this film without mentioning its star names? Al Pacino : Godfathers, Scarface, Serpico, Carlitos Way, Gigli (only kidding) and De Niro : Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas ... the list could be much longer. Putting these two together in a film for the first time could have been a lazy poster line for a lazy film but Michael Mann provides an equally interesting and visually stunning story to equal their talents and the result is a feast for fans of their movies. <br/><br/>Its a really absorbing story with great actors, a great director and big thumbs up to everyone involved. I highly recommend it."

","This film is f*cking amazing. I mean it really is perfect. The acting is top notch. De Niro in particular is spellbinding as Neil McCauley - though that's not to say any of the other characters are less than charismatic themselves, as each cast member portrays their roles brilliantly. The film is an edge of your seat psychological thriller that really gets under the skin of each character and their motivations. It's expertly paced, is by far Michael Manns best film and it currently holds firm to the number 4 position in my all time top 10 movies. And as if that's not enough to wet your appetite, this film also boasts the greatest gun battle between the cops and the (highly sophisticated) robbers ever to be attempted.

"scottshak_111","8","0","1","9 June 2011"," Is Michael Mann amazing or is Michael Mann amazing ?
","I'm a big fan of Michael Mann. Public Enemies, Collateral and The insider are still my favourite flicks. <br/><br/>Man-o-man Too bad I saw this movie too late in the 21st century.. Had I known somehow about it I wouldn't have wasted a single moment to watch this flick.<br/><br/>Boy these are the actors, the real grim Robert De Niro and the coolest Al Pacino. What a combination awesome rivalry, finest actors ever in the same bowl. While Robert De Niro plays a thief who is the boss of a group which had guys like Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Danny Trejo in it, he keeps his head low and has rarely ever caught heat until this time with Al Pacino in the driving seat as a detective handling his team of cops, who is merciless yet cool and has never failed to nail any case. Al Pacino is keen on catching Robert De Niro whilst a robbery is being performed as it would mean a big sentence for De Niro but blunders on his end causes De Niro to flee more than once. A failed attempt to execute a fellow member of his group costs De Niro's group a lot as he leaves one end of the cut thread open which leads Al Pacino's team to slowly crawl over their necks. While the movie went on I developed a soft corner for De Niro albeit he was a robber in the movie he was good at heart. He never gave precedence to love ever but eventually falls in love with a girl played by Amy Brenneman but things get ugly when she comes to know about his real identity. Al Pacino's personal life is a mess too with two divorces and an attempt to rectify the third he keeps on trailing De Niro till the end. If it weren't for his diligence in his work he would have been a good husband as well but not a genius at his job. The screenplay was amazing. De Niro had one maxim that he always followed – 'Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in thirty seconds flat, if you spot the heat coming around the corner' However he disobeys his own adage which costs him in the end. The movie ends with a sad note although it was the most apposite ending to such a movie. Great direction by Michael Mann, great story  Hats off to him Excellent choice (when he chose Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the lead roles). The movie could have gone unnoticed or called as a clichéd one if it weren't for the superb performances by the two veteran actors."

"KnightsofNi11","9","0","2","13 January 2011"," A crime saga of epic proportions
","I don't know that heist films get much better than this. Heat is a three hour long Los Angeles crime saga and there isn't a wasted shot in the entire film. It is pure unadulterated crime film intensity that should serve as the model for any good heist film today. The movie parallels the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law. Al Pacino is Lt. Vincent Hanna who is hunting down a gang of high profile bank robbers lead by Neil McCauley, who is played by the magnificent Robert De Niro. De Niro and his crew are planning one last robbery before retirement and Pacino will stop at nothing to stop them, even if it means shattering his relationship with his wife and daughter. There are a lot of subplots and side characters that all build towards one intensely unforgettable ending.<br/><br/>There is something so enticing about a good crime film, and whatever that is Heat has it. This film clocks in at 2 hours and 50 minutes, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. It doesn't feel drawn out at all. Every moment of the film counts and I was sucked in from the beginning, unable to turn away from the complex intensity of what was happening on screen. The film displays a broad range of tone. It is slowly paced at times, but it picks up at a brisk and exciting pace other times. The film doesn't feel disjointed or misconstrued though. It is consistent in its quality and caliber of acting, direction, and dialouge. It is a movie that keeps you enthralled and sinks you deep into its exciting bowels. There is not a wasted moment in this film and I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>If you take anything from Heat it will most likely be its climactic shootout scene. Heat displays some of the finest and most pure sound editing I've seen. The film is loud and obnoxious, but all for good reasons. It has such an in your face feel to it. The action explodes on screen as loud as possible. The shootout scene doesn't waste time with cheese eaten dialouge or an overbearing score. It is just the crisp, sharp sounds of guns firing and smashing into cars, walls, and of course people. Heat is a technical masterpiece with its robust sets and masterful action cinematography that compliments the acting and action on screen without being overbearing. Technical prowess alone makes Heat a worthwhile watch.<br/><br/>But where would technical skill be without fine actors performing excellent dialouge to back it up? Heat boasts a great cast. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are both perfectly casted and their roles are more incredible. But even the supporting cast does a great job. Jon Voight plays a small and yet very important role. Tom Sizemore does an excellent job as one De Niro's croneys. Kevin Gage has one of the best supporting roles in the film as Waingro, a sociopath exiled from De Niro's gang for incompetence. Even Val Kilmer does a great job in this film as one of the main supporting roles. His character is very enticing and his final scenes of the film are some of the most heartfelt. De Niro and Pacino are undeniably the shining stars of the film though. But when it is two actors of this fine ability, thats not something you complain about.<br/><br/>Simply put, Heat is just awesome. It is a near perfect crime film. I normally prefer smaller scale films that employ more minimalist filmmaking techniques to epic productions like, but in this case I'll take the epic three hour long Heat to any knock-off cheesy crime film. Heat is an incredible movie that will undoubtedly be remembered for years and should hopefully serve as a model for all future crime films."

","A lot of was expected. You don't get De Niro and Pacino in the same movie every year. They delivered too. Both played their characters extremely well. Especially Pacino (Vincent Hanna) who shines throughout the movie. Val Kilmer was a big surprise. Very composed yet creepy performance.<br/><br/>It was the actors who drew my attention most. The other was the beautiful Los Angeles. The crime saga itself was left more background. Maybe because it was quite slow-paced. Or maybe I was just a bit impatient. Anyway, I wasn't happy with the ending which was left unfinished with me. A slight disappointment.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you fancy a crime saga with minor errors but with quality actors, this is your man. A good 90's movie."

From Hannas troubled busy life to Macauleys troubled lonely life, we are not spared a moment to catch our breath as the film is filed with so much.<br/><br/>The much talked about scene involving the two is good, but there are so many better scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The night vision scene, probably the most intense thing i have seen in the whole film, but thats the standard of the acting and the editing.<br/><br/>Pacino does shout a lot, and becomes a bit annoying at times, and De Niro does that thing where he repeats a certain line a few times for dramatic effect, but apart from those two minor gripes, the film is flawless."

"ivony","10","0","1","11 October 2010"," A Must See
","In the saturated genre of Action/Thrillers, Heat finds a way to stand tall above the masses, maintaining originality and an overwhelming sense of tension even despite moments of predictability. Michael Mann brilliantly utilizes both veteran actors (Pacino as Vincent Hanna, DeNiro as Neil McCauley), playing them with and against each other to the ultimate confrontation neither can avoid. There is an underlying depth to the film as the actions are incidental, its the characters that matter. While the defining line between good guy/bad guy is drawn it is equally blurred as your empathy lies with both men, understanding they're one and the same, each capable of being on the other side. Black and white hardly exists here, but rather those murky shades of gray that calls to question what matters most, what truly defines us: the motivation or the actions, the man himself or his job? Truly a magnificent cinematic feast."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>What can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before. <br/><br/>I saw this film for about 7 times, i think. I love this film for a many reasons. Because it's so wonderfully acted and directed (the script is wonderful too). Because it's so epic. Because it's so beautifully sad. <br/><br/>This isn't just a ""cops and robbers"" movie - NO. I don't know, maybe it's just my imagination, but in this movie i saw a fight not just between cops and robbers but a battle between good and evil. And it's a breathtaking experience, when in one, just one scene, two characters, who are representing good and evil (and two different worlds), just sit dawn and talk. And they are talking not about film's plot, but about they lives. You can feel how similar they really are. If one of them wouldn't be a cop, and the other a criminal, they would be the best friends (i heard and loved the ""theory"" that Vincent and Neil are brothers, when Neil says to Eady that ""i have a brother somewhere...""). But enough about ""good and evil"". <br/><br/>This is a breathtaking action ""heist"" thriller. Yes, i think that scene that goes after bank robbery is the most realistic ""shoot-out"" in a movie history (there are other wonderfully filmed ""shoot-outs"", but this one i will remember for a lifetime). How this film wasn't nominated for a best cinematography, editing and sound effects is beyond my.<br/><br/>For this films line A.Pacino will be remembered forever: ""because she had a great xxx !!!"" :). What a great performances, from everyone. <br/><br/>By the way, (for a movie buffs), last time i watched ""Heat"", i noticed how big influence this film made for ""The Dark Knight"". The ""interogation"" scene in ""The Dark Knight"" is so similar to a ""conversation"" scene (not just a cinematography). Two main characters talks not about films plot but about them self's, what they do, and how they are fitting in this world. Bank robbery scene i a very familiar to ""The Dark Knight"". And this goes for a real fans: don't know how much of You noticed, but at movies (""Heat"") time 1:06:00 there is a shoot that goes for 6-8 seconds. This shot shows a car, with all the ""bad guys"" when they are going through the city. This is 99% identical shot that was used in ""The Dark Knight"", when Harvey Dent is being transported in a cop car through the city - view goes ""from the sky"", there is no music, no city sounds, just a night and this excellent tune.<br/><br/>Watch this ""Los Angeles crime saga"" - this is a timeless art."

He is calculated, precise, and above all, he makes little mistakes.<br/><br/>In between the two lead characters is an all star cast, all at the top of their game, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Wes Studi, 24's Dennis Heybert, Prison Break's William Fincter, and Natalie Portman all give their best to Michael Mann's unforgettable screenplay.<br/><br/>The entire film is about the relationship between Hanna and McCaley, one takes down scores, and the other is determined to use whatever means to take him out.<br/><br/>The action, fantastic, and the bank heist, near the end has to go down as easily the best action sequences ever filmed in the 1990s.<br/><br/>The directing, Michael Mann proves he can direct with the best of them with this fantastic film.<br/><br/>Heat, unfortunately was not nominated for any Oscars, but, in recent years, has gained a huge and appreciative following from those who enjoy their crime films, without the presence of annoying actors (Leonardo DiCaprio) or over directing from Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>1995's Heat remains an underrated classic of unprecedented proportions and that's saying a lot!"
"khanbaliq2","8","0","2","1 July 2010"," De Niro's and Pacino's combined star power was one of Heat's major selling points.
","The film is a stunning crime drama that shares its protagonists' rabid attention to detail - and love of adrenalin. A Los Angeles police lieutenant (Al Pacino) pursues the mastermind (Robert De Niro) of a highly organized robbery outfit, and likes his style.<br/><br/>Heat is virtuosically crafted but overstretched modern noir, in which director Michael Mann's idea that the cop and criminal are similar souls arbitrarily divided by law comes to seem facile, and the much-hyped face-off between De Niro and Pacino strikes disappointingly few sparks. Still, as an epic panorama of urban existence it is often breathtaking."
"ShawnCrawford","8","0","1","21 June 2010"," Intense action with underlying commitment theme.
","Heat is about a crew of professional criminals who target big money items like bank vaults and armored cars. The crew is run by Neil, played by Robert Deniro, and his character is the planning, disciplined sophisticated type. His main crew members are Chris (Val Kilmer), Michael (Tom Sizemore), and later added Donald (Dennis Haysbert). Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) plays opposite of the character Neil and with the help of his crew are out to capture Neil and his crew. The movie is mainly focused on these high dollar robberies but also centers around the personal lives of Neil and Vincent and how much alike they are. The main theme of Heat is the underlying fear of commitment which is evident in many of the characters. This give the movie moments of drama and time to build story between the high impact action scenes. This relevance can be seen in the movie Hancock (produced by Mann), in which the character Hancock cannot commit to Mary. There are several examples of this throughout the movie with the most notable being Neil's rule, ""Never have anything in your life that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you spot the heat around the corner."" Even though in the end he violates his own policy by falling in love with Eady, and this ends with his demise. Another example is the constant fighting between Chris and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd). They both have problems fully committing to each other but their love for each other keeps them coming back to each other. A third example is the relationship between Vincent and Justine (Diane Venora). This relationship is riddled with Vincent's commitment to his work being first in his life before anything else. Interesting techniques used in the film include the lighting and colors. Heat takes advantage of a lot of scenes using grays and blues. This enhances the mood in the romantic scenes, including times when Neil is with Eady. A technique used with the lighting is during the climatic ending scenes with the use of the high beams from the airplanes to illuminate Neil and Vincent in the darkness. This low-key lighting builds suspense in the final scenes. Overall this movie has what it takes to make a film. The intense action scenes are great and provide distraction from the overall theme of the movie, commitment."

","Heat is an incredibly movie. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro both deliver incredible performances. This is among the best crime movies of all time, up there with the likes of The Godfather, Goddfellas, and Pulp Fiction. The first half of the movie beautifully introduces to all the characters, their strengths and weaknesses, to prepare us for the exhilarating second half. This movie has some of the best characters seen in a recent movie. Each charter evolves from the beginning to the end. Now, while it is very long, almost 3 hours, its length ends up as a strength because it gives the characters time to change, and for the explosive shootouts to truly be emotional. It also includes arguably one of the greatest action sequences ever, as intense as the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan. The writing also really stands, this is Michael Mann at his best. Who can forget the scene when Pacino and De Niro have their conversation in the cafe? I don't give out ten star easily. That is a testament how to how incredible this movie is. This is nothing less that cinematic perfection."

","Two men in control with a desire to be perfect at their craft, but on the opposite end of a much familiar line. Despite their intentions, they are not distinct from each other. They do what they are best at, and factors such as pride, ego, and passion for their work bind them. There is this tension in the air all through the movie. It's the heat that you feel gradually smoldering; both the characters have much on the line to lose.<br/><br/>The hallmark of a great director is to use music as a tool for their suited method of story-telling. Michael Mann always does that beautifully, just like Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg. 'God moving over the face of the waters' by Moby just simply and silently crawls under your skin at the end sequence.<br/><br/>Two great actors never share the screen together too often to spoil the anticipation. In the only scene (shot masterfully) when they truly interact, they acknowledge each others' stand and strength. But things always are, just the way they are.<br/><br/>Neil McCauley walks away from the life that he desired for, after a long tenure of restless and lonesome squandering, but never too far. Vincent Hanna manages to get a better deal.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro and Al Pacino don't need to rehearse or prepare much for a role at this stage; they could just read the script and be ready to deliver the best. Both are riveting as always.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Jon Voight, Hank Azaria, Ted Levine, Diane Venora and Amy Brenneman, you can't get any better than this. Michael Mann comfortably manages to provide each of them a shine, even under the deep perpetuating shadows of such legends.<br/><br/>Great cinema, fast paced, grows on you all the way."

","De Niro and Pacino together is enough to make your mouth water isn't it? Well it is mine. Michael Mann has done an excellent job with this stellar cast, bringing what is essentially a thinking man's action film to the screen.<br/><br/>De Niro and Pacino are awesome, one as the pro-thief who coldly moves within his world of organised hits and planned jobs, and the other as the world weary cop who is on the edge yet cannot give up doing the only thing he knows. For these two alone the film is worth it. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore also put in strongly as De Niro's associates, as does Jon Voight. The girls, sadly second to the boys in a film such as this, do well too. Diane Venora, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman and Natalie Portman lead the way.<br/><br/>The only thing that knocks this flick down a peg or two is its over-length; and that by only fifteen to twenty minutes. Michael Mann (director) dwells a little too long on a couple of scenes toward the end when his audience is itching for the climax. Our writer-director really built the tension too well.

This is his best work. Cinematography by Dante Spinotti is outstanding. Editing by Pasquale Buba, William Goldenberg, Dov Hoenig & Tom Rolf is crisp. The action is spell-binding; especially the sequence post the robbery. In the acting department, Each & Every Actor excels. But the ones who clearly stand out are; Pacino, an astounding performance.

"foxx_1","7","0","7","5 November 2009"," Basically well crafted but with some flaws
","Solid performance by Pacino and De Niro, although Pacino was overacting at times - all that yelling and sarcastic talk was a bit over the top... I think the director should have jumped in but he probably figured it's better to let him act the way he wanted. Same applies to Natalie Portman who was quite young at the time and needed some guidance e.g. the scene at the beginning where she is arguing with her mother ('Nooo, I will be late...') needed the director's intervention which simply was not there...<br/><br/>This is not the major problem though - it is the script that was rather contrived and implausible quite a few times. I don't know why Michael Mann was chosen to be both scriptwriter AND director given the fact that he had rather modest CV in scriptwriting...<br/><br/>Anyway, the first major plot hole IMHO is the appearance of Waingro: a team that has been ""working"" together for a while and seems to be like a big family, just gets a perfect stranger (it remains unclear who and why recommends Waingro to Ceritto!!) as an extra hand to do - guess what? Well, nothing more than hold a gun pointed at stunned and deaf guards... How about just disarming them and tying their hands as they did later in the bank? We are talking about experienced criminals here, not some kind of rookies! The next script problem is van Zant's intelligence: he is smart enough to run a drug money laundering bank but also stupid enough to try to eliminate the gang in the most amateur way - namely, by sending two goofs to an open area without even thinking that there might be someone covering it?!? And then all of a sudden he is scared sh1tless and not leaving his office for days - just because he got a threatening call...<br/><br/>Another problem is the very odd romance between McAuley and Eady. At first I thought that she might be some secret police agent, trying to get to him i.e. a cliché we are used to but still plausible... alas, it turns out it's real love and attraction!! So let me get this straight: there is this young and attractive woman who is ""very, very lonely"" (?!?) and starts hitting on a guy who is 20+ years older! Every time I see that scene I feel like sinking in my chair - it is so hard to swallow. Same applies to all the interaction between those two for the rest of the film - even after she learns that he is a bank robber, she still agrees to flee the country... my guts were already twisting at that point! Unfortunately, the odd parts don't stop here - although there were some technical advisers to assist the director with the shootout scene in front of the bank, it looked like McAuley and his gang were not surrounded by dozens of armed officers but shooting at rabbits - standing upright and not getting hit as if the police were using blanks:)) Well in reality, they were but hey, we are supposed to believe this is serious:)) Of course, the only one who gets to kill one of the big baddies (Ceritto) is Lt. Hanna: the other cops are just good enough to get killed or wounded.<br/><br/>The final blunder was the corny scene with Hanna and McAuley holding hands... how about a hug? What were we supposed to believe here - that this was just a duel between two gentlemen and one of them was less fortunate? It seemed to me that the film tried way too hard to take side with the ex-cons in general: the scenes with Breedan, the one who was just released from prison and gets treated like piece of junk were there to convince us that it is not their fault if they turn back to crime, it's our hostile society who is to blame... so we are supposed to sympathize with those guys? Yep, this is what they do for living, they can't do anything else as McAuley pointed out... I could have bought that too if they were stealing without killing - which was obviously not the case here.<br/><br/>To sum it up - decent action movie but not at par with the big gangster dramas Pacino and De Niro played in before."

","A film with Academy Award Winners Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Jon Voight and directed by the great Michael Mann it would sound like the ideal movie. However, with ""Heat"" this is not the case.<br/><br/>""Heat"" follows the story of a police officer who is hot on the trail of a bank robber. Al Pacino does a fair job as the police officer and Robert De Niro is OK as the bank robber.<br/><br/>You almost have to wonder where this film went wrong. The answers are obvious. The film is way too long and the story isn't that great. The film dawdles when it spends time on Val Kilmer's character and Robert De Niro's relationship with his girlfriend . Also Al Pacino does his normal shtick, where he delivers all his lines to the far right side of the screen while intensely chewing a piece of gum.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws ""Heat"" does have some pretty bad-ass moments. Such as the perfectly executed scene with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino talking in a roadside diner (one of the very few times they are on screen together). <br/><br/>All-in-all ""Heat"" is a movie that has its flaws. But it is a great way to kill off a lazy Sunday afternoon. ""Heat"" gets a C."
"cheddarchexmix","9","0","2","3 August 2009"," Just something about it
","This is one of the few, if not the only, movies of its genre that I can (and do) watch again and again. Other reviewers are more adept than I at putting their finger on precisely what makes the difference (Pacino and De Niro side by side, the added emotional ambiguity of the various characters) - it's not as if a person watching Heat for the first time would find it excessively cerebral or removed from the action-movie mold. Nor is it lacking in the sort of seedy LA-centric flash for which Michael Mann is, for better or worse, so well known (see, for example, Collateral). But whatever it is, it's extremely compelling and one that has earned it a place in my DVD collection."
"mrspasm","8","0","1","26 July 2009"," Heat Is Cool But Left Me Cold
","Mr Man is known for his flashy 80s era MTV style films, and Heat is no different, even if it's not the same as anything he's done before. This film is known throughout the universe for having the largest cast of stars in history- you could play 6 degrees of Kevin Beacon with this alone! Yes, if you have a favourite actor or female actor you can be sure they pop up here somewhere. Let's have a closer look: We have Alfred Pachinko starring as a disgruntled cop on the hunt for disgruntled bank robber Robin DeNiro. DeNero has a gang of criminals under his claw; Valerie Kilmar with her lovely donkey tail, Tim Sizeless as a disgruntled fat man, Charlston Heston as a mob warlord, Ralph Lungren as a bodyguard, John Fought as a grizzly old something, Will Smith as the wise cracking kid from the hood, Dani Trey-Ho-Tep as a Mexican smuggler, Steve Busheemee as The Man With No Plan, the list goes on. DePesci wants out of the gangster life so he divorces his current femme foetal Charlotte Theron and chases weather girl Amy Bremmennemaneman. She is his one chance at freedom, but will the love of a gangster's life prove to much for him? Val Killman is married to Ashleigh Dudd and has a skinny daughter called Natalie Porter. He is always cheating on his wife though with a list of women and strippers played by the lies of Angelina Jolly, Nichole Kilmer, Hank Wazarea, Grace Jones, Mad Una, and in a shocking camero Kirsten Dunce. Al Pacman lives with his 'slow' brother Jimmy Depp and is getting divorced from his wife Diane Keaton. They have a suicidal daughter played by Amidala Portman. His police force consists of Paul Weller, Art Metro, Donald Sutherfield, Harrison Sierra, and Harvey Kitten. There are a few shoot outs and some excitement moments but mostly it's just talking and crying. I like films with lots of actions, and this is a film about cops and robbers so there should really be more shootings, cars flying over jumps, snakes in suitcases, poison darts, and pens that shoot fire etc. Plus it's at least 4 hours long, and as there are so many characters and actors double crossing each other I just got confused. This must be based on a Shakespeare novel or something. I am very upset at this.<br/><br/>Best Scene: Supposedly when Al and Rob meet in the movie it was the first time they met in real life. I though they had been in several other films with each other but I must have been wrong. There's a first time for everything!"

","Heat was a long movie. Its not the most fast paced movie either. It does star two of the greats of our generation in DeNiro and Pacino.

The characters are very believable, and you do get a sense of there background even though they don't say much about it. The action sequences are excellent.

The best thing about this movie was the city gunfight after the robbers exit the bank. The gun sounds almost make you think it is real. Most Hollywood gunfights are completely unrealistic and sound corny. The people actually reloaded, they weren't all pinpoint accurate, and it sounded real. Very A++++ gunfight.

"ackstasis","8","0","1","25 December 2008"," ""I do what I do best, I take scores. You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me""
","Like him or not, director Michael Mann has his own distinctive style, but what matters is how well he is able to use it to tell a story. 'Manhunter (1986),' a solid and well-acted thriller, was tarnished by Mann's excessively ""trendy"" style, and a musical soundtrack that has kept the film perpetually trapped in the 1980s. More recently, 'Collateral (2004)' demonstrated a precise and balanced combination of style and substance, making excellent use of the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, perfect for capturing the low-key lighting of Mann's favoured night-time urban landscape. His follow-up, 'Miami Vice (2006),' was almost entirely devoid of substance, a meandering crime story redeemed only by a thrilling shoot-out in the final act. 'Heat (1995)' is among Mann's most lauded achievements, and I'm happy to say that it's probably the finest of the director's films I've seen so far. Most noted for being the first film in which Al Pacino and Robert De Niro shared the same screen (they were separated by decades in Coppola's 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'), 'Heat' is sizzling, action-packed drama.<br/><br/>Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is something of a cliché, the hard-working homicide detective who is distant from his family. However, Pacino gives the character depth, a hard-edged, street-wise cop who is basically good at heart. When writing dialogue for Al Pacino, the temptation is always there to make him shout a lot, and there are several scenes when Mann does exactly that, but the character is strongest when he's not talking at all, lost in silent contemplation or embracing the hysterical mother of a murder victim. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) sits on the opposite side of the law, a principled professional thief who has dedicated his entire life to crime. McCauley has a motto: ""don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" His failure to adhere to this advice is ultimately what gets him killed, for, though he is prepared to discard his relationship with a sincere art designer (Amy Brenneman), McCauley unable to walk away from his own principles.<br/><br/>'Heat' boasts an impressive supporting cast  including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert and Jon Voight  but it's no surprise that Pacino and De Niro dominate the film. Their single face-to-face encounter is a corker, as they sit opposite each other sipping coffee (the table between them representing not only the border between police and criminal, but also a mirror of sorts). Hanna and McCauley exchange terse pleasantries like old friends, despite having never met before, and the two master actors coolly and effortlessly exude charisma with every word. The film's promotional tagline boasts ""a Los Angeles crime saga,"" suggesting that Mann was attempting something akin to his own 'The Godfather (1972),' though he doesn't quite pull it off as readily as Coppola. His film could have done with a few trimmings, excising a few largely superfluous personal subplots, including an impromptu suicide attempt that came right out of left-field. Nevertheless, 'Heat' is a gripping crime story, with great performances, and one of the best shootouts that you'll see anywhere."
"Fred_Maxwell","8","0","1","1 October 2008"," Not one wasted scene in it
","It's a long film but there is not one wasted scene in it. Even the incidental story lines - for example the recently paroled ex-cell mate of Deniro whose first job is in a ""grill"" working for a nasty exploitative boss and then ends-up as a stand-in getaway driver for Deniros crew. It just adds weight to the whole film. All the domestic dramas of the good-guys and the bad-guys that you wouldn't get in the typical cops and robbers film are shown in loving detail and nothing is rushed. Just makes it a more satisfying and involving film. What do you want to hear about 'Heat'. Is it DeNiro's best performance? No. Is it Pacino's best performance? I'd be lying if I said it was. Do the performances improve the story? Absolutely. Mann has written (he wrote it as well) a complex and exciting two-sided story that develops the hunter Vincent Hanna (Pacino) and the hunted Neil McCauley (De Niro) separately throughout much of the film. Underneath a hail of bullets Mann is able to paint both lead characters with the same brush by delving into the similarly tragic and chaotic personal lives of Hanna and McCauley, allowing for the final epic scene, which would have been too pretentious if it were not for the excellent performances of Pacino and De Niro."
"Ellen_Addie","9","0","1","28 September 2008"," great movie in depth
","What really floored me about this film are all the subplots. Usually, with this many subplots things get missed and there's always that tendency for casting of less-than-convincing characters. Not so here. The young black lady who played the prostitute killed by Waingro (the first one whom he told that he could always spot a liar). When she tries to lie, she does so convincingly (to the film watcher) that you think she's telling the truth. And her face changes as she realizes she's in grave danger. It is an awesome thing when a movie is planned, a great cast assembled, using a great storyline for a backdrop, and in the end, everything comes off as it should. It is not an infrequent occurrence in Hollywood that all of these components are in place, yet disaster strikes, and the movie is a dud. With a pairing of Pacino and DeNiro, and it coming off as well as it does, that would probably be enough for moviegoers. But add Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Dennis Haysbert, and the always interesting Tom Sizemore, and you have a cast without weakness. I am hoping that sometime soon, there will be a sequel using Pacino's character. It would be more than worth the wait."

","Heat is a kind of film with multi star cast including AL pacino, Robert DE Niro, Val kilmer , Jon voight and many others. The movie shows a game of deception and competition between LAPD officers and group of crooks. The lead officer in pursuit is Al pacino and the gang is led by Robert DE Nero. Both the cop and criminal had quite a few things in common , they both have courage to fight not to give up till the end , they had perhaps unhappy childhood and some family problems. It was great combination of these 2 heavy weights of Hollywood , They had developed some respect and regard of each other. I liked one scene of pacino very much when he confronts the boy friend of his wife in home. That was ,,"" u can come to my home, u can eat my food, stay around here for some while, u can even f*** my wife(f*** my wife , its free of cost ,dont miss the golden opportunity, u re welcome) but u can never watch my t.v"". The most special , when the fire fight is started outside a bank which was being robbed by the bandits , the first shot is fired by val kilmer and then a very much realistic street gun battle , i never in any drama except war movies they are however are different story. This fire fight looked very much real like in front of ur own eyes. As a matter of fact national geographic presented a documentary about north Hollywood shootout in situation critical series. They show Larry Phillips and Emil mataserreanu rampage the streets with gun power towards L.A police and civilians. When the bandits are dead after a so much long gruesome battle, they searched the apartment of Larry Phillips , where they also found a copy of heat from his VCR. It was speculated that perhaps this fantasy took over the mind of both robbers coz there was incredible similarity between the movie and shootout. It had shown in the film as mentioned before and in the end that bandits even fought till the end , even they were ready to die and not to turn their back regardless whatever the odds are. Anyway i enjoyed it and liked it. 7*1/2 out of 10 i ll give it"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","12 September 2008"," Mann turns the thriller genre into something more
","What makes ""Heat"" a good film is what separates it from other thrillers. While divorcing the surprise endings, plot twists, and master thievery planning and execution and deciding to make a three hour ""cat and mouse"" crime drama may be a choice that turns away fans of the genre, writer/director Michael Mann deserves applause for the bold step because it really pays off in the end.<br/><br/>""Heat"" stars two of the greatest actors ever in Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro. Pacino is the LAPD major crimes detective and DeNiro the master thief. As the movie goes on, not only do you learn about how their professions and how their utter dedication to them affects their personal lives, but you watch as they slowly come closer to one another in what is a great payoff for all the minutes of anticipation.<br/><br/>What's great about Mann's film, and most of his films for that matter, is that the criminals are more than just criminals and the cops more than just cops: they get extensive backgrounds painted for them and so the action ends up being about more than just who is capable of being the coolest and kicking the most ass, but about understanding the actions that both take and what's at stake.<br/><br/>Pacino and DeNiro give great performances as always. The movies they've been in since the 90s began are a little more on the suspect side, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that they truly are still talented. Nobody else in the film, actor-wise, really stole any attention. Maybe Diane Venora as Pacino's wife comes closest.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is a very drawn out, character driven cop-chasing-criminal thriller and that's really the best way to describe it. It definitely drags at points, but if you can focus on the details Mann has put into his characters and the use of lights and color in terms of aesthetic and symbolic value in the film, ""Heat"" instantly becomes one of the most respectable thrillers ever made even if it falls short of the most entertaining."

","I watched this film a while ago, when i was a bit younger. After watching it again recently, i realise i appreciate this film a LOT more. Main reason i watched this again is mainly in preparation for 'Righteous Kill' as I'm still not sure what to make of it after watching the trailer.<br/><br/>Like most people, Pacino and De Niro are among my favourite of actors. So this film really gets points for just having them in anyway. Although the other cast still put on a great performance (VAL KILMER, TOM SIZEMORE, young NATALIE PORTMAN etc). The film also has some of the best quotes EVER, mainly from Pacino's side '...you get killed walking your DOGGIE!' Classic.<br/><br/>De Niro, Pacino and Michael Mann are both on top form here. I still feel that the scene in the café is one of the most intense i have ever seen. Without these two, i think the film would have been forgotten in a month.<br/><br/>Some people complained that the film dragged on. I think it was paced quite well. The last scene was good in building suspense to the finale. Also thought the ending was one of the best I've seen, with both characters showing each other mutual respect.<br/><br/>Awesome film and cant wait to see 'Righteous Kill' now. Highly Recommended."

","DeNiro's Neil McCaulley is so cool and crisp. Tom Noonan is great. The movie has tons of style and the best shoot out scene of all time. Sizemore and Kilmer are excellent as always. As are Diane Verona and Ashley Judd. Watching McCaulley's crew work was one of the great cinematic pleasures of the 90's. As Lt. Hanna says, ""Their M.O. is that they're good.""(in Pacino's sole bright moment) The only rough spot is Pacino, who hasn't been able to act his way out of a wet paper bag is almost twenty years. The sad thing is that all the lamest dialogue got handed to him as well. The music reminds you of Mann's days with Miami Vice; ultra-modern yet understated and elegant. The sound editing is appropriate; when you have a dozen different types of weapons all being fired simultaneously, you appreciate not having to listen yet again to a foleyed-in Hollywood ""pow!"" A full metric tonne of supporting actors all lend their little bits (Watch Hank Azaria as the mouthy Vegas paramour-Pacino has fun slapping him down to size). The ending does seem to a drag a little in my opinion-reminding us a little of the Mexican standoff in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". After a while you're ready to scream ""Shoot already!"" Heat is hands-down the best LA crime drama to come out in a long, long while and along with LA Confidential, stands to be one of the best of all time."

","Heat is a rare masterpiece. Mann tells his stories in such a unique and captivating manner. Heat is a movie with a somewhat implausible storyline, that is told with incredible realism. Every event in this movie is shown with such detail and with such a realistic, ""in your face"" feel, that every one of it's 3 hrs is intriguing. Maybe this is just one of those movies that only select few are going to enjoy, but I think it's incredible, with excellent performances by Pacino, de Niro, and a young Portman. (alright, her performance isn't anything special, but she is.) Each actor shows us a unique and believable individual, which is what should happen. At the very least, the shootout in L.A. is one of the best of it's kind in any movie, at least that I've seen. These are my thoughts on one of the best movies ever made."

","Heat isn't a romance, but in another time and place, it could have been. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) never meet during the film's opening acts, although each is aware of the other. When they do finally meet, Hanna asks McCauley out for coffee. They sit in a café and discuss their jobs, their personal lives, and their relationship. The film then speeds toward its inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>But Heat isn't a romance. It's a crime drama. And Hanna and McCauley are not lovers. Vincent is a police lieutenant, while Neil is a professional thief. The two's cat and mouse relationship forms the core of Michael Mann's masterful crime saga, one of the best in recent years.<br/><br/>Cop and robber first become aware of one another after a botched job, during which, after a new member's mistake, McCauley and his crew are forced to execute the guards of an armoured car. McCauley is now the proud owner of $1.6 million in anonymous bonds, which he plans to sell back to their original owner (William Fichtner).<br/><br/>As they begin to set this up, and plan one last ""retirement"" bank heist, McCauley and his crew come under surveillance by Hanna and his Robbery-Homicide squad. But it is not long before McCauley becomes wise, and Hanna ends up watching McCauley watching him.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about Heat is the way it represents Hanna and McCauley as two sides of the same coin. Obviously there is the idea that they are essentially the same person, just on different sides of the law. But Mann's script presents us with a plethora of other contrasts and mirrors between the two antagonists.<br/><br/>Their personal lives, for instance. Hanna, an officer at the peak of his career, wants to be there for his third wife and her teenage daughter, but his devotion to his job gets in the way. On the other hand, McCauley, on the cusp of retirement, adheres to his philosophy of never having anything that you can't walk away from in thirty seconds, if you feel the eponymous heat around the corner. And yet, as he plans his final job, McCauley starts a relationship with a young graphic designer.<br/><br/>Pacino and De Niro are, of course, brilliant in their respective roles. De Niro, as the dignified and introverted McCauley, plays the same character he's been playing for years, but he plays it with impeccable skill. On the other side of the coin, Pacino has great fun with the more outgoing Hanna. Most of the time Pacino plays it straight, but once in a while there is a burst of almost maniacal ferocity, which places Hanna firmly in the role of the hunter.<br/><br/>While Heat is primarily a character study, centering largely on its two leads, that doesn't mean that there's no action. McCauley's bank robbery, and the following gun battle that plays out on the streets of L.A. between the thieves and Hanna's squad, makes for one hell of an action sequence. It is meticulously set up; the cinematography strikes the perfect balance between controlled and frenetic; and the fact that Mann manages to keep it up for over ten minutes is staggering.<br/><br/>This sequence, and the climactic showdown between Hanna and McCauley, form the action centrepieces of the film. But it is the carefully studied relationship between these two antagonists that raises Heat above the rest of the genre. A different situation, they could have been the best of friends. But as it stands, Hanna and McCauley present us with one of the greatest rivalries in recent cinema.<br/><br/>As an aside, Heat is also up for the ""Loudest Gunshots in Cinema"" award. Less auditorily stalwart viewers may want to consider earplugs."

"moetloe","10","0","1","13 October 2007"," The best in the cops & robbers genre
","This is one of my all time favorite movies; an exciting and well worked-out tale of cops vs robbers. Everything in this movie is well done: script and screenplay are sharp, exciting, but realistic. Acting is strong throughout: DeNiro and Pacino have hardly been better, and the supporting cast is strong right down to every minor character.<br/><br/>Without giving away details, here's a number of scenes that stand out and real fans will enjoy giving these a closer look to see what I mean about strong acting (as if the scenes don't speak for themselves): - DeNiro in the scene where McCauley confronts Chris' wife (Judd) - Scenes where McCauley and Nate (Voigt) interact, such as when they make their goodbyes. - Pacino in scenes where Hanna interacts with his informant (and the informant's brother) - The scene where Hanna comes home to his wife and Ralph. - The scenes between Breedan (Haysbert), the getaway driver, and his girlfriend. Also: The diner's manager's abuse of ex-cons like Breedan. - Of course: the DeNiro/Pacino coffeeshop scene.<br/><br/>At the time, critics mostly seemed to object to the (over)length of the movie. In my opinion, this merely reflects the lack of other aspects (flaws) of this film that warrant any comment. I say: you can't get enough of a good thing. There's nothing wrong with a movie spending time on character development, so long as the characters are interesting and they contribute to the story. This certainly applies for Heat, which provides characters with a complete and complex personal background, which adds realism, creates involvement with characters and their motives, and adds to the excitement and atmosphere in action and suspense scenes.<br/><br/>In todays era of fast-paced Hollywood action flicks, movies like Heat, that have the patience to tell a complete story, are a rarity and should be cherished. If you have enjoyed this movie as much as I have, you can be sure to enjoy other work by director Michael Mann (e.g. Collateral, Miami Vice) as well - but you knew that."

","Just to lay all doubts to rest once and for all. Both Deniro & Pacino, were both present for the legendary diner scene. From beginning to end, they both insisted/demanded that they did the scene together. Actually a little known entertainment note, Deniro & Pacino did this movie just to have that scene between them in the diner. That scene is not only a pivotal part of the movie, but one of the most legendary/famous scenes between two of the best actors in film history. How do I know this you ask. I was a food prepper at, ""Kate Mantilini Restaurant"" during that time. Michael Mann, gave the staff a rare honor of being extras during that famous scene. So everyone you see in the restaurant, are all restaurant/kitchen staff. During the filming, you could actually hear a pin drop. It was a unmeasurable level of excitement & intensity. So yes, from the very first shot to the very last shot. Pacino & Deniro were both there for that scene, it actually took two days two shoot that scene. I remember it like it was yesterday, I have about fifty pictures to prove they were in the restaurant at the same time. I also have a picture of Deniro - Pacino and myself, taken by one of the camera opertaors. All of the restaurant staff even got sag cards from Michael Mann, as a thank you. God he had to pay a lot of fines for those I'm sure."

","""Heat"" is Michael Mann's crime movie set in Los Angeles. It pits Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and the L.A. police against Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley and his loyal accomplices. The film captures both sides of the story exquisitely and features excellent cinematography and a well-made score.<br/><br/>From the start, ""Heat"" is a character-driven film. This is the film's main strength: it develops characters which are easy to become attached to and I became very interested in what fate the script had in store for each of the characters. My favorite of these characters is Al Pacino as Lieutenant Vincent Hanna. Hanna is the tough detective of old and Pacino has the gruff voice to match, but the character also gains depth from his relationship with his family. There is also well-placed humor injected into Hanna's character that was welcome. On the other side is Robert De Niro as Neil McCauley, who is also effective and develops a character of depth. There are also notable supporting performances from Val Kimer, Amy Brenneman, Dennis Haysbert and a number of others.<br/><br/>In addition to developing its characters, ""Heat"" benefits from showing carefully planned and executed crimes and careful and methodical investigative work. There is also high quality action scenes mixed in, which are given extra meaning due to the film's rigorous characterizations. There is also the famous scene where rivals Pacino and De Niro sit down for coffee and reflect on their lives which is simply brilliant. Overall ""Heat"" is a well-developed film which considers the consequences of crime on a public and personal scale."

Incredible work, the likes of which Hollywood has not seen before or after (in my opinion).<br/><br/>From a cinematic perspective, Heat is astounding. The scene with Eady and Neil overlooking LA at night sets up their relationship beautifully. Later they are atop the hill overlooking some mountains in the dawn, pink sky.

"dragonshield","8","0","1","24 July 2007"," Robert De Niro and Al Pacino at their best
","I saw this movie for the first time over two weeks ago and I was quite pleased on the overall result. ""Heat"" is an exciting thriller and it tells cleverly, quoting one of the plot outlines, about two men on opposite sides of the law - One being a detective and one being a thief. The movie starts off with a robbery, which is arranged by Neil McCauley, the thief, and his criminal crew. This brings Vincent Hanna, the detective, and his crew to investigation which leads up to a hunt, Hanna being the hunter and McCauley being the prey. The movie wisely mixes up with the two lives of these two men, making the viewer feel sympathy towards both ends.<br/><br/>First of all I must say that the screenplay is fantastic, it's very well written and despite the fact of the movie being a bit long-winded it still keeps the viewer interested all the way trough. It's exciting and includes great plot twists, having also some real depth in the whole background story. Emotions and feelings jump between happiness and sadness, having sympathy and hatred blended together with a really nice flow, although the flow sometimes not progressing as much as it should. It's just that sometimes it feels like the movie doesn't move towards, it just stops and stays there for a short period of time, which can be a bit irritating for some viewers. I guess those moments are there for building up the tension, but they could have been crafted out more carefully by considering the whole overall flow of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has some great characters in it and above all of them are the characters of Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna. These two characters who are played by such amazing actors are the characters which really make the movie what it is. Despite the movie having so much great characters some of them are sadly in need of some real depth, as those characters are sort of left out only as to be in minor roles, although they'd be important for the story itself. You really couldn't choose better actors for the roles of McCauley and Hanna, as they are played by the legendary actors Rober De Niro and Al Pacino, De Niro in the role of McCauley and Pacino in the role of Hanna. This is the reason why the role performances are what you expect them to be - Excellent. Other roles are played by such actors like Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and also Dennis Haysbert and young Natalie Portman. Still, neither one of them reach on the same level as De Niro and Pacino. It's pretty obvious though. The movie also includes this superb scene between Pacino and De Niro, which is undeniably the best scene in the movie and probably one of the best tension-packed scenes in the history of movies. Although they just talk with each other it's still so exciting and it's pure candy for your eyes, as it is indeed a great pleasure to see such legendary actors working together in the same scene. By just the glance of their eyes De Niro and Pacino make a beautiful scene which couldn't be better in any way. Those who have seen the movie probably know what I'm talking about. Just superb.<br/><br/>Directed by Michael Mann it sure has that tension his movies seem to have. To me the directing is pretty much flawless and it's what directing should be in thriller/detective movies, it has this certain style of showing things on the screen and leaving some of the questions for the viewer to answer. Cinematography compliments the whole thing by being also what you expect it to be in a detective movie, precise and detailed, followed by the astonishing music. Composed by Elliot Goldenthal, who I haven't honestly heard of before, it is perfect for the movie and fits so well with the main theme as well. Music is a crucial instrument when it comes to thrillers as it is supposed to be significant for the tension a thriller should have. I am glad to say the music manages itself brilliantly in ""Heat"" All this; The directing, cinematography and the music makes ""Heat"" an exciting thriller, each area compliments each other.<br/><br/>""Heat"" is a great movie but it could be better, as in the way it is now it's a bit too long and not so progressing it could be. The film is still definitely worth watching, especially for the thriller and Michael Mann fans, as those fans won't be disappointed. It's just that the progress sometimes gets so slow that it interferes with the flow. Well that may sound a bit too harsh, as it isn't actually so remarkable in the end, as you won't be left with a bad taste in your mouth after all. De Niro and Pacino are simply at their best and you just can't go wrong with them now can you? A great thriller which appeals to the feelings of the viewer surprisingly well by having also waterproof drama in it."

","Heat (1995) is an excellent film. I definitely consider it one of the few modern masterpieces. Pacino and De Niro each bring strong performances, and I truly feel De Niro's is one of the top five of his career. Everything about this film makes it jump off the screen. The film chronicles the lives of two men on opposite sides of the law. One is the dedicated detective Lt. Vincent Hanna, portrayed explosively by Al Pacino. On the other side is Neil McCauley, the calm, precise leader of a crew whose sole intention is to take down the biggest score. As the two engage in a tense cat and mouse game, the viewer is put into the action. The epic saga unfolds with effortless grace and subdued charisma. <br/><br/>It is a truly visceral cinematic experience. The colors, the music, and the power defy explanation when it comes to talking about Heat. Besides all that, the film has a tremendous supporting cast that makes it hard to pick a favorite character. Val Kilmer is worth noting as the brash, temperamental Chris Shiherlis. Heat is a construction of epic film proportions, directed with poise and passion by Michael Mann, a genius of his time. With all the emotion and tension that Heat exudes, it is worth noting that this film, despite its brutal nature, does have heart. There are subtle moments that let the viewer understand the characters' nuances and thoughts. The film makes you a part of the action, a part of the gritty L.A. backdrop, and a part of something special. The brilliant direction is no more evident than in the famed shootout sequence, in which the action feels strikingly real and in your face. I can't say enough about how I feel about this motion picture. It is a powerhouse that deserves credit for being one of the very best to come out of the '90s, a very good decade for films. If you are having doubts about seeing this film, then do it only for the coffee shop scene between De Niro and Pacino, one of my favorite scenes to watch in the film. Two screen legends taking time out of their film pantheons to sit down and have a little talk over coffee. What could be better than that?"

Pacino and De Niro deliver performances so nuanced and intelligent, one feels they were all to aware of the greatness the film would go on to achieve. Unlike other movies made by Michael Mann before or since (and in no small part due to the excellent casting), the characters are incredibly well defined and portrayed, the key being that even the support performances are excellent. This film hinges on the fact that even though people choose different sides of life (i.e Pacino 'cop', De Niro 'criminal'), there are similarities which are common in us all."

","A lacquered film, yes, but brimming with thought and accepted axioms is Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995). You won't see any glam cops strutting their way down an imaginary runway (Michael Mann was a strong force for the TV series ""Miami Vice"") but you will see plausibly hardened characters who struggle and keep in cadence with their respective propensities.<br/><br/>L.A.P.D. Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is a consummate professional in law enforcement and investigation. Seasoned thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a consummate professional in stealing in all its forms - he's an ironically considerate one, though (""Your money is insured by the federal government - you're not gonna lose a dime,"" he harangues a frightened bunch of customers as he's holding up a bank.). Most of the film is spent watching these two attempt to outmaneuver each other - as if this were a game of chess using real people instead of pieces made out of wood.<br/><br/>These two men are the same type, except one plays yin to the other's yang. There's a scene of dialogue between the two in a coffee shop of all places that almost jumps off the screen it's so crammed with kinetic energy - it's like what it would be like to witness a conversation between Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. In it they both reveal their inescapable connection to their respective jobs - they love their women but cannot properly fit them in to their time-consuming routines. It's as if they're both resigned to their fates - they know one of them is going to die due to the heat coming around the corner <br/><br/>Coppola's ""The Godfather Part II"" is the best of all crime films and it seems appropriate that this one ranks in as a close runner-up - these two films are the only ones to have both Pacino and De Niro simultaneously in the cast. Both films are exquisite pieces of art in the guise of entertainment flicks. The former being about the gradual and inevitable annihilation of a family due to the nature of preoccupation - the latter being about the nature of preoccupation that precluded everything else."

","One of my favorite movies of all time. I don't know who's better in this movie. Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro. If you asked me to choose, I'd be hard pressed to pick. They can both play 'bad guy' or 'good guy' equally well. And doesn't Pacino get a chance to act? At times, he's over the top! I love it when he gets a chance to do that! The scene with Hank Azaria in Vegas. Wow! No one does it better. DeNiro is cool & calm throughout, even though he's a hard core killer. The supporting cast is right on the money. The entire film is a work of art. The bank robbery scene lasts 12 minutes & the music is right on the money! I watch it over & over & never get tired of it. Diana Venora is so smooth as Vincent's wife. Her line in the bar about 'sifting through the detritus' is so cool. Overall, one of the best. Thanks Michael Mann."

","There are too many superlatives regarding this movie to be listed.I have viewed it about 5 times and still it entertaining. It is a very violent movie, so if you are squeamish about such things take a pass. Heat has a varied assortment of complex characters. The story line is basically about the world of violent criminals and the man who brings them together for the purpose of engaging in high profile crimes that have huge financial rewards. Denero plays the genius who leads them and Pacino the cop who wants to bring him down. The acting is first rate. Watch the interplay between DeNero and Pacino in the restaurant scene in which each is telling the other about their lives and goals. It is like watching two heavy weight champions fighting it out. I'll call it was a draw. Also look out for Dr. Bob, played by Jerimy Privin of ""Entourage"" fame. He has more hair now than he did then. Go figure.

","'Heat' is an unparalleled masterpiece with an unparalleled cast. As mentioned by another reviewer, this film's back-up roles are just as famed as the lead ones. I love the way Mann has developed the friendship between Pacino and De Niro despite their opposition. I love the way the movie runs for a good two and a half / three hours, yet you don't once get the impression the movie has just been drawn out and milked for all it's worth. And I love how you can sympathize with both Pacino and De Niro, as opposed to just simply the anti-hero or the protagonist. There are a handful of incredible scenes in this film but, not to take anything away from the final shootout, the one that has always stuck with me is the battle in the streets about mid-way through the movie. Another unforgettable moment is the one in which the two main characters meet face-to-face and bond over a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>""I will not hesitate. Not for a second.""<br/><br/>Magnificent film: 10/10."
"Derek237","10","0","1","13 July 2006"," A brilliant crime saga
","Heat is a movie filled with clichés but as a whole is not clichéd. It has a confidence and skill to its craft that makes you believe that you are seeing this kind of story for the first time, or at least, in a whole new light. It's mainly the story of the obsessed-with-his-cases, badass cop and the professional, by-the-numbers criminal. Michael Mann fleshes out the characters (played by Pacino and DeNiro) extremely well and presents them as two men who are each consumed by their profession. Mostly because they are both very good at what they do, and they would not prefer to do anything else. Each story would make an interesting movie or TV show, but Heat collides these two similar characters together to make a great movie about two skilled men conflicted amidst pressures from their work and personal lives finally meeting their match.<br/><br/>What I liked about the connection Pacino and DeNiro build is the fact that their characters truly respected each other. If the movie were bias to either side of the law, one character would be good and the other would be bad. It's not bias at all, and both characters are very likable. It's hard to root for one character over the other, which makes the film's conclusion all the more emotional. And believe me, it has a great ending.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is top notch, ranging from Val Kilmer to Ashley Judd to William Fichner to a young Natalie Portman, but the main attraction obviously is Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in the leads. They're actors who are amazing beyond words, and have acted in so many monumental movies throughout their careers, and I have to say that this was the last truly great, outstanding film that either has starred in to date. Oddly enough, it just so happens it was the same movie.<br/><br/>With Heat, Michael Mann tells a sincere and richly detailed story within a subject matter that usually isn't treated with such care, and Pacino and DeNiro perform with their usual greatness, but still offer up new things we haven't seen before. It's one of the best films of the 1990's.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

"tnrcooper","10","0","1","20 June 2006"," The best movie
","Well, it's up there anyway.<br/><br/>This is the rare flawless movie, a great movie by Michael Mann during a string of excellent movies, including The Last of the Mohicans, Heat, and The Insider. However, neither of those two films, while both fantastic, can raise a candle to Heat. The two-DVD set of the movie features lots of informative additional material including a commentary by Mann, featurettes about the journey from the screenplay to the screen, a documentary returning to sites visited during the movie, one about the famous scene featuring DeNiro and Pacino together on camera for the first time in their careers. The film itself is worthy of such attention as it addresses the lives of a group of accomplished, high-end bank robbers and the detectives charged with tracking them down in all their complexity, from the toll their careful planning and preparation takes on their relationships and personal lives, to the success of the operations themselves and the duties that the men undertake in their attempt to free $12 million from a bank. The title of the film refers to the proximity of stress, of challenges in a person's life, about the point at which stresses cause discomfort, at which one's comfort zone is disturbed, whether that be, as seems to be the case for the men (primarily) in this film who are work-obsessed, or whether it be through dysfunctional relationships, whether it be via unhealthy work relationships, via affairs uncompleted or something else. It speaks to the idea, finally that one aspect of a life is ultimately inseparable from another part.<br/><br/>The film is a nearly perfect depiction of the intersection of the complexities of relationships and work lives and how this complexity affects us. How Mann manages to make such a grown-up, subtly sophisticated movie is almost impossible to know, but Heat is a perfect balance of how lives cannot be compartmentalized forever and how actions have reactions, regardless of how long ago they happened, regardless of the physical distance from the person or the circumstances now. The film is so wonderful, that in summarizing it, I am unnerved that perhaps I might de-value it or not do it justice. The ensemble cast is fantastic, particularly Diane Venora as Justine Hanna, an artist and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino in a superbly calibrated performance)'s third wife who is tired of being the third wheel in a marriage between Hanna and his career. Pacino and DeNiro are unsurprisingly excellent. Pacino plays, with perfect nuance, an accomplished detective whose job significantly supersedes all other elements of his life his life. That said, he is a good man who is a more devoted father to his step-daughter (Natalie Portman in her second major role) and whose focus is true and untainted by blandishments that some cops might not be able to resist. Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is a world-class thief and equally focused man but is a sociopath in that the loss of innocent life does not detract from his intent to complete a theft successfully. Ultimately, he is self-centered while Hanna is a devoted public servant. In most other ways, however, they are two sides of the same coin. He emphasizes to Hanna during their meeting in a coffee shop that, if circumstances get too hot (another instance of the meaning of the title of the movie), that he will leave the scene. As he puts it, ""that's where the discipline comes in."" However, he has no reluctance about taking a cop or a civilian in the way out, if they interfere with his goal of completing the robbery successfully. Tom Sizemore, Mykelti Williamson, and Dennis Haysbert in particular, are excellent in supporting roles, Sizemore evincing a devotion to Neil McCauley that bespeaks a man who owes a great deal to someone and perhaps the devotion of someone who is in awe of someone while Mykelti Williamson seems the ideal police officer for his compassion but also for his discipline and commitment to upholding laws. He is a tribute to excellent police work. Dennis Haysbert's part in the film is poignant and bespeaks the larger forces, the larger palette against which all our actions take place. He must decide between going straight in a thankless dead-end job for a cold, demanding boss taking one last job on the chance that it will be a big payday. Ashley Judd as Charlene Shihirlis, the wife of one of Neil's crew (Val Kilmer also fantastic, as Chris Shiherlis) is concerned that her relationship is dysfunctional and that her husband is not adequately committed to assuring its success, and that, as a result, her son will not be adequately cared for. She is a woman who, from Mann's commentary on the DVD imagines her as the wife of a high-end thief who grew up rough and had some unpleasant experiences growing up, but just wants to settle down and attempt to live a fairly conventional life. The tension between husband and wife and drives her into the arms of a small-time Vegas crook (the fantastic Hank Azaria who conveys small-time sliminess and short-sighted misogyny better, perhaps than anyone ever has in movie history). <br/><br/>Mann must be given ultimate credit for weaving all the strings together so adeptly and conveying the inter-relatedness of the different parts of our lives. His imagination and clear- eyed vision of what motivates and drives us all makes this film an epic, a film ostensibly about thieves and cops, but one which ultimately speaks to the higher purpose which all must find on this earth."
"StayPuft003","9","0","1","11 June 2006"," One of the Best movies I have ever seen
","That is really the only way I can put it. Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances if not his best, and Al Pacino isn't half bad either. He's actually very good. The plot is intricate and not a bunch of random scenes put together, which I see a lot of in action films, and the idea doesn't seem too far-fetched. This movie basically has everything that a good movie needs: Great Action, including the best shootout ever to hit the screen, great emotion, and it is very moving. You get to know both sides of the law so well that you know you are going to be upset at the end. I was upset, but I thought it was great. I knew that either De Niro or Pacino was gonna lose, but I didn't know which one it would be. The emotions in this film are very realistic and the relationships the characters have with each other do not seemed forced and add to the plot in the most amazing ways. I do not wish to say a lot, because I don't want to spoil any of it for those who haven't seen it, but I will end it by saying that the acting is great, the action is great, the character development is great, and overall is this a superb film that should not be missed."

"DonFishies","7","0","3","23 May 2006"," Has potential, but is far too long
","About ten years ago, I sat and watched Heat with my family. Despite the three hour runtime, I was the only one who managed to sit through the entire thing without falling asleep. At the end of it, I really did not like it at all. I thought it was overly boring, and ran for way too long. My vast film knowledge was not even a fraction of what it is today at that point, but for years to come, if anyone ever asked if I had seen it, I said the same thing to them. So in the last two years, I've caught various parts of it, and was totally immersed within the film, despite my previous ideals about it. I never managed to watch it beginning to end at any point (usually just the same parts over and over), so I finally decided to crack down and watch it.<br/><br/>Heat runs along the lines of a parallel story between two characters: Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Hanna is a Liutenant with the LAPD, and basically spends his life tracking down and arresting criminals. His social life is totally absent, and it shows with the frustration his third wife Justine (Diane Venora), has with him. McCauley is a skilled thief, who is hired on various jobs with his crew, and lives by a very straight, and by-the-books lifestyle. He consistently delivers lines about being able to walk away from anything if any situation was to come up. For that reason, his social life is a mess too.<br/><br/>Both are basically the same conflicted character, just on two sides of the law.<br/><br/>With the film running for three hours though, you can tell that this is just a very basic idea of what the film is about. It is littered with dozens of subplots involving secondary characters, and even deeper subplots with the main characters. It seemingly goes on and on, until it finally meets the ending, which never seems to come soon enough.<br/><br/>While DeNiro is his usual great acting self here, there was something about Pacino that was just, not right. Watching the film, I could never figure out just what it was, but it was so easily noticeable that it was not on the same level as his performances in Scent of a Woman, The Godfather or Scarface. He's a great, versatile actor, and he's undoubtedly one of the greatest of the last thirty to forty years. But something just does not click here the same as it does with DeNiro. Of course, DeNiro's performance does not rank up there with the likes of Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but it is still much better overall than Pacino's.<br/><br/>The supporting cast which features Venora, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Tom Sizemore among others, are all just good. None of them really stand out performance wise, and none of them stand out as even close to matching anything that DeNiro puts forth (or Pacino for that matter). They are secondary to the two big actors, and they know it. They follow Michael Mann's writing to the tee, and make little to no progression in making their characters any greater than they can be.<br/><br/>As said, Mann's script and direction really hurts this film. It is too long. Easily, a whole thirty minutes could have been excised right from the film, and it still could have had potential for greatness. Collateral was a straight two hours, and felt brisk, yet got so much accomplished. Why could this ""saga"" not have been so much more tightly packed in? The layers of subplots really damage the film and its impact, and really damages any sort of astonishing acting to be done. The audience is bored, and so are the actors. Is that not obvious Mann?<br/><br/>But I will admit, the film has some fabulously choreographed sequences. The LA street shootout between the thieves and the cops is just astonishing. That one scene I mentioned above that I kept continually seeing? This was it. And watching it within the film really made me feel how sad it was to see such a great scene come so long after the lengthy scenes before it. It looks and sounds amazing. The cinematography within the scene is top notch, and is so well paced, that you have to ask yourself why the rest of the film was not done nearly as well. Yes, the film has a variety of other top-notch shots and visuals, but some are just overkill. And others are just unneeded. It was almost like Mann really wanted to make this film continue on forever, and try and throw some of his excellent style in to try and make up for it.<br/><br/>Sorry to say, but it just does not help the film in the end.<br/><br/>While some films have gotten better since I first watched them years ago, others have not changed. This film, sadly, is one of them. It has great potential, and some great sequences, but it just does not know well enough as to when it should stop. It's too long, and it has way too much going on in it for it's own good. It's not a bad film for this reason, but it's not an amazing one either.<br/><br/>7/10."
"talverri","7","0","3","20 May 2006"," Pacino detracted from the film
","I liked the film a lot. It had some off moments but overall was a tight, fresh film. What spoiled it for me was Al Pacino's character. I must be missing something because everyone loves Pacino so much. But as I consider it, ever since the Godfather III I have felt he is too over the top. And the strange thing is that I really like his earlier work. So either I am off or indeed Al Pacino does not know how to fit his movie star presence into roles. Maybe he was competing with DeNiro in Heat. Yet I thought DeNiro totally brought his character off. SoI found myself rooting for Deniro and not Pacino. Though I do not think Michael Mann wanted either character to be rooted for, cinematically it should have been Pacino."

Robert De Niro is Neil McCauley, the man mainly in charge of this gang, and the one who Hanna mainly wants to get his hands on.

He's gives Neil McCauley just the right look and feel. Pacino does his usual occasional overacting bit, yet he provides just the right tone for the workaholic, obsessed, personally troubled cop. Everyone else hits just the right notes for their characters and the context of the film. Really not a poor performance in the bunch This is pretty darn near perfect film making. Michael Mann achieves a great pace, feel and look, and the movie just pulls you in and captivates you. The look of a slick Los Angeles, with fortunes out there for the taking, is perfect. The plot and dialogue are as realistic and believable as you are going to find in a feature film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only complaint might be the occasional overacting of Pacino.

","I have watched this movie for the first time since I initially reviewed it in September 2003. Back then I lambasted it for being too long and not answering enough questions, accused the two leads of over-acting and put down the achievements of director Michael Mann amongst other gripes.<br/><br/>Now though, I have to say my opinion has changed tremendously. This is a truly outstanding film. A great take on the tried, tested and sometimes boring genre of heist movies.<br/><br/>In my original review I stated that Robert DeNiro was easily out-acted by Al Pacino. I still maintain that Pacino is the better of the two, but I reckon DeNiro is pretty spectacular as the main villain.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is the way in which it portrays the characters as real people with real problems. Pacino is the steadfast, no-nonsense cop with his finger on the pulse, but has a crumbling marriage and suicidal step-daughter to pre-occupy his supposed 'free' time, DeNiro is the compulsive criminal who wants to get away from crime and set up a new life with the woman he loves. But the inescapable fact for these two is that no matter what criminal they arrest or what crime they commit, their working life will never, ever be truly satisfying. Mann plays the characters off brilliantly as two sides of the same coin, each with partners who try but will never fully understand the life they lead away from home. Pacino just wants his wife to be there for him, but she places demands on him that are too much for him to shoulder after a countless bad days at the office.<br/><br/>Whether you are watching a heist or witnessing DeNiro and Pacino having a late-night coffee, the scenes in this film bristle with superb underlying tension; great credit to Mann there. The scene wherein Pacino and his men are carrying out surveillance on DeNiro and Kilmer from the back of a truck is excellent; with hardly any movement from the characters or much dialogue, the tension cranks up ten-fold.<br/><br/>Everything about this film, from the sets to the actors, oozes class. An absolutely superb cast fill each and every role with well defined persona's and you actually care about all of them.<br/><br/>***************SPOILER*************** <br/><br/>I still do have a gripe with the fact that Kilmer got away, why was he so special? <br/><br/>**************END SPOILER************* <br/><br/>One of the great films of the 1990's, Heat deserves branding as a modern classic."

"TheNorthernMonkee","8","0","1","30 March 2005"," great direction and phenomenal acting, but something is missing
","SPOILERS Both legendary actors (the best two ever?) and both making names for themselves in the majestic ""Godfather"" trilogy, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are actors that make a film. Often voted as the top two actors ever in television polls, these two men are like box-office gold dust. Therefore, when intensity genius Michael Mann decided to direct 1995's ""Heat"", he must have felt like he was on cloud number nine when they both agreed to starring roles. The notion of De Niro versus Pacino is an idea that fans drool over, and in ""Heat"" for the limited time they are on screen together, it works wonderfully. Unfortunately though, for a film which markets itself on the acting combination, this just isn't a long enough period. Still, with Michael Mann's masterful work behind the camera, the three men still produce a brilliant film. It just doesn't quite reach that full potential.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is your regular work obsessed cop. Attempting to mix a family life with stopping crime, things are far from wonderful. At the same time, master criminal Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a rich, but lonely man who might just have met someone to spend his life wife. Now though, on different ends of the spectrum, these two men will risk everything they hold dear, in the simple attempt of outwitting each other.<br/><br/>Helped by a superb supporting cast including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and others, Pacino and De Niro show just why they are two of the best (if not THE best) actors in the world today. Sharing screen time almost identically, the two actors pit themselves against each other for almost three hours, culminating in your predictable one on one resolution. Unfortunately for the film, and it's enormous hype though, it's far too rare that the two actually get to exchange words with each other. Excluding the conclusion and a stunning scene in a café, the two characters watch each other from a distance and talk about their opposition with respect. It's like claiming your friends with the President of America when you've met him once. You know of each other's existence, but more often than not, your never in the same room together.<br/><br/>Despite their relative lack of time together, De Niro and Pacino are a treat to watch throughout this film, and they are always well assisted by the direction of Mann. A master of intensity, Michael Mann is perhaps the finest director out there at the moment, that can use the dark tones of night-time to create a truly nerve tingling moment. Even during the day, he is proficient at gaining intensity. Ultimately though, Mann is finest during the cold, darkness when the Sun has gone down.<br/><br/>Michael Mann is also responsible for the story of ""Heat"" and truthfully, this is perhaps his one flaw. Creating a strong and sturdy story, it appears hard to criticise Mann's work. Unfortunately though, there are key mistakes. As a result of devoting himself purely to a De Niro and Pacino showdown, Mann leaves one or two gaping holes in his story. A minor character who plays a relatively key role in the film is also a mass murderer who butchers women he's slept with, but throughout the film, despite Pacino visiting the scene of a murder, he never once refers to it afterwards. Now if that was real, why didn't Pacino realise the characters links and mention it. Still, perhaps this is simply picking at an issue and looking for a criticism of the film.<br/><br/>There's little point denying that the true strengths of this movie are the outstanding performances by De Niro, Pacino and Mann. All working to their full standard, they provide us with almost three hours of pleasure. For a film which advertised itself as being De Niro versus Pacino however, their screen time together is vastly inferior to what you'd expect."
"policy134","9","0","1","27 March 2005"," Mann, the TV producer who should be king.
","The first crime drama in history that shows both sides of the law without deriding one side or another is also the best Michael Mann film that he has ever made. The two antagonists are three-dimensional and Mann shows that he is more than what he has been accused of being, a director that prefers style over substance.<br/><br/>De Niro and Pacino are of course two of the best actors known today, but they couldn't be in better company. Mann, who used to be producer of Miami Vice deals with each of their predicaments in a sensitive way that really describes what being opposites is really about.<br/><br/>De Niro's character, McCauley and Pacino's Hanna actually have more in common than the people that are supposed to be their friends and allies. They have been unable to form a lasting relationship with women and their only satisfaction is their work.<br/><br/>Of the many supporting players, two stand out. Tom Noonan is not a household name, especially here in Denmark, but his despicable character here is essential to counter what the De Niro character is like. Val Kilmer seems to be an odd choice to play a hardened criminal but he shows that he can be as hardboiled as De Niro could in his most unsympathetic role, especially when dealing with his girlfriend, played by Ashley Judd. She has an important part in the end where she has to choose sides.<br/><br/>Like many crime pictures, there is a great shootout, but this one is handled in a way that doesn't spell attractive or glamorous. The noise is absolutely worse than any war picture ever made and the casualties die hard.<br/><br/>The end is somewhat predictable but could it end in another way and still be believable? I don't think so. The two scenes that De Niro and Pacino share, including this one, are not really necessary to the plot, but they say something about their characters and their strange connection. That it is not two action scenes doesn't really matter because we have already seen the cat and mouse game they play before their first scene and to have them go head to head literally would spoil the poesy of these enigmatic characters. The one thing that I felt a little contrived was the way that Hanna approaches McCauley to have their talk but that is such a minor quibble that it doesn't affect the rest of the movie. So congratulations to Mann for making a brilliant film and I hope there will be many more to come."

","Why do the characters I like always have to die? Heat is such a great movie. Excellent acting, good story. But the ending... It's like flirting with a really hot member of the opposite sex, making you all excited and then receiving a punch to the face.<br/><br/>Hanna was such an unsympathetic guy, while the gangster Neil was so nice. These two characters just stood on the opposite sides of the law by accident. It could've easily been the other way round. So far so good. You have two main characters portrayed by excellent actors, supported by good actors. I'm sure other comments point out how the good guy is shown as a driven, lonely man, while the antagonist is intelligent and reserved.<br/><br/>I for my part can more identify with the latter. He kills people, sure. But Hanna is no different. Both are men who do what they have to do in order to reach their goals.<br/><br/>When I watch this movie I turn the DVD player off when Neil is on his way to the airport.

Obviously the highlight of the film being the foiled bank job which was just fantastic, my only regret being that I never actually got the chance to see it in the movie theatre! People say that a director has done his job if you feel the film as well as watch it and in the case of heat this is certainly true, the beginning of the last scene where Deniro make the decision to go back and get his guy leaving the girlfriend in the car wondering, is truly remarkable.

","Heat is movie that breaks all the conventions of what an action movie should be. Michael Mann takes a hardcore look at the lives of Robert Di Niro the criminal and Al Pacino, the cop. For 2 hrs. and 50 minutes., you won't see a lot of explosions nor will you see a whole lot of action. Instead you will see a great deal of character development as it relates to the two main characters. However, why I would give this movie an eight is because of how well it enriches the supporting characters. Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer play two members of Di Niro's gang and get their own scenes to develop their character. By the end of this movie, you will feel as if you know these people well, even though they are ""bad guys."" There is a little bit of action at the beginning and towards the end. Mann is quite adept at being able to film L.A as he shown through this movie and Collateral. And plus how can you not love the one and only scene with Pacino and Di Niro."
"MovieRat-2","7","0","2","26 February 2005"," Complex, drawn out story with some action thrown in
","Technically the film was superb: realistic make-up; excellent use of lighting and filters; smooth and realistic sound...an A+ for the technical guru's behind this film. If you can stand the 3 hours long film just to bask in the glorious visuals and audios, you will have no regrets.<br/><br/>The action in this film can only be described as a don't-blink-hold-your-breath-till-its-done tour de force. Each action sequence begins with a bang (literally) and ends with a bang. They are violent, terrifying, and yet beautiful to observe at the same time. A+ for the choreographers, stunt-men, and actors for giving us high octane action scenes that, without any doubt, stole the show.<br/><br/>So why only a 7 out of 10? Two words....story and pacing. The story, in premise, has potential for being a great classic film of cat-and-mouse between a hardcore cop against a cold and determined crook. And yet we, the audience, are subjected to 3 hours of long, drawn out scenes mostly involving the mediocre lives of the two main characters. There are scenes in this film which in the grand scheme of things have absolutely no point what-so-ever in being in this film. Plot points that would have been taken care of in probably 5 minutes are drawn out in complex detail to the point of monotony. Now, in some cases, this approach works; however, for the vast majority of the film they are unnecessary and ruin the overall pace of the film. Mann, a veteran film-maker, should have known better. C for effort, but even that is generous in my book.<br/><br/>I also felt the ambiguous morality of the film to be questionable. When the film nears its climax, you are still divided over who to cheer for: the cop or the crook. In a film that clearly shows that the cop, although flawed, is good and the crook, with ""some"" redeeming qualities, is evil, the audience is left with an ambivalent attitude toward the fate of both. Once again, pacing is at fault. After 3 hours of feet dragging, you simply don't care about either of them anymore."

(And in an eerie example of life imitating art, an infamous bank robbery not dissimilar from the one in the film occurred in LA only months after the movie had been released; fortunately, unlike the movie, no one but the bad guys were killed). Mann gives us a tableau showcasing a scene of such intensity, it makes the viewer feel as if he were almost there. Mann plunges you into his familiar world of cops versus bad guys. It's the dazzling execution which enlarges the formula and raises it to an accomplishment of both directorial technique and white-knuckled suspense.<br/><br/>""Heat"" begins with a slam-bang armored car heist (in another example of life imitating art, a similar robbery was committed only miles from my home a few years back; as in the movie all three guards are murdered in cold blood), a signature Michael Mann violent set-piece that proves the better moments of ""Miami Vice"" were just warm-ups for his outstanding feature work such as in this and ""Collateral."" ""Heat"" presents us with a hardcore crew of criminals who specialize in highly lucrative but dangerous robberies and burglaries. Robert DeNiro plays the leader of this band of elite bad guys. Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore also turn in excellent performances. Henry Rollins, however, should look into more acting lessons. The genuinely frightening Danny Trejo is badly underused, a rare example of Mann under-utilizing a talented actor.<br/><br/>The pace is frenetic, the characters sharply drawn and Al Pacino's explosiveness has seldom been put to better use. The film also has a cameo from the serial killer in ""Red Dragon"" (Tom Noonan). John Voit also gives a low-key, effective performance as McCauley's fence-cum-manager-type.<br/><br/>DeNiro gives us a man who's always been outside the ""system"" and now views, Don Corleone-like, those of us who do choose to live by society's rules as nothing but pawns pushed around by forces beyond our control. As Neil McCauley, DeNiro delivers to us that staple character of Westerns, the man who means to live by his own rules at whatever cost to himself or innocent bystanders. Smart enough to use violence only when necessary, but cold-blooded enough to murder anyone in his way ""at the drop of a hat."" McCauley gives us his philosophy about ""the Life"" learned from years inside California's toughest prisons, ""Have nothing in your life that you cannot walk-away from in thirty seconds flat if you see the 'heat' coming around the corner. That's the discipline.""<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot and expertly cut. Like ""Collateral"", this picture is another kind of visual ""tone poem"" of LA, the beautiful camera work revealing both the ethereal nature of the city and the brutality beneath the glitz and glamor. Mann's trademark cinematography sparkles.<br/><br/>The movie is encumbered, however, by a distracting and irrelevant subplot involving Natalie Portman as Al Pacino's Lt. Vincent Hanna's stepdaughter and his collapsing third marriage to (the wasted) Diane Venora. It takes time and intensity away from the whipsaw action and crackerjack plot, weakening the movie's focus especially during the race to the ""inevitable"" denouement. <br/><br/>Often touted for being the only movie in which DeNiro and Pacino have ever appeared in a scene together, the famous scene fails to meet expectations. The two greats don't seem to have much chemistry. The conversation between their two characters starts with inanity and ends in sputtering, platitudinous machismo unworthy of neither the actors nor director. Pacino's delivery of ""Brother, you are going down"" will hardly go down as one of Mann's best lines--or Pacino's best deliveries.<br/><br/>I would give the movie a 10 except for the above-mentioned unnecessary family suds and half-develop subplot about a serial murderer who also happens to be a key character in McCauley's fall; this irrelevant filler distracts the viewer and weakens the dramatic structure and forces me to give it a 9.<br/><br/>And, a minor nitpick with the climactic bank robbery scene. The only hole in the writing is how Pacino's cops learn of the robbery. After one of McCauley's crew is locked in by police surveillance and has to bail out of the ""scores"", Mann expects us to believe that this crew of hardcore hijackers wouldn't alter their plans, the timing, the date of the bank job or simply abandon it. It's the one really false note in the main plot. But the spectacular results of Mann's plot device almost makes you forget about the contrived way it was brought about that false note. <br/><br/>Finally, one more subplot is left dangling and unresolved. McCauley's girlfriend, played by a subdued, sexy Amy Brennerman, is left, at the end, in a car with $5 million in stolen cash. And...nothing. Mann just leaves it and the character hanging. I mean, if you're looking at a dozen accessory after-the-fact murder charges, that's no minor thing. The time wasted with the schmaltz could have been used better here. Personally, I have to say, I would have booked. You'd have never talked yourself out of a prison sentence and no one even knows you're involved. Honestly what would YOU do? Mann doesn't give us his answer.<br/><br/>The ending leaves you nearly breathless and the beauty of the whole outweighs the flaws.<br/><br/>DVD transfer: 9.<br/><br/>Sound: 9<br/><br/>5.1 Remix Quality: 9<br/><br/>Packging: 6<br/><br/>Disk Image: 7"

Even though all the actors did a very good job, it is the interaction between De Niro as the robber and Al Pacino as the police officer that makes this movie really work. There can be no doubt about the fact that these two men have lifted this movie to a level that it would never have gotten to if they weren't in it. It's by far the best cop-robber movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>What I loved so much about this movie was the realism and the fact that the story and the characters were more important than the action shots. If this had been a movie with for instance Bruce Willis (I'm not even talking about Jean-Claude Van Damme, Sylvester Stallone,...), this movie would have been full of explosions, fighting and shooting and it would have lost all its power. But not with these two fine actors in it. OK, there is sometimes a lot of shooting, but when a car gets hit by a bullet, it doesn't just explode and fly through the air like you see in most movies; when they meet, they don't just start kicking each other... <br/><br/>The fact that you really get to know both men, during their work as well as in their private lives, makes this movie different from others. They aren't always the guys whose lives are perfect; who get whatever they like, just by blinking with their eyes; they even show real emotions... That just adds to the believability and that's exactly why I like this movie so much.<br/><br/>There will always be people who won't like this movie, for whatever reason, but personally I think this is one of the few movies in this genre that are actually worth a second and a third watch.

","Michael Mann's longstanding affair with Los Angeles crystallises into a beautiful canvas called ""Heat"". We are given to read some of the most personal thoughts of an individual who seems to have a pulsating passion for the grandiosity of the city, as well as its law breakers. But he doesn't love these individuals, rather enjoys observing their choices, their moves, and their troubled lives. Ultimately, the dichotomy between the good and the bad world is diminished, leaving the society  the law-breakers and the law-protectors  naked, with all its scruples and shortcomings.<br/><br/>Neil McCaluey (Robert de Niro) robs banks, with his entire arsenal of armed men. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is the policeman trying to catch him. But ""Heat"" is not an usual 'cat-and-mouse' story. Both men do what they do best, and the fact that their interests conflict with each other is a pure accident of nature. There is no invested interest from either side to harm the other, there are no personal gains from succeeding in their plans. The cat would almost willing let the mouse run around the house, until the latter would lose any interest in his mischievous behaviour. It is the social pressure however, the roles designated by man for man, that prevents the chase to stop, and it is precisely this issue which is taken under scrutiny by Mann.<br/><br/>""Heat"" excels in its exploration of institutions. Like in a chess game, every detail is given attention, every pawn is regarded as valuable, and the similarity of tactics and emotions on either camps does nothing but to solidify a universal theory of human action. The bank becomes a symbol of social values, and its insecure status (in need of protection) does nothing but to prove a lack of coherence in its construction. Building those values becomes as easy as stealing them, but both actions would still share the same intrinsic characteristics.<br/><br/>The film does not give any answers, but like any good piece of work it raises the right questions, and formulates them quite successfully. The only outcome is probably that the game will go on until one king would leave the chess-board voluntarily, but even them the success of the victor is questionable. Beyond the public war, there is always a private war, one driven by personal convictions, incited by the individuals who surround one's life. The desire to lead a good life, the desire to be loved, becomes the driving engine in this latter conflict. And neither of the protagonists are able to rise above the challenge.<br/><br/>Mann has constructed a complex work, that seems almost incapable of fault. Two outstanding performances from its two legendary leads, who have paved the history of gangster films, are complemented by some career bests from Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Diane Venora. But only Dante Spinotti's shadowy cinematography is able to take the spotlight from its creator. LA becomes the leading character, that is misunderstood, haunted, cherished, and destroyed by its own hand sweating of heat."

This guy is a master thief and killer he wouldn't have done what he did under any circumstances he was far too clever and the movie went to great lengths to point that out to its audience. If you are an avid movie watcher you will know immediately what I'm talking about. One of the things this movie does well like Collateral and The Professional is bring out the humanity in the characters both good sides and bad sides at the same time.

This gave a little more validity to the all-too-short restaurant scene between Pachino and DeNiro.<br/><br/>
All in all, if this was edited down to a simpler cop-n-robbers movie it might be one of the most successful ever. Since we're bogged down with Pachino's wife and the young Portman, DeNiro's girlfriend the main focus loses some of the edge that makes it so sharp. <br/><br/>On a side note, watching this again made me wish that Pachino still acted around people lower than his caliber (because he doesn't) and that DeNiro would pick better scripts to work on. I also wish Val Kilmer was still around great projects and Jon Voight would receive the attentions he's deserved his entire career. <br/><br/>So fast-forward through the family scenes and just watch the main plot and I'll bet you life it more.<br/><br/>As is, I give the movie an 8/10. With my editing, at least a nine, most likely a ten."

","This comes close to being a great film, but is stuck at being merely good. If it were re-edited to eliminate between 45 and 60 minutes of the touchy-feely relationship crap, its greatness would be complete. This is not the observation of a misogynist action-film maven -- romantic comedies are among my favorite films -- but of a movie lover who's upset by what appears to have been conscious insertion of structural flaws into the plot in order to appeal to a wider audience. The pacing of the action is wonderful until about an hour before the end. We then must digress into the personal lives of the central characters to see ""Awww, they do have relationships and lives outside of work."" We then get back to resolution of the film's primary conflict, and on to a satisfactory ending. This is not the film for that sort of thing, and it is flawed for that reason. It's still worth seeing, just leave the room about 2 hours in, make a sandwich, and return about 45 minutes later."

The film is tightly directed, but I found the storyline somewhat confusing in parts. One other criticism/question: when will directors resist the temptation to include gratuitous gunfights? This one went on for ages, it was impossible to tell who was killing who, and frankly I didn't give a damn.

"sackleywhistle","10","0","1","5 September 2003"," Possibly my favourite ever movie
","There is simply too much in this dense film to recommend, but I'll try.<br/><br/>First off, the much-talked about on-screen pairing of De Niro and Pacino for the first time. Kim Newman referred to the scenes that they share as ""padded"" and he may have a point, but whenever these two are on screen together, the screen crackles with pure talent and energy. The coffee shop is one of many highlights. Pacino is doing the best rendition of his shouty loud mouth, but at other times shows vulnerability and frustration. His Vincent Hanna is a man trying to make a go of his third marriage and keep his stepdaughter on the rails, failing to do so because his every waking minute is spent trying to think ahead of and snare those he pursues - murderers. Truly one of Pacino's best roles - up there with Dog Day Afternoon and Insomnia - a man trying to do something right and good, whose energy occasionally goes in the wrong directions. His scenes with Diane Venora - his wife, Justine - elevate the part from your average obsessed cop to something more tragic and weary.<br/><br/>De Niro owns this film. Neil MacAuley is ""the flipside"" to Pacino's character, an equally dedicated, forward thinking individual, more at home on the street doing his ""job"" than interacting on a human level. His mantra is simple: ""Do not allow anything to be in your life that you can't walk away from in thirty seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner"". Pacino is that heat and we see him try to allow things into his life, knowing that the time to run will be soon. He is trying to put things right, advising his colleagues to think twice before committing to jobs with him, knowing they have more to risk than him - namely, relationships and families - and trying to forge a relationship with a young bookstore clerk. MacAuley's hang up is time, dividing all his professional and personal deeds into priority depending on how much time he has left to get done what he needs to do. De Niro makes a return to the gravitas and presence he showed in films like Godfather II and Raging Bull, bringing out a lonely character who works by precision and can handle any given situation by switching from thinker to man of action at the drop of a hat. Again, one of his most accomplished performances, perhaps his last great role to date amid occasional misfires and mediocrity that has followed.<br/><br/>Also worthy of mention is Val Kilmer whose Chris is another finely etched tragic character. As accomplished a thief as MacAuley, married to the beautiful Charlene - Ashley Judd - he squanders his money on gambling, ruining his marriage. Kilmer plays Chris as a cold, efficient member of the crew, saving the display of emotion welling up inside him for his exit from the film which is genuinely heart-breaking. The rest of the cast is filled with recognisable faces all doing sterling work in smaller roles, notably Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Kevin Gage, William Fichtner, Danny Trejo and Dennis Haysbert in a small but touching part.<br/><br/>Micheal Mann directs with a combination of the glossy architectural style which marks out his earlier films (Thief, Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans) and a more rugged, hand-held style for the excellent action sequences. The centrepiece action sequence which breaks the film into two halves is one of the most exciting, deftly handled action scenes ever filmed. Every bullet is accounted for and it is not merely an excuse for a shootout - it is the culmination of all the efforts of the characters involved up to that point, making the casualties and the impact of the events that much more dramatically involving. There is a feeling that the whole film is Mann's baby, a project which he has nurtured and designed to perfection. Every second is perfect within context. The look of the film is not overly stylised, but perfectly framed. The camera glides when helicopters or cars are speeding past and jolts when shots are being fired and characters are frantically running around. Yet everything has a sense of precision. Watching the cops and robbers firing at each other in formations, its hard to say who is the better trained. When Pacino's task force catch up with the crew on an early break-in, we see only what we need to see, from the points of view of Pacino and De Niro respectively. Likewise we are given enough information about every character, no matter how small, to understand their motivations and their lifestyles. <br/><br/>The other element which helps elevate this film even more is the score and soundtrack. Switching between the beautiful send-off theme, Moby and the machine-like beat of the bank robbery theme, every note works to highlight the emotion or impact of its given scene. Whether it be Pacino chasing across LA in first a helicopter then a car to pull De Niro over, the robbery itself or the much debated but - for me - pitch perfect ending, the score is a delight, often very subtle. Elliot Goldenthal deserves to be ranked with Hans Zimmer and Howard Shore among the finest composers working in studio scores for his work on this film alone.<br/><br/>An example of intelligent, exciting, dramatic and moving cinema and one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made. Do yourself a favour and see it now."

The ending is satisfying, but sad as well. There is also the memorable bank robbing scene in this movie that is one of the best action sequences in cinematic history. The music is crisp and fits like a glove with the tone of the film, especially the end credits song by Moby.

","I really liked Heat, but had to overlook flaws in logic...especially at the end of the movie.

They even showed a stretcher being taken inside.<br/><br/>2) When Pacino spots De Niro and starts to come toward him, De Niro begins to run away. But De Niro's girlfriend acts sad. We (the movie audience) know the part about him leaving in 30 seconds. But she doesn't. So if she's sad, then the question is: what would she prefer him to do? To kill Pacino (and dozens of other police officers who were on the scene)? I think most girlfriends would want their boyfriend to run rather than to kill police officer(s).<br/><br/>3) Which brings me to the next flaw: how many women would go to New Zealand with a guy under these circumstances: - She's only had a few dates with him - She's very close to her family - She discovers that he lied to her and that he has been a criminal all his life - She discovers he killed a bunch of police officers that day<br/><br/>4) De Niro doesn't pick a better hiding place in the final confrontation with Pacino.<br/><br/>5) Pacino doesn't radio to the rest of his team to help find De Niro.

"glowtube01","Null","0","1","18 December 2002"," How can you people not say this is a great movie?
","In my opinion, this movie handles a good deal of the things I'm hoping to see when I lean back into the chair - it has action, but is not driven by it, and I would not call it an action movie. It illustrates in a good way the interpersonal relationships of people torn by their calls in life, and how two men on different sides of the law can come to respect each other. I didn't expect this to come out good, but the meeting, and the respect growing between Vincent (Pacino) and Neil (De Niro) is skillfully done.<br/><br/>A very big part of this credit is due to the people behind it allowing the story to take its time to unfold, resulting in a movie 170 minutes long - this is a good thing. It gives you time to get to know the characters, and the plot and story rarely seem hastened, as is the case with a lot of movies nowadays.<br/><br/>The length also, of course, allows for the buildup in suspense, another one of the Heat's strong sides - from Vincent and Neil not knowing about each other, via being brought to each other's attention and meeting over a coffee, to the inevitable showdown in the end.<br/><br/>And this brings me to the big downside of Heat - the ending. Suddenly a lid is put on all the suspense, and you realize that like with 99 out of 100 Hollywood movies, it has to end with the good guys winning the day and the bad guys getting what's coming to them.<br/><br/>In one way, this could be argued for: Neil ends up breaking his own rule about not letting anything or anyone get in the way of his escape when he can, as he puts it, ""spot the heat around the corner."" But mayhap his newfound love and his final decision to go for revenge rather than safety brings about his end.<br/><br/>His partner Chris (Val Kilmer) on the other hand, makes the decision to leave his wife and child behind and flee (or at least lay low), when he finds out it isn't safe to meet up with them - and as far as we know, he gets away.<br/><br/>Still though, this does little to diminish the over-all predictable element of the movie. It may not be a particularly happy ending for anyone, as all who survive have had to give something up to achieve their goals, but as so often, the hunter gets his prey, and case closed. In my opinion, this is what limits Heat and keeps it on the ""definitely a good one""-level, while falling short of - to borrow a line from ""Swordfish"" - pushing the envelope.<br/><br/>-glowtube"

Unfortunately, about an hour into the movie I was ready to fall asleep.  I am usually upset when I see the scenes that were deleted from great movies when I watch them on DVD, but this movie was the opposite.

It has fast cars, shootouts in the streets, four consecutive love interests, hockey masks and even a blue light filter.  Oh and let's not forget the mandatory one-liner that is in this case repeated three times.  Michael Mann must have been thinking that the presence of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro on opposite sides of the law would make a guaranteed hit.  He couldn't have been further from the truth.  Just like 2001's ""The Score"", which paired De Niro with Marlon Brando in a film similar in content and tone, this movie was geared to disappoint from the outset.  Character development is ankle-deep, but the worst part about it is that Mann tries so hard.  Had the film been merely an hour and a half gangster shoot-em-up flick, it would have been bearable, but Mann's film is a pseudo-character drama, soap-operaish at times, unbelievably excruciating at others.  This is not to mention, of course, the plot impossibilities that one comes to expect in this ubiquitous genre.  How does De Niro escape so many situations in which he is perceivably doomed?  For a director to request suspension of disbelief from his audience he must in turn reward them for their loyalty.  But Heat was little more than a self-indulgent waste of three hours."

Michael Mann seems totally comfortable letting the camera rest on someone or something for longer than most other modern directors can tolerate, because he knows that this not just a popcorn action movie.<br/><br/>
The actual story is not the most original, but it is wholly enjoyable, especially when so many good performers on screen to deliver their lines.

","I saw this movie when it first came out because I, like most people, couldn't wait to see Pacino and DeNiro finally act, FACE TO FACE, in a movie together. And I also figured that the story was probably poignant and powerful if it was able to attract those 2 heavyweight actors. So my expectations going in were very high; when the closing credits were scrolling up the screen, I said to myself ""Hmm, well, okay, it was good, but was that the best Michael Mann could do???""<br/><br/>You see, any movie starring PACINO and DENIRO can't just be good--it has to be freakin' AMAZING, EXCELLENT, RIVETING. And this movie was none of those things. Let's face it, ""Heat"" is really just a cops-and-robbers TV show padded up with fancy, swirling cinematography, a high-wattage cast (also including Voight, Kilmer, Judd, Portman, Levine, etc.), a big budget, and epic treatment. How many times have we seen movies about an obsessive cop going after a hardened, seen-it-all bank robber??<br/><br/>Mann tries to disguise his trite, cliched story by trying to have us believe his version is somehow ""different"" or deeper by providing subplots involving Pacino's unfulfilled wife, DeNiro's tentative relationship with Amy Brenneman (whose character is the least interesting and most thankless of all the roles), Kilmer's hot/cold marriage, and other little subplots that seem to exist for no reason other than to create filler so that this simple cops-and-robbers story can seem Epic, Grand. The problem with these subplots is that each and every one of them are not particularly compelling or original: Pacino's wife wants him to spend more time with her, DeNiro wants to settle down with Brenneman but not before one last score, Kilmer's wife decides not to rat on him because...gasp...she loves him so much.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--I liked this movie more than I disliked it, but I'm being very hard on it because I feel that Mann didn't take full advantage of the opportunity he had. I feel like he was given the ingredients for a cake, and instead he gave us a cookie. And to add insult to injury, there's only ONE substantial scene between Pacino and DeNiro. Hey, that would've been fine if the movie was 1 hour and 40 minutes long, but the movie is 3 HOURS LONG, and the best Mann could do was give us a 5-MINUTE scene with two of the most legendary actors of our time???<br/><br/>There are at least half a dozen writer/directors who could've done the Pacino-DeNiro union better justice than Mann, especially in regard to the writing. (In fact, Mann went the lazy route and simply dusted off an old script he wrote years ago--""LA Takedown""--and updated it. How dare he!!) Mann's script is full of cliches and wooden dialogue. Can you imagine what a more talented writer/director like Tarantino could've done with a Pacino-DeNiro pairing?<br/><br/>So once again, I'll say: the movie was good, but not the ""masterpiece"" that a lot of people have proclaimed. For me, what makes this movie watchable is not the story, but the performances of the two leads. Some people have said that DeNiro's performance is better than Pacino's, but I think that both performances are equally worthy. Yes, Pacino's acting does get a little weird in a couple of places, but his character was the harder character to portray. Actors rarely admit this, but playing the Villain is easier than playing the Good Guy. Good Guys are boring...unless you try to give them texture and added dimensions to make them just as eye-catching as the Villains.<br/><br/>All I can do at this point is hope that Pacino and DeNiro agree to act together again in another, better movie."

","I really like Michael Mann's ""return"" to his Miami Vice roots with this entertaining police-drama. While many dismiss it because of its length, I contest that it moves quicker than any three hour plus film I've seen in recent years. Pacino plays the hot shot ""Sonny Crocket-like"" cop on the hunt of a master thief and criminal, played by Robert DeNiro in a great plum of a role. Mann's film is interesting because like the classic 1980's drama, it shows both sides of the story. The cops and the robbers. It shows that outside of their work, there is more to life than busting people or killing people or money. DeNiro's Neil has nothing because he's never known anything but treachery and fear. Pacino's Vincent is the same thing. Failed marriages. Failed opportunities. All that both of these men have is their work and they're damn good at it.<br/><br/>The film moves at a super pace. Every cast member has their moments to shine and there's plenty of guest stars to this drama: It's nice to see Jon Voight again. Ashley Judd and Val Kilmer are both fine. Michael Madsen is menacing as a member of Neil's gang. This film has all the elements of good drama, tough action and edge of your seat suspense, with a pleasing conclusion. It's also nice to see two giants like Pacino and DeNiro go head to head with one another. Their coffeeshop scene is perfect. Wes Studi, Mykelti Williamson and Tone Loc co-star."

I must have counted a dozen occassions where DeNiro could have safely ambushed Pacino. The earlier film LA Takedown, which is almost scene-for-scene and line-for-line the same as Heat, has a better ending I think, more true to the De Niro character anyway. Why Mann changed it for the implausible ending of Heat I can't conceive.<br/><br/>Having just watched the two films within a day of each other, it is amazing how close they are; even down to the cut-aways, close-ups and zooms. The scene in the diner and then outside when Waingrow is about to get shot but disappears is identical in every way, as is the scene when Patrick/Neil meets the girl when reading a book (except in Takedown she designs album covers and in Heat it's CD covers!).<br/><br/>The bank heist shoot-out in Heat is one of the best scenes in cinema history. Wonderfully put together and filmed, the violence is shocking rather than merely exciting.

","Everyone in this movie is Ultra-cool and Ultra Ultra-professional. Pacino as usual yells his way through the movie, Deniro as usual is an Ultra Ultra Cool Cop-killer just seeking a peaceful life in Big-time Crime and his buddies are semi ultra cool cop-killers just seeking a normal life in big-time crime and the chicks are the unfaithful mob who who keep our heroes at their most masculine.<br/><br/>I could never get comfortable with Voights hair do, Deniros is extremely predictable, Pacino is the macho ultra-professional and over-divoted cop, Portmans does not have much luck with mortality or a punctual father (it was a delight to see her 30 seconds of celluloid anyway though), if they want to get into parental psychology issue they have to be a little less over-dramatic and a little more explanatory. Wane Grow and the kitchen boss we ofcourse hate and relish doing so. A grown man actually cries because he has to take out the trash and basically handle the gritty work in a kitchen, (people a lot younger and alot older have to put up with that crap for years) his wife ofcourse is the 2D figure that announces having pride in him.<br/><br/>Pacino watches his own friends and comrades even and even colleagues he did not know get shot down, because of and BY Deniro but still manages to hold (SPOILERS RIGHT HERE NOW) his hand in dying moments, in some sign of professional courtisy. A beautiful but tragically lonely chick finds out that she is dating a murderer and criminal but for the sake of his ""love"" chooses to aid his escape and even live out her days with him, another example of cheap emotion. My summary is all that need be said. If you want to see a style and then some comic book in play with some thrills and sweat revenge on the side then her you are but otherwise look elseware.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"golosadis","Null","0","1","30 November 2003"," One of the best films of the nineties
","Hollywood film with a depth is not something that we can see every day. All is here, in this Michael Mann's brilliant epic film, gangsters, drama and romance, but nothing is pathetic or shallow. There is some somber, elegiac feeling throughout the film, intensified by great use of music, that future offers no hope for the main characters, neither for gangsters nor for the policeman (Vincent Hanna brilliantly played by Pacino), regardless of their plans or actions. Their destiny is sealed and they can do nothing about it. That is the same destiny that forces Carlito towards death in De Palma's ""Carlito's Way"" or Peckinpah's heroes towards suicidal bloodbath in ""The Wild Bunch"". As if the bare fact that they do possess some code of honour (they help each other during the relentless shoot-out on the streets, De Niro risks his potential happiness in order to revenge for treason) makes them more vulnerable and unadapted to living in a modern world, and pushes them towards the inevitable bitter end. Loneliness is the key word here. "" I am alone, but not lonely "" says De Niro in one scene, but we know that is not the truth, and he knows that too. Action scenes are perfectly made (especially the one after failed bank robbery), sound is crisp, use of music imaginative and photography (Dante Spinotti) brilliant. Sorry, no happy endings here, no special digital effects. Some lovers of pure entertainment might be disappointed, and think that film is a bit overlong, that it lacks action and is too dark. Well, this film certainly is not Hollywood mainstream production, nor it pretends to be a crowd-pleaser. This is one of the best films of the nineties."
"gkearns","6","0","4","22 January 2002"," A war of gods
","***SPOILERS AHEAD*** The two principal players, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) were gods, of course. Vincent was the God of Light, and Neil the God of Darkness. In the famous restaurant confrontation this was spelled out unequivocally. Neil (Darkness) would let nothing or no one stand in the way of achieving his ends; Vincent (Light) would let nothing stand in the way of his stopping Neil from hurting innocent people - that defined their purposes. Neil would never attach himself to a relationship (with a mortal) that he couldn't walk away from with thirty seconds notice; Vincent would never let love (of a mortal) stand above his work (*SPOILER* in the end, Neil turned his back on Eady; and Vincent walked away from Justine and Lauren during their time of greatest need) - that defined their stature as gods: gods cannot let their affairs be affected by mortals. Even their battles were Olympian: that bank robbery was like World War II. As the story of two gods at war, what was there to be concerned about? One would win, one would lose. *SPOILERS AHEAD* So equally godlike and equally strong were they that the final outcome was determined by luck: the sudden brilliance of the landing lights that outlined Neil's shadow. Their brotherhood as gods was also reflected in the end scene as Vincent held Neil's hand. The waiting and hurt Eady lived, died, cried, raged? No matter; this was a story of gods. Lauren lived, died, broke down, recovered, attempted suicide again? No matter; this was a story of gods. Charlene lived, died, went to jail, cried, built a better new life? No matter; this was a story of gods (and sub-gods, in her case). So, once their godliness and purpose were defined in the restaurant, I didn't really care that much for either Vincent or Neil. But overall, I really liked the movie, because Eady (leaving a gently secure life to fly off to Hawaii with an outlaw), Justine (sleeping with a nobody just to get Vincent to care), Lauren (attempting suicide in her step-father's apartment), Charlene (protecting her flawed godlet for some deeply passionate principle) were real humans with real, profound, interesting stories to tell. They're what made this three hour movie truly worth while sitting through. Vincent and Neil were gods, but these women were saints; and, as I see it, they carried the movie.<br/><br/>For Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, this movie didn't really stretch their acting talents. Playing gods, they could show no human vulnerabilities, and feel no human emotions, except anger - which only required them to yell or smash a guy's head against a wall. On the other hand, the female actors were involved in roles of real human drama: the roles they played required them to portray emotions, unreasoned loyalty, vulnerabilities, personal hopes, disappointments, and hurt; and they did fantastically well with the challenge. So kudos for a job well done should go to the ensemble of Amy Brenneman (Eady), Ashley Judd (Charlene), and Diane Veneron (Justine). And a special note of appreciation should go to Natalie Portman for her brief, but electrifying, poignant portrayal of the brittle, hopeful, hurting adolescent Lauren."

","Michael Mann comes back to the form he presented in the much-underrated Thief for this unrelenting look at the good and bad guys of L.A. Michael DeNiro gives one of his miraculous performances as a bank robber with soul, friends, loyalties, and passions. Al Pacino doesn't have as much room to act in, but his street-wise cop is completely convincing. (Spoiler?) The centerpiece shootout in the middle of the afternoon has to be seen to be believed. I finally didn't give this a perfect rating because, despite the pyrotechnics, the plot is as hoary and cliched as Little Caesar. But it sure is a fun ride while it lasts."

A film that redefines the `cops and robbers' story, contains 18 heavily developed characters, numerous social and philosophical issues, a 25 minute shootout sequence, and of course Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as the main cast. With great photography and storytelling, Michael Mann (famous for producing Miami Vice) has directed a masterpiece known as Heat, a crime drama far superior than any other.<br/><br/>With fantastic performances by Pacino and De Niro, as well as Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, and Natalie Portman, we are taken into the two lives struggling to survive in the streets of L.A. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a robbery homicide detective obsessed with tracking down a team of professional thieves. He's willing to bribe other criminals, break rules, and alienate his family in order to catch his prey. In a scene between his wife, he tells her he won't tell her about the job; `You want me to tell you about some crack head who micro waved his baby because it was crying to load, Â…no, I have to hold onto my angst, I preserve it to stay on the edge.' Neil McCauley (De Niro) is a highly skilled and cunning thief bent on succeeding his final score, and moving on to a better life, but willing to leave everything behind; `Don't let anything come into your life you can't walk out on in thirty seconds or less.'<br/><br/>Among a battle of wits and skill, Hanna and McCauley strike each other equally with moves of advance and diversion, creating a great game of cat and mouse. In this situation, the cat and mouse truly respect each other, admiring each other's skillful moves, like two opponents at a game of chess. During one scene, Hanna chases down McCauley, but with no evidence against him, Hanna simply offers a cup of coffee to McCauley, resulting in a fantastic conversation between Pacino and De Niro, the cat and mouse revealing their respect for each other, but letting each other know they will do what they have to, to get what they want. Both characters are deeply influenced by their life experiences. Both are from the streets and used to dysfunctional families. McCauley doesn't know his father or brother, and has been in prison, resulting in his career choice and willingness to leave everything behind for it. Hanna was in the Marines, has worked the streets as a detective for years, and has three ex-wives (not including his present wife), underlining his love for the job over everything else.<br/><br/>Every character has their own deep story, Kilmer and Judd's marriage and son, Sizemore's wife, Portman's suicidal tendencies; many side-stories that help the viewer follow the story more passionately. The characters are so well written we can't decide whether to root for Hanna or McCauley, more so since their Pacino and De Niro. There's no way you want either one of them to lose. The end scene, the most passionate scene, is when Hanna catches up with McCauley in an airport runway field. The runway lights blink, and McCauley attempts to use them to illuminate Hanna when he runs around a building, but the lights work both ways, and give off McCauley's shadow. Hanna shoots him, but as McCauley is dying, Hanna holds his hand in comfort. They respected each other, even liked each other, but their jobs and passions chose a different route for their lives. The film is one the greatest, a wonderful musical score, tremendous acting, numerous stars, great photography, deep story, and suspenseful action sequences. A definite 5 out of 5 stars."

"urbanstruggle","Null","0","1","23 January 2001"," A film worth seeing, if just for the Pacino/De Niro coffee break scene
","The biggest reason you should justifiably sit through this 2 hour and 50 minute film is to watch a scene about half way through the film where Pacino and De Niro's characters sit down to have a cup of coffee together.  The first half of ""Heat"", a crime caper film by Micheal Mann, is Pacino and De Niro playing a game of cat and mouse.  Pacino plays a veteran police lieutenant and De Niro plays a veteran high stakes thief.  The scene is one of those magical cinematic moments that only come every so often. Pacino and De Niro, legends, masters of their acting trade, acting together on screen for the first time, at last!  Mann's casting of the two to play opposing cop and robber was a masterful choice.  The impact of the scene where the two momentarily put aside their differences to come to terms with the fact that they truly do need each other to do their own jobs goes above and beyond the film itself.  It's as though the scene was two masters of the trade acknowledging each other for the first time.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is good, but it never quite lives up to the validity and authenticity of that scene.  Mann tries too hard to make this film an ""Epic"" in the lines of ""The Godfather"", much in the same way Brian De Palma tried with ""Scarface"".  The film is a top notch crime caper film with great, well thought out action scene's, wonderful cinematography and a plot that rings with authenticity (which gives it a one-up on ""Scarface"" right there), but much of the film seems forced.  I wish filmmakers would realize that ""Epic"" films are a happening and not a pre-fabricated film made with the intention of being remembered as an ""Epic"" (for recent examples, see ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"").  While ""Heat"" certainly is a lot more than a contrived wannabe-epic, it is, at the most, a very good crime film (apart from the amazing coffee break scene) no more, no less.  I give it a 7.5 out of 10."
"Caroseli","7","0","1","29 October 1998"," Love and Obsession Cops and Robbers
","Far from being a familiar cops and robbers movie, ""Heat"" is a story of two men's obsessions with being the best at what they do, and the price each one pays for it. Although there are scenes which tend to drag a little bit, there isn't a character, sub-plot or relationship in the film which is even remotely boring, which is much more than I can say about more traditional ""epic love stories."" Visually, also, the film is a treat--every shot and every set comes to life in the eye of Dante Spinotti's camera."

","Directed by Michael Mann, Heat is a action chase character drama that tries to be everything and ends up being bits of each..An absolutely outstanding cast though with Al Pacino as the cop on the chase of the big heist, Robert DeNiro as the leader of the bad guys (this is the only movie where both Pacino and DeNiro, arguably the two greatest actors of the past 50 years, appear on screen together) also with Val Kilmer Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, and Natalie Portman. This movie is a good movie with excellent characters who come to life. There are some memorable scenes..DeNiro and Pacino drinking coffee in a diner, Ashley Judd as Pacino's wife and Natalie Portman who does a great job as the step daughter whose life is falling apart.Overall a good movie but it seems to fall short of the lofty expectations.. on a scale of one to ten..a 6"

","Michael Mann makes great movies (THIEF, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS) and not-so-great movies (MANHUNTER).  HEAT falls into the latter.  Boasting one extraordinary performance (Robert DeNiro), three terrific ones (Al Pacino, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman) and one very good one (Ashley Judd), HEAT is, unfortunately, Mann's most poorly paced film.  Much of the problem lay with the stupid script.  The writers would have us believe the ""best"" armed robbery team in America would meet in a public restraunt after a multimillion dollar robbery at which guards were murdered, and the leader would exact his frustrations on a team member whom ""screwed up"".  We are to believe that DeNiro would ""cap"" a ""screw up"" on a public street, when he could have ""done"" him in an isolated location. We would believe that an experienced fence would order the ""hit"" on DeNiro without researching his team, when DeNiro knows where the fence ""lives?""  We would believe that DeNiro would keep the team together after the ""screw up"" escapes, rather than having them disban, track the guy down and ""tie up loose ends?""  This is the dumbest bunch of professional crooks I'VE ever seen.<br/><br/>Even the music, usually Mann's trademark, is tired and forgettable.<br/><br/>

","A fascinating portrait of two obsessed careerists and their neglected loved ones in a world of high-stakes crime.  Robert De Niro plays a brilliant thief and Al Pacino plays an equally clever detective out to track him down. Both men are highly principled and protective of their crew, but each is addicted to their chosen professions to the point that nothing is allowed to get in the way.  Michael Mann delineates the alienation felt by the detective's family and the thief's girlfriend in scintillating dialogue and rich performances.   The overall effect is haunting and stayed with me many hours after the film was over.  Quite separate from the cops and robbers story, it reflects our modern age of success-at-all-costs and tallies the damage left behind in broken lives."
