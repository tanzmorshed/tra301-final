"FlickJunkie-2","7","55","69","22 February 2001"," Insubstantial but highly entertaining
","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.<br/><br/>This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is ""Flashdance"" lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous `Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.<br/><br/>Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.<br/><br/>The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.<br/><br/>This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 7/10.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  He knows how to push our buttons."
"shulma2002","Null","79","104","28 May 2004"," Coyote Ugly Was A ""Feel Good"" Film
","I was not disappointed with ""Coyote Ugly"". It made me feel good and we need this kind of film these days with all that's going-on.It was no worse than ""Flashdance"" or ""Footloose"" which also had little storyline and average acting. I enjoyed it and it was what I had expected.Many of you gave it negative criticisms; what did they expect from a film about a young girl coming to the city? This was a simple story about a young shy girl with dreams trying to make it in show business; which is hard if you don't have the right connections.The dance numbers and bar scene were very realistic. As a New Yorker, I was happy to see that she wasn't mugged or worse as many films about New York portray.I'd like a sequel."
"Bondo20","8","81","113","21 July 2001"," Heartwarming story overcomes sappy bits.
","Based on the true story about the crazy female run bar in New York City, Coyote Ugly becomes surprisingly believable despite the usual Hollywood bits.  The story follows Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) as she moves from small town New Jersey to the city to become a songwriter.  Through her misfortunes she meets boyfriend Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) and the Coyotes and learns from each of them to overcome the stage fright that threatens to ruin her dreams.<br/><br/>Many moments are sappy or overly dramatic but the majority is enthralling as all the characters are solidly built.  The girls all have their own character but aren't so strictly chained to it that they become merely symbols instead of people.  While the females may be on the screen the most, the two supporting males Kevin and William Sanford (John Goodman) provide the most heartwarming scenes.  Goodman's performance provides subtle humor while his character struggles through the conflict of his daughter leaving and his desire to see her succeed.  For an actor who has put in so many great performances, this one still manages to be one of his best.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly offers something enjoyable to everyone.  Guys obviously will enjoy the attractive girls and the provocative dancing while girls can enjoy the strong female characters, each of which won't take crap from any of the men that surround them.  Parents can enjoy the side story of the conflict between Violet and her father.  Another feature to enjoy is the fabulous music with four songs performed by LeAnn Rimes with some smaller groups as well.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly crosses the unusual boundary of being both an exciting, fast-paced movie that gets the adrenaline flowing and a sensitive story with strong characters and brilliant acting to get the mind working.  The result is a thoroughly rewarding movie experience."

"bopdog","8","31","41","5 August 2000"," Familiar story still has great energy, and works for me!!!
","Not bad, not bad. I read reviews that criticized the cliche-ness of this movie, and I can see their point. At times the plot made the characters a little bit annoying. But hey-- story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal ""truths,"" or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.<br/><br/>This movie is interesting-- it is engaging, and even touching at times. I DID care about the characters throughout the story. I wanted to see how things would work out for them, and I wanted them to win. Sure, the plot is kind of predictable-- but the energy kept the theme in the forefront, and I AM interested in the theme presented here-- love, taking risks, courage, and all of that. The women actors were wonderful-- hot, sure, but also outrageous in an innocent kind of way. I had the sense that none of the characters in the movie, even the raunchy extras in the bar scenes, was belittled. I suspected the writers, director, cast, etc., had a basic affection for their subjects and topic.<br/><br/>The dancing was great-- I noted ""dancing doubles"" in the credits for all of the girls-- and the bar tricks and stunts were fun. I enjoyed pretending that those stunts were even possible, and that they wouldn't have killed 7 people the first night they were tried in a real bar in real life. I gave this one an ""8"" out of 10. Go see it-- you'll like it!"
"simplysoda_19f","8","26","37","3 January 2006"," Coyote Ugly is the best bar-flick since Cocktail
","I love ""Coyote Ugly"", even though it seems critics/reviewers had mixed opinions. I thought it was the best bar-flick since ""Cocktail"". If you haven't seen ""Cocktail"", it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender, and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly, you have Violet (Piper Perabo) who comes to NYC to become a singer/songwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos, so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called, ""Coyote Ugly"". The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello), Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade, and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singer/songwriter or not, because that would wreck the movie, but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally, I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10, because it has an amazing story, memorable characters and a lot of great lines, but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song, ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"". So, if you love bar-flicks like ""Cocktail"" you'll love ""Coyote Ugly""."
"Gustavo Rodriguez","10","76","124","6 February 2001"," An interesting, excellent surprise.
","I have to say that when I saw the trailer I thought this was going to be a film about some half naked women and some people drinking a lot. But, when the film ended I have to say I was really surprised. A good surprise. Some people will probably disagree with me but this is not a film about nudity or something like that, it is a film about following your dreams, about leaving home searching for something real. I think Piper Perabo is excellent in her role as Violet, who actually sings some of the songs in the film. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to have a great time."
"TheLittleSongbird","3","10","13","18 July 2016"," Great soundtrack. The film? Not so much
","In many ways, actually, 'Coyote Ugly' from personal opinion didn't even come close to good.<br/><br/>Feel-good films when done right are very entertaining and heart-warming. However 'Coyote Ugly', while with its moments, has too many faults that are at worst ineptly done to succeed as a feel-good film.<br/><br/>Starting with 'Coyote Ugly's' good things, the best asset by far is the soundtrack, which is quite brilliant and deserved a far better film. The LeAnn Rimes numbers ""The Right Kind of Wrong"", ""Please Remember"" and ""Can't Fight the Moonlight"" particularly stand out of the songs, as does the classic Elvis Presley standard ""Can't Help Falling in Love"", one of the most beautiful all-time great romantic songs. The score is very nice too.<br/><br/>While the acting wasn't great at all, there is one good performance and it is that of John Goodman, who is an entertaining and amiably likable father figure. Some of the camera work is quite smart too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, while the music itself is of really high-quality it does feel too constant with little break and like there could have been less, there were definitely scenes that would have benefited much more without it or at least from music with a less intrusive approach. Too many scenes feel like amateurishly edited and lazily choreographed, with a lot of gloss and either being overblown or lacking energy, music videos, which is a huge problem in a film full of them and with a wafer-thin story that feels like an excuse to string these scenes together.<br/><br/>Also hugely problematic is how cliché-ridden and stereotypical it is. Not just the story, which has every done to death cliché in the book that everything feels forced and predictable with ridiculous and laughable dramatic elements with little chemistry and no substance or emotional connection whatsoever. We are also talking about the characters in a film loaded with every possible stereotype, another problem being that apart from Cammie and Bill very few of them are likable, with a difficult to relate to protagonist, and some add nothing to the film, Maria Bello's character is particularly useless and only there because the film ""needed"" the obligatory boss stereotype.<br/><br/>Goodman aside, the performances are not great, or even good, at all. Adam Garcia is particularly bad, with an acting ability so limited it's almost non-existent and he feels out of place too. He doesn't even work as eye candy that well. Piper Perabo tries hard but too often lacks charisma and doesn't display a wide range of emotions with sudden shifts in character that undermine the character's growth. Everybody else is bland or annoying though Izabella Miko has moments of charm. Dialogue is painfully trite and thin throughout, while the direction lacks panache and flash. The film looks alright, especially in the colours, locations and the camera work, which show a lot of style, but cheapened by too much gloss and amateurish editing.<br/><br/>Overall, there is a great soundtrack but 'Coyote Ugly' falls far short. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
"michaelRokeefe","7","29","51","10 July 2001"," Belly up to the bar and hang on.
","Violet Sanford(Piper Perabo)wants to avoid a dead end life and decides to leave New Jersey for the big city. In NYC, she is determined to be a hit song writer. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job slinging beer and dancing on the bar with the other ""Coyotes"" at the popular watering hole Coyote Ugly. This is very titilating and an eye full to watch. The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello, who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast: Adam Garcia, John Goodman, Melanie Lynskey, Izabella Miko, Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes, who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes, the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band, Lenny Kravitz, Def Leppard, Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once."

The story of this movie is very simple, and it's about a girl called Violet from New Jersey,who wants to be a singer and go to New York to try her luck. Once in the Apple City, she has many problems finding someone to be interested in her music, and goes to work in a bar called ''Coyote Ugly'', where the girls (bar maids) besides giving the clients drinks also do sensual dances.

","I couldn't have been more pleased with ""Coyote Ugly"".  Being a huge New York fan, I loved the setting and atmosphere of the film.  Piper Perabo was excellent as Violet and has a very promising film career, and Adam Garcia who play Kevin O'Donnel is my new fave actor.  The songs, performed by LeAnn Rimes and written by Diane Warren could not have been any better (especially ""But I Do Love You"").  The trailers (although they are what made me want to see this film!!!) mislead you greatly, and I think that's why critics panned this film.  The advertising leads you to belive there's no plot further than a bunch of scantily clad chicks shaking it on a bar, but the movie has heart and substance and is very positive in inspiring people to follow their dreams.

Eventually though, she sheds her dignity and decides to mix drinks and light the bar on fire like the best of us.

","The Bottom Line Coyote Ugly was made for boys between the ages of 13 and 16. One of the worst movies of the year.<br/><br/>Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.<br/><br/>Not impressed with this one by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Con Air,"" etc)<br/><br/>Piper Perabo (""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"") -- a wide-eyed beauty from central casting -- is the movie's generic ingenue, a girl named Violet from small town New Jersey who moves to New York to pursue her dreams of being a songwriter. Of course, even though she grew up just down the turnpike from Manhattan, she's as naive as a farmer's daughter and learns the hard way that peddling your demo tape to snide receptionists at record label offices isn't going to get you anywhere in the Big City.<br/><br/>So instead of becoming an instant music biz success, Violet finds herself working at the meat packing district's wildest road house, Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>Staffed by 102-lb. sexpots who habitually shake their stuff atop the bar in size two leather pants and tank tops, the joint is packed wall-to-wall every night with hooting, drooling patrons that the girls tease like pole-dancers to coax drinks into them and money out of them.<br/><br/>Written in Screenwriting 101 style, packed with every New York City cliché in the book (her dank, dingy flat is broken into her first week in town), and overflowing with young girls in wonderbras while dancing, the first half of ""Coyote Ugly"" plays like it was penned by a 13-year-old boy who just discovered masturbation. For the second half, the script must have been handed off to a 13-year-old girl who thinks Britney Spears is the greatest musical talent the world has ever known, because the rest of the movie is launched by a ""Face it dad, I'm not your little girl anymore"" speech and built around Violet overcoming stage fright and chasing her dream of selling bubble-gum pop songs - aided, of course, by the charming encouragement of a handsome boy (Australian actor Adam Garcia) who just knows she can do it!<br/><br/>And yes, Violet sings. A lot. It's an endless source of unintentional comedy because when she's slinking across the bar at Coyote Ugly, singing along to the jukebox (each Coyote girl has a gimmick, that's hers), Perabo warbles in her own, weak and gritty voice. But when belting out one of the acoustic Lilith Faire-lite ditties she hopes to sell some day, suddenly she's a honey-voiced songbird, courtesy of audio looping by jailbait country music star LeAnn Rimes (who has a cameo in the finale).<br/><br/>Another hearty laugh stems from the fact that ""Coyote Ugly"" takes place in a picturesquely gritty, fantasy version of NYC in which a 21-year-old cutie pie bartender can walk down an alley at 4 a.m. in a 15-inch skirt and knee-highs, counting her tips without a care in the world.<br/><br/>On the respectability front, the picture's one saving grace is John Goodman, who is blue collar perfection as Violet's modest, toll-collector pop.<br/><br/>But even though ""Coyote Ugly"" is tedious, obvious and badly staged, it does have an infectious spirit. That's hardly enough to save this one aimed at the can't-wait-to-be-21 crowd."

"Wuchakk","5","4","6","18 March 2017"," Fun and snappy, but too predictable with little depth
","Released in 2000, ""Coyote Ugly"" is a drama starring Piper Perabo as a singer/composer who leaves her home in nearby New Jersey with her dad (John Goodman) to try her hand at the music business in the big city. For money, she gets a gig at a nightclub hotspot where the female workers dance on top of the bar for entertainment, amongst other things, like dumping ice on customers now and then, spraying others with the soda gun and occasionally pouring liquor on the bar and setting it aflame (Why Sure!). Maria Bello plays the owner of the bar while Adam Garcia plays the girl's potential beau.<br/><br/>Perabo plays a thoroughly winsome heroine and the movie's fun with a kinetic soundtrack (with, for example, ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" playing twice). After the first act though the movie never really takes off and the story becomes predictably bland, albeit still entertaining.<br/><br/>While the movie wasn't a big hit, it was moderately successful at the box office and has become a semi-iconic film. A mere 2 years after its release I was in Las Vegas and there was an establishment called Coyote Ugly with an alluring woman dancing out front on a raised platform to draw in customers. That was my first exposure to ""Coyote Ugly"" and I asked my brother-in-law about it; to which he informed me it was a movie. One of the problems with the film is that the girl dancing out front of that Vegas nightclub was far more fetching than any of the actresses dancing in the movie. The women simply aren't curvy enough to engender much fascination. Perabo is arguably the best, followed by blond cutie Izabella Miko, but Miko and the rest (e.g. Bridget Moynahan and Melanie Lynskey) seriously looked like they needed to gain about 15 lbs. at least. But, I suppose if you like women with the shape of 12 year-old boys you might appreciate this element more than me.<br/><br/>Another problem is the emphasis on the nightclub lifestyle and the soused antics thereof. If bars are your thang then you'll probably favor this movie more than I did. Thankfully, the protagonists eschew the drunkard lifestyle and the movie's to be commended for this (the filmmakers obviously wanted to ""have their cake and eat it too"").<br/><br/>But those are minor quibbles. The biggest problem with ""Coyote Ugly,"" beyond the story being predictable, is that there's no meat on the bones, so to speak. Take the subplot with the boyfriend and his big revelation scene; it was underwhelming and weakly executed, to say the least. Moreover, I just saw the movie last night and I can't even remember if the protagonist ""makes it"" in the music business at the end. That's how forgettable the film is.<br/><br/>A couple of years after the flick was released my wife asked a 9 year-old girl what her favorite movie was and she enthusiastically said ""Coyote Ugly!"" That tells you something about the film's depth.<br/><br/>The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot in South Amboy, New Jersey; Atlantic Beach, Long Island; New York City; and Tower Theatre & Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles.

"robert-temple-1","8","4","6","27 April 2013"," The Adventures of Piper Perabo in Manhattan
","I decided to watch this film because I admire the work of the young actress Piper Perabo, who has been so brilliant and charming as the lead character in the ongoing series COVERT AFFAIRS. The reason why she is called 'Piper' is not because she is a tropical bird who makes strange sounds in the jungle, but because she was named after the fifties movie actress Piper Laurie, remember her? But the reason why she looks so unusual is that she is half Norwegian and half Portuguese, a mixture so rare that we have never seen one before and may never see one again. She attended high school in Toms River, New Jersey, one of the small New Jersey towns I have actually been to long ago, strange that. (How many people have been to Toms River? If you have six fingers on one hand that's too many.) I first encountered her on screen in SLAP HER SHE'S FRENCH (2002, see my review), in which she and the whole film were equally hilarious. She was also in the wonderfully funny BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA (2008, see my review). So I thought I would jump from chihuahuas to coyotes and see what that was all about. Well, what a shock. All those girls dancing on the top of a bar in a Manhattan bar called Coyote Ugly, the girls themselves being called 'coyotes'! I got a DVD of what is called the extended cut, whatever was extended. This is in some ways what is called a chick flic, but not really. Perabo plays a good little girl from the tiny South Amboy, New Jersey (is that an in joke of some kind?), who gets the nickname 'Jersey'. She loves her dad who is a widower, excellently played by John Goodman, who has just the right sentimental sad sack tone for the part. Perfect casting there. She falls for the quirky Australian actor Adam Garcia, who has just the right amount of whimsy and works at a grill, so that is the love story part of it. She moves into the most terrible filthy and collapsing apartment in China Town, but seems to love it. But it's the bar that makes your jaw drop far below floor level. The girls cavort on the bar from where they throw buckets of water and buckets of ice cubes all over the patrons, and the patrons just love it. Everybody drinks bottles of whiskey and it gets poured all over the counter and the people too. Perabo wants to be a song-writer, like her deceased mother, but is too shy to sing her own songs in public. She takes a job as a coyote to pay the rent. The girls are all dressed in as little as possible and, as the woman owner puts it, 'must give the impression of being available while not really being available'. Perabo slowly warms up to this, which is not exactly her thing. There are numerous ups and downs, not to mention sideways wriggles, and Perabo is forced to sing to the patrons of the bar to stop a violent fight, which means she has sung in public for the first time by accident. Eventually after endless rebuffs she gets someone to listen to one of her own songs. There is a lot of very good satire of the music business in the film. Perabo's father comes to the bar unexpectedly one night and is shocked, and this makes for problems, as he says he never thought he could be ashamed of her but he is. She gets fired but then gets rehired. She realizes she is not a natural coyote. The pure unrestrained anarchy of the bar is really something to see and behold, though pardon me if I don't go searching for such a place, for as much as I can cope with anarchy, I really don't want to be soaked with buckets of water all evening and forced to drink that much whiskey. I'll give it a miss. Nor do I necessarily think girls should be demeaning themselves by wriggling on bar tops. It goes against my male feminist principles. But still! It's a movie! And there she is, Piper Perabo with her girlish smile, surviving it all somehow, for after all she has a big future ahead of her as the world's cutest super-spy in COVERT AFFAIRS (to be reviewed)."

","This movie was, in a word crap.  I am kind of depressed to know that I live in a world where millions of dollars are used to make movies like this and Kazam.  Can't Hollywood think of a better way to spend money?  Like, I don't know, burn it?<br/><br/>Anyway, pretty much every aspect of this film was poorly executed.  The plot was less believable than Weekend at Bernie's II.  The editing was confusing at best and the acting...well, John Goodman was as usual, a solid performance, but aside from him it was a slew of WB rejects(mind you this is the network that allowed the Wayans brothers their own show.)  Well...I take that back, there was one other glimmer of light in the otherwise foul smelling mire of Coyote Ugly...TYRA BANKS!  Just kidding She made me yearn for the master thespians of Cleopatra 2525.<br/><br/>Being the sad fanboy that I am I was reading an interview with the stars(I really don't think that word is appropriate, a much better term would be ""people who the camera was on the most"") they went on and on about how this movie was a celebration of womens sexuality and their newfound freedom to be whatever they(all women) want to be.  Well I guess that makes sense, after leaving the theater I realized that most women in this sexually and culturally open minded world, do in fact have the right to work in any Hooters restaurant they want.  Seriously though, Maybe I'm just hyper sensitive but the movie seemed slightly demeaning to women.  I found it in the same vein as Pretty Woman; using your body to make money will make all your dreams come true.  What a great message for a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>Well, in a nutshell, this movie really sucked on every level.  It is a sad reflection on the intelligence of the American consumer(as I glance across the room at my ticket stub)."

","Considering that ""Coyote Ugly"" is a teen-movie, it isn't even bad. In fact, it is quite better than most of those nasty teen-movies (such as the ""American Pie"" movies, ""There's Something About Mary"", ""Cross Roads"", etc...), but nothing extraordinary. Nevertheless, it is still entertaining enough and has its fun, as well as its moments.<br/><br/>The best things about this movie are the good pop soundtrack and the beautiful Piper Perabo as a very seductive girl. The plot is predictable but okay. The dialogs/lines are okay. The romantic atmosphere combined with humor is good in my personal opinion. There is some language in this movie, but fortunately it has no disgusting dialogs or profanity. There is also some drama, without being very intense, however.<br/><br/>Piper Perabo portrays Violet Sanford, a very sexy and sensual character, but also a very friendly and lovable character. Adam Garcia portrays Kevin O'Donnell, a likable, funny and cool dude.<br/><br/>While not necessarily a great movie, ""Coyote Ugly"" is however underrated. It deserves a little higher rating than this, if you ask me.<br/><br/>For teenagers, it's very easy to enjoy this movie.

You can't get enough of them and everyone knows there should have been more.  I've heard stories that the real ""Coyote Ugly"" in NYC is close to being as wild as the joint in the movie which makes me want to visit it sometime. :)  The biggest disappointment was the fact that Tyra Banks had basically NO part in the movie.  A quick 5 minute cameo in the beginning and that was it.  It's like Carmen Electra in the beginning of ""Scary Movie.""  You want more but it's never there :)<br/><br/>If you're still planning on seeing this movie go into knowing that you have seen this plot before and know that there won't be nearly enough bar scenes.

So Violet wants to move out of her small town to pursue her writing career in music (yawn, been there, done that) only to realize that when she gets in New York she's going to have to do more than try to hand over tapes at record companies (You think!) It actually comes up that she's going to have to pay rent (Gee, wonder why she never seemed to have thought about that before)<br/><br/>After seeing three girls ""winding down"" after a night at their job, she gets a job there. And that's when I thought the movie might pick up. I'm a girl so I'm not really into that boobs and butts scene, but at least the bar was a cool setting and had the potential to pick up a little speed and actually get interesting. Wrong I was. The bar scenes were few and far between and some of them were kinda dumb. (i.e. let's make the rowdy crowd calm by me singing)<br/><br/>By the third act, the main character has so many things happening to her that didn't even tie in with the resolution of her fear of the stage that it made me feel ill. So finally Violet gets a gig and somehow her boyfriend learns the building and knows where the power switches are so he can turn them off so she won't see anyone and get stage fright. Then her perky voice is heard and somehow, even after the main power switches were cut, the stage lights come back on. And when you finally think the trite c**p is over it cuts to the bar and you get to see the worst scene in the movie: the one with Leeann Rimes signing on top of a bar. And I thought the price of admission was scary!<br/><br/>Save yourself from this movie. Unless of course you like predictable, cliched, fuzzy movies, and have time and money to waste.

As far as the filmmaking, the dialogue was even worse than The Perfect Storm, which I thought was the worst I'd ever heard. The scene where she shows her boyfriend how it feels to be nervous singing by stripping was truly in horrible taste for a movie that junior high girls are going to be viewing.

"JamesHitchcock","4","3","5","5 July 2014"," The Ultimate Product Placement
","""Coyote Ugly"" is a real bar in New York; the name is presumably an ironic allusion to the fact that its female staff are all very attractive. I wonder how many other real bars in America have been able to benefit from the ultimate product placement of having an entire Hollywood movie dedicated to their activities. <br/><br/>Violet Sanford is a young woman from South Amboy, New Jersey who moves to New York to follow her dream of becoming a songwriter. The film is clearly based on the dubious theory that songwriters need to live in big cities because no songs worth listening to have ever been written in small towns. (It is also based upon the assumption that ""Violet"" was a plausible Christian name for girls of Piper Perabo's generation. Well, perhaps it was in New Jersey, but in the seventies the only Violets in Britain were those queuing up for their old age pension). Violet quickly discovers that, in the songwriting trade, success does not always come quickly and realises that she will need another source of income to tide her over until her genius is recognised by the music industry. She therefore gets a job at the Coyote Ugly Saloon.<br/><br/>""Coyote Ugly"" reminded me of a slightly later film, ""Burlesque"". In that film Christina Aguilera also plays a rather naive young girl who leaves her small-town home to settle in the big city and who ends up working in a rather risqué establishment. Lil, the bar owner, also bears certain similarities to the character played by Cher in ""Burlesque"". The main difference is that the Coyote Ugly Saloon is not actually a strip club; taking their clothes off is not something the Coyote Girls are expected to do. If, however, they are not strippers, neither are they barmaids as that term is more generally understood. They are encouraged to flirt with male customers, to dance on the bar, to take part in wet T-shirt contests and to behave in a generally raunchy way. <br/><br/>The film charts Violet's rise to fame not only as a bartender but also as a singer-songwriter, and there is a subplot chronicling her romance with a handsome young Australian named Kevin. Actually, ""handsome"" seems an inadequate adjective to describe Adam Garcia. He achieves the rare feat for a Hollywood leading man of being even prettier than his leading lady. The film-makers seem to have had the cynical idea of making a romantic comedy (normally regarded as a genre which appeals more to women than to men) which would be equally popular with both sexes. Garcia would provide eye-candy for the ladies, while for the men there would be the sight of various sexy girls parading their charms in tight- fitting T-shirts and jeans. Among Violet's co-workers is the gorgeous supermodel Tyra Banks, at this period trying to carve out a cinema career for herself. (Tyra's bid for screen stardom did not prove a great success, but at least she was no worse than some of her fellow supers, such as Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson, who also tried their hand at acting around the same time). <br/><br/>Good looks, whether of the masculine or feminine variety, are not always enough to ensure the success of a film, but ""Coyote Ugly"" did relatively well at the box-office. The critics, however, were less impressed, and I must say that my sympathies are with them. The plot is weak and clichéd, and the acting is undistinguished. Both Perabo and Garcia are forgettable; about the only one of the cast to make anything of an impression is John Goodman as Violet's father Bill, like most Goodman characters an amiable slob. Even the sight of Tyra Banks in a T-shirt cannot make ""Coyote Ugly"" anything more than a below-average rom-com. 4/10"

","The cover with all the girls having fun in a bar isn't accurate because the bar intrigue and the friends are really a subplot.

The reason is that even as a newcomer, Piper Parabo is definitely a better actress than Jessica Alba! She is really moving with her feelings and i like the way she manages her relationship with her father and her boyfriend. The final moments are maybe a bit rushed but i have enjoyed the journey. And what about the coyotes then? Well, they are in the back: the dance and drinks aren't so many and it's a good thing because getting drunk in a bar while peeping girls isn't my habit.

There is half a chick flick here as young chicks might enjoy this though older woman sleep through it. The music is good including the talented LeeAnn Rhymes. This helps it avoid being awful, but there is no real classic material in this one."

","I really think Bruckheimer directed this movie....who else would have conceived such Wellesian use of deep focus,such a lean, tight, wet script that surprises at every turn, with a backstory of such monumental humanity and pathos? The cries for mercy in the barroom scene reminded me of the Odessa Steps sequence in Potemkin,especially as the innocent man was catapulted into the jukebox glass, thus symbolizing for all cinematic history the tides and fluxes of human history upon which we all ride helplessly, like that bull in Gilley's from another film, which cast all aside in its merciless sweep? A film to savour smackingly again and again."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","1 November 2003"," Formulaic story with dancing girls  like a titillating music video but 30 times longer
","Aspiring song writer Violet leaves her New Jersey home and moves into New York, full of hope that a record company will pick up her tape and start selling her songs.  When she realises the reality of the situation she has run out of money and luck.  When she overhears three girls talking about how much money they made in one night, she learns of the bar Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids are so lively and fun that they draw the crowds.  She gets a job there  but will it hinder her chances of getting her big break?<br/><br/>I, like almost all men, enjoy the odd music video here and there  it's not hard to watch MTV for longer than 20 minutes and realise that all the videos know that sexy girls shaking their asses will get the viewers watching their songs.  This is fine because a) the song may be good so that it's not all visuals and b) it only lasts 3 minutes.  The problem with Coyote Ugly is that it is basically a long music video and has the disadvantage that neither a) or b) are true in it's case.  The plot is very formulaic and everyone and his dog knows where it is going from the outset.  For large chunks of the film nothing of merit happens  even a love interest is thrown in to try and fill the running time out.  This leaves plenty of scenes of girls in tight/skimpy clothes dancing on a bar, covering themselves with water etc which is all well and good if that's all you want.  However for me, and this brings us to b), I want more from a 90 min+ film  I can get that in a music video.<br/><br/>The running time just drags at times and few of the scenes do anything to help.  Scenes of Violet writing on her roof are just uninspiring and it's only the ass-shaking that ever woke me up out of the stupor that the film had put me in.  The film is just another slick little meaningless product from the usual stable  it has no substance but has plenty of enjoyable visual images for men to watch.  I just needed more than girls to enjoy this.<br/><br/>The cast are average at best.  Perabo is dippy in the lead but is likeable enough to do the job.  Garcia is a poor love interest and always feels like an afterthought  no matter how hard the film works to crowbar him into the narrative.  Of the Coyote girls, none really manage to have any meaningful character and are really just there to sex the film up.  Of the three, Banks is treated the worst  her character leaves the bar but then keeps just randomly turning up with explanation.  I'm not complaining because I found her the cutest, but it was further proof of the film's focus on image over everything else.  Goodman doesn't manage to come out with any dignity either and I'm sure the only thing he'll remember about his part in this film will be how much he got paid.<br/><br/>Overall  wanna see girls dance and be sexy? Then either go to a club in the real world or sit at home and fast forward to the bar scenes in this film. If you want anything more than that (plot, interesting characters, good story, substance) then you'd best avoid this as it basically has none of those qualities in anything other than very meagre amounts."

","I never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke I watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.<br/><br/>For starters I'd like to question the politics of the film. It hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. These women are nothing more the whores. Are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? This is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of cash. A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.<br/><br/>The manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. Any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.<br/><br/>And finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? We watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. She 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. I find this most strange.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascistic, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?"

She's the spunky girl who follows her dreams. The story is reminiscent of ""Flashdance"". Violet is a small town girl who wants to become a songwriter and/or singer, but suffers from stage fright.<br/><br/>In order to survive in New York City, she takes a bartending job at Coyote Ugly--a rowdy, high-energy joint where the girls are expected to dance provocatively on the bar, sell as many drinks as possible, and appear available--where she discovers her inner chutzpah.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is immensely popular and the music helps drive the action. Violet's singing is dubbed by LeAnn Rimes, who makes an appearance on screen. The film has a competent cast including John Goodman, Maria Bello, and others who are fun to spot.<br/><br/>Don't think too much while watching this film. Just relax and enjoy the music, the energy, and the formulaic story of a young woman learning to make it on her own.<br/><br/>The name (of the bar) Coyote Ugly is a monument to the concept of getting mindlessly drunk."

","A lot of the movies I write reviews for are branded 'amazingly bad' nearly every single time and more often than never, I'm left sitting there going, 'did you even watch the damn movie?' Because sometimes, that's how I feel. Sure, I'm all open for people to share their opinions but there's just some out there that make me want to tap them to a chair and play the movie over and over again.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's exactly how I feel with this movie. I've read reviews where they judge even the music they use during the film, which is ridiculous - the music choices in Coyote Ugly just help make it.<br/><br/>This is a story about Violet Sanford; an aspiring musician who moves to the big apple in hope of getting a record deal. So, that doesn't happen as easily as Violet had hoped and in order to gain some easy money, she becomes a bartender. Oh! But, not just ANY bartender - A Coyote. Sounds fun, doesn't it? They dance on the bar and guys buy them drinks (which they subsequently hardly ever drink). There is a lot of reason behind the making of this film. I mean, for one, it's a Jerry Bruckheimer film; Mr Big himself. So, just because the movie isn't something along the lines of CSI: Miami, doesn't mean it's not worth the watch. It's funny, it has romance, drunk hot guys... drunk hot girls! C'mon, you have to hand it to them - the whole cast made the film good, great even.<br/><br/>Personally, I love this movie, I would've given this a 10/10 BUT I had to take into consideration what other people thought. I mean, whether you watch the Director's Cut or the cinema version, it's still worth the watch. Don't take any one review for granted, watch it for yourself. Solicit Opinions. It's totally worth it. I give this 8/10. Thankyou!"
"StevePulaski","5","2","3","28 June 2011"," When you don't know what to say, display for TnA, I guess
","The most clever scene in Coyote Ugly is when Maria Bello explains why the bar is named what it is. She says it's when a woman wakes up in bed with a man after a one night stand and he's so ugly, but you have your arm around him because last night he seemed hot. Desperate, but not wanting to be rude, instead of pulling your arm out from under him you try to chew it off like a trapped coyote. That my friends, is Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>It was much to my surprise that Kevin Smith actually did a rewrite of the film's script at one point. I would imagine if Smith's version was made into the final film that it would be less about the girl's bodies and more about their problems. Instead of so many overhead shots of women dancing on one another, soaked in water, comparing wet t-shirts, I'm sure there would've been more sincere dialog between Violet and her friends. Maybe we would've gotten to know them better. It's all one big ""maybe."" The film centers around Violet (Perabo), an aspiring songwriter trying to make it in the complicated and relentless world of music. She tries to get her demo tape heard, but is always met with reps that blow her off. Violet leaves home and goes to New York to try her look, but realizing she needs to make end's meet, she goes to work at a bar called ""Coyote Ugly"" where she will entertain customers by seductively dancing on the bar countertop while pouring drinks and showering her and her fellow employees with water. That's the extent of it.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Violet dates a shady guy who she had mistaken for a record exec (Garcia). Let me ask Violet, do you think it's a good idea to date a guy who just tried to pass himself off as a guy who could get you a record deal and doesn't discuss any of his past? Does he seem like the dream guy mothers would want their daughters to date, and could have a good ol' day out with the father? I neglected to mention that the club is run by Lil (Bello). Lil, full name Liliana Lovell, actually runs the real-life Coyote Ugly in New York. Maria Bello was excellent in The Cooler, and does more sure-fire work in this picture. She is still as hilarious as ever, and plays a very strict, yet laidback bartender.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly, even in possession of a decent storyline, is ruined by its own immaturity. There are too many overhead shots of women on the bar countertop that go nowhere and aren't arousing or entertaining at all. I appreciate John Goodman's role as Violet's protective and caring dad, but the scenes with him are far to spread out and far too short to fully enjoy. I imagine if Kevin Smith was responsible for writing the entire screenplay maybe the movie would've been more about the daddy/daughter relationship rather than the women.<br/><br/>The story isn't gripping, but it works for a while. Until the bar comes into play. Then it's down to twelve year olds controlling the camera. Piper Perabo is gorgeous, and is one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood today in terms of looks and acting skills. She still hasn't had that ""breakout"" role that has taken her career to new heights. Surprisingly, as juvenile as this picture can be, this really didn't jump-start any future projects for her. Nor anyone else in this film.<br/><br/>Starring: Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, and John Goodman. Directed by: David McNally."

","I can honestly think of only one reason to watch this movie that I have just suffered through: John Goodman. I found John Goodman's performance affective and moving, however, his role generally had little effect on the rest of the picture. Beyond Goodman's moments we are left to drudge through a female-lead rehash of ""Cocktail"", which was one of the worst movies of the last twenty years, so that's not a good thing. Viewers beware: bartenders don't make interesting lead characters. Then there's a fair amount of ""Flashdance"" tossed in there, except instead of an aspiring dancer, we have aspiring songwriter. There's also the fact that this was such a tame movie that was trying to be sexy and scandalous and according to the DVD, it was also trying to be a comedy. Where did I miss that? The only thing funny about it was the overacting and the possible Kevin Smith inclusion (uncredited writer on this) of the ""special edition"" comic book, which was cute but quite out of place.

The most disappointing fact is this happy end and the fulfilling of the `American Dream' that makes everybody happy ad everybody smiles and says: America, Land of freedom were all you're dreams come true.

","When Jerry Bruckheimer committed to produce ""Coyote Ugly,"" I don't think he was intending to remake ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Gone With the Wind,"" widely regarded at two of the greatest movies of all time.  And while I don't think ""Coyote Ugly"" is one of even the fifty greatest movies of all time, I did like it for what it was; a cute little movie that can lift your spirits when you're down.<br/><br/>Violet Sanford, played by the heartbreakingly sexy Piper Perabo, decides to pick up and leave her smalltown New Jersey existence - much to the chagrin of her toll-booth operator father, played by John Goodman in a show-stealing performance - for the Big Apple for a shot at success in the music business. Once there, she finds out there's a lot more to it than simply having great songs. One night, she happens upon one ""Mr."" O'Donnell (or Kevin, played by Adam Garcia) and gives him her demo tape thinking he's in the biz. When it turns out that he's nothing more than a guy who works odd jobs, she gets disgusted when he won't leave her alone (she's so cute when she say ""So, I'm going to say 'good night...'"").<br/><br/>After more meetings, a rather embarrassing, um, performance at an open-mike night (which we get to see her legendary stage fright) and being robbed, she happens upon three women, one of them who is saying goodbye to the other two, at an all-night eatery. ""Are they hookers?"" she asks excitedly. ""No,"" says the dive owner as he hands her a matchbox with the name of a bar, the infamous ""Coyote Ugly;"" ""They're coyotes!"" She then decides to ""audition"" for the empty slot.<br/><br/>Somehow, over time, she impresses the hard-as-nails owner Lil, played with /chutzpah/ by Maria Bello, formerly of ""ER,"" with her way with rowdy New Yorkers ready to get into a fight over a girl, her ability to raise $250 in two minutes by auctioning off an intimate night with Kevin as a means of payback and saving her fellow waitresses from impending trouble by singing along to ""One Way or Another"" by Blondie on the jukebox. <br/><br/>
And while she falls in love with Kevin (who helps her get over her stage fright), she disappoints her father when he finds out that she's working at what he must believe is a strip bar, having seen his buddies at work putting her picture up in their toll-booth windows. <br/><br/>I think that the screenplay could be written a little better (Gina Wendkos does a better job with ""The Princess Diaries"" in my opinion). But the directing here is adequate; and I feel that, all things considered, the movie is well-acted; Melanie Lynskey was cute as Violet's long-time, always loyal friend. It's quite interesting to see Bridget Moynihan and Tyra Banks, two models, cast in the movie, Moynihan as the sexy ""New York b****"" and Tyra Banks as the sexy law student (who I would have liked to have seen more of). I feel that both of them held their own. And Izabella Miko was hot as Cammie, ""The Russian Tease!"" <br/><br/>I love the use of music throughout the film, including Violet's songs, which were actually written by Diane Warren, as well as the music played at the bar. Being of the male persuasion, I can't help but love the dance numbers with the Coyotes - love those outfits especially (even if it's really stunt dancers). And I can tolerate the sappy love story. Overall, this is a fun movie for anybody who needs to be cheered up (and who /doesn't/ these days!?).<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

From the beginning of the film its aim is simply to entertain the audience by cleverly bringing peoples inner inhibitions and desires to life.  Its a fun film to watch and manages to keep you captivated by the boisterous thrills in the bar and then cleverly transporting you away to  focus on peoples vulnerabilities in personal relationships.

","Seems Jerry Bruckheimer is running out of ideas these days.  He's now recycling material from nearly twenty years ago.  With Coyote Ugly, we have the story of a young New Jersey girl moving from NJ to the big bad city of Manhattan.  There, she learns that life in the city is tough and the only way to write music is up on the top of your roof.  Violet, played by Piper Perabo, does have some moments where she has some true defining moments as a character, but those are few and far between.  She finds the titular bar and promptly begins work there with the other barmaids.  They jump, they dance, the light the place on fire all to the tune of heavy pounding rock music.  The one bright spot about this movie is John Goodman.  As Violet's father, he brings some humor and life into an otherwise dull story that has all the plot twists of an unwound pretzel.  And as for Tyra Banks, I don't know why she was cast.  Her character vanishes before the first act is even over.  Lets just hope Bruckheimer doesn't mix any other films together."

","Super producer Jerry Bruckheimer adds fuel and fire to an overdone love story. Girl (Piper Perabo) leaves small town and bitter single parent (John Goodman) to make it big in the city. She gets turned down one after another by everyone and moves into a run down apartment. She then gets robbed but finds a great job where she can makes some cash. She meets a boy (Adam Garcia) and has a fight with her parent. The parent gets injured, she has a fight with her boyfriend and loses her job. Then everything somehow comes together in the end. What Bruckheimer does to this story is turned the level of energy up quite a few notches. He adds in gorgeous women (Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Melanie Lynskey,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks)for some seriously good eye candy, loud thunderous music, Bruckheimer colors, camera shots and flair and a wild bar named Coyote Ugly. This is one love story other than Chasing Amy that guys can enjoy. The eye candy is popin all over and the music makes for big time fun. This is a summer popcorn flick. It just replaces the explosions and FX with beautiful women going buck wild on top of a bar. This is a good date film but if you're a guy make sure you keep your hormones in check or you could be leaving alone. For a high energy, full of eye candy, fun loving Bruckheimer film without explosions, Coyote Ugly is a not that bad of a choice."

The script could not be any better. Every plot hole is filled  in by the time this movie reaches its much awaited ending. Rather than making a preview focused on the chick flick side of it or the raunchy bar side of it, the preview did both which added interest. This is Piper Perabo's and Adam Garcia's breaking off point. There is something almost magic about the way Piper Perabo performs in front of the camera. She is really something special. There were more songs used in this film than i've ever seen in any other film and they were all placed at just the right time.

I also saw that the previews were a big trick.  I thought Tyra Banks was supposed to have a part in this... her picture WAS on the poster...  But that aside, I think the movie would be mildly entertaining if they had more interaction between the girls at the bar.  Like one of them has a herion addiction and feels the need to put herself out of her misery.  But then I forgot about the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>So, every time the bar scene (the few that there were, seeing as most of this 120 minutes was dedicated to weak dialouge contributing to the cliche plot) became somewhat interesting, they'd ruin it by singing.  Too much singing.  Unnecessary singing.  At times INTOLERABLE singing (the songwriting dream... aforementioned cliche plot).  Then it occurred to me they wanted something to appeal to girls...<br/><br/>Ahhh.. how clever.  Her songwriting dream.  So if you're a boy who still has his nights interrupted by wet dreams and needs a visual fix by girls dancing on bars, or a girl who's all about 'GRRRL Power!' and 'I know she can do it if she just BELIEVES in herself', or even if you're just an average person who's day planner needs rearranging, go for it.

It was also delightful to see Melanie Lynskey in this move - she was great as Jacqueline in Ever After, it took a minute to remember who she was and she looked great.<br/><br/>So, I don't think it's a waste of time or money, depending on what you're looking for - if you want an epic stay home, if you want to be entertained go see it, just don't expect to be intellectually stimulated."

","Pretty and talented women serve up lots of raw energy, dancing and circus stunts while strutting their stuff on the bar at Coyote Ugly, a Manhattan hot spot. What saves this flick from being the same old tired old hash served up a different way is the brilliant editing. There are also some interesting scenes of Manhattan, including the fish market and the apartment and roof top which give a realistic feel to what it's like to live in New York on a tight budget. (A tiny, filthy, unsafe apartment like that one probably costs upwards of a grand a month.) The once scene which garnered a guffaw from the audience was when the significance of the title is revealed -- not only amusing, but also probably the most original concept in this movie.

","COYOTE UGLY is a nice romantic/drama/comedy that is uplifting and delightful.  It brings hope that no matter where you come from in the U.S. you can always make it in the big bad city. Except that I've already seen almost every John Cusack and John Hughes film, so it becomes routine and cliche.  If you haven't seen those films, which chances are you have, since they are in color, then COYOTE UGLY is nothing new. Every movie were a girl from a small town goes to a big city, either New York City or Los Angeles.  This time it's New York, but the main star, Violet (Piper Perabo) wants to become a songwriter, but she needs to pay for rent and other necessities (my guess is make-up).  So she goes from recording studio to studio dropping off her tapes for recording agents can listen to, but then that crummy copyright law gets in the way, damn lawyers. So what is Violet to do but to work in a evening hot spot bar called Coyote Ugly.  The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello) a energetic boss/bartender who is concerned about making money and not breaking the law.  There are other bartender's as well, Cammie (Izabella Miko) a sweet and kind bartender who usually melts men's hearts with her dancing.  Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) a tough as nails woman who releases her agression on the male customers.  And Zoe (Tyra Banks) a bartender who's on her way out to go to law school.  And what the women do at the bar is like a mixture of SHOWGIRLS and COCKTAIL.  They dance very erotic while pouring drinks, (hey, why can't every city have a bar like these?)  And the girls bring in lots of money nightly, mega bucks amount. While Violet is learning the ropes at the bar, and saving her money, she builds up a romance with a man who has multiple jobs, Kevin (Adam Garcia). And Violet communicates with her worried some father (John Goodman) who takes money at a toll booth. One thing that ran through my mind with COYOTE UGLY is that it is the most erotic and sexiest pronography where everyone keeps thier clothes on. The way these women dance, it comes close to a strip club dance than anything else.  The other thing that ran through my mind is the plot.  I kept guessing on what was going to happen, and I was right.  It's a romantic routine film, girl meets boy, they fall in love, they fight, they make-up, etc. What did I like about this movie?  Well, first there are the women, they are attractive and very beautiful.  Also each girl has a flame of talent that is begging to get out, however director David McNally sticks with the routine and shows too little of the girls at the bar and more with just Violet trying to succeed.  Then there's the two charming men, Adam Garcia and John Goodman.  Garcia is enjoyable as the romantic male, he is funny and charming at times, but he's also hammy and cheesy. And speaking of food, John Goodman is also funny as the father of Violet who refuses to diet and to watch over his little girl. But it's that darn bloody script that ruins everything.  It's a script that could be shown in a screenwriting class, in fact I think they have shown it in my class.  The typical rags from riches story, just with five women shaking their stuff while serving alcohol, man's two favorite things. When I talked to producer Jerry Bruckheimer last March about COYOTE UGLY, he told me that, ""there are going to be A LOT of hot looking women in it.""  And guess what?  HE'S RIGHT!!  There are a lot of hot looking women in this film, sadly they have nowhere to go.  This is similar to Bruckheimer's last drama, FLASHDANCE.  I think Bruckheimer should stick with action films, he's much better with those. *** (out of five)"

Think hard about the trailer for this film. Do you remember anything about the plot of the movie?  It's no accident that the trailer hid what I'm about to tell you:  Coyote Ugly is a chick flick, a classic boy-meets-girl.<br/><br/>Small town girl Violet Sanford leaves home for the Big apple with the dream of becoming a professional song writer.  Her lack of success eventually leads her to a bartending job at the swinging Coyote Ugly.  Along the way she meets the persistent `Mr. O'Donnell,' the boy who will win her over. But before the film can end, Violet must confront her stage fright in order to achieve her dream of being a song writer.<br/><br/>I apologize if I made the story sound in any way complicated, or interesting.  It was probably written from a template.  Good acting can usually make up for such un-originality, but every hard body in this film acts exactly as we would expect a model to act-poorly.  The trailer would also lead one to believe that Tyra Banks plays a part in this film, but she really has little more than a cameo.

I think she was expecting more of a Thelma and Louise meets cocktail type film with strong female roles running a bar and not taking crap from anyone. Yeah, they all danced around in skimpy outfits to 20 year old music, but there are sexy and strong willed people in the world. What bothered me about the movie is that it was a long disjointed collection of cliches that we've seen before and done better. Girl goes to New York to be a songwriter (in case you saw the preview rather than hearing about it from friends this is actually what the movie is about). Guess what, no one will buy her songs. Big surprise there. No one will even be nice to her! What a shock! She lives in what looks like the projects, has no job, has a stock dead mother family past. I keep thinking I've given too much away, but this is all the first five minutes of the film. Nothing else develops other than the generic boyfriend with a stock sitcom relationship. Oh yeah, the bar? It could be left out. It has nothing to do with the plot. She doesn't even grow as a person there. All those tough, take no prisoners women who work there? Wimps! They couldn't get together and make one stable person. And they are messed up in a seven dwarfs kind of a way. Oh let's see there's Slutty, and Bitchy, and Bossy. Each one is screwed up in her own endearing way. There is no explanation of why they are like this, and their tag name is the end all and be all of their personality. The characters all march through the plot like dutiful actors hitting the mark because that's where the director told them to go. No matter that it's out of character (Oh but they have none), or that it contradicts what they said 5 minutes ago. The lead character is from 20 miles South in New Jersey. She acts like she's from Nebraska or Iowa or something. Big doe eyed sucker from some farm, or fall out shelter. Doesn't the local library have internet access? There really is no excuse for being that naive in life.<br/><br/>Now there were things I did like. The house she moves from looks like a working man's house in New Jersey.

Piper Perabo does an ok job in what is really her debut performance, if you don't count Rocky & Bullwinkle and Single Spaced (where her character is named Giant Squid, really quite funny).  Her acting and all-around cute-ness would have been much more noticeable if she didn't have to sing those friggin songs during the movie. The editing was so bad during those scenes that I thought maybe Cheh Chang stepped in for his artistic interpretation.  Adam Garcia, Piper's love interest in the movie, actually came across as charming and all that good stuff.  Maria Bello, the boss, was a little too forced.  She tried to be a real hard ass but seemed to keep changing her mind.  John Goodman, Piper's father, was the best in the movie.

It isn't as though we needed an updated homage to the older film this year... we had 'Center Stage' for that, if we had yearned for it.

He's apparantly struggling with the intersection of a preternaturally extended mid-life crisis and a bad case of director's block.  Let's hope that with this regression he's gotten it out of his system and can get on with his life. <br/><br/>That said, we hadn't intended to see it (we couldn't find the theater in time to go to our intended viewing of 'The Patriot'), so we weren't the intended audience.  And we saw it on the supersaver's Matinee, so we only wasted three measly bucks per ticket. For that price it was relatively inoffensive, and an acceptable excuse to sit in an air-conditioned building and enjoy our popcorn."

","I was disappointed in this movie. Based on the trailer, I expected it to be a sort of ""Cocktail"" for girls. I was hoping this movie would have a lot of the electric booze-pouring scenes from the trailer, but if you've seen the trailer, you've seen about all there is to see (except for a pretty good wet t-shirt sequence). Unfortunately, though, the movie spends a lot of time with Piper Perabo's character whining about her songwriting career and a totally unnecessary, by-the-numbers romance with the type of movie character I like to call an ""Accent Boy"" (i.e., apparently, his whole charm lies in his foreign accent, here, Australian; see also Ben Chaplin in ""The Truth About Cats and Dogs""). I found the romance scenes boring, and the other bar girls' characters underdeveloped. I thought this movie would be about a bar (e.g. ""Cheers""), but it's really just another insecure-girl-goes-to-NYC-to-make-it-big story. You've seen this story before, and if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the good stuff already."

","Personally, I loved this movie!  It was funny, entertaining, uplifting and had a great soundtrack.  However others I talked to didn't think it was nearly as great, and maybe it's no great masterpiece but it is a really fun film.  The story revolves around Violent Stanford (perfectly played by newcomer Piper Perabo), a small town girl who moves to New York to be a songwriter, but finds out its not as easy as it sounds.  In New York, Violet gets a job at Coyote Ugly, a wild bar where the women dance around in skin tight clothes and pour water on them selves.  As dirty as that sounds its actually not.  There is no nudity and the dancing isn't that sexual, something that probably disappointed all the drooling men who went to see it in the theatres expecting another Showgirls.  In fact the advertising for this film is quite misleading, there are only 4 main scenes that take place in the bar, the rest of the film focuses on Violet's struggling career, her romance with a dish washing Australian, and her father's disapproval with her job.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly was produced by that maker of masterpieces, Jerry Bruckheimer, and has drawn many comparisons to his 80's hit Flashdance.  If you ask me though, this one is much better.  The direction is slick, the stars are hot and the story is entertaining.  See it."
"ghica","Null","1","1","26 November 2001"," Perfunctory entertainment
","I wonder why many serious film critics go to the trouble of explaining in lengthy and clever reviews why ""Coyote Ugly"" is not a good film. What did they expect? What do they expect in general of mass-produced teen-targeted entertainment? To challenge, illuminate and move? To elevate the audience to a new esthetic climax? Are them critics familiar with with teens' tastes? I find such criticism superfluous, even self-indulgent. ""Coyote Ugly"" is simply an instance, undistinguished, of a vast and serious cultural issue. One can address the issue itself and use this movie as an illustration, but taking it at face value and analyzing it out of context is inappropriate. Movies like ""Coyote Ugly"" do not set out to deliver artistic or original or educational content; so it is unfair to reproach them the fact that they do not deliver such values.<br/><br/>""Coyote Ugly"" is a successful movie both commercially and in that it seems to hit all the targets it aims at. This is the standard we should judge it by. Teen-targeted ""dramas"" could be judged, I propose, by technical merit alone: is the tempo of the movie high enough so that not to bore but low enough so that not to exhaust? are the actors beautiful and charismatic? are the characters simple enough not to create moral ambiguity but complex enough to be believable? is the story predictable enough so that not to challenge but reassure? Smashing soundtrack? Criteria such as these are more suitable. And I think ""Coyote Ugly"" delivers from this point of view. If there was, and I wonder why it isn't, an Academy Award category for perfunctory entertainment this movie would be a contender."

Althoughed the story is cliched as hell and the script doesn't flesh out characters, there's still something about it that makes it enjoyable.<br/><br/>Although Violet should read on the page as a wet,whiney girl Piper Perabo gives a bravo performance that makes you root for her.<br/><br/>Don't think the moral behind the film ''NEVER GIVE UP AND YOU WILL MAKE IT'' always works.

","After seeing the trailer and reading a little about the film, I liked the premise of Coyote Ugly a lot - small town girl goes to work at some kind of hardcore bar.  However, writer Gina Wendkos has simply delivered a sappy love story, with a slightly darker edge, characterised by the Coyote Ugly bar, and probably the influence of producer Jerry Bruckheimer, better known for his work on action films such as Con Air and Enemy Of The State.<br/><br/>Now, this would have been my misunderstanding and me simply going to see the wrong movie if it were a good love story.  However, the characters are hideously one dimensional (i.e. the audience knows nothing about the other two barmaids, Cammie and Rachel, both of whom seem to have leading roles, apart from their bar personalities).  Even the protagonist's main development, the overcoming of her stage fright, doesn't really make any sense and seems to be a rushed conclusion rather than a gradual development.<br/><br/>However, after criticising it, Coyote Ugly is moderately entertaining.  The bar scenes in particular, not just because of the acres of female flesh on display, but also because of the excitement of these scenes and the whole concept of the bar itself.  With this in mind, the scenes shot in the actual bar are the best of the whole film, coming off like a music video.  This does work against the film in the conclusion however, with the last 5-10 minutes seeming to be more of a promo for the film's music single rather than actually concluding the film satisfactorily.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, Coyote Ugly is entertaining, and even exciting in parts, but it's really just a cardboard story filled with one dimensional stock characters.  <br/><br/>6/10"

I am sure that staring at the trailers for this movie, most of your average moron teenagers thought this movie was a wonderful idea and couldn't wait to attend the first screening of this movie.  However, I sat riveted in my seat staring at an unbelievably frightening preview of what Jerry Bruckheimer had to throw at the American public.  I built up an immediate bias against the movie and vowed never to see it.<br/><br/>Enter the girlfriend....<br/><br/>It is impossible to tell your girlfriend that a movie is bad without ever having seen it because she will always come back with the ""how do you know if you've never seen it?""  No amount of rational explanation would make sense (go figure - they're women).  So, I swallowed every last bit of loathing I had for this movie and its peak (the just-as-frightening cameo of LeAnn Rimes) and chased it with a few glasses of Myers's Rum.<br/><br/>And, without further duress, I can without fail tell my girlfriend that she owns the most horrid piece of video known to man or woman.  The sappiness and overstated plot was not to be outdone by the flaunting of women on a bar in tight, unimaginative clothing.  Whether this movie was marketed towards men or women is hard to say, but the fact that neither sex could possibly enjoy this useless drivel is clear fact.<br/><br/>1)  The idea that some girl is going to head to NY to make it as a songwriter is as bland and flavorless as Cream of Wheat.  Thousands of artists head to the Apple daily to watch their dreams shattered and take to the pipe or something.  While this movie was supposed to be based around this girl's success and hardship, all I found was that the writer and director knew very little about the music business and built a ridiculous fantasy for millions of idiot children to belive in.  Watch out NY, more ""musicians"" headed your way.  To the plethora reviewers that said that this movie was an awakening to the works of the music business: try walking outside your front door.  NO business accepts the kind of ideas this movie is trying to push and the music industry is no different.<br/><br/>2)  The over-produced storyline is apparent from the beginning.  If you can't see past the formula used to put this movie together you're either deaf and watching an uncaptioned version of the movie (if you were lucky) or this is the first time you've been introduced to ""moving pictures.""<br/><br/>3)  The acting in this movie... wow - since it seems that we are limited to 1,000 words in this review, I'll just leave this to one word: whorendous. yes, i misspelled that...<br/><br/>Well, it seems that I must depart and pick up my girlfriend and take her to the mall.

","David McNally's directorial debut, Coyote Ugly, is basically a story about Violet (Piper Perabo) trying to establish her singing career in New York. She soon finds that the Big Apple is harder than she imagined, and finds herself broke and desperate for a job. She acquires one at the hottest, raunchiest bar in town, aptly titled the 'Coyote Ugly', where she has to dance, spin bottles and basically keep the customers happy. Throw in a love interest, Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who encourages Violet to overcome her stage fright and pursue her singing career. Then add her father's (John Goodman) disapproval of her job at Coyote Ugly, and you've basically got the plot.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly is a film that is targeted mainly at teens and is extremely predictable in most areas. The subject is far-fetched, for I doubt I'd attend a bar and risk getting my hair cut off or being doused in water, and I also doubt that four girls and one bouncer could control a massive crowd or serve them well- especially when the staff constantly break into dance on the actual bar itself! That aside, there is some bad dialogue and awkward moments, but the film isn't as trashy as the trailers imply. The film attempts to have substance with it's romantic angle, John Goodman is entertaining as Violet's protective but kind father and the rest of the cast provide adequate performances. Coyote Ugly is far from a spectacular film, the climax is extremely weary and predictable, and the last scene is fairly stupid. But in general, Coyote Ugly is a fairly decent teen popcorn flick, and can be entertaining if you don't take it too seriously! **1/2 out of *****!"
"tb1000","7","1","1","20 July 2001"," better than you would think
","Coyote Ugly is definitely a movie that you wouldn't expect much from, but surprises you along the way.<br/><br/>I must say this was my first time seeing Piper Perabo, and she completely amazed me for a little known and little experienced actress.  Only unfortunate thing is that she didn't sing in the movie.  Jerry Bruckheimer thought that her voice ""was too low"".  But what the hell?  Didn't effect the movie at all because, you really believed it was her singing.  I couldn't tell.  Anyway, she was perfect for this role, gracing it with the sincerity and innocence it needed, to become believable as the small-town girl, trying to make it in the big city as a song writer.  Definitely expect great performances from her in the future.<br/><br/>Maria Bello was great and believable in her ""strong-woman"" role as the owner of the Coyote Ugly bar.  Andy Garcia also surprised me, with a decent performance as Violet Sanford's love interest in the film.  John Goodman stood out with a surprisingly decent comedic role as Violet's overweight father.  And as for Tyra Banks ... well, she was OK, i guess.  Didn't mind her that much, although the only reason she's in this movie is for a little star power to grace the movie posters and trailers.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was decent.  For me, the highlights were Piper Perabo ""singing"" and her scenes with Andy Garcia."

It makes a valiant effort at being about something and the characters are engaging and enthusiastically portrayed, but ultimately there is too much focus on bouncing breasts and bared midsections.<br/><br/>One thing I will definitely give credit for, though...it would have been VERY easy to fill the movie with gratuitous nudity and, as near as I recall, there isn't any at all.  I think it's admirable that the filmmakers resisted the urge to go for the cheap thrills and let the film degenerate into ""Porkys 7"" or ""Showgirls"".

","I expected nothing from Coyote Ugly, and it would be tempting to say that's what it delivered, but I suppose that's not strictly true.  The script was intended as a ""small-town-girl goes to big city and tries to make it big"" story, but was heavily side-tracked by a sappy teen-style romance, not to mention the girl's commitment to her big old clinging but lovable father, and every little friendship she makes along the way.  Throw in a supposedly congenital case of stage-fright, and I'm afraid it came off less like ""A Star is Born"" and more like a really mediocre tv movie. Except... John Goodman, as big old softie Dad, was as good or better than ever.  Ask the man to play a caricature, give him a third-rate director, and he still comes across as not only believable, but consistently FUNNY.  It's not a big enough part that he could rescue this muddle, but it is enough to make it almost worth watching just for him.<br/><br/>Reviewing the IMDB ratings by demographic group, it's clear that the romance was quite effective, the highlight of the movie, for young female viewers, and it's easy to see why.  Piper Perabo is bright and pretty and very good in the part of the nervous hopeful, and you can't help but root for her smart and occasionally spunky character.   Adam Garcia, the young Australian actor who plays her young Australian emigree suitor, gets to take his shirt off and dance on the bar, but it's the character's dedication and loyalty which probably hits the buttons of those who enjoyed this movie.  Guys weren't as impressed, likely because the direction was so inept and shallow that we couldn't feel any kinship with him, and the character comes across as too much of a wise-ass to us. <br/><br/>The women dancing on the bar, and bottle-jockeying sequences were quite enjoyable, but they have only a tenuous connection to the rest of the story. They don't seem to be directed by the same director as the rest of the movie.  The idea, of course, is that we're supposed to see Perabo's character grow and mature during her tenure there, but I'm not so sure the sequences work as well as intended.<br/><br/>The strongest female character in the movie is Lil, the owner of the bar, played by Maria Bello, who looks more than a little like Sharon Stone, and plays a part worthy of her.   In a way, this is another problem for the movie, because she distracted from the sex-appeal of Perabo.  While it wasn't much of a movie, the part that Goodman didn't steal pretty much belonged to Bello, in my book.  I definitely want to see more of her, uhhh, work!"

Yet, the plot works well for this movie.  I found myself being drawn into the story.  The casting was well done, I felt all the actors did a  good job of filling their parts.  The cinematography was visually stimulating without being over the top or relying on any nudity...yes there is a fair amount of skin flashed but not enough to push the rating over PG-13.

","Just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make ""Clerks"". How the hell did they spend $45 Million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.<br/><br/>Anyway, it wasn't an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well."

","I just got back from seeing this movie.  I thought it was awesome. It's true the previews don't give you much about the movie, save that it's about a bunch of fun-loving bartendresses who twirl bottles of whiskey and dance wildly. The movie follows a young woman from New Jersey as she moves to NYC to persue a career in the music business, and takes a ""day"" job at a bar named Coyote Ugly to pay the bills.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was a LOT of fun. Being a woman, I was impressed that the female characters were strong, smart and displayed their sexuality proudly without being sluttish or ditzy.  The music was incredible, even though the acting by the female lead left something to be desired.  I felt the story went in too many directions to really develop any relationships and the editing made for some difficulty in following the movie. But overall the movie was a blast. Great dance scenes and hilarious lines made for an incredible time.<br/><br/>It makes me want to stomp on a burning bar right now!!"

","I loved this movie !! Although I have to say the ad is misleading, as I think the equivalent of this movie that had to do with the bar is at least 25 minutes !! The chemistry between Violet and Kevin was sweet to watch, and also the development of that song she wrote was quite nice as well. This movie deserves alot more credit and they all did a wonderful job in it"

","When I had to talk about originality alone, this movie wouldn't score too much of a good critic. We've seen movie like this - the concept although.<br/><br/>However, the fact that music plays a great part in it, makes it really fun to watch. The soundtrack is partly re-used, partly new, and that makes it for the spectator a great experience.<br/><br/>Some people would say it's kind of a sexistic movie, but I wouldn't think so. The women - although they are dancing on a bar - are presented as real human beings with real emotions!<br/><br/>When you are searching for a movie without much of a story, which makes it lightly digestible, and make you smile, Coyote Ugly is for you!"

","ok this movie was great. I went in to see it for all the wrong reasons and ended up loving it for the right ones. This movie shows the viewer how tough getting a break in the music business is basically. For those expecting nudity...you'll be disappointed. The soundtrack rules, the direction is fantastic (what else can you expect from bruckheimer) and the girls are beautiful. the cameo by Michael Bay director of Armageddon was cool. Generally the film will leave you in a good mood. I wish there were more films like this. The highlight of the film toward the end (which I will not spoil) is one of those moments that gets the hairs on your back standing upright erected and that moment alone is worth seeing the movie twice."
"Ace-38","Null","1","1","30 September 2000"," Nothing ugly about it
","In spite of how it was marketed, ""Coyote Ugly"" features a surprisingly deep storyline about a young woman from New Jersey, following her dreams of becoming a songwriter in New York.  Along the way, she finds work at a local bar--Coyote Ugly.  This experience not only gives her the confidence to work harder towards her goal, but allows her to conquer some of her demons.<br/><br/>Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a girl from small town New Jersey.  Her mother was a songwriter and she inherited that gift from her.  She also inherited her mother's stagefright.  One night, she comes home and find her apartment ransacked.  Seeking refuge in a local diner, she overhears three women discussing their evening at work, and that one of them is leaving.  The owner tosses her a matchbook with the club's name on it, and this starts her on her road to her dreams.  Ms. Perabo makes Violet a character with depth, feeling and emotion.  Violet could easily be your sister, cousin..ect.  Far better job here than what she showed in ""Rocky and Bullwinkle""<br/><br/>Maria Bello appears as club owner Lil.  Lil is a hardnosed city girl, despite her small town upbringing.  She runs the bar as if it is her life, and it is.  Tough, sexy and no-nonsense, Lil is a well written and brought to life character.  It would actually be a joy to work for someone such as her, as you always know where you stand.  Ms. Bello is always good at creating characters, her ""ER"" work being another good example.<br/><br/>Adam Garcia plays Kevin O'Donnell, Violet's love interest in the movie. Good Austrailian accent and a penchant for rare comic books are this characters selling points. He's got a great bit at the bar helping out Violet early on.  Good job Adam.<br/><br/>I'm going to lightly touch on the other club employees for a sec.  Another relative newcomer, Isabella Miko plays Cammie.    A very very sexy woman with a severe shopping habit, Cammie immediately befriends Violet and helps her through the rough early times at the wild club.  Not a whole lot to the character, but she sells what she has.  Bridget Moynahan stars as Rachel, the club's enforcer.  A tough attitude and actions to match, she weilds her sexiness as almost a weapon and whatever you do, dont make her angry. Funny story about her and an anger management course.  I won't ruin it here, but its quite a chuckle.  Tyra Banks got a lot of heavy publicity for her role as Zoe, but it's more of a cameo.  Zoe leaves her job, and that's what enables Violet to work there.  Couple of nice dance numbers but that's about it for her.  She didn't detract from the film, however.<br/><br/>John Goodman plays William Sanford, Violet's father.  A hardworking family first man, he is both proud and torn as his baby girl heads off into the world.  He eventually comes to Coyote Ugly and sees Violet dancing on the bar, water being poured over her.  Angry and ashamed of the newspaper pictures of his daughter, he is unable to tell her how he really feels. John Goodman is every man, every dad. Probably the best characterization in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Coyote Ugly"" packs a great story, killer soundtrack and well-thought out characters into a tight little hour and fifty minute movie and dares you not to like it.  It's hard to deny that this movie is fun for all audiences.  Don't let the gyrating trailers convince you otherwise.<br/><br/>4 out of 5"

","In the tradition of such movies as `Flashdance' and `Footloose', `Coyote Ugly' is surprisingly enlightening.  At a glance `Coyote' is simply a down and dirty bar in New York where bartenders are scantly clad and perform as showgirls dancing on tabletops for a muster of drunken lovesick idiots. At least, that is what the trailer would have us believe.  With an opening night slogan tainted as `The hottest night of the year!', I would expect nothing less.  But unexpectedly I enjoyed the story overall.  Newcomer Piper Perabo dazzles us with her sweet charm, good looks and convincing performance.  She plays Violet, an aspiring songwriter, who moves from New Jersey to New York to pursue a dream in the music business.  Not as a performer, but simply to write songs for other performers to sing.  When times are hard, she lands a job as bartender at the hottest club in the fish-packing district.  Only in the first half of the film must we endure the essential strippers with their clothes on scenario, and try to accept that Violet can tame the savage beast of a bar that is in total disarray, by simply grabbing a microphone, singing to a song, and have us believe that a star is being born.  But as the story moves on, we do enjoy some rather good written music, as well as an endearing story taking place between a daughter and her father.  (Played wonderfully by John Goodman)  She also has a compassionate relationship with an Aussie played by another newcomer Adam Garcia.  Adam is well suited for the roll, and though I felt like I was being a little rushed through there up and down relationship, I think he pulled it off quite nicely.  Overall, I left the theatre feeling rather refreshed.  Considering all the lame scripts we've had to stomach over the last few years, along with all the special effect mega crap flicks that Hollywood has been spoon-feeding us as of late, this movie has the ability to satisfy a wide audience.  From drooling jocks, to trashy girl cosmetic feminists, to dear old dad.  And even though we don't get to see nearly enough of my baby Tyra Banks, with a wonderful soundtrack, and a cast with good chemistry, `Coyote Ugly' delivers."

Maybe for you this is a great movie and you had fun seeing it, that makes you lucky in my book, but me, I had the misfortune to see this movie, not a high point in my day, in fact I watch it now and again just to try to take back from this crap movie whatever it took from me the first time I saw it.

","Small town Jersey girl (Piper Perabo) goes to NYC to be a songwriter.  While waiting to be discovered she serves drinks (and dances on the bar) of a horrible place called Coyote Ugly.  All the bartenders are beautiful, big-breasted, untalented actresses who show as much clevage as a PG-13 rating will allow.  As for the ""plot"" it's been done HUNDREDS of times before.  Every single situation and line of dialogue is yawningly predictable.  But most of the screen time is devoted to the half-naked bartenders dancing and twitching and (naturally) poring water all over themselves.  It's a PG ""Showgirls""!  I started fast-forwarding through them--there's too many of them and they are dull--although I must admit the women throw their all into it and seem to be enjoying themselves--too bad they didn't realize the movie is objectifying their bodies.  And what the hell is John Goodman doing here?  Was he really that desperate for the money?  <br/><br/>There's a few things that save the film from being a total washout.  It is colorful (the bar has tons of little colored lights), the dancing is energetic and Perabo is a good actress and makes for a very liakable heroine.  Also Adam Garcia...he can't act (and what a stupid accent!) but when you look like him, who cares?  He's very handsome and the movie does show him shirtless a few times (definite highlights).

Young girls who don't know any better won't pay any attention to any negative publicity this bile gets, they'll just watch it, vainly hoping that if they look reasonably pretty, and open their legs to opportunity, their life will be a breeze too. The same young girls will probably watch this film in a double bill of a Katie Price/Jordan/Paris Hilton show on the ITV2 networks Thursday slot of dumb-ass programmes.<br/><br/>Piper Parabo is terrible in this movie, although she can't be held accountable for such an unlikeable character. In a key scene which points out what a doxy she is, she waltzes into a record company HQ like she's the Queen of England and demands that they listen to her music and sign her up. Because that's how it happens in real life isn't it? I write reviews on IMDb, it doesn't make me Siskel & frigging Ebert!

Maria Bello as Lil, owner of Coyote Ugly does an excellent job (I loved her explanation of what Coyote Ugly means) whilst Violet is less insipid than most heroines. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of LeAnne Rimes, so the inclusion of her songs works great, although I would have liked for the dubbing job they did on Perabo to not be so obvious. <br/><br/>Adam Garcia (as Kevin) was bland and boring, and even the 'tragic past' they gave him failed to warm me up to him at all, but it could have been worse.<br/><br/>Better than I expected, but not great."

"RockytheBear","Null","2","4","5 July 2003"," Uglier than you think...
","ALL MY REVIEWS CONTAIN SPOILERS.  EVERY ONE OF THEM.<br/><br/>
Whenever I am discussing Tyra Banks, the woman I plan to marry, to other women, without fail, they immediately begin to sip on a tall bottle of Hatorade and dis the hell out of her.  I've heard it all:  She's phony, her forehead is too big, her breasts are man made; all statements in which Rocky the Bear does not care.  My latest Tyra complaint however, intrigued me somewhat.  I was arguing with a girl, a post sex tradition for me, and when she realized she couldn't change my mind regarding my feelings towards the famed Victoria Secrets model, she scraped the bottom of the barrel and said, ""...And what the hell does Coyote Ugly mean anyway??""<br/><br/>At first, I didn't know she was serious, but when I began to ask around, I noticed many women did not know what this phrase meant.  Maybe because it's a guy thing.  Coyote Ugly is a bar or club term, used to define ""a stranger in your bed, particularly one who was fine as hell last night, but in the morning is coyote ugly.""  The kind of chick who is so disgusting, you'd rather gnaw your arm off than wake her up, in the same fashion a coyote gnaws off his leg, if caught in a trap.  Ladies who aren't familiar with this term are probably the same ones who wake up in the morning with a lone bicep under their necks.<br/><br/>Sharp readers out there will probably notice how I am discussing other issues, and not the movie.  I am doing it on purpose.  I am saving you the time, and saving myself the embarrassment of admitting that I actually sat through this travesty of a flick; a flick that not even T&A could save, if you could imagine that.  What happens when you mix a half pint of Cocktail, add two cups of Flashdance, and a shot of Fast Forward?  Actually, you get nothing, but when you stick an umbrella in it, it instantly becomes ""Coyote Ugly.""  Fine a*s Piper Perabo plays ""Violet,"" a New Jersey girl who moves to New York City with dreams of becoming a songwriter.  Everyone in Manhattan treats her like a complete outsider, as if Jersey is on the other side of the earth, and not 40 miles away.  Okay, on second thought, I can understand that.  But what I can't understand is how when she moves to a dump in Chinatown, we do not see a single Chinese person.<br/><br/>After no luck with the music biz, she auditions for a job at a bar named Coyote Ugly.  Three girls work there already, including Zoe, the token, brilliantly played by Tyra Banks.  Zoe is leaving the bar in one week, to go to law school.  This is completely understandable because she only makes a measley 300 bucks a night at the bar (or 78k a year.)  Violet takes her spot as a Coyote, and then the 80s pop era of film, which I thought was dead, begins.  The bar itself is handled very realistically.  Why?  Because the bartenders perform choreographed routines on the bar, as if in a music video.  The NYC fire marshal frequents the bar regularly, yet never shuts it down-- even though every night the place is 100 people over maximum capacity.  Bartenders spit fire balls at the crowd, and on some occasions, light the bar itself on fire for no reason.<br/><br/>The film is one cliche after another, including the following scenes: boy meets girl, girl hates boy, boy shows ""stalker persistence"" so naturally girl begins to like boy, boy and girl have an opening up discussion on the hood of a car overlooking Manhattan's skyline, girl has fight with over protective dad, girl has fight with boy, girl loses job, girl makes up with over protective dad, girl makes up with boy, girl even gets her job back, girl makes it big in the music biz, girl meets LeAnn Rimes.<br/><br/>There.  You've just seen the whole movie, but chances are you've seen this same movie dozens of times before this one even came out.  My only surprise of the film was Jerry Bruckheimer's name in the credits as a producer.  He truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.  Or the most desperate.<br/><br/>

I truly am surprised that nobody tried to shoot ""Jersey"" when she was playing her ""music"" on the roof.  Only her next-door neighbor had it right, by smashing and banging on the adjoining wall to her rat's nest of a hovel (a.k.a. apartment) the very instant she began playing her horrid version of what was supposed to pass for ""music.""  Clearly, there must have been neighboring penthouse units nearby, and unfortunately there was no Vietnam Vet sniper living in one of them to pick her off when she was on the roof.  I guarantee he would have done anything to get her to stop playing. A cat fight would sound better than her worthless renderings.<br/><br/>Do NOT see this movie, unless you were thinking of ""retiring"" your TV with your foot kicked through the screen.  -1,000,000 on a scale of 1 to 10."

","Mostly everyone casts this movie aside until I force them to watch it and than they love it. Jerry Bruckheimer tried to recapture flashdance success and besides making a much better film it also was a hit at the box office. The story is familiar as a small town girl from Sayreville, NJ heads to the big apple in hopes of selling her music. Unsuccessful she picks up at a wild bar called Coyote Ugly where the girls are rough, dance on bars and are master bartenders. She also meets a hunky Australian beau. The movie isn't complex but it is emotionally resonant and overly entertaining. So if you're feeling down it's definitely a pick me up.

","After 20 years, I'd have to say...it doesn't hold up that well. BUT, that's not to say, it brings a tug of nostalgia for that era of Jerry Bruckheimer slick music video retreads of ""Flashdance""
A lot of it is due to Diane Warren's corny soundtrack music. And those of us who were in college by now, have a slight shiver when we hear her anthems. Which nearly toppled another Jerry Bruckheimer gem ""Con Air"" with ""How Do I Live Without You"" Oof.<br/><br/>The present day woman would consider that dis-empowering to be so attached to a man (or perhaps this could be used towards other women). Speaking of which, the topic at hand is ""Coyote Ugly."" Presumably, an article led to this story (written by Gina Wendkos). I recall a friend had moved to New York City and discovered a bar called Hogs and Heifers, which shared very similar rambunctious behavior (nailing bras to the wall). And dancing on bars and so forth. In Jerry Bruckheimer world...it's PG-13. So none of the topless stuff is displayed (unless you get the unrated DVD/Blu-Ray which shows Piper Perabo's funbags).<br/><br/>Though this movie is about making it in the big city, it is somewhat laughable at the truncated timeline. Within a few weeks Violet Sanford (Perabo) becomes the hottest songwriter in the country with a number 1 hit that is sung by Leanne Rhimes. And though these girls are suppose to be world and tough, the painfully model casting of...Tyra Banks, Bridget Moynahan, Izabella Miko and Maria Bello set this in a truly fantastical mystical world I'd reserve for...um...say Hollywood. If that was the intention than kudos to director David McNally. To me, it seems less genuine. Jennifer Beals would seem like a dog up agains these girls.
Any way, great to see John Goodman pop up as Violet's New Jersey dad (though still seems like he can't shake that Dan Conner-ness) and Bud Cort's very small cameo.
Clearly this movie was made to rake in the jiggle factor. So, cheers to them for recognizing what it exists for. Also special note to cinematographer Amir Mokri. Great lighting. I feel this may get a re-release in the future. That will stand up well."

","This movie was excellent.  I was waiting to see this movie for a while, and I was not disappointed.  While the trailer does the movie some justice, the plot was actually good even though it started to get a little predictable at the end.<br/><br/>I did not expect a whole bunch of girls dancing on the bar for two hours, but that wouldn't have been bad.  I had a feeling that it was going to be a girl that was trying to make it in the big city, and it was.

She started to lose that cute country girl look and took on an edge that seemed appropriate for her character.<br/><br/>As for the other girls, even though their parts were small, they played them well.  'Lil (Maria Bello) was very tough as nails, but not as much as Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), who played the violent loner coyote.

"Chowdah","Null","0","0","14 August 2000"," Flashdance+Cocktail+Breaking Away=trashy, mildly entertaining, $$$ generating, bellybutton ring fluff
","I just saw Coyote Ugly, and much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed it. That's not to say it's a good movie.  But, God help me for saying this, it's still enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's basically a remake of the Tom Cruise movie ""Cocktail"" mixed with ""Flashdance"", the exploitation flick that put Bruckheimer on the map. There's scenes showing the heroine taking care of her loveable Dad, and their relationship is reminscient of a really good coming-of-age movie from the 70s, ""Breaking Away"".<br/><br/>The movie has a cookie cutter plot.  The characters are all pretty cliched, and you've seen them a hundred times before.  There's the perky heroine who dreams of following in her mothers' footsteps by making it big.  John Goodman plays her loveable concerned father.  There's a teary-eyed, supportive best friend who hugs our heroine a lot.  There's a worldly older woman mentor/boss, and the ubiquitous cute boyfriend with a ""mysterious past"".<br/><br/>The people and places of New York are squalid, but made palatable and picturesque by the Bruckheimer Dream Factory(tm).  There's lots of incidental stereotypical characters (the horny hollering female executives, the bear-like skinhead bouncer, the snooty William Morris Agency male receptionist, etc etc.).  And of course, as much beer-soaked T&A (masquerading as feminism) as a PG-13 rating will allow.<br/><br/>
This definitely ain't Shakespeare folks.  It's more like Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey staged at a wet T-shirt contest, with our hero dressed in a shiny tank top and cowboy boots.  Our hero's mighty challenges amount to learning how to sing like Leanne Rimes while twirling Jim Beam bottles and line dancing on a bar.<br/><br/>So what makes this movie worth a look?<br/><br/>1) Energy.  It moves along at a good clip.  The story arc is pretty standard stuff, with each plot point introduced and tidily resolved in all the ways they suggest in those ""How to Write A Screenplay"" textbooks.  It was done well enough that I didn't mind being manipulated by the movie.  It's a well worn formula, but when they do it right, it still works.<br/><br/>2) Slick production values.  Everything here is very competently put together.  It's well directed, well produced, and especially well edited. The sets are full of expensive eye candy that distracts you from how dumb the movie really is.  There's lots of cool stuff, toe-tapping music, and pretty colors to look at.  And lots of T&A for the guys.  Oh yeah, and a cute guy who does a strip tease for the girls (at one point, his ""package"" is only barely covered by a bedsheet).  And middle aged women bid for him, so Mom won't feel left out either.  In fact, there's a stock character for everyone at the mall to sympathize with, and enough humor to disguise the fact that this is basically an exploitation movie.<br/><br/>3) Decent casting/acting.  Piper Perabo is a woman from New Jersey in her early twenties, trying to make it in the entertainment biz.  She plays a woman from New Jersey in her early twenties, trying to make it in the entertainment biz.  And she's cute and sweet and innocent looking too. It's a perfect casting.  Everybody else is well cast, and all the performances are good.  You get the feeling watching the movie that they all knew this was dumb material, and just had fun with it on the set.  That fun shows on the screen, and I found myself enjoying the movie because the cast was enjoying it.  I even found myself sympathizing with poor Piper Perabo, when she freaked out upon entering the rowdy Coyote Ugly bar for the first time. It was just like Mark Hamill entering the Alien Bar in Star Wars.  (You know, Piper kind of reminds me of a female Mark Hamill...)  The cast and crew overcame the limitations of the material, and made lil' ole' jaded me actually care about the characters.  Even though it's just a bunch of predictable and manipulative trickery, it worked for me, and I had fun.<br/><br/>4) It was better made than The Patriot.  The Patriot stank.  At least this movie knew what it was trying to be, and was a well executed production. And there were no stupid Tricorne hats in it.  Nary a one.  Thank God for small favors.<br/><br/>The verdict: it's worth a look.  It's a bit of fluff that you shouldn't pay full price for at the theatre.  You'll probably like it a little, but feel guilty because you should know better.  Rent Breaking Away to make yourself feel better.  It's a better movie, anyway."

I wanted to see more T&A.  But, emotions overruled, and so we got stuck with a lame movie that tests the fast-forward button.  We just want to see stories around the bar.

","After I read a movie review for ""Coyote Ugly"" in my local newspaper and watched the trailer for this film, I expected it to be a mediocre picture lacking in plot, depth and clothing. Fortunately, a trip to the theatre to see ""Coyote Ugly"" proved me wrong. This film was an absolute treat. I'll grant it forgiveness for its cliches of the innocent girl in the big city seeking her fortune, the barista babes who befriend her, or the time-honored boy chases girl scenario, or in this case, how the ferociously handsome Mr. O'Donnell chases Violet Sanford.<br/><br/>On the subject of the male lead, Adam Garcia gives a sizzling performance as the dashing Mr. O'Donnell. Female fans in the audience will be thrilled to see Adam Garcia in his prime at the bar, but I won't divulge any details here. (Darn!) Although the film does feature some provocative female rug-cutting, some of the numbers are well-choreographed and pay homage to genres of dance like line dancing or ""Riverdance""-esque moves. The soundtrack takes pages from The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Kid Rock, Third Eye Blind, and LeAnn Rimes, who performs the film's trademark song ""Can't Fight the Moonlight.""<br/><br/>This film has its share of pitfalls, such as the moment when Violet describes her stage fright to Mr. O'Donnell or Violet's weepy friend (why is she in the film again?) Yet on the whole, it was a solid, humorous, cliched film. I would give it **1/2 to *** stars. Thank you!"

However, her stage fright proves to be a barrier to her career so she finds herself having to take a job at a bar where all the bartenders are beautiful women who do exotic dancers and other things to please the customers.  Of course she meets the man of her dreams and eventually gains self confidence.

","Coyote Ugly is every boy's dream. If you are a guy between the ages of 15 and 28. you'll love the film for it's very beautiful leads. Even if this was the worst movie of all time it would still be a hit with the guys. If you're a girl you'll love the girls too. Maybe not for their looks but because they show us what it's like for a woman to be in control and in charge. They'll also like violet's journey to become a song writer and make it in the world. Now i'm 15 yrs old and i went to see tihs with some friends from the ages of 15-18. we fall somewhere in between. our favorite parts were the ladies dancing on the bar tables and pouring water on their beautiful bodies. but i also like movies with some hint of a plot and i think this movie's plot was pretty good.<br/><br/>The story focusses of Violet Sanford who leaves New jersey and goes to New York City to be a song writer. Now Violet has stage fright and in new york you can't just hand over your demo tape to just anybody you have to present your songs in one way or another and for her that means going to open mic nights and performing them herself. She's too afraid to do that so in the mean time she needs to make some extra money. This is where coyote ugly comes in. This is a bar where sexy ladies entertain their guest by dancing on bar tables, feeling on each other, and showing off their beautiful bodies. the ladies are all beautiful and very strong characters. Girls with attitudes. at first for Violet this is just a job but pretty soon she realizes that Coyote Ugly is the place where she'll break out her shell.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good for this kind of film. The standout is Piper Perabo who is on her way to being a great actress. she has a mixture of charm, sexiness, innocence, and talent. Maria Bello is good as Lil, the boss who runs the bar, she's very demanding in the role and she makes you believe that this bar is her life. Izabella Miko and Bridget Manyahan are also good as the sexiest coyote's in my opinion. Tyra Banks who is only in the movie for about 10 minutes is good as the energeti zoe. she's in the films most memorable scenes.<br/><br/>All these critics and people the say this movie is bad or the worst movie of all time need to chill out. movies don't need to have oscar winning plots. they just to need to entertain and this one most definitely entertains."

","Here's one of those movies that could easily have been an ABC movie of the week, or maybe that would be pushing it.  Rather one of those movies they show on a women's network, like Lifetime, in the afternoon.  When it comes down to needing a compelling dramatic problem, the heartbreak of stagefright is not usually the one chosen.  But there it is, hope that's not a spoiler, but essentially that's it: Girl comes to big city, wants to be songwriter, but darn it, can't sing in front of people.  Interesting thing is she doesn't have any trouble getting up on a bar and getting doused with beer and water by other women.  And that's the part of the plot that actually makes sense.  There are all kinds of slow spots, so deadening, you'll have ample time to get a bucket of popcorn, use the restroom, knit a sweater and get in some golf and still be back in time before anything even remotely interesting happens.  The movie is sold as a ""get their testosterone and hormones pumping"" thing for teenage boys, but it's really a ""chick flick"" about the dreams and aspirations of a beautiful young woman from small town New Jersey.  Seems like the advertising execs knew watching  a young woman sit around trying to write a song would not make for great TV commercials.<br/><br/>Another problem is the massive plot holes and omissions--seems like the heroine is sending song tape demos to everyone and his brother, but then within the space of about thirty seconds she magically buys a computer, becomes knowledgeable about how to use it and the sequencing software and the disc burner and the mixing technology and boom has a demo disk after she burns a cd and then for some reason we're not clear on, ... well, figure this is not a plot driven cinematic endeavor.<br/><br/>That the flick actually got a PG rating is somewhat mystifying since there's not much in the way of nudity, bar dancing and all, and less violence than you'd see on a tv cop show.  This one should have been left for TV production where you are not out seven bucks and two hours, since all you need do is turn the dial.

We were both surprised at how much we enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Most of the main characters (Kevin, Violet, Mr. Sanford) were quite endearing to the point where I actually cared about what happened to them. Many times I sit through a movie where, by the end, I am not even aware of the characters' names, let alone feel any emotion for what may or may not happen to them.<br/><br/>Maybe my opinion of this movie is somewhat biased because I have a life dream similar to Violet, and by seeing it I can pretend for a few hours that it's actually happening.  Sometimes you need to be a little delusional for a couple hours.<br/><br/>For anyone who likes guys (and believe me, I do), Adam Garcia should be reason enough to make a trip to the theater.  From what I saw of him in the commercial I though he would be mildly attractive.  I have to say, Australians have the sexiest accents in the world.  He is an attractive man and a terrific actor.  I look forward to seeing him in other films in the future.<br/><br/>All in all, I learned a lesson today.

This movie offers something for everyone, whether it be attractive women controlling men completely, a great sound track, an aussie hunk, a decent love story, comic relief, a great new talent in Piper Perabo, or the time tested lovable antics of John Goodman... Coyote Ugly delivers.  What the critics seemed to have forgotten the occasional attraction we simple moviegoers have to a movie that is just fun to watch.  When it comes down to it, that is all Coyote Ugly really is, a fun movie that provides a solid two hours of entertainment for an audience weary of pumped up thrillers and human dramas that leave you in a far worse mood that if you had never even heard of the movie.

","This movie is cool.  In addition to flying beer bottles, there is a plot. It's about Violet Sanford, a small town girl who wants to sell her songs in the big city.  She doesn't want to sing them, she has stage fright.  But when a robbery leaves her broke, without a job, and without prospects in the big city, she gets a job as sassy, spunky Jersey, a barkeep at the trendy Coyote Ugly.

","** Spoiler alert but there's no way that could possibly ruin your experience of this flick** I realize that panning this movie is as easy as my subject line, but, come on, this girl has to move 42 miles to NYC in order to become a songwriter? Please.  I drive farther than that to work every day.  Why can't she live at home and write songs and take the train into the city to peddle her songs. Oh, sorry.  It was in the script.  That's why. Even a hick that lives in Mississippi knows you don't just walk into Sony Music Publishing and say ""Please please listen to my tape"".  And I know my girlfriends always sit around in greasy spoon diners in the middle of the night in NYC betting on fav movies of this month's centerfold.  Of course, when you have robbers that know to look in the freezer for money but don't bother to steal ""big-time-songwriter equipment"" (or does she leave it on the roof of her apartment building rain OR shine?), I guess you don't worry about those things.

","Well to put it quite plainly, I've seen better but I was amazed mainly by the leads storyline.  While the other Coyote girls were not really given a backstory, I was rather impressed at how the Director just chose to stay focused on Violet's character and her relationship with her dad (a rather impressive Blue-Collar performance by John Goodman), her boyfriend, and the other Coyotes. All in all I'll just say this....Not bad for a Bruckheimer film."

","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This movie at times is done on the level of T.V. movie. The father daughter relationship in the film isn't all that deep. It is pretty one note and predictable.  The film then has go to with the overly sappy and happy ending. For me, it just didn't ring true. It could have with something with a bit more edge, considering the subject matter and setting of the film. It needed more a Boogie Nights kind of ending. Call me cynic, but that is what I think. The film at times resorts to lazy writing. The father (John Goodman) and Daughter (Piper Perabo) have fight after he finds out what she does. Goodman gets into some sort accident and winds up in the hospital. Through that things are patched up and all better. Too many films resort to that sort of thing to the characters back together. It is not very imaginative. The film could have found a different way to patch things up or have the less happy where everything all happy and gooey. 4/10"
"Jim Griffin","Null","0","0","5 October 2001"," Hollywood at its worst (big, big spoilers!)
","The Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer partnership, which had spawned such corkers as Crimson Tide and The Rock and such crap as Top Gun and Days of Thunder, was disrupted somewhat by the untimely death of Simpson in 1996. But aside from the company logo, nothing has changed on-screen since then. If proof of their soulless, mass-production technique was needed, this is surely it; with one half of the team dead, the artistic content hasn't changed in the slightest!<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly, though a Bruckheimer solo project, has the worst features of the brainless 80s fantasies that were the team's trademark.  It is a film so banal, so puerile and so immature, that it could have been written by its teenage target audience.  Only a 13-year-old could be convinced by its glossy tale of hardship, only a 13-year-old could be surprised by its ending, or interested in anything that comes before it.<br/><br/>The constantly pouting Piper Perabo plays Violet Sanford, a small-town gal who wants to make it in New York as a musician.  Her dad doesn't want her to go because it's a scary place, but she moves anyway and finds success isn't as easy to come by as she'd imagined.  It's genius, isn't it?  You can imagine the writer suddenly being hit by inspiration, jumping for joy as the idea forms in her mind, realising this is a story that has never been seen before and simply has to be brought to life on the big screen, then waiting six hundred years for cinema to be invented.<br/><br/>I've honestly never seen a movie so wholly dependent on cliché.  There is literally nothing original in this film.  That's not sarcasm, it's not petty sniping or an exaggeration; literally, actually, undeniably, nothing. Every last moment is predictable.  Anyone surprised to find Perabo's apartment small and badly decorated has never seen a film before.  Anyone amazed by the burglary or disappointed by her lack of success in the first few minutes is as stupid as people who think `Baby on Board' stickers actually prevent car accidents.<br/><br/>For the pre-pubescent girls in the audience there is a love story shallow enough for them to relate to.  The supposedly-charming Adam Garcia is the love interest, and the will-they won't-they tension that surrounds the fledgling couple is diminished slightly by him being the only man in the city she actually talks to!  We should probably assume the script said there was chemistry between the two leads, but it never made it past the page - they are both gorgeous, and that seems to be enough to convince us they're a good couple that we should be rooting for.  But this is a romance so infantile that when Perabo first meets Garcia, he follows her through the dark streets of New York at night, says he's staring at her ass, and she finds it charming!<br/><br/>There are attempts at gritty realism and at showing the hardship and heartbreak of having your ambitions frustrated, but these don't last beyond the second reel.  This is Bruckheimer, and realism was never on the agenda. The few scenes that show us the bad breaks in the big city are followed by a cheesy ending and a happily-ever-after for the lead characters that render them insincere.  It follows the three-act structure precisely, giving us first the ambition, then the hard times, then the triumph.  I yawned my way through all three.<br/><br/>This movie should be held up as the example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood.  It's cynically unoriginal, painfully infantile, constantly banal, and so vacuous it could suck the audience out of their seats and into the screen.  There are so many reasons to hate this stodgy turd.  Seeing Garcia buy rare Spiderman comics in a diner is one of them; seeing the character whose soul purpose is to ask what Coyote Ugly means is another; and suffering the shameless cameo of LeAnn Rimes singing the crappy theme song is the most irritating.  I hate this movie, I resent it wasting a hundred minutes of my life, and the only thing more annoying than a film so ruthlessly efficient, so pointless and so banal, are the preteen idiots who actually like it."

","Since Jerry Bruckenheimer also helped produced Flashdance, I suppose it's okay to rip off yourself - but it's not exactly like ripping off Hitchcock.<br/><br/>This is an excellent 30-minute movie - unfortunately, the actual running time is much longer. However, if you've seen more than 10 movies, you can tell exactly when to fast forward and the movie is like a pleasant music video with one cliche after another.<br/><br/>And in some aspects, it's so ludicrous that you do have to stop and watch it unfold - in a bar where the bartenders: dance on the bar; perform pole dances; girl-on-girl dances; hose either other off and; practically strip  Piper's character is apparently so captivating that she is able to stop a Navy tailhook-like gang-molestation and a full scale bar riot by singing along to a jukebox.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the water-downed drinks at Coyote Ugly but for us, the viewer, her ""captivation"" eludes us. We're just left to ponder all the scenes they threw out so they could have this grand turning point.<br/><br/>On the bright side - I'm glad Piper got the gap between her front teeth fixed - her acting is less distracting. She's pleasant enough and so is everyone else but this is a story we can all come up after being yanked out of our beds in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>Quick - her dad is a blue collar worker who hears his daughter wants to move to New York to become a songwriter - how does he react?<br/><br/>Quick - what happens when she tried to submit her songs to record companies & publishers?<br/><br/>Quick - what role will she fill in a bar where the bartenders are just adjectives: hostile biker chick, slut, black girl and acting-tough boss?<br/><br/>Humm, I wonder. Well, that's about as much thought as Jerry Bruckenheimer put into the plot of this movie. In theory, this movie was directed by somebody but it not very apparent.<br/><br/>Oh, and Michael Bay shows up as a photographer and proves he's as good an actor as he is a director. But I guess he gets his SAG card and he can certain use the $600 dollars (or whatever the minmum is now) to offset his 2 years on Pearl the Harbor.<br/><br/>See it on cable after you TIVO or tape it - do not spend more than 30 minutes of your life on your movie."

So after some debate I did.  He was so right! This was a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Violet Sanford is a small town New Jersey girl who moves to New York City to pursue her dream of being a song writer.  When she gets there she finds out it's not as easy as it seems.  After approaching all the music studios with her tape she finds that no one will even listen.  She goes to this club and meet Kevin this cook that she thinks is a big music director.  She gives him her tape and learns, after he's already got her tape he's not who she thinks he is.  She's completely upset and then comes home to find that her shabby apartment has been broken into and the money her friend gave her is gone. She goes to a diner almost broke and very depressed and that's where she sees them--The Coyotes.  The guy behind the counter tell her where they work and she goes there and gets hired.  At first she has trouble keeping the job because she's very shy. She almost got fired 2 times then she goes back to get the tape from Kevin and he asks to see her again.  He wants to know where she works and all she will tell him is that she's a coyote.  Well he finds her and with his help and their blossoming love for each other she finds her way. It an amazing film with wonderful party and dance sequences as well as a good love story.  It's a story of finding yourself and finding success in the big city.  It's also got that element of love that I so love to watch. It's a great movie, definitely worth the time."

","This movie has a good heart. I'll give it that. The trouble is that said heart is buried under several acres of unpleasant, filthy, sweaty flesh. Adding an empty-headed, unsympathetic heroine was also a mistake.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>It starts out as a ""little girl hits the big city"" story, and indeed the theme from the Mary Tyler Moore show would not be an inappropriate theme song. Violet moves to New York with dreams of becoming a lyricist. The music industry rewards her for her fresh-faced optimism by crushing her like an insect under their collective heel. Her apartment is robbed. Even when she has a chance to perform her song at a ""get discovered"" nightclub, she balks when one idiot starts heckling her. Finally a waiter gives her a hint that a handsome Australian working at the diner at which she is eating is a mogul and wants to hear her demo tape.<br/><br/>Alas, it was all a cruel jest and the fellow is actually a short-order cook. He immidiately sees the setup, and tries to let Violet down lightly, but she gets mad and storms off. How is this his fault?<br/><br/>Eventually, Violet sees a bunch of tramps who seem to be pretty well off, and a series of events lead her to Coyote Ugly, where the scantily-clad waitresses dance on the counter to the delight of the inebriated patrons. Of course, this is the perfect springboard for an aspiring songwriter, n'est-ce pas? After accidentally hosing down the fire marshall (long story), Violet must make enough money to pay the fine. How? Our hapless Aussie has returned with the demo tape that he forgot to return, and Violet gets revenge for his kindness by auctioning him off (prostituting him, really) to the highest bidder. (Maybe Coyote Ugly would have a bit more money on their hands if they would stop wasting alcohol by using it to set the bar on fire and pouring it all over the waitresses.) To whom do our sympathies go?<br/><br/>In any event, Violet retains her job as a Coyote while her ""boyfriend"" tirelessly and without a complaint tries to get Violet a leg up in the music industry. When a scuffle breaks out, Violet calms them with a song, which is pretty high on the Big List of Stuff that Only Happens In the Movies and learns to conquer her stage fright.<br/><br/>But why make Violet so hard to sympathise with? When her boyfriend sets up an artificial audience to rehearse in front of, all Violet wants to do is take off her clothes and seduce him. Finally she performs her song practically in the nude, save a curtain-like drapery.<br/><br/>In the end, once again at the ""get discovered"" nightclub, Violet balks yet again, merely because the same idiot is back. Only after one of her coyote friends decks him and her boyfriend turns out the lights (she performs best in the dark) does she continue. Why is she so inhibited all of a sudden? Maybe she could do it if she took her shirt of and poured booze all over herself.<br/><br/>Violet's poor Aussie friend is tireless and devoted, and hardly gets a scrap of thanks. Instead, he gets auctioned off, insulted, and stood up, even when he puts his prized possession on the line and almost loses it. Violet even auctions off her FATHER at the very end for no logical reason at all. How sweet!<br/><br/>Perhaps the moviemakers realized how featherweight this all is, for they plastered the adds with nothing but dance footage. Indeed, this movie sinks pretty low to keep the audience's attention. When Violet is shopping for clothes, the camera lingers on her silhouette, just in case you were planning on going to the bathroom or the refund booth. A completely pointless scene shows a baseball game. Why? So we can see just a little more cleavage in a place where people may have realized how pithy this movie truly is.<br/><br/>But still, the saving grace is John Goodman as Violet's father. (Is it me, or is Goodman getting better as he gets older?) He can be funny and heartful at just the right times, and his character is a good one. Otherwise it's all fluff.<br/><br/>There are some parts of the movie that are stupid, illogical, and smutty, and there are parts the are cute, touching and funny. When this movie is good, it is very, very good, and when it is bad it is horrid."

Since participating as an audience member of this particular picture, I have become a die hard fan of Adam Garcia/Izabella Miko.<br/><br/>However, the movie's only downfall is the lack of history of the 'Coyotes'. A little more screen time for Lil, Cammie and Rachel wouldn't have hurt but the movie still rocked.<br/><br/>The script was smooth and travelled at a leisurely pace that enabled the audience (or any Coyote Ugly Movie fan) to become absorbed within the film's plot.<br/><br/>Over all, a fantastic movie that can make you cuddle up to your loved one or get up and pull out the moves for the wicked soundtrack."

","Coyote ugly is a recent installment of a series of movies by Jerry Bruckheimer that lacks originality and, worse yet, is just plain predictable.  In short, it's a bad version of Flashdance.<br/><br/>Anyone who has any sense of plot sees from the start of the movie that the star--Violet--is going to make it to big time after undergoing a growth process where she learns to kick her stage fright and be the star she was allegedly born to be.<br/><br/>This movie is just bad.  For one thing, Bruckheimer, who has made a few decent movies in his career, would have you think that a star is born when Violet karyokes to Blondie's ""One Way or Another"" song.  Bruckheimer wants you to think that Violet's moment is special, once in a lifetime--watching a girl katyoke to a song should be retired to the dustbins of overplayed top 40 hits.<br/><br/>Violet's boyfiend, played by Adam Garcia, is a bizarre character.  His presence in the movie is awkward.  Perhaps he was aiming too low in appearing in this movie.  Judged by his natural feel for acting, Garcia has a promising future and, as such, should avoid duds like Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>Why John Goodman?  What possessed him to be in this movie?  Goodman really was the shining star in this movie, nothwithstanding a respectable performance by Garcia.  One would almost assume that Bruckheimer used Goodman to lend some credibility to this wannabe Flashdance disaster.<br/><br/>Do NOT see Coyote Ugly.  It's dull, predictable, and downright stupid."

And at the same time we understand why her father is disappointed. A fine part played by John Goodman. At times their relationship reminded me of the one Madonna and Danny Aiello had in the 'Father Don't Preach' music-video. Father reluctantly sees his daughter grow up. And she only wants him to be proud of her.<br/><br/>After I saw the trailer on television I immediately went to the REAL Coyote Ugly Saloon on 1st Avenue on which this film was based (unless there's another one, of course). The real bar is not nearly as flashy as it's celluloid counterpart. But they DO hose down annoying customers with beer and there IS dancing on the bar. However by the female customers, rather than the waitresses. But they do get fresh with you if you happen to order something they don't serve. (anything besides beer and Jack Daniels) And they do drink shots with the costumers. Funny detail is that in the movie is explained why they don't get drunk.<br/><br/>I know, I know, we already have Flashdance. (Also from Bruckheimer) but I don't mind if this type of story is being updated now and then, right? Although the soundtrack could sound a bit more contemporary."

","It's a story we've all heard before - girl from Hicksville moves to New York to make it big in songwriting.  Girl finds New York hard to break, girl meets boy, boy falls in love with girl, girl gets a couple of breaks (not the songwriting ones that she was hoping for thought), girl eventually falls in love with boy, songwriting career falls to the back burner.  Girl realises dreams are not being realised, girl gets ticked off with boy, boy gets the flick, both are miserable.  While girl is miserable she does something to realise dream. Dream is realised, credits roll.  End of movie.<br/><br/>There is no serious thought needed to see this film.  Plenty of beautiful people to look at - which satisfies both the men (all the dancing chicks at the bar) and ladies (Adam Garcia ... phwor!!!) alike.  A marked departure from the action flicks that Bruckheimer normally produces and it works reasonably well, albeit in a sugar sweet way."

","""Country girl moves to the big city to chases her dreams and meets a boy in the process."" Sounds a little cliched doesn't it? I expected this to be a shallow feel-good film that was only worthy of watching on video. How pleasantly surprised I was. Finally a non-sci-fi American movie that's not about life somewhere in L.A.!<br/><br/>This is a good solid story. Not that this sort of coming-of-age thing hasn't been done many times before. It was the style with which it was exectued that caught my notice.<br/><br/>The all-American Piper Perabo playing the lead role of Violet `Jersey' Stanford was convincing consistently throughout the film. There's a lot of talent there. John Goodman was his usual brilliant self, although this role wasn't one where he could really stretch his wings. He's proven his talents many times before in roles such as `Walter Sobchak' in The Big Lebowsky.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is impressively not too focused on all the latest hits which was good. Classic songs by INXS and EMF gave film a real kick. The cameo appearance of Leanne Rimes wasn't overly obtrusive. It had the potential to be extremely corny, but I think they got away with it. Strange how Violet's otherwise beautiful songwriting turned into something a bit more Britney-Spears-ish when it came to the final song performance scene.<br/><br/>Unlike most other American films which include an Australian character, it was pleasing to note that at last they didn't write all those cheesy ""That's not a knife"" lines in. This guy was just playing himself. The Australian-isms were all very natural and true to life. And thank goodness there was no need for him to do any lines in an American accent - there's nothing more embarrasing to watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>The sets and shots of New York City were nicley done and not too gratuitous. (i.e. There was no Empire State, Statue of Libery, etc..) Some nice lighting effects in the grimy apartment buildings.<br/><br/>All in all a very well executed film. I give it a 7 out of 10."

","I actually liked this movie.  Not because it had a believable plot, rich characters, witty dialogue or standout performances.  It didn't. But what this movie did have was energy, a catchy soundtrack and a large dose of fun. <br/><br/>From the trailers, the movie didn't appear to have a plot.  I was surprised to find that it did, albeit a very weak one.  Had this plot been handled by a more experienced screenwriter or a producer other than Bruckheimer, this movie may have been better received by the movie going population and may have elevated itself above the ""Pathetically Cheesy"" category. <br/><br/>
Taking all this into consideration, the movie is still an enjoyable watch....one of those ""Bad but Fun"" movies.  The catchy soundtrack, rowdy dance scenes and the adorable performance of Adam Garcia (Mr. O'Donnell...comic book collector extraordinaire) are what saved this movie for me.  As a kid, I enjoyed the likes of Flashdance, Dirty Dancing and Footloose....all dance movies with great music to keep your feet tapping and will leave you singing the tunes for days afterward.  Coyote Ugly, while not as good as the above mentioned films, is still a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>So when the credits rolled and the chorus of ""Man, that sucked"" resounded throughout the room, I just kept my mouth shut....<br/><br/>You won't tell anyone, will you??"

In critiquing this film I, therefore, will not have to talk about how wonderfully delighted I was to find that it had some substance.  Or how nice it is that it was not as bad as I thought it would be.  You see, it is after all a bad movie.  <br/><br/>I think I understand the advertising angle on this one.  If it had been touted as a drama romance people would have expected more.  Instead they pushed the T&A, and let word get around that it was not as bad as the trailers attest.<br/><br/>This movie is a 'girl goes to the big city to make it big' movie with the inevitable charming, city-smart boy along for the ride.  Nothing wrong with it at all, for a lowest common denominator, nice little story movie.  I rate it at a four out of ten, a four for ""not great, not horrible, don't bother."""

He usually makes action movies(with strange yellow lighting and a catchy piece of music) and I wouldn't expect him to create romantic movie on how tough life in the big city can be, even if you pursue your dreams. I liked the fact that they picked Piper Perabo as the main character. She has the potential to become a pretty good actress. The problem with the movie is that it's not really heading anywhere. It's just a story about a succesful bar in the ""Big City"". Of course there is the love story, but I found that fairly predictable. John Goodman is a real cool father by the way, without him the movie wouldn't have been as funny. Despite the lack of storyline it's still a pretty nice feel-good movie!"

","Coyote Ugly has elements of everything including a likeable, easygoing storyline, amazing visual effects, uplifting soundtrack and a collection of characters within the plot which are hard to not care about. The one factor which does appear obvious is that the film does not appear to go too deeply into anything such as its plot, characters etc etc, but who cares?? I have now seen Coyote twice and enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. Recommended for both sexes alike, the men will particularly enjoy the former models which set the bar alight (and not only with the aid of liquor and matches). Definitely a DVD purchase, when in need of something to lift me out of a bad mood this feelgood film will certainly help. The cast put in strong performances, especially Maria Bello as the ambitious Lil and John Goodman as Violet's comical father. Kevin O'Donnell will now no doubt carve a niche as a new heart-throb and rightly so, he's one fit geezer. All in all Coyote Ugly is no masterpiece of film-making but an excellent all round attempt, which I would recommend finding the time to go and see before it leaves the big screen."

Finally she kisses her rural North Amboy, NJ (and her dad, John Goodman) goodbye and leaves to find fame and fortune as a songwriter in New York. The usual cliches follow: unanswered demo tapes, the burglary in her flat, the daily struggle for survival. <br/><br/>Things turn better when she is tried as a new Coyote: a barmaid in the underground bar Coyote Ugly (because ""Cheers has already been taken""). First she is everything a young girl from the countryside is supposed to be: naive, clumsy, bashful - a contrast to the in-your-face attitude of the other barmaids. <br/><br/>After a long and weary fight behind, in front of and on the bar, she is accepted as a Coyote, even putting her boyfriend and some open mic night chances aside. This phase of giving up her dreams for the easy money is really saddening. <br/><br/>Finally her dad, boyfriend and girlfriend intervene  out of different reasons and get her on her first open mic night, where she is once again confronted with her stagefright, but is overcoming it (for sure we need a happy ending here).<br/><br/>The conclusion: an open-hearted, sometimes amusing, sometimes melancholic display of a young woman, her dreams and fears. Peppered by some hot bar scenes (well there has to be something for the guys) and some real hot music (can't wait to lay hands on the soundtrack) this is a wonderful movie. (Don't ask me whether LeAnn Rimes is doing a cameo for the former or latter reason). <br/><br/>And - doesn't Piper Perabo sometimes look like Alanis Morrisette (or for the older generation: like a young, up-and-coming Carole King) ??"

","Coyote Ugly.  ****. USA, 2000, Directed by David McNally starring Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia, John Goodman.  I went to see this movie without my wife.  She decided from watching the trailers and see the ads that it was some dumb T&A drunk guy bar movie.  I mean that sounded OK to me; but I was really surprised.  `Coyote Ugly' is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year.  `Coyote Ugly' is the best romantic comedy that I've seen since `Notting Hill.' Violet Sanford (Perabo) is a young woman from small town New Jersey and she's moving to the Big Apple to seek fame and fortune as a song writer.  Her dad (Goodman) and her friends don't want her to leave.  Her best friend reminds her that they have never carried through on any of their dreams (preserving their virginity, going to college, going to beauty school) so why does she want to pursue her dream of being a famous songwriter?  But Violet is off to the city, where she naïvely goes from one agency to the other trying to sell her songs.  Needing to earn money she ends up working at `Coyote Ugly' serving drinks and dancing on the bar.  All the familiar plot points of a romantic comedy follow and you just know everything is going to end up happily ever after.  And it does.  But there are a number of things that make `Coyote Ugly' a good movie.  The acting is good.  John Goodman is especially good as Violet's father.  All the girls at the bar are good.  Garcia is good as the boyfriend and love interest. Another thing I liked about the story is the persistence of the main character.  When life was getting her down, she'd have a good cry and go back out and kick some butt.  She stuck to her dream and worked hard to achieve it.  In the end she has friends, family, the promise of a carrier, and a boyfriend.  The more I think about this movie, it's not a movie for oafish guys who want a T&A moment.  `Coyote Ugly' is a movie that young girls should go see; a really good date movie; one of the best movies of 2000."

Well, I was completely wrong!  The movie actually turned out to have a story...even if it was sometimes cheesy and predictable.  The plot is about a young girl who aspires to become a song writer but has a terrible case of stage fright.  She eventually seeks out a job and joins a group of girls working at a bar in NYC called Coyote Ugly.  Although the story line is rather predictable and even though I wouldn't call the movie oscar worthy (god forbid), it was nevertheless very entertaining and a good choice for a Friday night out with friends."

And I must admit, my buddies and I were part of the huge public that figured this is going to be a great T & A movie.  Well, we were right; however David McNally went and snuck in a great, yes great, story. At first it may sound like just another small town girl moves to big town in hopes of making it big.  And you're right, but this isn't just that, it's laced full of great acting by Piper Perabo, Maria Bello, and the great John Goodman. Violet Sanford (Perabo) wants to be a song writer and saves all her money, from working at the local pizza place, to move to New York City.  Naturally her dad, William Sanford (Goodman), doesn't want her to go.  She inevitably moves out, and into a run down apartment in ""The City."" <br/><br/>There she encounters every problem imaginable trying to get her songs heard by music execs.  She meets Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who at first lies to her and says that he can get her tape heard, but finally gets found out. Instead of getting hurt, Violet begins to fall in love with Kevin. When all desperation is coming to an end, Violet meets a manager of a bar, Lil (Bello), and ""auditions"" to work for her in the bar.  As the preview shows, this is not your regular corner bar.  Violet, now ""Jersey"", has a horrible first night, but sticks with it, and by the movies end, is the best one at the bar. The movie does have a few sappy scenes, and I actually did get a little choked up at one particular scene with Violet, and her dad, but all in all this is a ""feel good"" movie. That's not to say that there is nothing wrong with the movie though.  I think, being a mere 91 minutes long, that it is a bit short, and probably could have gone into Violet's childhood a little.  And I didn't feel anything for the love interest in Violet's life.  I didn't care for the choice of Adam Garcia for this role. This movie definitely has a great deal of T & A, a wet T-shirt scene come to mind, but it's much more then that.  Please trust me when I say that this is a MUST SEE movie."

Piper Perabo is the one casting that elevates above the low level material. She dreams big and works the bar to get there financially but much of this is predictable. Maria Bello as her boss is a total stereotype. Adam Garcia as her love interest is a useless prop for predictable romantic drivel. John Goodman as her father never rises above the humour level. A pre-talk show Tyra Banks even gets cast in this film. While the film is popular, it doesn't divert the horrible clichés and lazy writing.

Something I truly loathed was the amount of annoying pop music, that almost kept me from sitting through  it. It isn't exactly as bad as some of the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it's definitely no masterpiece. Most guys will probably watch it just to see the girls dancing, but the good thing is that they can watch it with their girlfriends, since it does feature a lot of girlie stuff. So watch it with your girlfriend, and you'll probably both like some parts of it; it's not as horrible to sit through as the truly bad teen movies(read: Crossroads), but it does take some effort.

At one point of the movie we are told why the bar is named Coyote Ugly - entrance ""funny"" joke that isn't a fraction cliche by now - ""because X was taken"". Whee. Actually contrary to most people I guess, I didn't find one of the female cast attractive. You know this thing food. They should try it. They all just look anorectic to me. Which leads to another problem, the total absence of acting in this movie. Nobody can act, especially not John Goodman, it's as if he tried to act really bad but making it turn out even worse in the process. This film, aimed at teen girls primarily, also sends out many messages that are very unhealthy in my humble opinion. Alcohol is nothing bad, ""looking good"" is another word for being an anorectic and yes of course you will become an actor or a singer or whatever if only you work hard enough.

Still it's one of those guilty pleasure movies people don't admit to watching and enjoying. 12.30.13"

","Coyote Ugly stars Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia together with Maria Bello,Izabella Miko,Bridget Moynahan,Tyra Banks and John Goodman.It is romantic dramedy about an aspiring musician from New Jersey who tries her luck in New York becomes a bartender.<br/><br/>Violet Sanford dreams of making a name for herself as a singer and songwriter.She move to New York to make a name for herself but she found out that it won't be an easy journey towards it as her music is constantly rejected by music producers.This temporarily led her to becoming a one of the attractive female bartenders at Coyote Ugly that flaunt their skin while dancing and serving drinks to the male customers.She also finds a new boyfriend in Kevin O'Donnell.As the story goes on,we see Violet get into many problems and conflicts with bar owner Lil,Kevin,her father,her fellow barmaids and having stage fright when performing.But in the end,she manages to overcome these obstacles and her dreams ultimately come true.<br/><br/>As always,there is nothing refreshing and groundbreaking in it as we have seen the plot elements in it in previous movies.The story was definitely clichéd and predictable as the viewer can see how everything will come out for Violet in the end.The only thing I could say is that it definitely will provide enjoyment to the male viewers especially when the attractive barmaids show parts of their skin while dancing and it also would be a form of a stress reliever for people looking to relax while watching it.Added to that,it can also be form of an escapism as well as feeling good which it does effectively.But viewers looking for an intelligent film should stay away from it for they will feel disappointed."
"alympiaedwards","9","1","2","2 May 2014"," Classic movie ""Coyote Ugly""
","Coyote Ugly, released in the year 2000 is still to this day a favoured film. It's a 12 rated romantic comedy/drama based on the existing Coyote Ugly Saloon, which stands in New York just as this film is set in. The running time is 100 minutes. It's directed by David McNally, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman, written by Gina Wendkos and stars Adam Garcia, Maria Bello, Izabella Miko, Tyra Banks and John Goodman.<br/><br/>New Jersey girl Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) leaves her hometown, her father Bill (John Goodman), and best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) to live up to her ambition of becoming a songwriter in New York City. <br/><br/>Whilst everything was going wrong, Violet results in visiting an all-night diner and notices three girls, Cammie (Izabella Miko), Rachel (Bridget Moynahan), and Zoe (Tyra Banks), flaunting the hundreds of dollars in tips they earned. She then finds out that they work at a trendy bar named Coyote Ugly. She decides to find the bar and convince the bar owner Lil (Maria Bello) to give her a shot at it. Whilst in the process of trying to please Lil, Violet ends up getting cosy with Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia). Kevin commits himself to helping Violet overcome her stage fright so that she can sell her music.<br/><br/>She then feels that she can proceed to pursue her dream, and performs at an open mic night at the Bowery Ballroom with the Coyotes, her father, her best friend, and Kevin all there for moral support. The performance goes exceptionally well and she finally lands a deal with a record label.<br/><br/>I believe that this film can be loved by millions of people, and that it will never get old. Not only is it a brilliant film, it can show people that as long as you appreciate the support you have and believe in yourself, you can conquer anything,"
"savvas172007","7","1","2","5 February 2011"," My favourite one...
","OK. I know it's definitely not the best film ever made, but it's my favourite one. I watched it when I was 11, and I couldn't resist on its magic. My sister owned the OST, and there were many times per month I used to listen to it. Anyway, I think that the whole story of a girl coming to the big city, full of dreams and no money and finally makes it, is totally motivating. I suppose many guys will think I'm stupid loving a chick-flick, but keep in mind that it's also about a bar full of bartenders singing, dancing and... showing what they've got!!! But, it was also a great film. I've watched it more than 15 times ( I stopped counting four years ago), and I gather it's gonna be the movie I'll be watching in future... If you haven't watched it, run and rent a DVD or blu-ray disc of it... A night full of joy is guaranteed."

"jacob-l-williams","7","1","2","30 June 2010"," Almost good... but in ultimately ugly.
","Coyote Ugly is a film that I have to admit I was looking forward to watching, I'm not normally a fan of rom-coms, but this film had been described to me as a raunchy teen drama so I thought it was worth a watch. However imagine my disappointment when I realised it was basically just a boy meet girl film all over again only with a bar where girls dance and sing.<br/><br/>After 15 minutes I was bored and ready to turn it off when there came a scene that made me stick around to watch the rest, the scene is when Violet is having breakfast and the other ""coyotes"" walk in. The scene isn't a fantastic one but it was enough to keep me watching and I have to admit I enjoyed the film for a small time in the middle. <br/><br/>It was thrilling to watch the girls dance of the bar and the way in which customers where served and pelted with water if they ordered it, it was just a shame to see it ruined so soon and revert back to the badly written rom-com it had begun.<br/><br/>The last ten minutes are in all honesty probably the worst last ten minutes of a film I have seen in a long time, honestly beginning with the toll booths stupid light flashing, the ridiculous u-turn the turning off the power; then Le-Ann Rhymes appearing and everyone being happy it was stupid and to end the film with the biggest cliché of all other than a freeze frame... a slow motion kiss, was ridiculous and took away all the enjoyment I had from the mid-section of the film.<br/><br/>This film is not raunchy and it is not a teen drama, my friend has lied to me and I cannot help feeling that nearly two hours of my life has been completely wasted and wish I had turned it off after the appalling start.<br/><br/>5/10"
"nicnaws","10","1","2","27 July 2008"," GREAT movie~
","I really liked this movie. I loved the fact that Violet was determined to move to New York and pursue her dream (something I've wanted to do since I was 6 years old) as a singer. This movie really inspires me to compose music (NOT dance on a bar! - LOL). I thought that Kevin had some awesome dance moves, and he seemed like an overall nice guy (something I have a hard time finding for some reason). He tried his best to cure Violet of her so-called ""stage fright"", which I can proudly say I have FINALLY overcome after years of jamming' parties and karaoke! She never gave up, even after her apartment was broken in to and it seemed like the whole world around her was falling apart. Her father finally came around, and all it took was a car accident! HAH! And I betcha he married his nurse! Overall very entertaining, and I give it 2 thumbs up!"
"TOMASBBloodhound","6","1","2","8 June 2008"," More watchable than it probably deserves to be.
","The director listed for this movie is someone named David McNally. Who? The writing credits are given to Gina Wenkos. Who? Actually Kevin Smith apparently did some work on the script, I hear. Anyway, there is only one name that matters in these credits. Jerry Bruckheimer. Of all the slick, commercial, featherweight productions this man has made, this one might be the most slick. And that's saying something. Coyote Ugly almost makes Days of Thunder look like Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is often rather entertaining. Much of the credit would seem to go to Piper Perabo who plays the main character. Her name is Violet, and she's just moved to New York to pursue a song writing career, but it seems like the big city will swallow her up before she ever gets her chance. She ends up taking a job at the bar of record, and the rest of the film details the ups and downs of her time there. It must be noted that Piper Perabo is not only beautiful, but quite charming and likable. As someone watching the movie, you really hope she succeeds. A bad casting choice here could have really given us a turkey of a film. The rest of the cast is spunky, and generally talented. Maria Bello shines as Lil, the owner of the bar. She is actually based on Lil Lovell who was the founder of the franchise. Adam Garcia shows some promise as the male lead, but its a thankless role. John Goodman adds some laughs and acting gravitas as Violet's dad. Tom Brady's baby momma Bridget Moynahan is there as a bitchy bartender. A chunky LeAnn Rimes plays herself in an ending scene. She also provides the vocals whenever Piper is singing. Tyra Banks isn't in it as much as you'd hope.<br/><br/>There is not a shred of credibility in any situation we the audience are presented with. For example, the Coyote Ugly bar is about the rowdiest bar east of the Double Duece in Jasper, MO. Yet, there is only ONE bouncer who sits by the door and mostly just reads. Fights in this bar can be broken up simply by throwing a bucket of ice down on the crazy patrons. Violet lives in Chinatown, yet there are never any Asian people around. Kevin seems to be broke and has to do all kinds of odd jobs around town, yet he drives a huge gas-guzzling old car when public transportation would be the likely choice for such a person. Or how about the scene where Violet has just humiliated herself and is hiding out in the bathroom. Another bartender gal informs her that there is a guy at the bar asking about her. ""Asking for me?"", Violet asks, completely stunned. Because obviously nobody in a bar full of drunk men would ever ask around about a hot new employee. Sure. But this film takes place in a magical dimension known as Bruckheimer Land, where the improbable is not just possible. It is demanded. You know, here's a big question..... since this film was such a hit, why was there never a sequel? Since 85% of all films released from Hollywood now are either a remake, sequel, or based on a comic book, why was no sequel for Coyote Ugly ever made. Heck, this summer we're getting sequels for Hell Boy, and the Hulk. Those weren't even hits!!! 6 of 10 stars for Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"segacs","3","1","2","23 December 2006"," Just plain awful!
","Does any of this sound familiar: Small-town girl goes to big city to pursue her dreams. Small-town girl faces obstacles in the big bad city. Girl meets some tough-talking friends and does some ethically questionable things in pursuit of her dreams. Girl meets perfect guy who sweeps her off her feet and believes in her. Girl makes all her dreams come true.<br/><br/>If you've heard it all before, you're not alone. ""Coyote Ugly"" breaks no new ground, takes no risks, and doesn't even have any decent acting to redeem the movie. It's almost painful to watch Piper Perabo trying to decide whether her character is tough-and-sexy or sweet-and-innocent. She gets neither quite right, and in truth should've just gone for ""porn star"" because that's how she comes across.<br/><br/>The script is laughably awful, containing lines that surely made movie audiences across the nation groan aloud and roll their eyes. The plot - such as it is - is utterly unrealistic and offers us nothing in the way of insight, profound thinking, or even lighthearted laughs. Some men (mostly teenaged boys) may like this because it features good-looking women dancing on a bar... but even those scenes are fairly tame compared to most of what you'd find in your average PG-rated flick these days. The movie sets back the cause of empowerment of women by at least five decades. Oh, and the soundtrack blows. In fact, there are almost no redeeming qualities here whatsoever.<br/><br/>So why the three stars? I'll give one star alone to Maria Bello for her performance as the bar owner who turns out to have a heart under her tough-as-nails exterior. And I'll give another star to the dance sequences, which, while tame, were at least fun and mildly energetic. The final one is for John Goodman, who has one of his worst roles here, but is a cut above anything else in this mess.<br/><br/>Two hours of my life I wish I could have back."
"Tarna85","2","1","2","23 November 2006"," coyote ugly........
","Coyote ugly tells the story we've all seen a million times, yet i think a plot like girl-next-door moves to big bad city could still work if the script could be spiced up a bit.<br/><br/>A good actor can do wonders with a bad script (if the director lets them) and a great script AND great direction can bring out an outstanding performance but in this film Piper whatever her last name is couldn't even do that and after wondering why, i came to the conclusion that she just simply can't act and her 'performance' is what let the film down.<br/><br/>I couldn't emote with her cause her acting had no depth. In the scenes where i was suppose to feel sorry for her, i didn't. She doesn't have any screen presence, and she reacted to lines BEFORE the other had said it. I can't believe out of all the takes they did that these takes were the best.<br/><br/>Adam Garcia had not done much screen acting at the time but his performance was okay.....he didn't need to characterize at all so all he had to do was stand there and say the lines and hoped it sound convincing. I was entertained by his little jiggy on the bar for about half a second but the film could have done well without it.<br/><br/>The bar scenes were just stupid, i didn't enjoy them and from where i come from you don't have to be wild and crazy to get up on a bar and shake your ass. There was nothing seedy or shocking about it in fact i was worried about the patrons safety when they started spraying water everywhere and going by piper's reaction to people dancing on a bar, obviously she had never been out of the house and to a party.....<br/><br/>This film will only be enjoyed by teenies. So if your 18 and over save yourself the time and avoid coyote ugly."

Not because of the romance involved (how lucky Piper Perabo was 2 kiss and get involved otherwise with Adam Garcier), but because of the whole singing and desire 2 follow her heart. I too sing, and am starting a drama course at college in a few weeks.<br/><br/>The film shows how hard and cruel life can be, deterring girls from thinking that getting into the music industry is easy. Violet took the plunge at the end, she never gave up fighting for what she wanted. Coyote Ugly Rocks!!!! A well wrote and superbly acted film, give Coyote Ugly credit where due!"
"joseph952001","Null","1","2","14 August 2006"," But - Where's Rosanne?
","I accidentally tuned in on this movie on Cable over the weekend. What a pleasure this film was. This was an excellent relief from all the realism on the T.V. and in most of the movies today. Bette Davis was correct that in todays T.V. there's too much realism. I agree. Anyone can play realism in the movies or on T.V.. You see it on the streets and in the news. This is acting? Of course not. The problem with Coyote Ugly, with most people, is that it's just good old fashioned entertainment to take you out of this lousy world we live in with nothing but a bunch of psychotics and neurotics you have to deal with everyday of your life. The reason that I love the Jerry Springer show is that everyone on his program is so over-the-edge that it's entertaining, and that's what made the movies years ago so great to watch. They could take the worse script there is and make it believable because they knew their craft - acting! This film has everything in it. A girl down on her luck. Falls in love. Has a Father than doesn't like what she's doing, but comes around. Goes for the Gold in life, and finally succeeds. If you think about it, this movie is almost a modern remake, in many ways, of ""The Jazz Singer"".<br/><br/>I loved every foot, minute, and second of this movie, but - with John Goodman playing the father, I almost expected Rosanne to show up and yell out, ""Dannnnnnn! Becky's working in a trashy bar!"""

The outline of this small town girl going out in search of her dreams in NYC, really provides a positive outlook for anyone wanting to get out their home with their parents and be out on their own in the big city. Before this movie, I had never heard of or seen Piper Perabo or Adam Garcia before, but now whenever I do see them in a movie, I remember what a great performance they gave in Coyote Ugly, and just that motivates me to see that particular movie. Definitely see this movie, because you won't be disappointed by any means. It's the perfect film for all people with all different tastes in movies. I'm not one to watch something over and over again, so that definitely says something."
"bethaneybailey","8","1","2","4 June 2005"," A perfect mix of sexuality and romance.
","Coyote Ugly was the first movie to make me declare my devotion to a single movie as my ""favorite."" Having only been ten years old when I saw it and immediately liked it, I'm assuming most pre-teens nowadays will enjoy it. In fact, I will venture to say that it appeals to all types of people, as it is not your typical ""chick flick"", but it is certainly not a movie solely for men who see the cover and immediately pick it up, wanting to see chicks dressed in skimpy outfits and dancing on a bar.<br/><br/>The film's stars are displayed in the film at their absolute best in both acting and appearance. Piper Perabo kick-started her movie career with her leading role, later being cast in the family favorite, Cheaper by the Dozen. Adam Garcia was at his very cutest in this film. A couple of years after the film was released, he appeared in Riding in Cars with Boys, playing a forgettable role for anyone not a die-hard fan of his acting. In this film, however, he and his charming Australian accent shine undeniably as the boy-toy of Piper Perabo's character. This film also launched the costars into stardom, and even the actual bar Coyote Ugly, which is located about an hour away from my hometown.<br/><br/>As the old saying goes, you should never judge a book by its cover. This film may appear to be targeting a predominantly male audience, but it is also a brilliant blend of coming-of-age wisdom, family crisis, and romantic drama. It presents all aspects of Jersey girl Violet Sanford's life and journey to stardom with smart humor and inopportune situations. Featuring a few timeless songs on its intelligently varied soundtrack, it creates a vibe with absolutely nothing to criticize.<br/><br/>This being one of my favorite movies of all time and featuring my favorite song of all time, I am quite convinced that this movie was created flawlessly and would appeal to all audiences, but I tend to be very opinionated. However, if you are looking for a movie that you can watch with your friends OR your spouse on any given weekend, I would highly recommend giving Coyote Ugly a try. Recognizing some of your favorite actors of the present will undoubtedly be only half the fun."

I found it full of clichés i.e small town girl trying to make it in the ""Big City"" as some kind of struggling artist, her apartment gets broken into, she's down on her luck and then gets hired to be a well paid Coyote. However, despite all of the ""cheese"" I found John Goodman's performance to be one of his best. I'm not sure if his performance appeared to be one of his best because the abilities of his cast mates have a lot to be desired or if he truly gave a good performance. I also have to admit that I have not seen everything that John Goodman has been in so I can't comment on all of his performances. I just thought it interesting to note that such a poor movie could have a quality performance."

","Piper Perabo is a great new talent to watch. Her acting ability and style to her role in this movie is a pleasure to watch. Her behind the scenes interviews, shows she is a hard worker and will do what it takes to get the job done. I also enjoyed the performance of Bridget Moynahan, her acting and timing as Rachel, worked very well with Piper Perabo, when she started at working at the bar, replacing Zoe. Veteran John Goodman plays a perfect single father, trying to care and do the right thing for his daughter and in the end helps her make the right decision.

The movie follows all the necessary steps (work sucks at first, meets boyfriend, work's getting better, boyfriend is great, breakdown at work, break-up with boyfriend, thinking about returning, chat with dad that she has to stay to make it, finally makes up with boyfriend and makes it in music industry). Now, we've all seen it before (showgirls comes to mind), but it's carried out really good in this movie.

"kpickette","2","1","2","15 April 2003"," The worst!
","Coyote Ugly was made for boys between the ages of 13 and 16. One of the worst movies of the year. Not impressed with this one by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Con Air,"" etc) <br/><br/>Piper Perabo (""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"") -- a wide-eyed beauty from central casting -- is the movie's generic ingenue, a girl named Violet from small town New Jersey who moves to New York to pursue her dreams of being a songwriter. Of course, even though she grew up just down the turnpike from Manhattan, she's as naive as a farmer's daughter and learns the hard way that peddling your demo tape to snide receptionists at record label offices isn't going to get you anywhere in the Big City.<br/><br/>
So instead of becoming an instant music biz success, Violet finds herself working at the meat packing district's wildest road house, Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>
Staffed by 102-lb. sexpots who habitually shake their stuff atop the bar in size two leather pants and tank tops, the joint is packed wall-to-wall every night with hooting, drooling patrons that the girls tease like pole-dancers to coax drinks into them and money out of them. <br/><br/>Written in Screenwriting 101 style, packed with every New York City cliché in the book (her dank, dingy flat is broken into her first week in town), and overflowing with young girls in wonderbras while dancing, the first half of ""Coyote Ugly"" plays like it was penned by a 13-year-old boy who just discovered masturbation. For the second half, the script must have been handed off to a 13-year-old girl who thinks Britney Spears is the greatest musical talent the world has ever known, because the rest of the movie is launched by a ""Face it dad, I'm not your little girl anymore"" speech and built around Violet overcoming stage fright and chasing her dream of selling bubble-gum pop songs - aided, of course, by the charming encouragement of a handsome boy (Australian actor Adam Garcia) who just knows she can do it!<br/><br/>
And yes, Violet sings. A lot. It's an endless source of unintentional comedy because when she's slinking across the bar at Coyote Ugly, singing along to the jukebox (each Coyote girl has a gimmick, that's hers), Perabo warbles in her own, weak and gritty voice. But when belting out one of the acoustic Lilith Faire-lite ditties she hopes to sell some day, suddenly she's a honey-voiced songbird, courtesy of audio looping by jailbait country music star LeAnn Rimes (who has a cameo in the finale). <br/><br/>Another hearty laugh stems from the fact that ""Coyote Ugly"" takes place in a picturesquely gritty, fantasy version of NYC in which a 21-year-old cutie pie bartender can walk down an alley at 4 a.m. in a 15-inch skirt and knee-highs, counting her tips without a care in the world.<br/><br/>
On the respectability front, the picture's one saving grace is John Goodman, who is blue collar perfection as Violet's modest, toll-collector pop.<br/><br/>
But even though ""Coyote Ugly"" is tedious, obvious and badly staged, it does have an infectious spirit. That's hardly enough to save this one aimed at the can't-wait-to-be-21 crowd."

","Ok I have been waiting for months for this movie to come out and yes i will admit the only reason i wanted to see it was because there was many hot women in this movie.... at first.<br/><br/>Then I read the reviews and saw it it got 1 and a half stars in my local newspaper and I was kinda of thrown off by it but because i had read a plot summary i decided to give a shot. Lemme tell you I am so happy I saw this movie. Not only are the women in this movie trey hot but it is an emotional movie as well. Of course those harsh critics who went for a complex plot and in depth character development and guys who went to see it just for the chicks are going to say it sucked because they didn't go to see the movie to be entertained they went for T&A (which because its pg-13 i knew wasn't gonna happen). Well not only did this movie please me it almost made me teary eyed (and i do not cry at movies at Titanic I didn't even come close I laughed at my friend who did). And because Pierabo is so sweet and innocent-looking she sold me. So in my final analysis if your looking for a date movie this is it, and if you want to go to the movies to critique it because you knew you were going to hate it anyway then don't. If you liked High Fidelity or Keeping the Faith, you will be pleased.<br/><br/>P.S. To all you Coyote Ugly haters, you probably thought Battlefield Earth was a classic or perhaps Sphere"
"Shiva-11","6","1","2","4 August 2000"," It wasn't as bad as I thought (of course it may just be the hormones talking)
","Coyote Ugly: Coyote Ugly: Rather than follow the classic script - marry your high school sweetheart, settle down in a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 kids and a dog named spot, Violet sets off  (against her father's wishes)  for New York to fulfill her dreams as a songwriter.  Our heroine soon discovers that life in the big city isn't easy, and getting noticed in the music business is even worse.  In order to make ends meet she gets a job as a bartender at a local bar. Let the games begin.<br/><br/>I've always found it interesting that women (at least the ones I know) will go to a movie, no matter how bad it looks, as long as their favorite star (Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, etc) is in it.  I can't stand the thought of an actor I enjoy being in a lousy movie, and tend to avoid them like the plague.   But all that came to a crashing halt when I saw the trailer for ""Coyote Ugly"" - I didn't think ""Hey, this is the movie based on the GQ article"" or ""This looks like an interesting story"".  The only thought that came to mind was ""Wow!""  So much for my credibility<br/><br/>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, known for such testosterone laden dramas as ""Con Air"" and ""The Rock"",  has dropped the guns and explosions in favor of bars and bombshells (the non-exploding kind) in this homage to ""Flashdance"". The first half-hour of the movie is like a trip to a strip bar with several notable exceptions: the girls look better, they keep their clothes (what little they happen to be wearing) on, they can actually dance, the crowd is mixed and everyone is having a great time.  Furthermore, you don't have to worry about a cover charge, choking on smoke, or paying $6 for a watered down beer.  Unfortunately, they choose to spoil the fun with a ""plot""- it seems that our little Violet has performance anxiety and gets involved with a cute do-gooder boytoy.  Will she triumph over her fears, become a success, and marry her Prince Charming?  Honest, it's not predictable (note: heavy sarcasm alert!). They should have spent more time in the bar and less time in reflection.  Story aside, there actually are some good performances.<br/><br/>The casting call for the part of Violet involved hundreds of girls and I can say without fear of reprisal or recrimination that they found exactly what they were looking for in Piper Perabo - she is cute, dynamic and possessed of a wide-eyed innocence that is genuine.   Not only does she have to look adorable, but she had to take piano, guitar, and singing and dancing lessons for the role (doing quite well at each I might add).  It was also a pleasure to see Maria Bello once a again - she was the no-nonsense-tough-as-nails doctor on ER who quit to pursue other interests and whom I feared would join David Caruso at the ""Home for Abandoned Actors"".   If your script calls for a ""Gutsy Broad"" she's your woman.  The one piece of casting that sticks out worse than sunflower in a field of tulips is Tyra Banks - her character retires from the bar to go to law school.  Please, the only way I'm going to buy that one is if I've had one too many drinks beforehand - I would try to diminish her successes in any way, she is a beautiful, successful, vibrant woman, but by her own admission, if you're looking for brains from her, you had best look elsewhere. <br/><br/>In summary, if you are searching for a tightly written cohesive plot, beautiful cinematography, suspense, or deep characters, this is not the movie for you.  If however you want to watch the beautiful people have some fun and don't feel like thinking for awhile, this may make for an entertaining matinee."
"hatebreed","10","1","2","21 March 2004"," I think it is a good story
","I saw the movie and I think it is a very good story. Forget a litle bit about the image. It tells a story of a girl chasing her dreams, despite her stage fear she as to win and she finally beats the stage fear. For me, thats what this movie is about, a small town young girl who leaves her home place, to pursue her dreams, who finds herself in a distant, diferent, and wild place (New York City), and despite all that she makes her dreams come true. Its a good lesson. The script was cool, well written, the feelings of the characters are involving, and whith great deph. It is not only a movie where good girls shake themselves in a bar, as some people think, it is much more than that. The best actor was certainly Jonh Goodman, as Violet's father. Piper Perabo's performance, has Violet Sanford was well made, she was able to give that inocent/country girl style. The older coyote Lil(Maria Belo)has a leader and boss, but with origins a litle similar to Violet, was a well atchieved performance. One of the highlights of the movie, is Leann Rimes song ""Can't figth the moonligth"", one of the best songs I have hever heard. In fact it is one of my favorites."
"Ken-208","4","1","2","9 August 2000"," Shallow and Boring
","About the only thing this movie has going for it is it has a few cute girls in it.  Other than that there's not much reason to see it.  The story lacks interest. The emotions and acting seems fake.  You don't really end up caring about any of the characters and the music really isn't that great either.  This is more or less a made-for television movie that really can't justify paying money to see or rent.  <br/><br/>In fact if I was watching it on television I probably would have just changed the channel.  MTV has more pretty faces, better music, better dancing as wall as many other channels.  Stay at home and watch TV rather than waste your time and money on this dud.  I'd give this around a 4 out of 10 stars.  Another recent movie called ""Center Stage"" is superior to this movie and has a similar story (girl goes to big city to be discovered). Rent or see that movie instead of this one."

It was nothing like ""Flashdance"" or a female-""Cocktail.""  The dancing was minimal and the close-up shots of boots on a bar is hardly dancing.  New-comer Piper will get better roles but she should continue taking those acting lessons.  Adam Garcia showed the most potential to breakout.  Maybe it's just me but did anybody else think he looked like a blend of Dylan McDermott & Ralph Macchio?  The movie was derivative and cliche.  The soundtrack was the only good part.

Each one alone, isn't much of a story, but together they make a real good tale.<br/><br/>It is by no means without it's flaws...you were never sure if it was a feel good, heartwarming tale of the girl trying to make it big, or the sometimes dark and seedy environment of a bar that takes female empowerment to a whole new level. It's best moments are when it's both. It shows a more human side to the girls at the bar, and adds more depth to Perabo's character.<br/><br/>No, this movie isn't for someone looking for an Oscar winner. It isn't. Some of the acting (read Tyra Banks) is weak. Some of the story is too good to be true. You may not like what it has to say about men...or women for that matter.

If you've seen any of the ones I mentioned, or have lived on this planet for longer than five months, you can see it all coming a mile away. <br/><br/>
The plot (you should excuse the expression) is paper thin, the acting is amateurish for a high school play and the biggest complaint of all is its not bad enough to be good..its just bad enough to be bad. <br/><br/>
I DID enjoy seeing Melanie Lynskey, who was so memorable in 'Heavenly Creatures' and she did a passable New Jersey accent.  I guess you have to pay bills, but I hope she gets better opportunities in better movies before she is stuck in the second female lead forever.  <br/><br/>I enjoyed Perabo much more in 'The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle' but part of that could be because she is not carrying the whole movie with that one.  She does not have the screen presence necessary for you to even consider the possibility that you are seeing a future star.  She might be a legit actress someday, but you can't tell from anything seen here.  She is not helped by a dreadful script, though."

","This film ""Coyote Ugly"" gets it name from the bar where the girls work, apparently a real bar of the same name in NYC, but this film was shot on a set. The lead actress Piper Perabo was chosen from about 4000 girls, and she does a fine job, very believable as ""Violet"". In fact, her life leading up to this film paralleled the character very closely. She looks a little like both Jennifer Lopez and Sarah Jessica Parker, and delivers her lines much like Parker would have.<br/><br/>Storyline - young Violet, mother dead, father (John Goodman) works as toll booth operator on the NJ Turnpike, she decides to move to NYC to realize her dream of being a successful songwriter, against dad's wishes. Meets all usual obstacles, rejection, apartment is robbed, broke, she quite accidentally finds about Coyote Ugly as one worker/dancer is leaving. Not ""her cup of tea"", she perseveres anyway. Also meets a nice young man who also helps her get over her fear of performing on stage.<br/><br/>Although it looks like Perabo does her own singing, as we learn on the DVD extras, Leann Rimes does all her singing, dubbing her voice to match Perabo's vocal style. Rimes also does an appearance near the end. Goodman is his usual good self as dad.<br/><br/>The DVD has selectable sound in either DTS or Digital Dolby 5.1. I selected DTS and the surround track was fine. There were a couple of ""glitches"" in the video, but overall was just fine. ""Extras"" included a commentary track by the ""girls"", which is fun to listen to, but not particularly helpful in understanding subtlties of the film. There are deleted scenes and short features on how some of the stars were selected. <br/><br/>Anyway, the film is a nice story, has some fun barroom action and dancing, no violence nor bad language, and only subtle sex suggestions. A good, fun movie for young and old alike."

It's not worth either the money for the ticket or the VHS / DVD. A typical ""Chick-Feel-Good-Flick"", one could say.

The few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the ""tragic"" accident of the father, the ""difficulties"" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on.

Nah.

But, I'm afraid not. They seem to have cut this down to a sequence of little ""nice"" moments which don't fit together very well, so the result hardly involves at all.  The script wasn't funny (apart from the occasional quip by John Goodman), and the ideas upon which the film were based were silly and not-very-clever-at-all.

Nevertheless my basic problem with this movie is that our hero (yes - she might be talented and some of her songs sound good in the beginning) needs almost the whole one and a half hours to fight the fear of getting on stage. Finally she makes it BUT it is her last time on stage - because she prefers to be a song writer. OK... Whatever... Then what the heck is this movie all about?

","A talented young woman from New Jersey, filled with hope and desire, moves to New York to chase her dreams of becoming a songwriter in `Coyote Ugly,' directed by David McNally and starring Piper Perabo.  Against the wishes of her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to show business discovers:  It's tough out there.  Soon, in order to pay the rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her `audition (work one night)' to see if she can handle their kind of action.  It's a tough gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if she's to succeed.  And that is really what this movie is all about:  Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all through. 	Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh, somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character makes it easy to connect with her right away.  She becomes someone you care about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately.  There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as an actress.  John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter at heart. His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional bond between them and the audience.  It's something with which many will be able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the film. <br/><br/>	One of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the movie itself, but from the `promotion' of the movie; in this case the theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what `Coyote Ugly' really is. Certainly the `coyotes' and the bar are a significant part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by the preview.  It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a profane word, and no sex or nudity in it.  It is an upbeat, entertaining film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one would expect simply from seeing the trailer. The excellent supporting cast includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a cameo as herself).  Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will gain the audience it deserves.  Reminiscent of `Flashdance,' there is a universal theme here of having a dream and going for it.  In the final analysis, `Coyote Ugly' is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's ever had or pursued a dream.  Do yourself a favor, put any preconceived notions aside and check this one out; I think you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 7/10."

The story is way too familiar - small town girl goes to the big, dirty city to sell her soul, I mean songs.<br/><br/>In the case of Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo), one too many rejections land her way in over her head in a gofor-broke party bar with the unlikely moniker of Coyote Ugly. Big bucks to be had, but you've got to earn them the hard way. Tossing bottles of Jack with the finesse of a swaggering Tom Cruise (remember ""Cocktail""?), brazenly shakin' your groove thing (that pesky ""Flashdance"" again), and maybe even belting out a song or two (""Little Voice"" anyone?). Violet, affectionately renamed Jersey, catches on to the after-hours ropes, but doesn't let go of her dream. Oh, you've heard this one before?<br/><br/>Not a whit of imagination, but every predictable moment is drenched with an emotion closely resembling heart. Violet tackles the bright lights of the big city and the love of her man (hunky Adam Garcia) with let's-put-on-a-show gusto that's endearing in its struggle to seem genuine. With her big-hearted Dad (John Goodman) to show her the way, there is no mountain high enough to keep Violet from making her show-biz fantasies come true.<br/><br/>I poke fun, but the truth is the package works like a big old fun house mirror. Images are not always what they seem. Coyote Ugly is one bog party, where zany girls light the bar on fire (literally) and burn the floor with some frisky moves. When the action is elsewhere in the sprawling jungle of New York City, it looks gritty in an artsy, artificially lit way. The plot twists and turns can be seen coming from a mile off, but much is forgiven when the costumes are tantalizing and the dreams burns bright. Excellent psychological approach...<br/><br/>Perabo, the month's ""It"" girl, works her story with effort. Her chemistry with just about everybody - from the bitchy bar dancers to her best buddy from home - is vintage good girl clicks with the universe. Bar dances are a disappointing, quick-cutting mishmash of leather-clad thighs, kick-butt boots and bare midriffs. Relentless strings of pop tunes wear thin early on. A mixed bag, but one that's chock full of delicious eye candy."
"Anonymous_Maxine","2","1","2","8 September 2000"," Unfortunately, the Internet Movie Database only allows 1,000 words, which is not nearly enough to sufficiently communicate how horrible this movie is.
","The drawback of watching the huge amount of movies that I watch is that you find yourself watching the same previews over and over again. I saw the preview for Coyote Ugly so many times that I was sick and tired of the movie before it was even released. I was unable to decipher any kind of plot from the preview, and the reason is simple. If the producers had allowed the preview to reveal the extensively recycled and re-done and re-made and used up plot, no one would have bothered to watch the movie. From a business point of view, that's very understandable, and I respect the decision not to reveal how shallow this movie is too early on. However, after seeing the entire film, I have realized that Coyote Ugly is packed full of every cliche ever created by every unoriginal and boring film ever made in cinematic history.<br/><br/>(spoilers) Young kid decides to leave home to pursue wild dreams in the big city. Encounters difficulties, gets robbed, decides to go home, father encourages her to keep trying, success is inevitably and laughably attained. I accurately predicted at least 80% of everything that happened in this film. Did anyone not know that there would be a robbery at her new apartment in New York? Was anyone surprised that she would have some sort of superficial problem getting her music heard? Is it that hard to predict she would succeed at the end? <br/><br/>Okay, I'll admit that if she failed, the movie probably would never have been made (what a relief that would have been). You can't put a Fight Club ending or an Arlington Road ending on a movie like this. But look at the way the entire movie panned out. Violet was completely isolated from reality during the entire film. Think about the logic here. Violet goes to New York to become a star, but obviously has trouble getting a record executive to listen to her music. She goes home one day to find her apartment robbed. This is the pathetic attempt to make it seem like the real world, but even if it did do that, this is where it stopped. For the rest of the film, everything worked out perfectly. The first guy she meets becomes her wonderful new boyfriend. The first group of girls she overhears in a diner are talking about the lucrative jobs they have, and how one is leaving and there will soon be a difficult effort to replace her. This very same bar happens to be the hottest bar in town, and when Violet inquires about the opening, she is hired within minutes. You gotta be kidding me.<br/><br/>Besides all that, everything that happened in the plot is just recycled garbage that has been seen dozens of times before. Violet finds a cute new boyfriend. They get in the usual fight somewhere in the middle of the film, and when she tries to call thinking she wants to apologize or something, she hangs up a split second before he grabs up his receiver, anxiously saying ""Hello? Hello?"" to the usual dialtone. She goes to his house to make things right, and just as she shows up, he's got some girl walking into his apartment (THAT was the most predictable element of all). But wait! He's not sleeping with her, he's showing her the apartment to see if she might want to move in! He's a sweetheart after all! How about Violet's job? Obviously some problem has to come up (the suddenly lonely parent, as always, winding up in the hospital), and she has to get fired at least once. When she does, she decides to get a job at a quiet little restaurant (which, for some reason, doesn't seem to have electricity), but eventually goes back to her old job. The bar scenes were both laughable and ridiculously exaggerated. No bar in the world looks like that, and even if one did, there would not be scantily clad female bartenders dancing on the bar every few minutes, and even if there were, there would be about 50 bouncers, not just one. You would think a policy or two would change when the airheaded blonde Cammie was pulled into the crowd and fondled by a bunch of drunks. I guess nothing came of that because she didn't seem upset about it at all. Every bar scene in this film was the result not of skillful filmmaking, but of audience manipulation.<br/><br/>What a pathetic waste of time. Everything in this movie has been done before, and it has never been done worse than it was done here. Even though New York City is portrayed terribly, at least they thought to throw in an acute bit of stage fright for Violet so she would have a problem that coincides slightly with reality, even though this was also ridiculously unoriginal (ever see Runaway Bride? EXACTLY the same thing). Coyote Ugly is an awful movie. It follows a formula that is more easily decipherable than the script, and it is the kind of film that will probably be hugely entertaining to you if you have never seen a movie. If you don't like being jerked around at the movie theater, avoid this garbage."

","I knew about this film for two reasons, the big actor from The Flintstones being in it, and the successful song, I was certainly interested, from director David McNally (Kangaroo Jack) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air). Basically Violet Sanford (The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle's Piper Perabo) is an aspiring teenage songwriter, and she finally gets her dream of going professional going when she leaves home and heads for New York City. She finds herself a place to stay, but her efforts to give her demo tape to a music producer are useless, and then her apartment gets broken into leaving her with nothing. Feeling useless she gets some lunch with what she has left, and by coincidence she overhears some girls who work at a bar as they say goodbye to worker Zoe (Tyra Banks). This leads Violet to the Coyote Ugly bar, run by Lil (Maria Bello), who gives her a chance behind the bar to experience what goes on, and Violet is surprised to see that it is a very raunchy bar, the girls call the shots, they thrust moves on the bar counter, and the attraction of what pulls in the punters. Lil warned her that she may not last long at the bar, but after meeting Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) she learns more of the ways of the city, and gains a bit more confidence to work in the bar, she also auctions him off to get money she needed. But what she really needs is confidence on stage, as her demo tapes aren't gaining the interest, so she needs to sing the songs herself live and maybe get some attention that way, and Kevin tries to help her with her stage fright. One night while working in Coyote Ugly there is an incident that causes a fight, so Violet grabs the microphone and sings along to the song on the jukebox, Blondie's ""One Way or Another"", and that gains the bar some more punters. Violet's toll-booth father Bill (John Goodman) does find out about the bar and doesn't approve seeing what goes on, and there is a point when he has a car accident, but he survives and supports his daughter with any decision she wants to make. After having a disagreement with each other, Kevin returns to give her confidence as well, and she completes a new song ready to present at a live show for newcomer singers, musicians and writers. In the end, Violet initially still has stage fright, but Kevin helps her and she gets through her song gaining high interest, and of course in the end a professional singer, LeAnn Rimes comes to Coyote Ugly to perform her song with her, and a proud Bill gets auctioned. Also starring Izabella Miko as Cammie, Bridget Moynahan as Rachel, Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey as Gloria, Del Pentecost as Lou and Johnny Knoxville as College Guy. Perabo is pretty good in the lead role, Goodman gets his humorous moments, including that scene where he lies about eating a vegetable meal when it is in fact KFC and going ""yum"", the raunchy is obviously very easy to enjoy, the music soundtrack is all good, the story is pretty much a cross between Flashdance and Cocktail, it may be a little predictable, but ""Can't Fight The Moonlight"" by LeAnn Rimes is a fantastic number one hit song, it's not a bad romantic comedy drama at all. Okay!"

","I had free cinema tickets in the year 2000 and my choices were this or Disney's Dinosaur. It was a daytime screening and I couldn't make a later screening with more choice and the tickets were expiring that week. Dinosaur was the choice; a mediocre film following Disney's pantheon of midas touched 90s films. Why is this relevant? It was better than Coyote Ugly.<br/><br/>Coyote Ugly isn't bad per se, just a bit meh. The film is a fairly generic story about a small town girl who moves to the big city to become a songwriter and ends up working in a rowdy bar, maybe not unlike Hooters. Inbetween she meets a hunky Australian love interest. It's sort of a comedy-cum-Romance-cum-music film-cum-bar room drama. I'm all for hybrid films, but this film doesn't do any one thing particularly well apart from the music (the songs are good). Piper Perabo is unfortunately obviously lip synching and it just feels like a thinly veiled promotional video for then largely unknown LeAnn Rimes.<br/><br/>The romantic plot is just too predictable and a bit tacked on. The bar scenes are good and capture some of the excitement. Unfortunately, it isn't as groundbreaking or thrilling as say corny Tom Cruise vehicle Cocktail.<br/><br/>The best thing in the film is John Goodman. His charisma and natural humour is always fun to watch and of course playing a Dad character is a natural fit as he's been doing it to perfection for years.<br/><br/>So all in all: good photography, good music, John Goodman being his usual charming self, boring plot and it never really escapes from feeling like an extended music video."

","This movie begins with a young woman named ""Violet Sanford"" (Piper Perado) having made the decision to quit her job at a local pizzeria and leave her home in New Jersey to try her luck being a songwriter in New York City. Yet even though she has thought about this move for years things don't go nearly as well as she had planned-and then things get much worse. It's at this point that she meets a grill cook by the name of ""Kevin O'Donnell"" (Adam Garcia) who does his best to help her out even though he has few connections in the music industry. Unfortunately, that being the case, she gets tentatively accepted for a job dancing and bartending at a raucous bar known as Coyote Ugly which causes her life to change drastically from then. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an uneven comedy-drama which had both good points and rather weak ones as well. To that extent, both the acting and the comedy were mediocre but the plot was interesting and it kept my attention for the most part so I suppose I shouldn't be too critical about it overall. That being the case, I have rated it accordingly. Average."

","David McNally directed the sexually charged Coyote Ugly at the turn of the millennium. His film starred Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia in the familiar tale of a girl leaving her small town to try to make it in the big city. If you're thinking ""I've seen this storyline before, do I need to see Coyote Ugly"" the answer is no. The film is just as boring and formulaic as it seems despite girls dancing on top of bars while pouring pitchers of water on themselves--I suddenly realize why the film grossed so much. <br/><br/>Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is tired of waiting tables at a diner in her small town in New Jersey and only writing her music part-time. She is ready to make the leap to nearby New York and begin the pursuit of her songwriting endeavors full-time. After finishing her last shift at the diner and getting a wonderful send off from her friends, Violet goes home to pack the car for the move. Her father, Bill (John Goodman) is reluctant to let his only daughter loose in The Big Apple, and it's clear that she has taken a parental role over her father since her mother's death years prior. He eventually is as supportive as he can be with her departure. After arriving at the run-down apartment which is all she can afford, Violet's best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) hides money in Violet's freezer that she is reluctant to take. After several disappointments in trying to get the mixtapes of her songs to studios and agents, Violet finds herself disappointed and rejected. When she returns home to find her apartment ransacked and her belongings stolen Violet cries and questions whether or not she should return home. While out for a slice of pie to drown her sorrows, Violet overhears a conversation between several girls waving money around at a nearby table. Violet gathers that they are ""coyotes"" working at a nearby bar. Following the bread crumbs she has sniffed out, Violet seeks the bar out looking for a quick way to make a lot of money. Violet is initially stunned to find out that the bar she has happened upon is a city hotspot in which the girls comprise a team of sexy women who entice patrons to pay for the show they put on. The rest of the girls can sniff out Violet's small-town upbringing, but what they can't sniff out is the passion for her dreams that will push her to do whatever it takes to succeed. Oh, of course, there is a love interest that initially looks like it's not going to work out.<br/><br/>Of course, she's from a small town and wants to move to a big city, of course, she's the parental figure in her single parent home, of course, her apartment gets broken into, of course she loses everything she's saved for months, of course her friend from back home left money in the freezer, of course she overheard that there would be a position open at the bar, of course she was too shy to dance on top of a bar, of course she had outdated technology making it near impossible to adequately get her art distributed, of course, she had a love interest that she was reluctant towards, of course, she had stage fright--except when she was with the coyotes, and of course she eventually made it. I'm not kidding when I say this is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen in my life. It's also aged horribly and was difficult to watch, as most films that prominently feature technology, clothes, and music. Throughout the entire film, when I'm supposed to be buying into how hard this beautiful white woman's life is, I kept asking myself, ""how hard can your life really be, you have perfect hair--if all else fails, shampoo commercials. A film as predictable and lazy as this just has nowhere to land with me, and few redeeming qualities about it, with the exception of John Goodman, he's always good--certainly the bright spot of this pile of garbage."

","A shy Jersey girl hits New York hoping to be an aspiring song writer and she ends up working at a sleazy joint doing dances on the bar with her fellow 'coyotes'. Why is this happening? What kind of moron would use such a contorted device to advance a story? Unfortunately, Coyote Ugly doesn't not want to be a descent music movie, it wants to be Showgirls; a bad decision. <br/><br/>I'll give points to the choreographer for staging a bar dancing style that doesn't rely so much on nudity to sell (unlike Showgirls), however that fact that the movie spends more time on such sequences than it does on anything else, results in Coyote Ugly being pretty Indescent. On the other hand, Coyote Ugly, is a much nicer film than Showgirls. There are fewer A**holes in the cast of characters, and far more laughs (although some may be unintentional)<br/><br/>None of this however changes the fact that the storyline is tripe. Of course the intended audience won't care, but even if one treats the film as pure eye candy, its effectiveness doesn't go beyond moderate. Coyote Ugly feels wacky and rushed, and it's over before you know it. Ignoring the indecency, I don't feel there's quite enough here to warrant a look."

The story is quite conventional and simplistic and that's might the reason that this film didn't reached so many people. Some of the gags are funny, but at times they also feels constrained. Piper Perabo is stunningly beautiful and delivers a okay enough act. It's a shame she didn't got a bigger breakthrough in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Though, she doesn't have enough chemistry with Adam Garcia on screen and the lines between them which the screenwriters came up with are awful. Adam himself doesn't show a big range in his act in this film. John Goodman does a decent enough act as Violet's father, although this is of course not his greatest part. The other girl actors (Tyra Banks, Maria Bello) delivers okay act, without leaving so much impression.<br/><br/>The target audience for this film are youths/people in the twenties/older teenagers and ""Coyote Ugly"" have all the ingredients to satisfy them, both males and females. Why does it then fall on the category ""bad""? It's not the best movie in this category, but, like I said before, it's decent entertainment. The only bad thing I can come up with is that the story is predictable.

Problem is, that so far he only has been given awful material to work with (this movie and ""Kangeroo Jack"".). This director certainly deserves better and I hope producer Jerry Bruckheimer also sees this and gives him another chance one day, with a movie with a better script. McNally made this movie with lots of flair and vision and certainly makes the story look more interesting than it really is. Because lets face it, there is very little plot and story present in this movie. At times the movie jumps to one sequence to another without feeling an obvious connection. Horrible editing and continuity at times.<br/><br/>It really is the story that prevent this movie from being a great one. It's all very predictable and formulaic and all of the clichéd moments you could expect from a movie with a concept like that, are present. The movie also tries to be too dramatic at times with as a result that it becomes unnecessarily sappy at times. Guess it's more a chick-flick than anything else really.<br/><br/>The actors do their best and they did their job well enough, although it is fairly obvious that everyone was cast on their looks and not their acting skills. But I, as a well functioning heterosexual male, am not really complaining about that.<br/><br/>The style is certainly good and somewhat uplifts this movie and helps to make it just better than slightly above average.

He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.<br/><br/>Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume. The Olsen twins, credited as someone named Piper Perabo; play Violet, a young songwriter who makes the BIG journey all the way from New Jersey to New York City to realize her dream. Olsen Twin Violet has stage fright but immediately meets the nicest boy in NYC - an Australian (played by Adam Garcia) who collects comic books, thinks he saw her in a television show with Lori Loughlin, works an assortment of entry-level jobs, and still has time to truly care about her. Supermodel Tyra Banks appears on the screen a few times but does not have to act or to play an actual ""character""."

","It's not that there's anything wrong with Coyote Ugly. It is certainly watchable and not near as bad as some would make it out to be. I'ts even fun in some areas.What is lacking however is any originality. It is completely generic. Cookie cutter is a great word. I had a problem with that aspect of it, that and the complete lack of believability in anything about it.<br/><br/>Violet (I'm sorry, beautiful name but this girl did not look like a ""violet""-Cindy, Stacy maybe but not Violet) is determined to become a song writer and moves to the big bad apple to do just that. Yet from the opening scene(WARNING-SPOILERS THROUT REST OF POST) we know exactly where this movie is going, the predictable formulated movie problems that will get in her way, the movie characters that will appear and how it will all end.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of two others-flashdance meets cocktail-Yet even though I don't think either of those movies was particularly great they had something that I can't put my finger on that was lacking in Ugly.<br/><br/>The strengths of the movie was in the quirky cast and the actual bar scenes-this is a perfect movie to watch when you don't want to concentrate to hard because you don't have to with this. Yet although this movie was better then it was reported to be, it was also light years away from being anywhere near as good as it could have been. There was a lack of buildup toward things-characters simply appear, things happen that are so unrealistic they border on ridiculous-take away the racy dancing on bars and a few other things and this could have been a 1 hour after school special on going for your dreams etc etc-not that all after school specials are bad but there is this unreal quality to the movie-and a rush at the end to make it feel good that reminded me of a high school version of cocktail(a better movie in my opinion). A good example is the whole painfully dull ordeal of Violet getting to the club in time to sing her song and become a star(which you know through all the u turns, screaming and general hysteria is gonna happen anyway).<br/><br/>Still, the movie wasn't all bad-good looking characters,fun dancing and singing, a few great one liners-all combined to make Coyote a pleasant movie view if not outstanding. 6 out of 10 is my vote."

","I have been compelled to comment on this movie because it managed to waste 101 minutes of my precious time. ""Coyote Ugly"" is much too lengthy to discuss such a basic premise: girl moves to big city to fulfill her dreams and encounters interesting experiences along the way.  Mediocre, teenybop and emotionless performance by lead Piper Perabo, who happens to be in almost every scene. Plus a dumbed-down script that will make you scratch your head and go ""Whaaa?"" while you feel that you're being dragged on by a hole-filled story.<br/><br/>I haven't been to Coyote Ugly, so I couldn't say if the movie is a close depiction of what really goes on in a Coyote Ugly bar. In any case, if you like to see women gyrating on bar ledges and people being doused with ice cubes, then this movie is for you. If not, don't punish yourself by watching this crap bar movie.<br/><br/>The only good thing about ""Coyote Ugly"" is Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia)'s bar dance."

"gbheron","4","0","1","7 June 2003"," Ugly Indeed
","Jerry Bruckheimer movies are not intellectual endeavors; as we all know his clichéd scripting, 'wall of sound' soundtracks, and fast-cut action are mostly applied to slam-bang, kick-ass adventure movies. On the level of pure, mindless entertainment they usually work; they certainly make him and his team buckets of money. In ""Coyote Ugly"" Jerry takes his style and applies it to the romance genre. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>Yes, the production values are super slick, and the story, although unoriginal, holds promise. To digress, Violet (Piper Parabo), pizza joint songbird from New Jersey, pulls up stakes and heads for Manhattan to hit the big time. To pay her bills while launching her music career, she bartends at Coyote Ugly, a bar where the female bartenders dance, prance, and sing (all very suggestively) for a raucous male clientele. <br/><br/>It's all very predictable from the stage fright, the romantic misunderstandings, the trouble at the barwill her career get launched, love find its way, the bar remain open? Need you ask?   <br/><br/>Since we've plowed this ground many times before it's the 'getting there' that should provide the entertainment. But thanks to an incredibly bad script, getting there is an unintended laugher. At this level the film works, but if you want to take it seriously, I'm sorry, it fails."

","I thought this film wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, but it isn't something to rush to either.  There are enduring performances by Ppier Perablo and some others, and the story is good, but it is missing something. I think it is called brains.  This film (despite being entertaining) is kinda stupid, so it can appeal to stupid teens.  And it does (not that I am stupid).  But I think that couples will like the sensuous parts and some of the romance.  But that might be it.  Also, you might want to see this movie for Perablo's performance.<br/><br/>One more interesting thing (and according to this site) is that Kevin Smith (of Jay and Silent Bob fame) is supposedly a uncredited co-writer on this film, and I actually think he did do a couple of things.  The clues- 1, the character Violet (Perablo) comes from South Amboy, New Jersey (which is where around Smith is from) and 2, the Adam Garcia character's prized possession is a Spiderman comic book (Smith had Stan Lee who created Spiderman in the film Mallrats).  Just a notion, I could be wrong.  But one thing I am sure of is this film is a must see, for girls. B+"

Besides, they never conveyed that she had worked hard enough to even deserve this success.  They already expected us to start bawling just three minutes in when Violet parts with her friend outside the apartment.  I guess her authentic Jersey accent is supposed sway us.

Decisions of who to cast and how much skin to show are now determined to the millimetre, it seems, by simple, cold algorithms.  There's no spontaneity whatever.  I'm aware how silly I sound in saying this, but if you must watch ""Coyote Ugly"", don't do so for the chicks - watch it for the story.  It's another slickly produced, enjoyably formulaic tale from the Bruckheimer factory, and since the selling point is this time ersatz sexiness rather than ersatz violence, it's a good deal less offensive than most.

The rest all more or less made an impression similar to the one on the box. But on to the film itself. I liked it and I liked it a lot. You can call me a romantic ba***rd but still I liked it. Almost everything about it. Ok I admit this is a film with not much depth or twists but it is really great fun from the moment 'Jersey' (Piper Perabo) leaves her house to the predictable ending. The best scenes in my opinion the ones in which we see 'Jersey' singing her own songs (damn she, or better LeAnn Rimes, can sing) and it makes me wonder why the Can't fight the Moonlight became the single for this movie.<br/><br/>
Moving on, there is everything you could possibly want in this movie, hot chicks, dancing, romance, fights, comedy and last but certainly not least a good deal of great music.

","Yes, unbelievable, but I really liked this! First, when I saw the trailer, I thought this movie might be a kids version of Paul Verhoeven´s ""Showgirls"", which belongs more to the sector of trash and satire. But finally ""Coyote Ugly"" was an old-fashioned but pretty sometimes-dreams-come-true fairy tale. It would be better to make comparisons to the dance movie ""Flashdance"", which was also produced by Jerry Bruckenheimer and tells the same story about a poor girl from the countryside/province/suburbia who wants to become rich and famous in New York... The chicks in ""Coyote Ugly"" fulfill their jobs in looking great very excellent (especially Tyra Banks and Maria Bello), but I think none of the actresses will have their breakthrough with this one. The film itself is for being shady too harmless, for being a social study too surface, and for a comedy it´s not funny enough.

","A good soundtrack and excellent hair design will never hide the fact that this film is less scholarly than a Playmate of the Month video. For the guys in the audience, it's also less, shall we say, `rewarding' than preview advertisements might promise. Piper Perabo hardly carries the film in the lead role of a young girl who moves from her tiny New Jersey town to the Big Apple in search of her dream of becoming a pop songwriter. The plot device of her songwriting dreams allows the filmmakers to let LeeAnn Rimes dub Perabo's voice (badly) to the tune of Diane Warren's (sometimes good) songs, and then actually bring Rimes into the film in the last five minutes (our girl made it! She's now writing for the girl she mysteriously sounds exactly like!). Perabo's deliciously pretty with a great smile, but her acting is wobbly and kills a lot of credibility for the film. Supporting cast, particularly Maria Pitillo, do much for the film, but in the end the word `Inane' kept rattling through my head."

I think they chose the perfect actors and actresses for every character perfectly. The movie also shows you what the real world is like (well, except we can't all get lucky and walk into a club and find a completee hottie, who also happens to be a nice guy). All in all this is one of the best movies i've seen in a long time!"

","Coyote Ugly is truly an uplifting tail about a girl who moves to NYC to pursue her dream, and at the same time, to come out of her shell.  Despite the way the trailers made the film out to be, it's not just a ""bar"" movie with topless dancers or anything like that.  It has a plot, an excellent plot I might add, and the sexuality of the film just boosts how good of a film it really is.  I would highly recommend this film."

","The good news is ""Coyote Ugly"" will play well with teenagers. The bad news is....um, well, just about everything else. Sappy, corny kind of Urban Cowboy meets Flashdance wannabee small time B-flick. One small kudo to Perabo who's star may be rising...though it's got a long way to go."

","When you hear as much about a film, you don't have any option but have to see it!<br/><br/>And I must say the majority of the reviews were a little unfair -- it wasn't actually that bad.<br/><br/>Piper Perabo goes to the big city, and ends up working as a barmaid with a penchant for dancing and signing on the bar.  She was actually quite good, as was her father [John Goodman] and the rest of the cast were bearable.<br/><br/>The token Australian love interest was a strange character who never went anywhere, but this was actually watchable all the same."

","i only have to say that this film is very very very good. in spain it was nº1 3 months ago . i think piper perabo is the best actress and she is beauty, very very beauty and clever,i think john goodman is great too. tyra banks is bad in this movie, she is a bad actress and she only can be a model. i will buy this movie on DVD soon!! i think leann rimes has made a very good song for this film- can´t fight the moonlight, listen to it!!"

","After seeing this film it became my favourite. It was absolutely brilliant. It was funny and Adam Garcia is gorgeous! All the actors and actresses were brilliant and the soundtrack was wicked! This is definitely my favourite film in the world and I want to go and see it again and again and again."
"imy2000","10","0","1","25 October 2000"," Fantastic
","This film is great, not only does it contain plenty of great girls but it also has an alluring soundtrack to it, which creates a wonderful film and an atmosphere for each scene of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought i would watch it and come out satisfied with having seen the girls, but no i was impressed, especially by Piper Perabo, not only is she good looking but she has a smile that would make anybody she looked at smile. She plays a fantastic role, which is supported by other actresses such as Maria Bello, Izabello Miko, Melanie Lynskey. I felt that Tyra Banks didn't participate in the film for long enough! so no mention for good acting for her !<br/><br/>On the whole, a romantic story set around Violet (Piper Perabo) who has her heart set on becoming a song writer, so she moves to New York where she encounters Mr O Donell (adam garcia), but she lacks the courage to perform thus leading her to Coyote Ugly (a bar). The film generally gets better as you watch more of it and by the end you have to be singing one of the several songs in it like 'Can't Fight the moonlight' - just excellent!<br/><br/>
I certainly recommend you watch this, and would guarantee anybody even vaguely interested in films would enjoy this one."
"eightx10","3","0","1","6 August 2000"," Bad, but its a good laugh
","This movie is not the worst movie ever made, but it certainly has a few similarities with it.<br/><br/>This one pulls out all the old B-movie cliches: small-town girl goes to big city, befriended by bad-girl mentor, has to do something she is uncomfortable with to survive in city yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>All the watchers of USA Up All Night or Cinemax should recognize the plot. It just has a higher-profile cast and more budget.<br/><br/>But I love b-movies, and this one is slightly redeemed by an endearing performance by John Goodman and some really funny lines.<br/><br/>Funny, sometimes unintentionally.  Entertaining, even though it is really stupid."
"Chris_Docker","5","0","1","22 October 2000"," Straightforward entertainment - engaging braincells not needed!
","Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who gave us Flashdance, Gone in 60 Seconds, Con Air and Dangerous Minds, this is entertainment that doesn't require you to engage too many brain cells to enjoy it (Is that bad??)<br/><br/>The story of a would-be songwriter who goes to New York to find success, it is mostly about the red-hot bar where she starts working out of necessity. As it has the familiar music-video formula it is especially disappointing that the soundtrack is not more memorable, but visually the movie delivers what it advertises and is a great feel-good movie, popcorn movie or date movie. There's plenty of New York adrenalin, gutsy females that will tantalize the guys and a male lead that's not bad looking for the ladies, plus a few wish-fulfilment themes to also appeal to the girls. Out and out fun."
"meeza","9","0","1","22 September 2000"," Wild and Funtastic!
","`Howl! At The Screen' and believe me you will when you see the sexy bartenders of `Coyote Ugly.' This feel-good movie is about a beautiful struggling songwriter who goes to New York for fame & fortune and ends up being a karaoke-dancer bartender in a very upbeat sexy bar called `Coyote Ugly.' The bar girls in `Coyote Ugly' dance and sing near-naked on bar stands to very upbeat 80's music while they shower their patrons with sprinkles of Jack, drops of Cuervo, and showers of Comfort.  Ok! Stop daydreaming! And read the rest! Even though it does not have some intellectual screenplay or strategic direction, the film does have the right formula to be one of the best films of the year. If you don't know what it is, just read the review again and focus on the words `near-naked' , `jack' , `cuervo' and `comfort.' Case closed! ***** Excellent"
"Bobert-3","10","0","1","4 September 2000"," Better than I expected.
","I went into the theater thinking I was going in for an awesome movie. It was even better than that. There was a wonderful plot, excellent story line, and casting was beyond perfect. The soundtrack was awesome, and the on screen chemistry blew my mind. I totally recommend this movie to anyone with any taste at all. Long Live Coyote!!!"
"seventeenthdreamer","10","0","1","24 August 2000"," see this movie!
","Okay, this is not American Beauty. But the bar top dances in the movie are great. Buy the movie when it comes out, you can fast forward the 60 percent of the movie that is away from bar. Izabella Miko and Bridget Moynahan were fabulous. Yes I know bad acting, but were they given good scripts?"
"Bobass","10","0","1","22 August 2000"," Overall, good.
","I thought this movie had it all. Good acting, hot chicks, nice plot. I thought it would be a good date movie, hot babes for the guys, and romance for the girls. I thought that Piper Perabo shined and Izabella Miko was sexy."
