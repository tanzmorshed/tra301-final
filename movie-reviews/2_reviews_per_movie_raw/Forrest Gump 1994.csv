","When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing..."
"Zonieboy","10","665","781","8 April 2002"," A beautiful fable for now and the future
","I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.<br/><br/>I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.<br/><br/>The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.<br/><br/>I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.<br/><br/>The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"
"thomas-hardcastle-2","10","680","827","14 May 2007"," In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....
","Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.<br/><br/>Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.<br/><br/>I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.<br/><br/>But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.<br/><br/>I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see."
"sundrymules","10","445","540","20 June 2005"," The zen of Forrest Gump.
","This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","272","327","10 June 2002"," Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump
","""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.<br/><br/>We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.<br/><br/>Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.<br/><br/>Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.<br/><br/>This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.<br/><br/>10/10"
"kenhe","10","334","416","31 May 2004"," Purity and innocence retained
","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."
"adinutzza2001","10","456","590","14 February 2005"," why such a low rating???
","What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that ""if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death."" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. <br/><br/>How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. <br/><br/>So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding."
"schmimic","10","199","256","23 April 2005"," Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.
","Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, ""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump."" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.<br/><br/>The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.<br/><br/>Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.<br/><br/>As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.<br/><br/>This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)"
"blairgallop7","10","147","191","15 December 2007"," Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire
","He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!"
"john in missouri","10","195","267","1 December 2007"," Quite possibly the best movie ever made.
","I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.<br/><br/>This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)<br/><br/>Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing. <br/><br/>Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.<br/><br/>Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.<br/><br/>See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more. Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies -- if not THE greatest -- ever made."
"george.schmidt","10","156","212","13 March 2003"," Contemporary classic: one of my all-time faves
","FORREST GUMP (1994) **** Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson. Brilliantly directed and inspiring comic drama about the truly extraordinary life and times of mentally challenged Forrest Gump (Hanks in the best role of his career won his second Best Actor Oscar in back-to-back winning roles), a simple, honest, and decent man whose childlike innocence is his lucky charm through his altering experiences that span the past two decades flawlessly. Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle. Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. *** One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forrest telling Jenny why he loves her so much (""You're my girl!"") and at the gravesite when the birds fly overhead."
"jjacques1","10","19","23","13 October 2018"," Forrest Gump (Negative Reviewers are Missing the Point)
","I am a long time IMDb fan and first time reviewer. When I am reading through fellow user reviews, I generally find myself gravitating towards reading reviews that hold the opposite of my opinion. If I loved a film, I read the poor reviews and vice versa on the films that didn't resonate with me. I like finding value in an opposite viewpoint.<br/><br/>With that said, while I read through the negative reviews of Forrest Gump, I found myself thinking that a number of the reviewers might be missing what I see is a large part of the film's message.<br/><br/>Their focus was on the characters' intelligence and lifestyle. I read things like the point of the film was that you would be successful even if you're an idiot like Forrest, as long as you walked a conservative path. If you decided to take the path Jenny's character chose, despite the fact she was more intelligent then Forest, your life would end in disaster.<br/><br/>I think the differences between Forrest and Jenny's journeys has nothing to do with the disparity in their intelligence or lifestyle but more with the difference between someone who knows who he truly is versus someone who is searching to find out who they are.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is passing judgement on either person's choices. I don't see Jenny's life ending the way it does as being a failure. Her life had value and she was able to find what she was looking for. Forrest's life was incredible and his love for Jenny was his guiding star. He lived through so many experiences and met so many famous people of that era. He lucked into wealth and at a couple points in the film became famous in his own right. None of that had any real meaning to him. His purpose came from his personal relationships, protecting and doing right by those he loved and his strong sense of right and wrong. <br/><br/>Each character's journey (again regardless of intelligence) is representative of the experiences of an entire generation of North Americans."
"AlsExGal","10","10","11","22 December 2012"," The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...
","... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.<br/><br/>Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made. <br/><br/>Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","32","42","30 April 2016"," Even After Twenty Years the Film Still Holds Up
","Forrest Gump (1994) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend.<br/><br/>FORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I've never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don't understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there's FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.<br/><br/>As far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.<br/><br/>I thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I've always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there's no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.<br/><br/>Then there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY'S FOOL, there's no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that ""simple"" man and there's not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank's character and Sally Field is good as well.<br/><br/>No matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it."

It even made me write a review. Such a beautifully made movie, has got everything. Teaches you about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our life as granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tells you how to realize and work with all that you have, no matter how you are. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and his life. Not only through the eye of Forrest, but a mother, a friend and general people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come across is exceptional, and all you will leave behind is love and respect. Magnificent movie."
"tightspotkilo","10","43","65","19 November 2008"," An Amazing Movie
","I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1994. When it was released on VHS I obtained that version. I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me, is the way which it, as a simple and guileless little story, like a feather wafting in the breeze, nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeball-bulging, forehead vein-popping, spittle-spewing vitriol from liberals and so-called ""intellectuals"" who are absolutely certain that, like a guided missile, it is seeking them out, intentionally, personally, to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas, and by a nitwit character no less. Hahahaha. As if.<br/><br/>So let's first thing pop that little pea right out of the shooter. Let's dispense with the bilge of this movie being some kind of sub rosa rightwing plot. Puh-leeeze. This is a mainstream Hollywood production. Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks, Sally Field, and Robin Wright Penn are all known Hollywood lefties, liberal devotees who would take the pipe long before allowing themselves to be associated with or be used by anything akin a rightwing movie, let alone be openly and voluntarily involved in making one. Bottom line, this is not a political movie. This is not a movie which is making any kind of political or social statements in any respect. People who think it is doing any of that are just working way too hard over-thinking it all. Period. It's odd because it's really not all that complicated of a thing to understand. Which leads directly to another amazing thing about this movie: it is amazing the way the simple little message the movie is actually sending just sails right over so many people's heads. Amazingly they just don't get it, and based on the comments here they still aren't getting it 14 years later and counting. So if you fall into that category let me help you out.<br/><br/>What is the message of Forrest Gump? Stripped to its purest essence, this movie is about loyalty and devotion, particularly to the ones in our lives we love and care about. These are the human values being reinforced. Loyalty. Devotion. Forrest Gump embodies loyalty and devotion. To his mama. To his good best buddy Bubba. To the love of his life, Jenny. To his leader, Lt. Dan. And in the end to Forrest Jr. One by one and all together Forrest sticks by and takes care of his family, friends, and loved ones. This is the thread running through the entire story. This is what carries Forrest to all of the remarkable places he goes along the way.<br/><br/>The use of a mentally challenged man as the leading man is a conceit, used to illustrate the point that loyalty and devotion are the most important things in life, trumping everything else. It drives home the point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much. Indeed, it drives it home with blunt force. Maybe it drives it home too hard for such a simple little point. Maybe this is where the movie's detractors get themselves side-tracked. <br/><br/>There are a number of other amazing and remarkable things about this movie. The performances. The special effects. The almost poetic simplicity of the story and the way it is told. See it for all this and more, but please, don't over-think it."

","""Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""<br/><br/>No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.<br/><br/>Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like. It's a classic in every sense of the word."

"kofi-62048","9","8","11","17 June 2016"," Forrest Gump (1994) review
","Forrest Gump (1994) is an awesome and breathtaking film directed by Robert Zemeckis. This is an exceptionally touching film with a great cast, excellent choice of music and a thoroughly pleasing narrative. Some of the dialogue in this film is now commonly quoted in everyday life which is a great achievement. It was a teeny bit long though, otherwise this film would have probably got a perfect scored.<br/><br/>Despite Forest Gump's low IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for numerous of the most notable events in the late 20th century. without trying hard just other might do, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley how to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest during a remarkable array of historical events and people.<br/><br/>In fact, nothing is quite pursued to its logical conclusion, which makes the film more a triumph of style than content. Nevertheless this is certainly what it is. Gump is not so much a measure of its times, as a benign reflection upon them, nearly but not quite through the eyes of its lovable protagonist. The film goes through all the emotions but does not appeal on any of them long enough to trouble anyone."
"comps-784-38265","9","8","11","22 February 2016"," Instant Classic
","This film was an instant classic for me. <br/><br/>They don't write scripts of this calibre any more, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is brilliant as the mildly retarded Forest Gump. The film takes you by the hand, and shows Gumps life and experiences, both good and bad, in his own words from childhood to adulthood.<br/><br/>At the same time you get a basic look at modern U.S. history. <br/><br/>It is heartwarming and sad, funny and satirical. Cleverly weaves in so many sub plots and ideas. <br/><br/>Yet doesn't use excessive violence or bad language to relate powerful messages in a heartwarming story. A story all the family can watch. <br/><br/>A cracking film you can enjoy over and over again."

","I've never seen anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter, I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump"". Any attempt to describe him would risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Even a dream....<br/><br/>The title character leads viewers through an accidental travelogue of American social history from the early 1960s through the present in this revisionist fable. Vietnam, desegregation, Watergate and more are presented from the perspective of Hanks' lovably slow-witted character as he finds himself embroiled in situations he can't quite comprehend. Academy Award Nominations: 13, including Best Picture, Best Actor--Tom Hanks, and Best Director. Academy Awards: 6, including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Adapted Screenplay The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages, between the 1950s and the 1980s, to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.<br/><br/>Yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half"". Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking, balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.<br/><br/>Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field), who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid"", his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does."" He turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind. That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump, the football hero, becomes Gump, the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump, the Ping-Pong champion, Gump, the shrimp boat captain, Gump, the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump, the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps. It could be argued that with his IQ of 75, Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny (Robin Wright), the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She's a stripper by that time. The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do, and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who, quite convincingly, loses his legs. Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound, in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox"". The biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. Eventually it becomes clear that between them, Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie!"

","This movie was amazing. It reminds me of my rises and falls in my life and just seeing how resilient Forrest Gump became was really inspiring. He had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability to contribute to society. He did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go as far as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise. The promises that Forrest made to his mother, Bubba, Jenny and Lieutenant Dan were all kept. His love, passion, drive and spiritual understanding were all unconditional. What an amazing movie"

","The movie Forrest Gump is about a boy who suffers from mental retardation. He also suffers with scoliosis and has to wear knee braces. The movie tells a story about his life and his accomplishments. He suffers bullying from the people in town and the kids in school. He grows up and proves a lot of people wrong. The story takes place in a small town called Greensboro, Alabama. Tom Hanks portrays the character Forrest Gump. This movie won eight Oscars, one of them being Best Actor in Leading Role. Tom Hanks won the award in 1995. He did a very good job of showing Forrest Gump without mocking his disability. We meet Forrest's character at bus stop talking to people on the bench about his life accomplishments. After that, the story starts with Forrest' first day on the bus. This is when Forrest first experiences the other kids bullying. Until he meets young Jenny, who lets him sit beside her on the bus. Young Jenny is played by Hanna Hall. Jenny becomes his best friend and doesn't look at his disability as a difference. Forrest and Jenny grow up together and spend all their time together. Jenny has an abusive and drunk father. Older Jenny is played by Robin Wright. Forrest gets many opportunities, he is asked to play football in college. You also see many history events and how innocent Forrest's eyes are to the world. The movie is told in the 1970s, a lot of movements happened in the seventies. The movie shows both Forrest's experiences and Jenny's life, vastly different. Jenny went through the hippie movement, with drugs and peace. Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time."

"yooeun228-1","8","7","10","4 June 2007"," everyman,,,
","Robert Zemeckis directed this movie, Forrest Gump, in 1994. It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and ""Stupid is as stupid does"" This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, ""Everyman"" All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.<br/><br/>There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn't really mean to show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump. Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote ""stupid is as stupid does."" Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the ""white trash"" but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.<br/><br/>Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are."
"orekhovo","Null","7","10","1 April 2002"," Few thoughts
","Even this movie is old by any standard i have seen it for the first time only today. And when i logged in to see user comments i wasn't surprised to see divided user opinions. This movie can be interpreted differently and provoking in general. Forest Gump by Robert Zemeckis can be movie about anything you want. It can be movie about American History at galnce, Vietnam or about not too bright guy named Forrest Gump who gets lucky. He survives in Vietnam, make a few millions, etc... although i was surprised that amongst nearly 100 comments i have read. I havent' seen anyone who would define a film storyline as a lovestory, not as american history at glance with offensive characters painted by stupid Forrest Gump and his black best friend, who is not so bright too and speak about his shrimp business all the time. A love story of two strong personalities, who live their life through their mistakes to surrender to what was set long time ago."
"emrelanur","10","17","30","24 September 2007"," That's one special man...
","I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.<br/><br/>It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.<br/><br/>I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.<br/><br/>Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10."
"toccina","9","8","12","9 March 2016"," Ability
","Spoiler Warning!!!! Forrest Gump is in reality a movie that covers a plethora of issues for example racial issues with the KKK and Black Panthers, drugs, peace, war, and finally disability. For this review I would like to touch on the disability portion. I must first say that even though this movie is mostly comedic it can still be said that it is partially accurate. In the beginning Forrest breaks off his braces to help with his scoliosis but broke them off to run away from bullies. Yet even though he had this disability against him he still had the ability to do it. So in reality this movie begins by saying that it's more about ability. I can prove this point further by saying that he became a war veteran with a medal of honour and also managed to become a millionaire and then evidently a successful father, even though Forrest was put in the situation that was impossible, and even if it was for comedic purposes it is much deeper, yet he still managed to come out ahead. Mostly a duration of the movie it is asked if Forrest is stupid, now Forrest doesn't like it and even though he may have a low IQ he still manages to pull through in the long run. This is also the case for Lt. Dan, he is in Vietnam harmed in battle and winds up with his legs amputated, later in the movie he gets prothstetics and is able to walk again, he also ends up being a millionaire because of his success in the shrimp industry. It's not that he is in need because he is disabled but is able to help because he is able. So in reality Forrest Gump isn't necessarily a film about specifically disability or otherwise it is something that shows how much of an ability you have whether or not you have a disability from birth or war or some other thing. It takes a will to do something and this is why I would give this movie a 9/10 because of its uplifting story and some form of motivation to do something with your life."

","Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.<br/><br/>Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?"

","Most people in the world may have a high IQ than Forrest Gump, but almost nobody may live a life like him. When I first saw this movie 6 years ago, I enjoyed it as a comedy. Now when I watch it again, I see the true meaning of life in it. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never known what you'll get next. An individual may seem so small compared with the whole society, and people may feel upset even desperate when they are in trouble. Forrest Gump has set an example to all of us, that only way to a happy and meaningful life is to love and try to live it to the fullest. I love this film very much and every time when I am upset with things in my life, I'll watch it again."

In early 90's he was still to establish himself among great names & thats how he did it? Although he had already won an Oscar for philadelphia but this movie was his official entry to the hearts of millions of people across the globe. Its hard to imagine any other actor fit in this role. His movies have always been like a box of chocolates- YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO COME & this one is a pure delight- a movie that can make your day.<br/><br/>Some of the finest dialogs, thrilling moments, funny instances, touching storyline, insightful thoughts & a pinch of romance, this movie offers you everything you are looking in a heartwarming feel-good movie.<br/><br/>Robin Wright's performance was a treat to watch and some breathtaking chemistry with Tom Hanks made it even more delicious. Even the best in the romance cannot match this one. ""I may not be a smart man but I know what love is"" is one of my favorite lines in the movie. Stupidity has never been so touchy before.<br/><br/>Every single character contributed to this beautiful fable in bits & pieces- Forrest, Jenny, Lt.

"bob the moo","Null","34","69","1 November 2003"," A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture  any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers)
","Sitting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump starts to take to those around him and tells a story of his life to date.  His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.<br/><br/>I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways  either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.<br/><br/>As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs/slogans/tee shirts/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times  be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc. Her fate is less than Forrest's  she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily  first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.<br/><br/>Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot  and didn't like what I saw.<br/><br/>The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film  all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.<br/><br/>Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from."

"jboothmillard","9","73","165","11 March 2005"," Forrest Gump
","From Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated director Robert Zemeckis (The Back to the Future Trilogy), this is a remarkable comedy drama based on the novel by Winston Groom. Basically, Forrest Gump (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Tom Hanks) is the low-intelligence but friendly man on a bus stop bench, and telling his life story to all strangers who sit down. The film is basically chronicles of his life accidentally ending up in big events of America between the 1950's and the 1970's, and finding fame and fortune without wanting or asking for it. These include meeting Elvis Presley, being put on an American football team for his running speed, meeting President John F. Kennedy, joining the army for the Vietnam war, becoming a Ping Pong champion, receiving the congressional medal of honour from President Richard Nixon, becoming a shrimp boat captain with his own company and running across America for two years. Within these adventures in his life, he always thinks of those close to him, the love of his life Jenny Curran (Golden Globe nominated Robin Wright Penn), friend Lt. Dan Taylor (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gary Sinise), friend Pvt. Benjamin Buford 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) and his mother Mrs. Gump (BAFTA nominated Sally Field), and with his low-intelligence he does not realise the significance of his actions. Also starring Siobhan Fallon as Dorothy Harris, School Bus Driver, Alexander Zemeckis (Robert's son) as School Bus Boy, Elizabeth Hanks (Tom's daughter) as School Bus Girl and The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump Jr. This is one of those films you cannot ignore, even if some people think not to watch it, but like Forrest says ""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both"" (this explains the use of the feather at the beginning and end). Personally, this is a film I would definitely recommend to see, and not just because of Hanks in what has to be one of his best roles. It won the Oscars for Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for Alan Silvestri (he should have) and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Tom Hanks was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 39 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""), it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Forrest at Jenny's grave, it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very, very good!"
"bkoganbing","10","11","19","13 February 2010"," The Hand Of An Unseen Providence
","When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.<br/><br/>It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.<br/><br/>Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.<br/><br/>There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different. <br/><br/>The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.<br/><br/>Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.<br/><br/>It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.<br/><br/>To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.<br/><br/>In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.<br/><br/>If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it."""
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","11","19","21 April 2009"," A magical and powerful celebration of life. A true classic.
","Every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.<br/><br/>I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.<br/><br/>But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.<br/><br/>Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this – in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.<br/><br/>Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. Forrest Gump is a classic that will look handsome in any DVD collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older I get. A true classic."
"MovieAddict2016","6","44","96","5 September 2005"," I used to love this movie.
","*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers *** <br/><br/>Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.<br/><br/>I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.<br/><br/>The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.<br/><br/>And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.<br/><br/>It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.<br/><br/>Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.<br/><br/>As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.<br/><br/>As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already."

","This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw it away.<br/><br/>I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work, how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.<br/><br/>Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office success and win multiple Oscars.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work.

","I really love this film and I have seen it many many times.<br/><br/>It is extremely moving and powerful which is exactly what a film (of this genre) should be. If you want to watch a comedy, go watch a comedy, nobody is denying that this is not a romantic-comedy full of belly laughs but it is a real tear jerker and makes you think and Tom Hanks totally deservedly won an Oscar for being such an outstanding actor. It is really a fantastic film, there are not enough ways for me to express that. It makes you think and it touches you and it is *very* hard for the film crew (actors,directors,cameraman etc) to be able to achieve that but they have. I seriously don't understand how people can be so critical and hate this. I do not (well hardly ever) watch a movie expecting to critise it, that is not what movies are for. And *of course* you are not going to like some of the characters because they are not *meant* to be likable!! Thats just how some people are, a film cannot portray everyone as sugary sweet and perfect. I understand that not everybody will think it is fantastic but I do not understand the negative comments, to me they seem silly because I think this is a wonderful film, one of the best ever. The best thing about this film is that it goes through lifes highs and lows just it does for real people."
"alex_ryde","10","9","15","12 April 2007"," Book or Movie? Two separate monsters...
","Having seen the movie and read the book, I feel it necessary to make an observation. Even though the movie is based on the book, it is remarkably different. In the book, Forrest goes into space; Bubba is white and meets Forrest in college; Forrest runs as a candidate in the senate; Forrest does not serve under Lieutenant Dan in the Army, but meets him in hospital afterwards; Forrest's mother and Jenny do not die (they do kick it in Gump & Co. though); and there is also Forrest's wrestling career and his friendship with the orangutang Sue that should be mentioned too. The book is a fantastic piece of literature and should be on every college syllabus everywhere. But if the film had been taken directly from the book, I doubt it would have been so successful. The film includes fantastic sequences (Forrest running and influencing pop culture; Forrest directly influencing John Lennon) that do not appear in the book. The way Forrest is tied into the last 40 years of American History is great, if a little convenient. I wonder though, whether the sequel will follow Gump & Co. or whether they will create another new monster."

","This is one of the worst movies of all time. It is nothing more than an expensive, intricate jigsaw puzzle and none of the characters have redeeming value with the possible exception of Forrest's mother. His love interest Jenny is a vile human being and at no time did I want Forrest to end up with her. The off putting message IS in fact that you can be an idiot and be successful, and in fact suggests that it might be better to be so. The idea that skills that many people find so difficult to master all come so easily to a simpleton like Forrest is offensive. Its saving grace is that the book is even worse. I don't understand what people love about this movie, which is vastly overrated."

","i don't usually watch many family type movies, but forrest gump is honestly one of my favourite movies to watch with my son and partner. tom hanks is a wonderful actor and in this movie it shows! there are some tears, some comedy, some laughter, some sadness, just basically a lot of emotions that shows we are all human in one way or another. i never get tired of watching it and seem to learn life lessons every time i watch it because i have forgotten some small phrase or action or something, then think oh wow forgot about that! then it seems familiar like an old friend - it is that sort of movie. very highly recommend it to anyone!"

","For anyone who grew up in the turbulent Sixties, ""Forrest Gump"" delivers a clever blend of nostalgia mixed with a uniquely creative view of history as experienced by a presumed to be simpleton. While Tom Hanks' character recalls his life with a slow tangy drawl, he variously entertains and educates a host of passengers waiting for the next bus to their intended destination. Some ignore him, some show interest, one even scorns Gump's tale of getting rich in the shrimping business, only to depart before Forrest has a chance to pull out his copy of Fortune Magazine. Life can be like that for those unwilling to listen and learn, casting doubt instead of exploring the truth and keeping an open mind.<br/><br/>I got a kick out of Forrest's string of brushes with greatness - the way he taught Elvis how to shake his hips, his unquestioning response to LBJ's inquiry about his war injury, and the way his war time experience inspired John Lennon to write 'Imagine'. There was also that ingenious sequence in which he meets President Nixon, then inadvertently tips off the Watergate scandal. However the most understated and easiest reference to miss was the clever homage paid to the 1969 film ""Midnight Cowboy"", when Forrest wheels Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise) across busy city traffic, and is narrowly missed by a taxi cab. Lt. Dan's response was ""Hey, I'm walkin' here"", just the way Ratso Rizzo did in that earlier film. All that with the 'Everybody Talking at Me' movie theme seamlessly woven in as so many songs of that era were utilized with other aspects of the story.<br/><br/>For Forrest Gump, life is not a pretentious path to wealth or fame, but a never ending quest to learn and be a productive human being. Not to mention finding one's own true love. For Forrest, life long friend Jenny (Robin Wright) represents an unfulfilled ideal, one he accepts into his heart while still a young schoolboy and nurturing that relationship platonically throughout his adulthood. For her part, Jenny represents a youthful quest for experiencing life to the fullest, only to make a series of wrong choices that lead her to the brink of suicide. It's fitting that Jenny eventually realizes what Forrest knew all along, that they were made for each other even if outward appearances seemed to dictate otherwise.<br/><br/>I've seen this film only a couple times in the past, thinking it was good, but only considering it for it's entertainment value. I guess one of the benefits of getting older is the insight one gains with experiencing life a day at a time and steady as she goes. My viewing of the picture today gave me a greater appreciation for the subtleties offered in the film, and leads me to believe the world would be a better place if there were a little more of Forrest Gump in all of us."

","In 1981, Forrest Gump watches a feather fall from the sky at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia. He recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on the bench, recounting his childhood in the town of Greenbow, Alabama. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, whose life is followed in parallel to Gump's at times. Despite his below average intelligence quotient, his ability to run at lightning speed (despite being a victim of polio as a young child) gets him into college on a football scholarship. After his college graduation, he enlists in the army, where he makes friends with fellow recruit Bubba, who convinces Gump to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. Despite his low intelligence, Gump manages to excel at drill exercises. They are sent to Vietnam, and during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Gump ends up saving much of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs as a result of injuries. Gump is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism."

"ScrimshawHatcheck","1","97","238","23 June 1999"," Sugar-coated Trojan horse
","This movie uses all the sappy, sentimental tricks in the book to sucker the audience into believing in poor, disadvantaged Forrest Gump: the sick mother, the bad legs, the innocence of incomplete mental capacity, the bullies, the girlfriend, etc.<br/><br/>If that's as far as it went, however, I wouldn't be writing this. The dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.<br/><br/>Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive and manipulative."

","This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the best efforts of the actors, most of whom are very talented, the ridiculous and corny plot makes this a real chore to watch.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that the director was trying to make a modern ""Homer's Odyssey"", but ended up instead with ""Homer Simpson's Odyssey"" - sans laughs. This movie offers lowest common denominator entertainment: patronization to those with learning difficulties, a twisted view on history, naive jingoism, and a nauseatingly contrived ending.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I began wondering whether I was being too harsh on it. However, after talking to between fifteen and twenty other people, I've come to the conclusion that I was being quite fair. None of those I've spoken to liked this film.<br/><br/>If you like bubble-gum then you will probably like Forrest Gump. If however, you like movies with some semblance of intelligence or real entertainment you will probably be disappointed by this movie."

","A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the movie's values and message are clearly right wing: as many other reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!<br/><br/>I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie's right-wing allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness. As another commenter put it, ""this is a movie for people who voted for Reagan"" or for the Bushes. Overall, it's a remarkable document of Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.<br/><br/>So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp: the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going public largely shares these right-wing views."

","Forrest Gump (1994) is one of the greatest Oscar Winning Movies. It won Best Picture, Best VFX, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Film Editing. It was one of the best films I have ever seen.
Forrest Gumps casted Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Gary Sinises as Lieutenant Dan Taylor and more. First of all, the acting was extremely excellent, Tom Hanks could act like a stupid guy and he actually won an Oscar for that. It was really impressive.
The story was really good. Starting the time when there was president John F. Kennedy and there was was in Vietnam (my country, it made me so proud of having Vietnam in such a good movie). It was an Alabama man with an IQ of 75. I could imagine that being Forrest Gump was the greatest thing. Bullied, called stupid is fine, many people though it would make you an outcast.
This was such a good movie that some day I want to see it again and again and again. The scenes are really unforgettable with humor and tragedy. I laughed and cried (whenn Jenny and Bubba are dead). It was the most unforgettable movie ever.
Well, I had nothing left to say. Forrest Gump is a must-see. A 9.4/10"

","Based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom of the same name; Forrest Gump is about a simple man, named Forrest (Tom Hanks) whom with a low I.Q. who goes through life, accidentally being present at many historic moments, while building success for himself, however, never getting with his true love, Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) which mostly seems to be the only thing, that is eluding him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this feel-good, financial blockbuster was indeed one of my favorite movies from the 1990s. I still quote, act out, & rewatch this movie, even with the downer tragic ending, this film has. I just can't help, loving it, despite the film changing a lot from the source material, like Gump's core personality and size. I kinda like that, he's not an autistic savant. In my opinion, it would be, too jarring. It would be, really too odd and unrealistic to see him, play chess, while being an astronaut, while people still thinking that he's an idiot. I kinda like that the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel, before skipping ahead to the end of the book. The middle part of the book is truly outrageous with Gump fighting off, cannibals, and becoming a pro-wrestler. That was way too out there to be taken seriously! The careers, he got in the film, seems more grounded with the reality of his character and the story. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States. Those changes really did help the film, a lot. This movie was also well shot by Robert Zemeckis. It made great use of its locations. I also love the use of CGI techniques to make it look like Tom Hanks was in some of the archive footage with various historical figures. Most of the visual effects in this film were pretty impressing at the time. Yet, I just wish the voice-dubbing was a little better. It doesn't really match well, with the movement of the long-dead historical figure's lips! While, the movie does have a lot of profanity, sex/nudity, drug use and violence for a PG-13. I think it somewhat works with the rebellions style of the 1960s. I also dig the film soundtrack. Great use of many well-known artists of the 1950s & 1960s. It's really does fit with that era of time. Also, the original music that Alan Silvestri made for the film was also beautiful. It fits some well in the film. Not only did that work, but the acting was outstanding. Tom Hanks was amazing as the title character. In other hands, this dim-witted, guileless, Southern-drawling simpleton hero could had turn into a bumbling yet annoying unlikeable offensive mental retarded stereotype. Instead, Hanks makes the fictional character, Gump seem like a real person with real motives and feelings. He really did deserve the Oscar, despite what some critics make say about his performance. Even the supporting cast was well-done. I love all of the characters ranging from 'Bubba' Blue (Mykelti Williamson) to Mrs. Gump (Sally Fields). I even kinda like Jenny, even when the writers made her, somewhat a horrible selfish trouble-person, who leaves Gump with a kid that grew up to be Haley Joan Osment in one of his first movie roles. Then- who can ever forget, Lt. Dan Taylor? This was Gary Sinise finest role. The character development that they gave him, was heart-breaking, yet hopeful. I love his redemption story. The film has this 'ignorance is bliss' philosophy to it; that makes the movie, fun to watch. The satire on contemporary values, during America's mid-20th century accomplishments is truly funny. The historic 'zelig' style jokes are mostly a hit than a miss to the funny. I also like how ambiguous, Forrest's story, as some people believe that he might be an unreliable narrator who whitewashing American history. Yet, I don't think, it's as racist or sexist as some people think, it is. The film is a lot more positive than that. Forrest is a represented of what is innocence and good about the world. He has this, out right decency about himself. He helps his friends if they're in need, even if some of them, take advanced of his hospitality. Forrest Gump is also a surprisingly spiritual story, well-told. A lot of people has stated out, the relationship between Forrest and Jenny echoes the relationship of Hosea and Gomer in the Old Testament; which in return is about, the relationship between God and man. Hints, the white feather that floats through Forrest's life. The movie is about the question of whether we are masters of our own fate or on a path to a predetermined destiny. Another thing, interesting, is how some people has been noted to see some political interpretations which I kinda have to disagree with. While, it seem like Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of counter-cultural embrace, complete with drug usage, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation between America's extremes political points; I agree with Hanks, the film was non-political and non-judgmental. Forrest Gump isn't about liberal or conservative values. It's about learning to live with your limitations, while also giving it, everything you got. About the film winning best picture in 1994 over films like 'The Shawshank Redemption' & 'Pulp Fiction', I think the movie deserve it. While, on the surface, those other two films look superior better and more mature. In true, 'Forrest Gump' has just as much to give as those films. Also, it's by far, the more entertaining film of the three. Overall: Forrest Gump is like a box of chocolates. It's super sweet."

"jeremy3","1","72","175","28 August 2006"," Didn't like or get the message
","This movie suffers from a bad case of ""schizophrenia"". The movie starts out as a story about a boy who overcomes a handicap with a strong single mother (played by Sally Field). The movie could have been then a ""low key"" version of Radio and made a statement about the obstacles one has to overcome. Instead, Zemeckis wanted to make a statement about American history from the 60s to the 80s. The result was a judgmental indictment without regard for the ""complexities"" involved. For example, we are supposed to think that Forrest Gump is so ""dimwitted"" that he doesn't care about civil rights, when a young black woman is trying to attend class. Is Zemeckis mocking civil rights? Then there is something about having to pee while shaking hands with LBJ. I guess some people find this funny, but it just appeared childish to me. Then, Gump goes off to Vietnam, leaving his ""flaky"", ""irresponsible"" girlfriend behind. You get tired easily of his girlfriend being portrayed as an irresponsible child. When he returns from 'Nam, he gets in a fight with some pretentious hippy, who is supposed to represent the entire anti-War movement. This really irritated me seeing all the complex issues of the 60s being used to subjectively attack the anti-war movement. After this slight, the movie moves on to a new story. Now Forrest is running for no reason. In the movie ""Convoy"", where this idea was borrowed from (switching from truckers to runners), there seemed to be a little bit of a political message. Forrest is just running for no rhyme or reason. By the end of the movie, I am just annoyed by his talk about a box of chocolate. This movie was extremely annoying, patronizing, and ignorant. Forrest Gump might of been a better, more honest movie, if Zemeckis stuck to the storyline, instead of pursuing a right-wing political agenda."

"enricobonanno","2","52","123","15 January 2004"," One of the most over-rated American films of all time!!!
","How can you start talking about a movie like ""Forrest Gump"" without being bias on the whole hype that has been surrounding it since it came out. For someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the Academy Awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than...<br/><br/>
Pulp Fiction The Shawshank Redemption Quiz Show and even Four Weddings and a Funeral<br/><br/>and how could Robert Zemeckis' (I hate that name) work be considered better than...<br/><br/>Krzysztof Kieslowski for RED!!!!!!!!!!! Quentin Tarantino for PULP FICTION!!!!!! Woody Allen for BULLETS OVER BROADWAY!!!!!! Robert Redford for QUIZ SHOW!!!!!!! Not to mention that the Academy is such an airhead that Frank Darabont the director of The Shawshank Redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!!<br/><br/>Let's consider MANY important factors for this movie to be loved blindly, without a true sense of reflection and observation.<br/><br/>Number 1: I have to much time on my hands,<br/><br/>Number 2: It stars Tom Hanks who undoubtedly represents the white, flawless way of American Life. He is the Jimmy Stewart of today (that could not hurt). He is talented, but highly overrated. He has some excellent performances, but he always seems the same to me. He could never have the talent that actors like Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different role. He is the typical American male sweetheart, regardless everybody loves him. His star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to get sold and appreciated.<br/><br/>Number 3: Stories about characters with disabilities always, and I mean always sell in Hollywood (Rainman, I am Sam, Nell, My Left Foot, Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) not that I am saying that these great films compare to Forrest Gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad sells.<br/><br/>Number 4: The history of the United States is taken rather lightly in this movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. Racism, Vietnam, meeting a number of American Presidents, his unheard speech at Lincoln Memorial, the hippies, drugs, Bubba Gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp the magnitude of those very events. He is mentally handicaped as we are shown from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is emotionally handicap too. He never seems to get emotionally affected by anything, unless it involves Jenny, even then it does not appear to be convincing or moving in any way.<br/><br/>Number 5: The story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy, uncompromised and made in half measures. It touches certain issues, but never dwells on them with justice. The ingenuity of the character, his disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a certain depth. Which they are not. It is unfair, because Hanks' charm and Gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. It never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the  story and into the gut of what was attempted to be said.<br/><br/>Number 6: Stupid moments, everybody loves them, Hollywood is an expert of what people like and what they want to spend their money on. Gump begins a ""marathon"" across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a metaphor for the movie itself). Elvis Presley the King or Rock ends up as a youngster, who knows how, in Gump's house as a visitor. Gump who has braces in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous. Something that I personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an issue like the Vietnam War, but Forrest somehow manages to run in and out the jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. Maybe Zemeckis never read a book or even watched a film (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Casualties of War) to illustrate him on what really happened on that war. Young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. Forrest Gump is a fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of ""reality"". Oliver Stone dedicated his film Platoon to the American soldiers in Vietnam, he went there for real and saw what happened. Zemeckis has decided to ignore all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even be immune to a experience like Vietnam (in every aspect possible).<br/><br/>To conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because Forrest Gump won the oscar for Best Picture makes it one of the best films of the 90's. The ""sweetness"" of this movie is not even sweet, its only the a ploy, a sales pitch of the American Dream. In 20 years who will remember Forrest Gump, and more importantly who will remember that film when The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction are still in people's memories for real reasons. They are art films, Forrest Gump the oscar's favorite.<br/><br/>And seriously folks if you haven't seen Kieslowski's RED run over to blockbuster and rent it. Its the end of the Color Trilogy. Then you'll know what we mean.<br/><br/>thank you. VIVA EL CINE!!!!"

","This movie, nothing more than a cheesy scenes needlessly thrown together, truly has no heart or point to it, and is among the worst that I have seen. It attempts to do everything without focusing its attempts. Just like the way that a person who tries to multitask only does a semi-good job on either task, this movie does no good job at anything. If the movie were sped up, it would seem like a parody of Hollywood films. I am honestly shocked that anyone enjoyed this film.

I personally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their own batch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.<br/><br/>From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie, because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, or sterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me. I personally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded his buddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movie only grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and would have won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtar part 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things to come from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although better films than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIG HOLLYWOOD garbage machine.

","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an IQ of 75 and plays a role in many aspects of American history, everything from Elvis to Watergate to the smiley face to the integration of the University of Alabama.  The message of the movie is that if you are stupid and you always do as you are told, then great things will just fall into your lap.  The movie is beyond farfetched.  The movie is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable.  The basic premise of the movie is ludicrous.  There is no way to make it work.  This movie is a real insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  Tom Hanks is totally obnoxious in this movie.  I never liked him anyway.<br/><br/>The movie glorifies stupidity and treats us, the viewers, like we are stupid too.  When Forrest's mother says Forrest is named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, we see a flashback of General Forrest.  When Forrest talks about Lieutenant Dan's (Gary Sinise) family, we see flashbacks of Lieutenant Dan's relatives.  I understand!  You don't have to show me!  The movie begins and ends with a feather drifting around, as if we are too stupid to get the message that Forrest drifts through his life aimlessly.  I get the point!  I don't need to see an actual feather!<br/><br/>The soundtrack is irritating.  The songs keep breaking into the movie in a very annoying manner.  And they are so literal-minded!  When Forrest is running, we get `Running on Empty.'  When Forrest goes home, we get `Sweet Home Alabama.'  When Jenny (Robin Wright) walks out a door, we get `Don't You Love Her As She's Walking Out the Door.'<br/><br/>Forrest's mother (Sally Field) does something absolutely despicable to keep Forrest in a school for which he is clearly not qualified.  Are we supposed to admire Mrs. Gump for her devotion to her son?  I do NOT admire her!<br/><br/>The movie never even tries to explain how a person with an IQ of 75 somehow manages to graduate from high school and college and join the military. The movie expects us to simply accept this fact without question.  And what happened to Jenny's sisters?  The movie mentions them once and then conveniently forgets all about them.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is Gary Sinise.  He plays a believable character and gives a good performance."

","Perhaps one of the most overrated movies I have ever seen.  I fear for a society that adores and embraces a movie without looking beyond the surface. This movie is, at its core, a celebration of mediocrity.  Sort of like the current popularity of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" (which lets the average person feel smart because they can answer easy questions) this movie is designed to make the average person feel great about themselves for being nothing more than average, just like Forrest.<br/><br/>I agree with the comments that infer a fascist or totalitarian subtext to this movie.  This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a ""success"" without trying.  A satisfied public is easy to control, for better or for worse . . ."

The scene in which Forrest's mother dies inadvertently provided some comic relief after interminable scenes of Gump running across America, meeting Presidents, and maintaining a frankly creepy crush on childhood ""sweetheart"" Jenny.<br/><br/>This nauseating piece of reactionary twaddle is something the CIA should consider as a means of extracting information from anyone they saw fit. I'd be screaming for mercy after 10 minutes.<br/><br/>And what were the Academy smoking when they gave Hanks an Oscar for this turd?

","Since I first saw this film at the age of 8, Forrest Gump has always been my favourite film. As a child this film was magical and Forrest inspired me with his ability to run fast. The scene where he breaks from his leg braces is iconic and highlights how well the movie matches music to emotion. The Forrest Gump theme music by Alan Silvestri hits the mark and truly captures the beauty of a feather moving in the wind. The movie uses the theme of life being like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. What the audience gets is top tier cinema production on all levels. The director Robert Zemeckis delivers a visually stunning film that shows so much of the American Dream. The acting showcases Tom Hanks, Sally Field and Gary Sinise in their elements and they bring such life and dimension to the characters as we follow Forrest and his Mama across the decades. The movie tackles some of the hard topics with grace and surprising wit, all the while being respectful and quite informative of many historical moments without getting caught up wasting too much time on any one moment. The film to personally becomes one of understanding WHY exactly Forrest was able to be so successful. Luck? Funny script? Are we to believe its like the movie Being There where a man can succeed by the Mr magooing of his ignorance and naiveté. No. Forrest is successful because he is trusting. He puts his faith in others and in return friends help him. Sure a man of lesser intelligence can be swindled and taken advantage of but the story says that a man who works hard, trusts his fellow man and loves his mama and his god will succeed in America. The American Dream."
"Galina_movie_fan","10","10","18","14 February 2010"," ...And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump
","I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country. <br/><br/>The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar. <br/><br/>When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump."
"miaoyabo","10","10","18","18 December 2006"," What a movie!
","I lived in China and in 1995 when I was still a high school student, I watched this movie for its reputation  won several Oscar. Honestly I felt bored when I was watching the movie that time because I could hardly understand the meaning of the movie and could hardly feel its beauty. At that time, only ""The Terminator"" kind of movies was able to attract me. After I watched it for the second time now after 11 years, I felt quite moved by almost all the elements this movie carries, the story, quotes, special effect, Tom Hank's perfect portray of Forrest Gump and most importantly, Forrest's deepest innate world. It's not easy to conclude what kind of person Gump is and what are the meanings and inspiration this fictitious character conveys to all the viewers. But I do have the strongest inspiration from this movie, that is, people can really get somewhere to achieve something not only because they have a lot of good qualities, more importantly, from what we see on Forrest Gump, because of not having a lot of bad qualities, or innate weakness of human beings, or various interferences around everybody. You can see all those bad qualities, weaknesses and interferences from the lives of Lt. Dan and Jenny who are normal or seemingly smart persons. On the contrary, Forrest is a person with low IQ and was thought of by many people as moron. Yes, Forrest is not smart and he knows it quite well. But for me, exactly because of his being not so smart, he doesn't have those bad things that other normal persons have that prevent them from achieving what Forrest was able to achieve. Those people have too many thoughts sometimes, or too much expectation, or too much depression in face of setbacks and all those things are actually interferences to the normal people that prevent them from staying focused for a long time. Now I should be looking at myself and asking myself, what kind of interferences I should remove from myself to really get somewhere. Thanks, Forrest Gump, thanks, this fabulous movie that sheds so much light on me."

","FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.<br/><br/>The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell. <br/><br/>Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.<br/><br/>On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.<br/><br/>According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write ""Imagine"" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.<br/><br/>FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis?

","Forrest Gump is a film that essentially decides to take a fictional developmentally delayed Southerner and insert him into several decades of history, having him interject with everything from George Wallace's anti-integregation push to inspiring Elvis' famous dance moves. This is simply a history trivializing gimmick, that is repeated dozens of times throughout the film. Three things basically happen in the film; Forrest does something amazing, he interjects in a historical event, but boy does he miss Jenny. This is constantly repeated as well. The message; that the wholesome, slow, never questioning Forrest is a hero while the nonconformist free thinking Jenny becomes an aids infected slut is problematic. The depiction of Forrest by Tom Hanks is one note and mind numbingly sentimental. Forrest Gump is not so much a movie as a one note concept stretched out to a bloated running time. Stupid is as stupid does, and this movie certainly is stupid."
"donjeffries","1","44","103","3 July 2009"," Overrated And Unbelievable
","The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal ""Bosom Buddies."" Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....<br/><br/>To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.<br/><br/>The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.<br/><br/>Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many ""good"" and ""upright"" citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better."

","For the life of me I will never understand the popularity of this movie. It is nothing more than a tedious, painfully melodramatic mess.<br/><br/>The entire film is based on a gimmick that is repeated ad nauseum until eventually I just wanted to chew off one of my hands instead of watching another minute.  That gimmick consists of inserting Forrest into an historic event and watching him emerge triumphant.  That the film repeatedly has Forrest living through (and becoming a hero in) the most tumultuous times in recent American history---Vietnam, segregation, the Cold War, etc.---is an insult to the people who lived through those times.  To say that Forrest, with all his moronic wisdom, is smarter than those who actually experienced the event into which Forrest is digitally inserted is nothing short of an affront to America itself.<br/><br/>One of the greatest tragedies in its Oscar sweep is that ""Gump"" won for Best Editing over ""Hoop Dreams,"" a movie culled from over 300 hours of footage. ""Hoop"" is riveting for every minute while ""Gump"" drags on and on with superfluous scene after superfluous scene.  Could that ""Forrest running back and forth across the US"" have possibly been milked any longer?  This lasts 15 minutes with no reason except to portray the passage of time.<br/><br/>And as for Forrest's ""soul mate,"" Jenny, this little slut is a despicable character who abuses Forrest throughout his entire life, both mentally and emotionally, and shows him nothing but disrespect.  This character does not deserve our sympathy, she deserves our contempt.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is woefully, abominably bad.  Its main gimmick is cute the first time you see the movie, but after one viewing the entire facade comes crashing down to reveal a redundant plot, mediocre acting (Hanks is an Oscar-caliber actor, but not for this dreck; he was better in both ""Cast Away"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"") and inept editing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this stands as the least deserving of all Best Picture Oscar winners.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/10"

But I thought it was the most manipulative, unrealistic, piece of tripe I ever saw. Nothing that happens to Forrest would happen in reality and don't tell me it's a parable, because I don't even think it works on that level. The truth is if I was sitting on a bench with Forrest and he started to tell me his life story, I would get up and leave because strangers who behave that way make me uncomfortable and many people would admit this if they were honest enough to get over the emotional aspects of the story. Jenny was a tramp who didn't love him and slept around and didn't deserve that slavish devotion. And the line ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get"" not only makes ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" look profound, but it's untrue to boot. Whitman samplers publish the contents on the inside of the box. So, shoot me.

","I just recently saw this movie again, hadn't seen it since it first came out in '94.  Maybe everyone else figured it out, but I suddenly realized  that the whole movie really was about ""stupid is as stupid does,"" the phrase he repeats every time he's accused of being dim.  Forrest Gump is obviously not a bright guy, but the movie seems to say that that doesn't matter very much because he makes the right choices.  His decisions are smart even if he isn't.  <br/><br/>And his decisions are, of course, strangely conservative, strange insofar as the movie comes out of ultraliberal Hollywood.  He plays sports, has an old fashioned sense of chivalry (i.e. beating up anyone who abuses his lifelong love Jenny), he goes to war, he believes in God, starts up a small business, works hard, loves his mother, has a deep sense of honor (giving over half the proceeds of ""Bubba Gump"" to the family of his deceased friend) and, strangest of all, is a white male from the south portrayed in a positive light.  <br/><br/>Contrapose this with Jenny, who is obviously very bright, very smart and makes every wrong move one could make (""stupid is as stupid does"" again comes to mind).  She's promiscuous, a drug user, suicidal, falls in with the anti-war inanity of the SDS and Black Panthers, parties hard at discos during the seventies, and ultimately ends up dying of AIDS, never mentioned, but the implication is of course there.  <br/><br/>The movie is a tour through American history of course, but I don't think the special effects detract from the basic simplicity of the story.  It is basically a morality story.  Not a very deep or complex one, but just very simple--do the right things, and your life will turn out okay. <br/><br/>
There aren't very many of these movies made anymore, and so it's somewhat satisfying that this one was, and that it was so successful. It's as if American society had finally had its fill of beautiful alienated youngsters who rebel, do drugs, hate their parents and act like all around jerks (see American Beauty or Cruel Intentions for examples).  <br/><br/>Gump isn't the best movie ever made, but it's a strong one, one very much worth seeing, and seeing again to be honest.  ""Stupid is as stupid does"" may not be poetry or very deep, but it ends up being true, and more than enough to fill up a movie, and make you feel good as the feather floats up into the air at the end."

","I have to whole-heartedly agree with people who complained about the hype. I guess this movie was made to pander to the baby-boomers.  Why people insist that Tom Hanks is a great actor is beyond me.  Don't get me wrong, I thought he was brilliant on ""Bosom Buddies,"" I just wish he would return to the small screen.  I remember Bill Maher on ""Politically Incorrect"" remarking on Mr. Hanks winning the Best Actor award for this movie.  He basically asked how hard was it to portray an idiot?  I suppose Tom Servo's diatribe on MST3k accurately summarizes my opinion of this flick. Something like, ""Oh, so life is like a box of chocolates?  Oh yeah?  Well, I say life is like a c*** sandwich; the more bread you have, the less c*** you have to take!""  If only there was more bread in this movie!"

","I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this movie. I usually love Tom Hanks, but his acting was wooden and his character was unbelievable. I was very disappointed when it received an academy award. The movie was supposed to be inspiring, but it's hard for me to be inspired when there's so little that's recognizable about a character. I think the reason the box of chocolates line was quoted so much was that that was all that was memorable about the movie. One ""effect"" that I especially disliked was the technique whereby Forrest Gump was included in old footage. In addition, I found myself worrying about Sally Field's career. There was a period in her career when she was in some excellent movies and this role as a pitiful mother definitely seemed like a step down."
"hernan_amado","Null","17","35","23 July 2002"," Over-rated and disappointing!
","""Spoilers"" I must start by writing that I do not like this movie at all. Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.<br/><br/>We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world. I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.<br/><br/>After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!<br/><br/>I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it. All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance. His performance in 'The Green Mile' was better. 5/10"
"SpaniardInTheWorks","5","23","50","18 June 2000"," The most ridiculous movie I have ever seen in my life
","OK, before I tear this movie to shreds, exactly HOW many Academy Awards did the stupid thing win? No, wait, don't tell me. I have a feeling the answer will depress me.<br/><br/>This hype--er, movie--is a living testament to the fact that the baby boomers are incredible suckers. It's quite simple, really. You make a movie that romanticizes the '50's, '60's and '70's, and with enough publicity and a good enough soundtrack, no matter how bad the movie is, you have a hit on your hands. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the generation is stupid or shallow by any means; I'm merely saying that perhaps the haze of nostalgia that obstructed their view of the movie screen during Forrest Gump is what made this trash a hit.<br/><br/>Because Forrest Gump is one ridiculous, unbelievable joke followed by another, and when Forrest isn't teaching Elvis how to dance, giving Lennon the idea for ""Imagine"" or, in an embarrassing scene I only WISH I could call ""forgettable"", wiping his face on a clean shirt and making a smiley face with the dirt by accident (""Have a nice day,"" he says to the man who gave him the shirt, thankfully ending one of the ""clever"" scenes that surely had everyone rolling in the aisles); his life is taking another depressing turn that makes this less ""feel-good movie of 1994"" than ""number 1 movie of 1994 to commit suicide to"". He's born crippled with an IQ of 75; the neighborhood kids taunt and throw rocks at him; his ""girlfriend"" Jenny leads him on hopelessly while sleeping with every man in America except for him; his best friend dies in Vietnam and his superior has his legs blown off. Feelin' good yet? Oh, it gets better.<br/><br/>But even if Forrest Gump IS depressing, that doesn't make it a bad movie. What makes it bad is, as I said before, the silliness. Sure, putting him in all those vintage newsreels is cute and even pretty cool to see. But the cuteness wears thin pretty soon, and is replaced by more ridiculous events in which Forrest inadverently alters NEARLY EVERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN AMERICA, FOR THREE ENTIRE DECADES. Maybe that's appealing to some people, but not for me. For me, it makes the movie completely unbelievable, and what's more, stupid. This is not cute, and I certainly wasn't feeling good when I realized I'd wasted over two hours of my life listening to Forrest Gump's preposterous anecdotes.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie's few saving graces--the good but predictable soundtrack (""For What it's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield in a Vietnam scene...great! Only 300 other movies before have done the exact same thing!), and the interesting effects with the newsreels--fail to rescue this bomb from the clutches of mediocrity. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis can have Oscars coming out of their friggin' ears, for all I care...this movie will only ever amount to a 5 out of 10 in my book."

This movie likes to think that if it can pass itself off as simple, it can pass of its truths as ""simple truths"" much like its foggy-headed main character.  Not so.  It's just simple, in a kind of idiotic way that makes us underestimate the complexities of our social history (speaking as a 23 year old, what do I know?, but I've been through a little bit) and come out with a shiny happy 90s answer to all these issues.

On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack of empathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, is walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just shouted ""move"" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so on.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove it can be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of the film had come together up until the inserts.<br/><br/>Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates - flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents."

"Jarv1","1","24","54","25 February 2004"," A poisonous pill with a sugar coating (loads of spoilers)
","I loathe and despise this film on so many different levels.<br/><br/>Firstly, how did Tom Hanks win an Oscar for speaking very slowly. I have never seen such a collective display of acting incompetence be so highly lauded.<br/><br/>Secondly, The central message of this film is (spoilers) America is better than everywhere else in the world. Don't get me wrong, I like America. I love Americans, I waste massive amounts of my time and money on movies, music, and books produced in America- but this bloody movie is a typical of why so many people now seem to be anti-US. If you look at the lengths the ""good"" characters go to conform to society's ideal- his mother having sex with the principal, for example- they will behave in an immoral fashion to further their own lives within the American ideal. Furthermore, just in case this subtle point flew over the heads of the audience, the sole character to attempt to break from this conformity is killed with AIDS.<br/><br/>Thirdly, I know it is a movie, a work of fiction etc, so there must be some suspension of disbelief, but this simply goes to far. How does a mentally handicapped kid from a redneck backwater manage to meet a significant amount of noteworthy 20th century figures, and be present at so many of the last centuries significant events? Also, why does no-one tell him where to go when he is waffling on at the bus stop?<br/><br/>Next Up- no-one ever seems to comment on this, but this film is BORING. It is a string of randomly connected events, some of which are so tedious that when I first saw it I literally felt my brain melting. For example (spoiler) when he goes running for god knows how long for no apparent reason- then stops again for no apparent reason. The sheer pointlessness of this section made me want to cry out of frustration. This film is 2 hours and 20 minutes long- not an epic by any stretch of the imagination, but at least half an hour over time. The running section could easily (for example) have ended up on the cutting room floor without detracting from the movie in any way. This is actually typical of so much of the movie- (spoilers) Elvis does not add anything to the plot (except irritation), the table tennis scenes, the section with the prostitutes in New York, I could go on and on but frankly cannot be bothered. The basic storyline, as reliant as it is on suspension of disbelief etc, is essentially quite simple. (spoiler)Retarded boy from red neck backwater attends several famous events and through god's good graces and America's providence has a fabulously successful life, whilst losing the only woman he ever loved, and making some life-long friends. Easy, biographical story, not without a heartwarming premise. Instead we have a bloated, appalling, falsely moralistic, repugnant propaganda sequence constructed from a series of irritating set pieces and laden with pseudo-meaningful interludes. Why was it not made as a simple fictional biopic?<br/><br/>Finally, I am not pro-feminist at all, but this movie made my stomach turn in it's treatment of the female characters. All the women of the movie are morally loose- whether it is his mother, love of his life (the only two complete female characters anyway), or any of the minor characters (two hookers leaps to mind), they all display a worrying lack of morals.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is 140 minutes of my life that I want back. I feel violated for having seen this saccharine wrapped pile of excrement- I think I have given enough reasons for why it is the worst movie of all time without even going into it's wallowing in sentimentality, or dismal direction, or even looking at the waste of fine actors (Sally field, Gary Sinese etc). That Tom Hanks won his second Oscar for this overrated pile of garbage shows what an absolute travesty the Academy voting system is."

It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.<br/><br/>This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

","I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.<br/><br/>These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Soap opera fans<br/><br/>-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do have<br/><br/>an artistic film school depth<br/><br/>I'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout.

That this movie was passed off as touching is wrong.  I loved Dumb and Dumber, and I see why I am not offended by it:  it does not feign depth or decency.

","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.<br/><br/>Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.<br/><br/>Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended."

","The first time I saw Forrest Gump, I loved it. On the second time around, I saw how terrible it actually is. There is not as much a plot as an idea. It's like watching ""Look who's talking"", where the writers thought that simply having a baby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half.<br/><br/>You all know the premise of this movie. The life of a retarded man in 20th century America. He does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. This is funny. Then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. They kill off Forrest's wife and have Forrest give a tearjerking speech like only Tom Hanks can. This is uplifting. There. Now go home and feel good.<br/><br/>Some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. In my opinion however, the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the American dream. In fact, Forrest Gump could have been a biting satire. As the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at Forrest's improbable success, the film could be seen as a parody. Mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what would happen in reality. The filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could as well have been caused by someone like Mr. Gump. The movie, however, doesn't have the guts to have lean to the right or left. Forrest's pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities for actual commentary.<br/><br/>The film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. Apparently itÂ´s not PC to bully Forrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. Forrest as both a war hero and a peace advocate exemplifies this problem. This isn't being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. Especially concerning the Vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. In the end, it only comes off as having nothing to say."

"classicalsteve","3","13","27","18 April 2010"," Sometimes American Movies Are Like a Box of Gooey Chocolates, and Gump is Pure Sap: One of the Silliest Movies to Win Best Picture
","There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".<br/><br/>Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so. A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.<br/><br/>So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?<br/><br/>During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.<br/><br/>The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel. Whoever wrote Forrest Gump was eating a box of these candies and decided to make a movie about it. The problem with those box of chocolates is that you know exactly what you're going to get and that's why I avoid them."

","Forest Gump Review <br/><br/>Forest Gump is always running away from danger, bullies, football, and sometimes just because. Running helps face many ups and downs in his life. As the protagonist trying to find love he can't get it because the love of his life can't see past his simple mind until it's too late. While Forest is achieving great success in his life by becoming a football star, a army hero, a ping pong champion, a shrimp boat captain, and a nationally known runner, he still wants Jenny. The film was produced in 1994 by Paramount Studios and Steve Tisch, Steve Starkey, Wendy Finerman. Forest who is born simple in Alabama during the period of segregation in our country and he has many obstacles as a child because people refer him as stupid, but his mother tells him he is not and to not to listen to them. He also has to have ""magic legs"" to help walk better, and he learns at an early age that he can run anywhere faster than he can walk. The movie moves thru history as Forest ages, and takes him to Vietnam and many other great adventures. He finds a lifelong friend along the way in his army Lieutenant, and Forest is always thinking about Jenny his childhood friend, wishing to be with her. <br/><br/>The effects set the mood of each scenes and capture the times especially during the war scenes with the music and the sounds of violence. The songs played in each time sequence of the movie help you establish what period Forest is in. <br/><br/>The theme is you never know what you are going to get in life and you will never be prepared so you need to make the best of everything. Hope that along the way that best always happens and try not to get off track. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies that I have seen.

It's brilliant to be in a movie that was a huge success both commercially with more than 600M$(second most in 1994 behind only THE LION KING)and critically with six Oscars (including Best Picture).

This film always inspires me to question my life. As ""normal"" people with normal IQ scores, we though we know what are important and what are things we want. We won't spend time on things that seem not important, and be make decisions and choices based on that. But for Gump, he never made a conscious choice on those important decision in his life: play football, join army, make friend with the shrimp guy, play Pingpong, running cross the country. He didn't choose to do any of these things. Just like the famous line from the movie: Life is like a box of chocolate, and you never know what you will choose.

","To get a 10 from me, a movie needs to be practically perfect in all aspects that I consider of the utmost importance: screenplay, acting, characters, technical achievement and soundtrack. Forrest Gump achieves that task. <br/><br/>First of all, I think screenplay and characters ought to be analyzed together. The story of this movie is absolutely brilliant on its surface. The idea of displaying a naive and low IQ man who witnesses some of the biggest events of the US history during the second half of the XX century was perfectly performed. It was undoubtedly one of the most amusing things that I've ever seen on the screen. <br/><br/>However, the movie was for me something beyond that. Forrest Gump, as being the simplest man you could ever imagine, represents the human being at its ""purest condition"". Gump does everything that we would do in the same situation if we weren't pressured by conventions established by society. Most people start drinking beer, for instance, not because they like it, but because they need acceptance from others. Forrest's case is different: he drinks Coke because it tastes better. He decides to mow the lawn because he likes it, regardless of other people's thoughts about that. He loves Jenny without any prejudice or shame, even though she only looks for him when she needs him desperately, representing the rest of the corrupted human race. Summing up, he follows his primal instinct and he is unconsciously immune of everything else. This makes Forrest Gump one of the nicest and well written characters of all time.<br/><br/>Nothing would be the same, of course, if it wasn't Tom Hanks in the leading role. He is astonishing, vanishing completely inside the character. Robin Wright is also perfect as Jenny, being able to perform a large amount of feelings among almost two hours and a half. Gary Sinise and Sally Field are also great. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall, who performed young Gump and young Jenny, caught our attention from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis and his team made the movie of their carriers. The visual effects were revolutionary, placing Gump alongside John F. Kennedy and John Lennon and making the audience burst out laughing. Moreover, the rhythm and the editing were perfect and the cinematography was impressive. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is also a differential, because it follows perfectly the passage of time. Hence, we enjoy some of the best hits of the 60s, the 70s and the 80s. The original score deserves a mention too. It's simple, beautiful and fits perfectly with the scenes where it appears. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is directed brilliantly, has memorable characters, astonishing and captivating performances, an original and magnificent plot and a marvelous soundtrack. Surely one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>Vote: 10."

","This movie will never get old and cannot be duplicated. Tom Hanks has done a phenomenal job bringing out this disabled character from every aspect never missing a beat. From childhood memories of bullying to just growing up and trying to be accepted,this film makes you think about your own life and become grateful. It gives you a sense of hope in knowing you can be somebody that makes a change in this world. Full of emotional drama, action, and a little bit of comedy ""Forrest Gump"" is an all time favorite. Ten out of Ten hands down one of the best Films created. Watching this movie lets you see it from the eyes of someone who wasn't born with the glamorous or perfect lifestyle. I learn and see something different every time I watch it."

","This film is incredible... And Tom Hanks is the greatest actor ever.. Watched every movie he acted.. Inspiring movie.. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing... How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does."

"jenkins_kai","10","5","8","18 July 2015"," A Marvel at Human Relationships in the Modern Era
","The tale of Forrest Gump has always been awe-inspiring. In my youth, I would curl up on the couch with the family and watch it religiously. We would quote it, laugh, and reminisce of our favorite parts.<br/><br/>Growing up, I have come to realize that the ambition that Tom Hanks portrays as Forrest is definitely something to be desired. I always connected with his character and never truly understood why. It wasn't the low IQ. I am quite intelligent. It wasn't what he accomplished. I have only done a handful of things, none of which are noteworthy. So reviewing this film as an adult, I realized I was watching it through a different pair of eyes. At first I thought the movie had changed. No... I had. The reason why I connected so much with Forrest are two-fold.<br/><br/>First, his desire for strong relationships. There were so many people that shunned him and hated upon him, much of which I can relate to. However, throughout the film, we remember his relationships. The love he has for the character Jenny is so strong, it keeps him loyal throughout his entire life, despite always taking second to someone or something else. He knew what his heart wanted and waited patiently for his time. His relationship with his ""mama"" is definitely on to be desired. Sally Field brought a nurturing side to her son who already had shortcomings from childhood. Yet, she always used positive reinforcement to encourage him and build him up. His relationship with his Army buddy Bubba was something truly remarkable. In times of hardships, a man who he barely knew, he risked his life for. Granted, throughout training they did get to know some about each other, but the fact that Bubba treated Forrest like an equal is something so commendable and it makes me want to be a better person like that. Forrest's relation ship with Lt. Dan was, albeit, an unhealthy one from the start, but even though Dan was a loner, gave up on life, and despised Forrest for saving him in Vietnam, he ended up living a full life with his new wife, who could see past his disability and truly love him for who he was underneath.<br/><br/>These days we don't see people behaving this way anymore. Almost like respect is beneath us. I will treat a custodian the same way I treat a President. People say respect is earned. No... respect is given. It doesn't matter who you are, what matters is who you are. Within. I know that last statement may sound redundant, but I'm sure some of you (hopefully all of you) can see the meaning for what it's worth.<br/><br/>Secondly, Forrest's financial gains. Throughout his life, he accumulated a substantial amount of wealth. The greatest thing? He didn't let it change him. He was the same Forrest he was as a child as he was after his accomplishments throughout his amazing life. There was no greed. There was no revenge. There was no backstabbing. There was no hate. Just love. All he did throughout the film... was love.<br/><br/>It is because of my thoughts on the film that truly make me reflect and want to be more like Forrest. Despite hardships, disabilities, and hate promoted everywhere he went, he rose above it all to maintain his self-respect and his dignity. He chose not to let outside forces change who he was within. I love him for that.<br/><br/>To Tom Hanks, should he ever read this review: You did a splendid job. I wish words could express how much I truly enjoyed your portrayal of the great Forrest Gump, but all you need to know is that, as a child, it brought me joy and laughter. As an adult, it did it again, just in different ways. I commend you and I thank you.<br/><br/>I guess it turns out that life is like a box of chocolates..."

","You can watch this movie over and over again, and it gets better every time. Every time it comes on television I go out of my way to watch it, because of how great it is. It's got memorable characters, unforgettable lines, and laugh out loud moments that will make you laugh every time you watch it. Forrest Gump is also remarkable in the fact that it is a stunning recap of the greater part of the 20th century including historical moments like, the Watergate Scandal, Vietnam War, the integration of the University of Alabama, and much much more. If you haven't seen it yet I recommend you see it immediately. A timeless classic that will have to captivated the whole time."

","After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talk about autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again this movie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are several things (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Ping pong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrest is not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys all the accusations of the movie being a ""Sentimentalistic ode to stupidity and ignorance"".<br/><br/>There are various things with which you can explain why ""Forrest Gump"" is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only of Tom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting Gary Sinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly was able to touch with this movie's music.<br/><br/>Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here is the problem with understanding that this is what they call ""Modern fable"", a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talks about what happened in that time, similarly to ""The legend of 1900"" or ""the curious case of benjamin button"". This genre seems to not be understood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receives a limited amount, but present amount of hatred.<br/><br/>Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angry because it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from other movies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understand that it's just unreasoned hatred. Go watch it, it's truly wonderful."

The movie is an inspiration to anyone and everyone, from war to Elvis Presley, peas and carrots to a box of chocolates, you never quite know whats going to happen to Forrest next. A very unlikely man finds himself in crazy situations where he finds he has a lot to say and I think without this film, we'd all be lost. As well as this, the under-lying love story adds to the thrill of the film. Jenny, his first and only love, who goes suffers greatly, is saved by Forrest even though she tries to disregard him and rejects him from her life."

","I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try.<br/><br/>And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough. He's a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role. I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.<br/><br/>What a magical movie."

But most important, it teaches to do the right thing. Once you learn to do the right thing, good things start happening to you. What few movies have is the effect of ""once the movie starts, you start living it"". This movie sucks you in and if you're a human being it leaves traces in your soul. Few movies can do that. <br/><br/>To oppose some of the reviewers. If you have rated this movie low, let me tell you something. You most probably haven't got the message of it. It's not a documentary you know. There's more to it and if you will eventually get the message, then it might help you in quite a ways.

","Movie Critic <br/><br/>Title: ""Forrest Gump""<br/><br/>By: Julian Castro<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is a great movie that almost everybody that likes to watch movies, has some day seen this film, and have thought it is a great movie. I have seen recently this movie two times and in my entire life I have seen it 5 or 6 times and every single time I see it, I become more satisfied and proud that still good movies can be created. This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and its main actors are Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump and Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Forrest's love throughout the entire movie. This film is a dramatic comedy because you feel as if you were the character, so you acquaint with the protagonist and you fell what he feels during the film. But also this movie has very funny scenes that make you laugh and enjoy the movie much more. <br/><br/>This movies takes places in various settings were Forrest Gump goes throughout the film. The most important places are Greenbow, Alabama which was his hometown, also Savannah, Georgia, Vietnam, New York City and Washington D.C. These settings are great places to develop the plot in the film. Forrest Gump is a person that has mental trouble; he has a type of mental retardation. This disability doesn't stop him of doing all of the accomplishments that he achieves throughout the story. What Forrest does is that he follows what his heart wants so he does anything humanly possible to achieve his goals. But Gump's most important goal is to achieve the love of his life, Jenny. Forrest met her since their childhood and since then Gump felt in love with her. So throughout the whole story he tries to achieve his aim with her.<br/><br/>In this, very well directed film; the actors did a great job making their specific roles. For example the protagonist of the story Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) was a great actor in this film, because he never overacted in any scene of the movie. Hanks is the perfect actor to do the role of the main character because has a lot of experience in doing a lot of films and most of them are loved by the public. So my personal thought is that Tom Hanks was chosen to be the protagonist actor because of his great quality in the art of acting. Also a great actress was Robin Wright and she did the role of Jenny Curran. She did a great job in her part and she also has the natural ability of being another great main actress and does it flawlessly without overacting. Robert Zemeckis (director) did a great decision by choosing those actors and because of his awesome decision this movie turn out being a great movie. <br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"", in general, it has very unique scenes. Personally, I liked the beginning of the film because I thought it was a very unique part, which Forrest starts telling some of his life experiences and things that happened to him that had a big impact on him, to a woman that was seated next to him in a bus. This is the only movie that I've seen that it starts like this one. Also a very nice part in the film is when Forrest was talking with Jenny about his experience in Vietnam, and Jenny was paying close attention to what was Forrest saying to her. This was an amazing part because Jenny told Forrest, after his experiences, that she loved him. This was a very powerful part because we see that Forrest felt great after those words.<br/><br/>This movie is known for having many different moral and life lessons. This movie tells us that people that have mental problems such as Forrest Gump can succeed. The only limitation for you is you, this means that I you want to achieve something no matter what, if you have dedication and effort to achieve that something, you will reach that goal. Also another moral lesson that this movie shows us is that war is not needed to have an agreement. This movie tells us that war is bad and it can affect many people's lives and families. Also the last lesson that ""Forrest Gump"" taught us was that don't give up, what we need to do is to try as hard as we can to pass through the obstacles that life puts us in front. A clear example of this lesson is Forrest, life was hard to him because he was handicapped but with some effort and hard work he succeeded in everything he did. I think people that watch this movie will see similar moral lesson, because the movie is trying to teach us the lessons that I mentioned in the paragraph.<br/><br/>This PG-13 film is a great movie that anybody that is above 13 years old can watch. But I specially recommended it to people that failed in life, so that this movies teaches them that they still have an opportunity to stand up from that failure and learn from it. I would not recommend this movie to people that don't have a open mind, because they wont learn from their errors or from their mistakes, but generally I recommended to almost everybody. Finally, this movie is a marvelous piece of art, because it is wonderful movie to watch and every time you see it you learn something new that will help throughout life or in future real life situations.<br/><br/>Scale of 1-10:<br/><br/> 9.5<br/><br/>Julian Castro is a 10th grader critic from Lincoln School.

","*****WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** Adapted from the novel of the same name by Winston Groom, ""Forrest Gump"" is unlike any movie I've ever seen. For the duration of its two-hour run, it enchants and moves, amazes and inspires, seamlessly blending comedy and drama, history and fantasy, threading its spellbinding yarn against the backdrop of some of the defining events in modern American history.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is about Forrest Gump, an everyman from Alabama. While Forrest is none too bright, he can run like the wind, which secures him a scholarship to the University of Alabama. As the film continues, he becomes a footballer, a soldier, a ping-pong champion, a folk hero and a multi-millionaire. He meets Elvis Presley and JFK; exposes the Watergate Scandal; saves lives in the Vietnam War; runs across the United States; becomes a household name as a highly successful shrimping boat captain; makes the cover of Forbes magazine; and inspires John Lennon's iconic record ""Imagine."" And yet, in spite of all these events, the defining moments in Forrest's life are those he shares with Jenny, his childhood sweetheart, who flits in and out of his life as she goes on a downward spiral trying to come to terms with being a survival of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was a child.<br/><br/>It is from these tender and real moments between Forrest and Jenny that the film finds it emotional core. Their relationship develops over the years and ultimately leads to them marrying and having a son together. But even then, Jenny's traumatic past comes back to haunt her, as the years of self-destructive behaviour that it triggered led to her becoming ill with an unknown virus (possibly HIV/AIDS) that tragically claims her life towards the end of the movie. <br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is very much a take it or leave it film. It could be viewed as one-dimensional, optimist bilge, about an idiot meandering aimlessly through life, merely getting lucky. Reading between the lines, though, you find a masterpiece, careening between sadness and joy, pain and triumph. Robert Zemeckis' direction is almost flawless; he renders ""Forrest Gump"" with aesthetic quality and flair. It includes soundtrack with contributions from various American artists and, of course, Alan Silvestri, who composes a beautiful piano suite that is magical in itself.<br/><br/>Recognising technical and writing merit, the standard of acting in ""Forrest Gump"" is high as to be almost off the scale. Tom Hanks's performance as Forrest Gump accrued Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG awards that he wholly deserved; he plays Forrest's naivety and vulnerability well and his monologue at Jenny's grave was a tearjerker. Robin Wright's portrayal of Jenny - a woman crying out for help - was tender and real and Gary Sinise, playing Forrest's commanding officer in the Army, Lt. Dan Taylor, who loses his legs after being wounded in combat, is superb, flawlessly capturing Lt. Dan's wrath, melancholy and despair and later his redemption and joy. <br/><br/>There is no way to define ""Forrest Gump"" as a movie. It can only be defined as art."

There are also several lines in this movie that are classics- in particular the ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" line.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a particularly deep film for the most part at first, because the story is quite simple.

","Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.<br/><br/>What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.<br/><br/>If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10"

This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.<br/><br/>Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10"

","Forrest Gump is the story of a guy with a low IQ and his journey through life, encompassing the homespun apple pie America of the 50s when everything was rosy and American interventionism led the world against the evil Communists, the horrible 60s when those nasty dirty hippies tried to usurp American Interventionism and God-given right to invade other people by protesting against the Vietnam War. (Shock, horror, Nixon was right all along!) and the crisis-torn 70s, when all those nasty hippies were now drug-addicted Aids carriers that caused American Interventionism and God-given etc, etc.<br/><br/>You get the point. The issues raised in the movie were far more complex than the mindset on display here, with good and bad on both sides of the argument. America is a wonderful country with wonderful people, but it can't feel good about itself so the film-makers just rewrite history so it CAN feel good about itself. It takes more than a movie of course but apparently people want to be convinced that Interventionism is not such a bad idea; still working well, isn't it? Gump's a decent guy, of course. He isn't judgemental for one thing. Perhaps if we were all afflicted with similar IQs no one would question anything, and American Interventionsm etc etc....<br/><br/>I liked Gary Sinise's performance as the war veteran amputee, just another decent guy who has every reason to feel bitter. Pity the movie then has his character rounding on the left-wing draft dodgers and hippie protesters who didn't go to Vietnam, but tried to stop the conflict; perhaps he would better off rounding on the people who sent him there in the first place???<br/><br/>This is a great movie for reactionaries. ""God damn it, I told ya that was the way it was!"" Bet they all give it a 10."

","Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow ""feel good movie"" this will fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.<br/><br/>At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of them. But this film certainly helped launch the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant"" found at tourist traps all across the United States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater tourist looking for a vacation for the mind."

","When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with ""Gump"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the life story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple man, has touched so many others.<br/><br/>There are two primary reasons why ""Forrest Gump"" will resonate through the ages:<br/><br/>First, is the Gump character himself. Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen. Even though Forrest is obviously ""slow"", he has qualities about him that we all wish we could mimic. He doesn't get caught up in the ""b.s."" of life, instead just taking things at face value and living life in the moment. As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the minutiae of our everyday lives that we forget to just ""live""...something Forrest does like no other.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times. I think there are so many baby boomers who, like Jenny, thought that counter-culture (drugs, hippies, etc.) was the best route into adulthood. What many of them realized, however, was that such behavior could not last forever, and eventually you have to come back to reality. In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about ""the journey"", so to speak. It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level. The film is on television so much these days that sometimes it gets a little over-exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking."

","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man."

There is no way, anybody would be able to take their eyes off of this masterpiece directed by Robert Zemeckis. It combines one of the most beautiful screenplays in the 20th century and a score that keeps playing in your head until you peacefully fall asleep or just die and go straight to heaven.<br/><br/>The leading role of Forest Gump is being played by an astonishingly good Tom Hanks - such a great performance! As well portrayed is the smaller role of the mother, played by Sally Fields and Gumps big love-interest Jenny, portrayed by Robin Wright.<br/><br/>Boots the house down, this is a must-see movie for every generation."

","The movie Forrest Gump has become a well known movie all around the world. Tom Hanks, a very popular and well known actor, portrays the role of Forrest. Forrest Gump is a mentally handicapped man whose disability is not specified in the film. People try to degrade Forrest by calling him names. Whenever someone calls him stupid, his mother, who is played by Sally Field, tells him ""stupid is as stupid does"" which is something he continuously repeats during the film. Although he has a disability and is told by multiple people that he can't accomplish things, he ends up doing things that no one ever imagined that he could do. Graduating high school, going to college on a football scholarship, fighting in the Vietnam War, owning a very successful shrimp business, and meeting several different presidents are just a few of the things that Forrest accomplishes over the course of the movie. Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright, first meets Forrest on the school bus when she allows him to sit with her. Jenny becomes Forrest's best friend and they then become inseparable, going everywhere and doing everything together. After they finish school, Jenny and Forrest eventually start to drift apart. Forrest serves in the Vietnam War and does countless other things with his life. Jenny's life seemingly goes in the opposite direction, she becomes apart of the ""hippie movement"" and gets involved in some things that she should not be involved in. Throughout the film Jenny makes occasional appearances in Forrest's life. Some of the things she says to Forrest when she sees him is enough to make anyone wonder ""what the heck is she thinking?"". Although there are plenty of other films in the world, this one is by far one of my favorites. With the story line and the different cinematic elements of it, including the feather falling and landing right beside him, this movie proves it is well put together and deserved to win the 6 Academy Awards it was nominated for, including Best Picture and Actor in a Leading Role."

"matthewssilverhammer","9","3","4","12 September 2014"," Sincere and Sweet
","There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives littleat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are foughtyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and naïve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybeor maybe it's just great filmmaking."
"computerman420","9","3","4","16 August 2014"," Greatest movie ever..
","I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.<br/><br/>And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.<br/><br/>I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.<br/><br/>Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid,"" his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.<br/><br/>That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.<br/><br/>It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She is a stripper by that time.<br/><br/>The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the ""Back To The Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.<br/><br/>Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.<br/><br/>Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox."" And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love- ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie."

Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.<br/><br/>Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.<br/><br/>The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.<br/><br/>p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story.

From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation.

","Tom Hanks has proved over the years that he is a talented and versatile actor and his performance as Forrest Gump is easily one of his best (only his performance in Philadelphia was better in my opinion from his films I've seen).<br/><br/>But it's not only Hanks performance that makes this film remarkable, but the story itself. Forrest Gump is an unintelligent man, but he has a heart of gold. We get to learn about his life story and everything from childhood, his college years to his service in the army in Vietnam to his eventual marriage to Jenny. We get to see Gump's struggles through life as he is picked on for being unintelligent and we also get to see some happy moments in the 2 strong friendships Gump forms with one of his army buddies (Bubba) in Vietnam and his childhood friend and eventually his wife Jenny.<br/><br/>What is also great about Forrest Gump? The fact that we are presented with a central character who we can sympathise with. It is all too easy sometimes for film makers and their writers to create characters who we are supposed to care about, but we start out hating, and hate them throughout the film and then hate them at the end. This is not the case with the character of 'Forrest Gump' It is impossible not to like Forrest as he shows that although he isn't bright, he is still capable of showing his emotions and empathy towards others i.e his protectiveness for Jenny, and when he rescues most of his platoon in Vietnam. Whilst Forrest Gump is a serious film, it does have many funny moments like when Jenny tells Forrest Gump that she has a son called Forrest and that she named him after his dad and Forrest Gump turns round and says 'He's got a daddy called Forrest too'. Obviously she then tells him that Forrest is his son.<br/><br/>Is this film perfect? Not quite - Forrest Gump's continual running seemed pointless to me, although it was fun to watch.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a wonderful film with a basic story about the life of a truly remarkable person and is well worth your time."

On a lonely day or when I need to put things in perspective and get a laugh, I pop this one in. I laugh, I cry, I think, I relax, I wonder and then I cry again at the end. I definitely like his mother and Jenni dying in the movie. It is very realistic that way. Watching Forrest sit on the stump waiting for little Forrest to come back and the feather taking off is a memorable moment for me. He lost important people in his life and gained something so priceless on the way. Jenni was gone but yet he still had a part of her, the best part. Life goes on and you take the bad with the good.

","The movie Forest Gump Was the best movie that Tom Hanks ever stared in. Tom Hanks has stared in hundreds of movies that were instant hits but Forest Gump was by far his top performance. There are also many aspects that make this movie the top movie of its time. One scene particularly of the movie really describes what kind of man the main character is and, gives a big glimpse of who he is.<br/><br/>Tom hanks has stared in many hit movies; like, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, And The Da Vinci Code. This movie is different that other because it really suits the personality of Tom Hanks and, in the making of this movie it is obvious that he had a lot of fun portraying the role of Forest Gump. The character Forest Gump is portrayed as a man who as a child was bullied a lot as a child because of his leg brace and lack of intelligence. He never new the importance of his life. As a child he met Elvis Presley and gave him the inspiration to do his dance moves that were considered atrocious in that day in age. Also had a great talent for running as he discovered as he was running from Bullies who were on bicycles and a truck chasing him through the fields. As he grew up he didn't gain much more brain power but gained the power of care, empathy, and love. This screen play is sure to make you cry but laugh just as much. That is exactly what the directer Winston Groom was trying to achieve with this film.<br/><br/>Furthermore, this film is considered by me and thousands of other people across the globe. This movie won 26 awards and nominated for countless others. Critics have made this a easy 8.7 but, I would give it a ten. Sure to make laugh cry and all of the in between. This was the best movie made its century because of the selfless acts that the main character, Forest Gump had done for his country and those around him. His lack of knowledge on curtain subjects he makes up in his empathy for others and the selfless acts for his friends and family.<br/><br/>Although, Forest talks funny and some may consider this annoying. This is a long movie that jumps from scene to scene and one has to be deeply involved in the story line to understand it. People may also question the authenticity of all acts that Forest Gump did. People may also get confused with all of the character that are introduced and later plays a important role.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Forest is a small town man who listens to what he is told and always remembered the quote that everyone has hear one time or another, "" Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates you open it up and you never know what your going to get."" That really meant a lot to Forest because he keeps a open mind to all options and everyone has a place in his heart. For example he just joined the military, and met someone named, Bubu. Bubu and Forest soon became good friends and when Bubu got injured in the battle field, Forest ran back into the dense jungle riddled with gun shots and explosions in search of his friend Bubu with out thinking. This really gave a big inside view on the character of Forest Gump. <br/><br/>However, the choice is up to you. Do you think this is a movie that you would thoroughly enjoy? Or just another movie that goes down in your list of movies that you wish to see. It just depends on the kind of movie you enjoy and connect to. If you like comedy, romance, war all in one movie, then I would bump it right up to the top of your list of things to watch.<br/><br/>Forest Gump"
"grabes","Null","3","4","16 April 2000"," WHERE'S JIMMY?
","'Forrest Gump' was an inoffensive and entertaining enough movie without being spectacular cinema. However, my comments concern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the movie<br/><br/>President Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of Nixon.<br/><br/>There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a dubious proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!<br/><br/>Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think there's any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable landscape"

","After becoming increasingly disenchanted throughout this seemingly endless film, I began to wonder what the message, if any, was. It appeared to me that the theme was that it didn't matter if you were an idiot, things would work out fine so long as you are American and your hearts is pure. Some time after seeing the movie I read extracts from the original book which was clearly of more satirical intent. Forrest Gump is a modern day Candide living out a pseudo-panglossian idyll where everything works out for the best (in this best of all possible worlds.) While the book clearly highlights the absurdity of this, the movie takes a superficial view that illustrates the situations without any apparent understanding of irony."

","I'm not a movie critic who really understands the artsy part of movie-making.<br/><br/>For me, a great movie is one that stands the test of time, makes you laugh and cry at the same time, changes your perspective for the better and keeps you entertained every moment from title sequence to closing credits. Forrest Gump is that and more.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect. Tom Hanks is brilliant beyond words, bringing to life a character that is so likable, memorable and even relatable. And finally, the soundtrack is amazing."

","I have seen this movie at least a dozen times - likely even more. For me, it is a top 5, and could easily be tied for #1 with the other 4!<br/><br/>The beauty of the film is found in Forrest Gump's innocence and purity and the way he deals with adversities and others, especially being raised in a conservative, white-powered, pre-60s Alabama culture. He does not see color, race, intelligence or gender - partially thanks to the way his mother raised him and painted a simple picture of life analogies for him to understand everything. He somehow manages to retain that innocence through some very difficult times. As he is picked on as a child, as a Vietnam soldier then veteran, as a college graduate of the late Sixties, and as an adult struggling through friendships, love, death, money and life challenges. Anyone watching should be able to personally relate to some of the various periods and parts of Forrest's life. <br/><br/>I would not be doing this review justice if I did not mention the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and detailed costumes that lent itself to making this film epic. It truly is a film that captures your attention and imagination and holds it for its entire length. I recently shared it with my kids, who, even after 20+ years, found it amazing to watch."

It seems whoever wrote this was against fatherly figures, lutenist Dan was one of the only fatherly figures in the movie.but other than that this movie a great movie and i love it.

","This might just be the best movie I have ever seen! It made me all kinds of emotional. There are parts that are so funny you will spit out your drink but other parts make it hard to swallow. Forest Gump is a simple man with a simple heart but he sure knows how to tell a story. This is my favorite movie of all time and I wish I could watch it again for the first time. I find that the worst part of the movie is the ending with Jennie. I think the only thing that disturbs me is that Jennie only comes to Forest when she is sick and no one else will take her and then she left... I felt as if Forest deserved more respect than that. However, the rest of the movie is golden. I 100% recommend it anyone in the world."

You see death, the evils of war, corruption, jealousy, self righteousness, greed, wealth, frustration, success and the world. But you see all of it almost without reaction.

Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. A beautiful story.I can understand why it won 6 Oscars.Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time.There is no way to define ""Forrest Gump"" as a movie. It can only be defined as art."

I became a fan of Tom Hanks. I find myself similar to Forest Gump. I don't remember how many times I watched it, every time I watch it, I feel great. I took great motivation from this movie.

This movie has such a heartfelt message, you can't help but fall in love with it (unless you're a heartless piece of trash that is). Following Forest's life story captivates you from the beginning as you learn all the hardships he had to overcome starting from a very young age and ending with the present in the movie (after he finishes telling his story and you follow him in the present). It's just hands down an amazing movie that made me cry and smile, laugh and yell in anger, and helped me realize judgment is the worst crime anyone can commit!!"

","Forrest Gump is a simple man from Alabama who lives an extra ordinary life.<br/><br/>This is my highest rated film of all time. A movie that can be watched over and over. Tom Hanks becomes Forrest Gump. You never feel like you are watching an actor. He is superbly backed with stellar roles by Gary Sinise (Lt Dan Taylor) and Robin Wright (Jenny).<br/><br/>The soundtrack to Forrest Gump is classic. As the story plays out it captures pivotal moments in American history. The cinematography is stunning, with the perfect track for every scene delivered by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, Fleetwood Mac and the list goes on.<br/><br/>The greatest film ever made."
"tavm","10","4","6","9 September 2014"," After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!
","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny. With all that said, I'll now just say that Forrest Gump is worth all the praise and adulation it has gotten over the years."
"CMTiago","10","4","6","6 September 2014"," It's a classic for a reason
","Forrest Gump seems to be a movie that is either dearly loved or passionately torn down. It almost always generates discussion and is a cultural landmark in American cinema. I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.<br/><br/>As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.<br/><br/>1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10"

All in all it will be on my top ten list. This movie will never get old no matter how many years it has been out for. Even though they talk in a Southern Accent it is still amazing. I think the whole aspect of Forest Gump is amazing and I never expected it to be that good the first time I watched it. Now I cannot stop watching it.

","I love this movie so much. It works as a comedy, and it teaches you really important life lessons. I admit, when I first saw this movie, I wasn't used to Tom Hanks and his southern accent. But this simpleton shows that you can do anything you want in life if you set your mind to it. I laughed at the times when Forrest says stuff that ""Mama"" used to say. And I really liked all the historical references like Vietnam, Watergate Scandal, and possibly the invention of the smiley face. Forrest shows us that anyone can achieve big things in life, even if you aren't capable. He gets the Medal of Honor, saving lives, and he didn't need to beef up on strength or anything. He didn't even have to pick up a ping pong paddle at an early age to be a master at ping pong. And he didn't even need to be a track star to run a cross country journey for a really long time. This movie really taught me to never give up."

I am a high school student who just watched the movie for a class project and for this project we had to write a review.Forrest Gump is a beautiful film and definitely is the film that Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are most known for. It's one of those rare movies that everyone has seen and just about everyone loves. It's a classic and it's not hard to see why.

This movie is excellent in every way. It is way better then some of these new movies. I love the story and plot. Jenny is a bitch though. She doesn't understand how much Forest loves her and she always pushes him away. Until she really needs him when they have a child together.

","This is the 3rd best movie I've seen. I love everything about this movie. The acting, the story, and how almost every big news event from the 1950s to the 1980s finds it's way in this film. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a kid from Alabama with a low IQ of 75 and with braces on his legs. He meets a girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright) and they become good friends. Forrest starts to lead an extremely productive life. Despite his low IQ he is accepted into the University of Alabama and becomes part of the all American team. While there he witnesses George Wallace stand in the door, to keep African American students out. When he graduates he joins the US Army and serves in the Vietnam War. He befriends a fellow boot camp recruit, Private Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue (Mykelti Williamson) who has a dream of going into the shrimping business and his platoon commander Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who regards it as his destiny to die in combat like his ancestors before him had all done. In one part the platoon is ambushed by the Viet Cong. All the men are wounded. Forrest takes all the wounded men and brings them to safety, including Lieutenant Dan. Bubba dies and Lieutenant Dan is angry with Forrest for not letting him die in combat. In the Army hospital Forrest takes a liking to Ping Pong and becomes the Ping Pong champion, and receives the Medal of Honor for saving everyone. In Washington DC he meets Jenny again who has lead a life that is the opposite of Forrest's. She moves from failure to failure as she becomes a hippie and takes drugs while Forrest goes to China to play Ping Pong for the US against the Chinese team. He meets Lieutenant Dan in New York, New York who has now fallen into depression and is still mad at Forrest for leaving him a cripple. Forrest retires from the Army and goes to become Captain of a shrimp boat like Bubba wanted to do. Lieutenant Dan later becomes his first-mate and they begin to own a very successful shrimping business. Forrest meets Jenny again and they spend more time together before she leaves again. Then Forrest for no reason at all decides to take a long run all over Alabama at first and then all over the country. He meets Jenny again who now has a son named Forrest Jr. (Haley Joel Osment) and shortly after wards Forrest and Jenny are married, and their wedding is attended by Lieutenant Dan. Later Jenny sadly dies. The film ends as Forrest is waiting for the school bus to come by and pick up Forrest Jr. on the same tree stump that Forrest's mother (Sally Field) had waited by on Forrest Sr.s first day of school. I highly consider this to be Tom Hanks's best role in any movie he's done. I certainly recommend this film to everyone."

I saw this movie 2 times and I'm proud that I've watched it, because every time I'm watching this movie, it makes me to realize that the world can be cruel and beautiful in same time and if people are nice, they can accept you the way you are.

"jbirls21","10","4","6","11 May 2014"," The best film in history
","Tom Hanks, hands down, gives one of the best performances by any actor. Ever. Forrest Gump is such a compelling, historically based, dramatic and even light hearted film that I believe is the greatest film of all time. Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, definitely should have won for Best Supporting Actor. He plays a man with no legs for more than half of the movie and he is such a harrowing character at large. Moreover, Forrest Gump, undoubtedly, has some of the best lines in movie history (Run Forrest Run, Life is like a box of chocolates, etc), but the morality behind the film is incredible. Forrest Gump, when he runs across the country for literally no reason, is such an inspirational moment in the film. What I enjoy most about Forrest Gump is that he unwittingly gets caught up in some of the most key moments in the 20th century. Watergate, Kennedy, Civil Rights, Vietnam, Alabama Football - he's there. And because Forrest is such a simple man, these scenes are that much more captivating. An absolute 10/10, Forrest Gump, driven by the once-in-a-lifetime performance by Tom Hanks, followed by a forceful performance by Gary Sinise, is the greatest film in history in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out big time. Myself, it is one of those few movies that never gets old. Fantastic every time."

I love the fact that he was in the army and even though he was not welcomed he made a long and lasting friends. Another thing is that he was always keeping his faith in God strong and true. He is an honest man and his momma raised that way. She did what was best for him.even though at times is didn't seam like it. And last thing Is that no matter what life throws at you.

"Wuchakk","9","4","6","11 March 2014"," Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in ""Forrest Gump""
","YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutes<br/><br/>I haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.<br/><br/>THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:<br/><br/>-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.<br/><br/>-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""<br/><br/>-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).<br/><br/>-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.<br/><br/>-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.<br/><br/>-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).<br/><br/>-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.<br/><br/>-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).<br/><br/>-- Keep your word.<br/><br/>-- Pray and have FAITH.<br/><br/>-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.<br/><br/>We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.<br/><br/>From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?<br/><br/>Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""<br/><br/>Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiancé at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two."

","I was long ago planing to watch this movie and when my lecturer from university told us in a lecture about him I finally decided to watch it. It's a great movie. Really touchable and inspiring story.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is nothing special, they don't even believe he is able to graduate school like normal kids, but his mother does. She never gives up on him and support him. She is the exact parent which a child like Forrest needs to grown up right. Without any expectations of big results Forrest gets beyond his possibilities and started running though his life really fast. Even though he is not with a special intellect potential he achieves everything that he wants. He is doing what he wants in the moments, when he is enjoying it and he succeed. Nothing stops him to get what he want, people's opinion is not important for him. <br/><br/>This movie is example for that there are no limits or restrictions for what a person can or can't do. When you want to do something you just start doing it, because life is short and we may loose our chance while we are wondering when is the right time to begin. There is no more right time than the exact moment - now."
"taylorleach8","9","4","6","18 February 2014"," A modern day fairy tale about a ""slow"" man, who inspires audiences by accomplishing amazing feats that someone ""like him"" should never be able to do.
","""You have to do the best with what God gave you,"" says Mrs. Gump. Never realizing just how far her son, Forrest would go. With only an IQ of 75, Forrest goes to prove to his Momma and all of America that disabilities don't have to hold one down. In this modern day version of a fairytale, Tom Hanks accurately mimics a mentally challenged person (Forrest Gump). He convinces audiences that he has a disability through his line delivery, speaking in a slow choppy southern drawl, a sound rather uncomfortable to the ear. Unfortunately we hear this speech quite often as Forrest (Hanks) voices over the entire film, telling his inspirational, somewhat unrealistic life story. In the 1950's Forrest Gump's story begins. He's a child growing up in Southern Georgia, set apart from other children because of his need to wear leg braces. His mother pushes him, never allowing him to believe he is different from anyone else. Although it occurs naturally throughout the film, Forrest's ability to influence history while remarkable, is quite obviously an overextension of reality. From teaching Elvis his first dance moves as a child to winning a football scholarship at the University of Alabama. Gump continues to marvel as he pushes across barriers that people don't believe possible for someone ""like him"". While some may criticize the exaggeration it was intentional by the director, transforming the screenplay into a modern day fairytale. Allowing Forrest to go above and beyond what is capable in real life to plant hope and inspiration to the audience.<br/><br/>Another achievement Forrest adds to his list is a war hero in Vietnam. Despite the films main goal being the message not visuals director Robert Zemeckis, a special effects whiz took advantage of the scenes in Vietnam. Down pouring rain, hot wet rain forests, and huge explosions that lite up the screen. Thus turning this family movie into pure action and creating a life like war zone. Later on he demonstrates his vision and the special effects teams' skill by displaying an injury that takes place in the previous war scene. Lieutenant Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sims) suffers a realistic double leg amputee. <br/><br/>Forrest doesn't stop at war hero though, he continues to amaze. He runs literally across the entire country for therapeutic relief and opens a successful business which turns Forrest into a millionaire. Here the screenplay continues to emphasize how important morals are through Forrest, that despite his good fortune he continues to portray the definition of a good friend and human being. As the film develops so do Forrest's feelings for Jenny his childhood friend. Here Hanks continues to impress by his complex emotional appeal. Forrest is slow but not unemotional, therefore when Hank expresses his love for Jenny his feelings are somewhat naive and abrupt. Hanks makes the audience believe that Forrest simply feels love, and does not understand the multitude of reasons behind why he and Jenny will never work out. The tale of Forrest Gump may be far-fetched, but in 2 hours and 22 minutes Hanks and Zemeckis do an excellent job of pulling audiences heart strings, reiterating important values that seem too often forgotten."

The perfect heroine, the perfect main character, the perfect ending, the perfect punch line. And Forrest Gump himself is a character drawn as to be a man with the most integration you will ever meet. Inspiring. If I could shed a tear, I would happily give it to this film.<br/><br/>As you know the film is about the life of Forrest Gump. He starts his story as a story teller (telling his own life) to random people at a bench in somewhere we are yet to know. The film doesn't waste it's time in his past as I would fear to make me bored. Quickly we go through the many live story a man can get. Entertaining as well as thrilling (in a way). As we go through all that, the set goes through the present time of Forrest Gump where it becomes so touchy, you wouldn't expect so. <br/><br/>A brilliant performance from Tom Hanks. Too a great performance from the actor of Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), as I have not seen him in many, but all favorites, but this tops them all.

","Well to describe how I personally see this movie is hard, cause so many aspects of it really are hard to describe in words... It's really something special to watch this guy who everyone said was a man with no real future go trough life in a way we could never expect, with such a simple way to see things while people around him seem to have a hard time simply living... That's where the paradox of Jenny comes into mind, where she seems to always want to find herself in a messed up world, she always comes back to the only man who never saw her for anything else than his best friend and the woman he loves... That is to me the essence of this movie, the power of Forrest Gump is that attraction, the feeling that you're watching an epic adventure trough the life of a simple man who never intended to be a great man but he became one without even knowing it... He lived for the one he loved, his mother, Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan... And Tom Hanks captured this essence... I truly believe this is one of the greatest movie of all time...

","Ever have that one film that you've been getting bothered to watch, and just because you haven't seen it people feel the need to hate you and bash you? Or maybe it's just me. Forrest Gump has been neglected by me for years on end. Sadly, I can not give a reason strong enough for people to understand. It's something only I understand.<br/><br/>My reason is that sometimes I get so sick and tired of hearing so much about one film I just blow it off and pick around the edges. It gets annoying to hear the same thing being spoken over and over again, and when I say some of my favorite films are Clerks, Tremors, License to Drive, Joy Ride, and Bio-Dome people, the ones that have heard of the above, say I have a very eclectic taste in film. That I do. But when people started verbally insulting me saying ""I'm not a real critic"" and ""You can't call yourself a critic if you haven't seen the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump, I finally just said ""OK! I'll watch it!"" The plot I won't waste time repeating. Aside from me till this day EVERYONE knows the plot of Forrest Gump. So why repeat it? A simpleton with an IQ of 75 (Hanks) describes his life in an autobiographical form to strangers while waiting for a bus. Can't get more simplistic than that.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump has been called by people ""a masterpiece"" and ""a classic."" While I think it's a well made film, I don't think it deserved six Oscars. I also don't think I should be ridiculed and slapped in the face for not seeing this film. It wasn't truly amazing. In fact, no film is really ""amazing."" Even the favorite film I don't call amazing. When defining ""amazing"" you'll find it's definition is ""surprising greatly."" I've seen actors, directors, people, teachers, etc do an ""amazing"" job teaching. The film I'm waiting to define ""amazing"" has not been found.<br/><br/>The Oscars Gump won were Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Effects, and Best Film Editing. It deserved Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Editing. That's about it. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show were all nominated for Best Picture in the year 1994. I can tell you right now I liked Shawshank better than Gump.<br/><br/>As for the rest, Director Robert Zemeckis did a great job adapting the story onto film. Tom Hanks is rightfully the only person who could play Forrest with true affection. I respect that. Hanks is now attached to so many things like Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I think ""Will he ever make a film worth seeing again?"" One category Forrest Gump should've won for is ""Best Musical Score."" The film includes the catchiest, most enjoyable score I can remember in a film. It's definitely on my list of faves (and my iPod for that matter). I found myself jamming out to the tunes in this movie. Especially Lynyrd Skynyrd's iconic ""Free Bird"" which was used to perfection in this film.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump, the character, is very likable because of his mild mannered and innocent ways. I enjoyed the scenes of him in the army, and the scenes of him at the end. He is definitely a very memorable character. Not an amazing character.<br/><br/>My final thoughts on ""the greatest movie ever"" go as followed; it was a damn fine film with very memorable moments, but is NOT the greatest film to ever be filmed, put in theaters, thrown in a case, set on the shelves. I somehow feel if I was not pressured and annoyed to review this film I would've enjoyed it more. Maybe if people didn't annoy me so much to review it I would've enjoyed more of what it had to offer. The damage is done. I bet even after I'm done with this review people will say I didn't do it appropriate justice. I got two words to say for them; s**t happens.<br/><br/>Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis."

","Forrest Gump An absolute film favourite of mine, mainly because there has never been a movie character that I have appreciated so much as Forrest Gump. A simple man who experiences (and creates) some of the most significant events in American history, while all he really wants is to be with the woman he loves, Jenny.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance as Forrest, a man of 75 IQ who is waiting at a bus stop whilst telling his life story. As we see the story develop from him meeting both his sweetheart Jenny, Elvis Presley and being told 'run Forrest, run!' different people arrive at the bus stop and listen to him. Each meets his story with emotions ranging from enraptured to derision, as they learn with the audience the incredible life Forrest has led. This includes him starring in the All American Football team, winning a Congressional Medal of Honour in Vietnam, exposing the Watergate scandal and making millions from 'Bubba-Gump shrimping industries', while meeting three different U.S Presidents along the way. The film ends on a poignant note, with Jenny and Forrest meeting again and having a son, as Jenny dies of HIV/AIDS.<br/><br/>Along with Tom Hanks in the title role Forrest Gump featured an excellent supporting cast, with career bests from Robin Wright Penn as Jenny and Gary Sinise as the legless Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan Taylor.<br/><br/>I was inspired by the wonder of a man experiencing his life without realising its significance to the world, just simply wishing for an emotionally damaged woman who goes on to live a lonely life without him. She rejects Forrest, telling him 'he doesn't know what love is', before eventually realising that no-one would ever love her more.<br/><br/>Due to its preposterous plot line and sentimental tone, Forrest Gump could easily have descended into melodramatic mush peppered with phony special effects. However in the capable hands of screenwriter Roth and director Zemeckis the movie becomes a highly entertaining yet profound account of one simple-minded man who goes on an enthralling quest. For such an audacious film there were amazingly few flaws (Forrest inspiring John Lennon to write the song 'Imagine' and the contrivances of him running across America the only examples I can recall).<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a film that may well transcend anything of its kind. It gave us a character I had great sympathy and hope for, and reminded me that a person needs no intelligence to be an upstanding and admirable person.<br/><br/>9/10 BrianInvincible"

","As a low-IQ child escaping the pursuit of his classmates, a football player holding the ball considering nothing but to run, and a Vietnam War soldier saving his friends regardless of danger, Forrest Gump seemed to be running all the way in his life. He ran through not only his life, but also most of the most meaningful years of American history. We can never imagine that it is a person with only 75 IQ that could be interviewed by the President Kennedy and President Johnson, accidentally exposed the Watergate scandal of President Nixon, participated in the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and America, and even enlightened Elvis Presley with his casual dance. He shared his innocence and purity with people around him, even in the most difficult times, and also explained us what true love and friendship are. Finally, Forrest became a millionaire, a father, and an idol by his running-followers, any of which could be the dream of the normal people. He made us laugh at ourselves, because we finally realized that it is not your possessions that make you powerful, but your internal heart."

","""Forrest Gump"" professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and arbitrary ways. An exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking, the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge, which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the better. ""Forrest Gump"" was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary Reagan era, with its ""what me worry"", feel-good-about-America message, regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering we may countenance or cause (whether in Vietnam, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Angola, or Iraq, then or now). The movie was also a major piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the Vietnam War that began under Reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the perfect fit for that most tenacious of ""urban legends"", the spat upon veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the Johnson and Nixon regimes that put them in harm's way, and then dumped them on the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support before PTSD was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in combat). This movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing nativism expressed by the likes of Sarah Palin and the ""Tea Party"" movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in America as well.

I pose a question to you, the reader; is something wrong with me? Because Forrest Gump, in my eyes, is, possibly, one of the hundred WORST movies that I've ever seen. Forrest Gump boasts a FAIR performance by Tom Hanks, starring as the title role. That, perhaps, is the best part of this movie, and it was only par. In terms of the story, which could be the worst part of this movie, it is completely pointless. It may be entertaining to watch, but, in the end, it is two and a half hours of a retard (75 I.Q.) prospering in life. This could be a really great movie, but there was no struggle involved.

Just one example among many: was I supposed to believe that Gump could be a successful football player on the University of Alabama team? How did he even get into the university? Given the tone of the movie I doubt that this was meant as a sarcastic comment on the intelligence of college football players, but that is how I saw it. It's an insult to real players who have worked hard to get on a team.<br/><br/>All right, so I should just view this as some feel-good fantasy, yes? But there were some scenes that were played for real: Gump's buddy in the Vietnam war being fatally shot in the guts, his girl friend dying of AIDS, his mother dying of cancer. Such mixtures of realism and fantasy have never worked for me.<br/><br/>Putting the above matters aside, there are more serious concerns. The message of this movie, that being mentally challenged is only a minor impediment to achieving great successes in life, is objectionable. How are parents dealing with the real problems that mentally challenged children have in this world supposed to react to this message? Or the mentally challenged themselves? Or everybody else for that matter.<br/><br/>I was highly offended by this movie."

Throughout the movie, he plays a part in almost every major event of the post-WWII era, and in the process meets several distinguished personalities.

It was the first Best Picture winner that I saw in the theaters, but I didn't consider it the best movie of 1994.

","After all the hype and promotion, I was disappointed at the lack of content. The scenes of nudity and sexuality were unnecessary and made a film which could have been great an embarrassment for those of us who prefer to stay out of other folks' bedrooms.  The acting by Mr. Hanks, however, was superb. (The only reason I gave it a ""3"" instead of a ""1"")  He made me empathize with, and love, Forrest.  His portrayal of this gentle man was the bright spot in this fatally flawed movie."

","""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies ever made! It made a HUGE impact on me when I saw it in 1993.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this one, you should go out and rent it when you get the chance. Tom Hanks has never been better, and the rest of the cast I have no complaints to make. I haven't seen them so much before, but as far as I can see they should all have won an Oscar for best performance! If it could be possible, my biggest wish right now is that there could be a second movie coming out soon. Then we would see how it has gone for Forest and his friend Lt.Dan. If they have made more money or if they have lost it all. (Not that I believe they would have lost it, with the luck that Forest has). As i final comment, I have to say that this movie has given me so much joy through the years.<br/><br/>Much like ""Sound of Music"" did for that generation, this film does for our times!"

","This is one of my favorite movies that I've ever seen. It's heartwarming, beautiful, charming, funny, and just overall great. The acting is superb, the story is excellent, and music is probably the best I've ever heard. Mostly because of the genius song selection for this movie. Every single song in this movie that you will hear(not including the original score)will perfectly some up the 50's - 90's era.<br/><br/>A great thing about this movie is that the story centers around historic events like Vietnam, Watergate, and even includes famous people like JFK, LBJ, Elvis, and John Lennon. The movie perfectly captures these famous moments and people through the eyes Forrest Gump who simply was at the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an innocent tale about an innocent, loving man who gets sucked into America's history from the 1950's - 1990's. While going through these important moments of America's history, he is also trying to be with the woman he loves, Jenny. Jenny is an interesting character because her actions and her life are the exact opposite of Forrest's. Forrest is a person who wouldn't hurt a fly. He manages his life well, works hard, and has family values which make him a great person and therefore,the audience can easily fall in love with him. Jenny on other hand, is a person who can't seem to live her life. As a child she was abused by her father, she got kicked of college for appearing in a Playboy magazine, and her dream of becoming a country singer is pretty much destroyed because in the 70's she started taking drugs and the entire time she's being used or abused by every man that she meets, except Forrest.<br/><br/>Thats the beauty of the film. You want these two to get together. You're rooting for the characters. And that's something hard to find in movies.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump still stands the test of time even though it's already 15 years old. It's a classic movie that I enjoy watching whenever it's on TV. It offers a great story complete with great acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what the hell are you doing? Go watch it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>10/10 A+ all the way"

","Screen favorite Tom Hanks proves that even the most unlikely soul can change the world in the award-winning 1994 blockbuster ""Forrest Gump"". The movie chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted but good-hearted Alabama man who has been present during significant historic events in the 20th century. In his life, Forrest Gump has been an All-American football star, a Vietnam War hero, a champion Ping-Pong player, a successful fishing tycoon and an inspiration for a whole generation. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkably uplifting smash hit that ranks as one of the best films of the 1990s. Tom Hanks delivers his most entertaining acting performance. ""Forrest Gump"" features an unforgettable story, great special effects and terrific performances by Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The 142-minute blockbuster opened with overwhelming positive reviews, grossed over $650 million worldwide and earned six Academy Award wins including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. ""Forrest Gump"" Collector's Edition is an absolute must-have for any DVD collection. The 1994 blockbuster is presented is its theatrical 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The 2-Disc DVD contains an enjoyably well-defined video transfer and an excellent 5.1 Dolby digital sound. Its supplemental extras include two detailed audio commentaries by director Robert Zemeckis and crew, the 30-minute ""Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump"" documentary, behind-the-scenes and visual effects featurettes, trailers and picture gallery.

"Torgo_Approves","7","5","9","8 October 2006"," Like the chocolate in a box, my feelings are mixed....
","(r#79)<br/><br/>I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn't an extremely well made movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. The ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but I still can't help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. There are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself.<br/><br/>The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and I loved both ""Sling Blade"" and the more obscure ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"". In the former, Billy Bob Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, Bad Santa. In ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"", Stellan Skarsgård was also utterly believable. But I just can't buy Hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsgård, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human and real as you and me. Hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He's just too goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. I did laugh at Gump's cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just ""Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"".<br/><br/>Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'Gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way.<br/><br/>This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. On the surface, ""Gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. At least Hanks and Sinise do their best."
"haden-2","4","5","9","31 October 2002"," An argument for not making movies out of books
","This movie manages to get the idea of the book and some of the episodes, but completely misses the tone, which was dark and cynical. Imagine Candide being made into a Lifetime movie and you get the idea.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is fine (although actors get a little too much credit for playing mentally-challenged individuals - a bigger challenge would be Einstein, Leonardo, or like Tom Hulce, Amadeus Mozart). <br/><br/>Some of the better, more fantastic parts of the book are completely left out. One in particular involves Forrest's being stranded on a Pacific island following the crash of his spacecraft (he is an Astrophysics savant). Would've been great. This movie cried out for a director like Terry Gilliam, but it got hackmaster Z. Oh well. It wouldn't hurt so much if it hadn't won best picture and best actor(!?!?!)."
"uscoa","5","5","9","20 October 2000"," Not worthy
","I am surprised that `Forrest Gump' made it on the 1997 AFI list of the 100 best American films. My only explanation is that had the virtue of being a recent film. It is memorable, no doubt, but it doesn't fit together.<br/><br/>When I first saw the film, I didn't understand the Black Panthers or even the specifics of the Vietnam War. Ultimately I was lost at some places. Now I understand the history, and my stomach turns at the thought of squeezing forty years of history into a two and a half hour film; it didn't work. Digressing, I am shocked by how disgustingly idiotic the character is portrayed, under the guise of a 75 IQ. I'm no expert, but I don't see someone with that IQ dropping his pants or letting himself be hit by rocks. Frankly, the rural areas of the South where young Gump grew up didn't yield rocket scientists. This is because common sense was taught instead of the abstract reasoning of the Weschler IQ scorer. Just because a person cannot recite ten numbers backwards doesn't mean that they will drop their pants on TV.<br/><br/>I'm lingering on this because it annoys me due to my elementary knowledge of these facts which were overlooked in the plot of the film. In the 1979 film `Being There', Peter Sellers plays Chance, a gardener with a mind similar to Forrest Gump; even a little simpler. However, his character never left the house where he was born and learned everything from television.<br/><br/>Next up on the docket, Vietnam. Vietnam was not funny, nor is its interpretation through the eyes of Private Gump. I don't like heavy-handed Vietnam films like `Platoon' or `Apocalypse Now', and this film is more accurate, visually; so I hear. As for the aftermath, Lieutenant Dan's post-war trauma so closely models that of Jon Voight's character in `Coming Home' that I would sue for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>The acting has ups and downs. Gary Senise is excellent as Lieutenant Dan. Robin Wright's dime-a-dozen performance makes me want to throw up. Sally Field is good in her few scenes. Star Tom Hanks is overrated and, frankly, not deserving of that golden statuette. As for the film's Best Picture Oscar, I can only conclude that the judges knew they would be lynched by angry mothers, old people, and arch-conservatives if they selected the ultra-controversial, though much better, film `Pulp Fiction'.<br/><br/>`Forrest Gump' has highlights however. The bus stop bench as a forum was a fresh idea. The Bubba-Gump Shrimp section is hilarious. And the too-little-too-late drama at the end of the film sticks with you.<br/><br/>Make your own decision, I'm playing it safe with a 5/10."

","This is a ""cute"" movie. Tom Hanks is cute. The video clips are cute, to say nothing of technologically advanced.

He was a hero and a Medal of Honor winner and he took care of his slutty girl-friend who had sex so often with so many different people that she got this disease no one even had a name for back then, but he just wanted to marry her anyway. On top of that, he was warm-hearted and sweet and a warm and fuzzy human being. So what if he was a ""dull normal"" in IQ terms? He triumphed over all the egg-heads and nerds, and you, Joe Six-Pack and your brainless children, you too can triumph over them by being a mediocre, slow, plodding, non-comprehending, low-IQ individual.

"twofold420","3","12","28","19 March 2008"," why i hated Forrest Gump
","I know I'm not the only one who hated this movie. In fact I'm not even the only person in my family that hated this movie, my mom and sister did too, and I have met other people who hated this movie throughout the years since it came out. Unfortunately, it hasn't been too many people at all.<br/><br/>Enough of that, I of course looked and heard why people seem to like this movie so much. But I couldn't disagree more. The whole plot of the movie is ridiculous -- how a mentally challenged person could go through or cause all these historical events and fads. For example, creating the smiley face, the s*** happens bumper sticker, catching the people in the Watergate scandal, winning a medal of honor, becoming a ping-pong champion (like an American can ever win that!), becoming an all-American athlete for football, running across the country, falling in love with a drug-addicted stripper (well i guess this one's believable as he is mentally challenged), speaking out against the Vietnam war after he won the medal of honor for it, etc. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Running some more, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. Then just quitting for no apparent reason, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!!<br/><br/>OK, now the good parts of it. Yes there are some things I liked about the movie. The cinematography was beautiful (and I'm a big fan of this as I believe it helps set the tone of a movie), but it's useless because there is nothing for it to enhance. I also liked Gary Sinise in this; Lt. Dan is actually a cool character. And of course, the soundtrack is awesome...Now only if we can mute everyone but Gary Sinise and the music, I might be able to sit through this movie again. One can only hope...<br/><br/>Now back to the not so good to outright horrible. I never read the book by Winston Groom so I can't say if they did the book justice or not, and I really don't care. I mentioned how much I hated the basic premise for this movie, but the dialog doesn't help either, with it's cheesy axioms and pathetic southern accents (I used to live in TN, and I don't remember the accents being that bad). Whatever, I can live with the accents, but I prefer the exaggerated ones in ""Fargo"" (I thought they sounded cool). Anyway, now onto the acting: Tom Hanks wasn't great in this movie at all. How hard is it to play somebody that doesn't change from one scene to the next. He walks, talks, and acts the same in every scene of the movie. This had to have been Hanks' easiest performance to play...and it won him his second Oscar. But of course this isn't the first time that's happened. See Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man,"" but at least that was a good movie.<br/><br/>I like a lot of Robert Zemeckis's films by the way to include ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" ""Contact"" and even ""Beowulf,"" but this one, he asked way too much for me to believe. I actually think the events of ""Star Wars 1-6"" were more likely to have occurred than the events in this movie. A lot has been said about his right wing political agenda; I don't care; it's his movie, he can do what he wants with, but I don't have to agree. Also that this movie is stereotypical to blacks. I always wondered what African Americans thought about some of the stuff in it as I don't think it was meant to be racist, but some of it kind of came off like it. I guess it's up to them to decide.<br/><br/>Now onto the last part of my comment which doesn't have anything to do with why I like/dislike any part of the movie. I've been called a Communist, un-American, and other worse things for hating this movie. Really what is the point. I don't put other people down for not liking movies I like. Everybody's is entitled to their own opinion. Furthermore, I thought I lived in (and fought for) a country where I can like or dislike whatever movie I want. I don't like movies because everyone else does, and just because Hollywood or the media says that a movie is good, doesn't mean that it is. In fact I tend to disagree with Hollywood a lot. Anyway, isn't having to like something that's jammed down my throat communist in itself? Anyway, if I had to choose between becoming a communist and liking this movie, I would choose communism without a second thought or regret.<br/><br/>If I was rating this movie on how much I actually liked it, I would give it a -infiniti just on the stupid screenplay alone. Too bad, it took awhile for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to get popular, or that would have swept the Oscars that year."

Whatchyou talking' bout, Forrest? <br/><br/>This is retro-active re-writing of pop-culture disguised as American history designed to make us all feel better about not understanding the exact details of the Watergate break-in or the black panther party. Forrest floats through life with the gravity- and substance- of a feather, tossing off sickeningly-pointless nothingisms: ""Life is like a box of chocolates..."" No, it isn't.<br/><br/>It really, really isn't.<br/><br/>His erstwhile girlfriend goes through every cliché of cultural extremism (flower child, disco burnout, AIDS corpse) to lecture the audience about the dangers of Actually Being Involved In Something!

(Love the way you moved Lennon's lips to set up your clunker of a joke... that took a lot of class!) And finally the mystery of who taught Elvis to dance has been solved- it was a crippled simpleton, and not the butler as previously suspected.<br/><br/>But the adventures don't end there: Zemeckis (Greek for arrogant-ignorant) wants us to believe that this Drooling Dandy was an integral part of EVERY significant historical event: Gump meets JFK, carves Mount Rushmore, builds the sun, performs open-heart surgery! Forrest saves a fellow soldier during The War (good) who happens to be black (better) and inherits a shrimping boat (obviously)... we meet Gary Sinise's Lieutenant Dan who has the gall to question Gump's ability; for this his legs are blown off and he's doomed to an entire life of pain and suffering. Don't fear the retard...<br/><br/>All of Forrest's toothless adventures are washed down with some of the most over-played soundtrack songs of the era, until the Dumb One takes to the road for a series of painful gags, increasing exponentially in stupidity until finally he's left with the motherless son he never wanted nor could possibly raise. (It's the next best thing to Immaculate Conception.) Are we vomiting yet?<br/><br/>Ultimately, Forrest Gump proves that Tom Hanks was so good in ""Philadelphia"" that we weren't finished giving him Oscars, and the movie's other trophies only go to prove that we're the very lemmings They think we are, preferring glossy bile over thought-provoking quality.<br/><br/>This is ""Pop-Culture for Dummies"" masquerading as American History and quality film.

"MadReviewer","6","6","12","8 May 2001"," Great Film, Horrible Message
","I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.<br/><br/>For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship  and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn)  but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.<br/><br/>Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump  he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?<br/><br/>In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish  in fact, a few are downright noble  I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.<br/><br/>`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think."

","After all the hype surrounding this movie and its subsequent showing at the Oscars, i thought i knew enough about this movie to know it wasn't going to be my type of flick. ""..feel-good fodder for the dumbed down American masses...simple boy leads extraordinary life in an over-simplified excursion thru post war America.... over-hyped, over-rewarded.. lacking realism and believable characters.""<br/><br/>that would have been some thing like the review i might have given prior to watching this film.<br/><br/>having now seen the film ( thru a rather sad of anything else to do on Saturday night)i would not change much about what i've already said about the film except to say , if possible it was even worse than i feared.<br/><br/>Not once did i feel any pathos for Gump. his low IQ was mainly used as a convenient plot device to explain all the unbelievable things that happened to him. Who can believe a guy who runs across America for 3 years just because he felt like it all of a sudden? If all the things that happen to Gump really happend to one person, that person would be a national celebrity if not an icon. Yet Gump seems to end the movie as a relatively anonymous character. Some might say this adds to the charm of the story, that this guy could be involved in all these extraordinary happenings without really knowing the consequences of his actions and what was going on around him. I think this merely adds to the flawed nature of the film. SPOILER ALERT Having said all of this, the movie maybe has one redeeming feature.My girlfriend was in tears by the end when Jenny dies. Maybe this works as a love story.  But i wouldnt watch this film just on that basis. In fact i won't ever watch this film again unless someone offers me a serious amount of money, which lets face it is about as realistic as most of this movie!"

","Forrest Gump is one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. Within this movie was a substantial amount of Life Lessons. I use to watch FG everyday after I watched Pokemon and I absolutely love this movie. I was able to identify with Forrest because as a child I was picked on because I was bowlegged and because I had a mole in the middle of my eyes. He was the perfect example of showing children who feel they are different from others that they can do anything that they put their mind too. Like many of us Forrest experience life and loving a girl that was too afraid to love him back in fear of hurting him and because of what others would say. It showed in the movie that making decisions based on what others think will make you miss out on a great thing just as Jenny did. Not only was Forrest handsome, but he was afforded so many talents that made him very successful rather it educational excellence or not. He was a Success, I feel that FG should be used in Freshman Orientation of 9th grade children because I feel this movie will help a lot of beginning 9th graders with decision making throughout high school"

"BooChanan","10","4","7","27 April 2013"," I'm not a smart man, but I know what a good film is.
","Forrest Gump is a film that is hard to describe. It gives the viewer so much more than a standard drama/romance film. It would call it a 'life' film; one that takes the emotions that everybody feels and serves them on a plate at a 5 star restaurant. Tom Hanks plays the title character in one of the most iconic acting performances of all time. Forrest is, in fact, my favorite film character of all time - and that's saying something. Unlike, some films with great acting roles, the film is not carried alone by Tom Hanks. A whole range of great actors (young and old) are in this breath-taking film. The music in this film is simply stunning; it is filled with child-like lullaby themes to symbolize the childish attitude that Forrest has to life. This is mixed with grand, epic pieces as we see Forrest mature infront of our eyes. The music is some of my favorite in all of cinema and brings a tear to my eye when I hear it. Robert Zemeckis is known for using hi-tech effects to give a unique feel to his films. Forrest Gump uses this technology in an amazing way; bringing Tom Hanks and us into historical events. The cinematography in this film is superb; the iconic feather scene at the start giving us a glimpse of what is to come. But the script is what makes me adore this film so very much; it is so quotable, so witty, so simple, so effective. It is genius!<br/><br/>There aren't enough words on earth to describe this film's magnificence, so I will just end by saying that Forrest Gump is most definitely in my top 5 favorite films of all time and will always remain in my heart.<br/><br/>I'm not a smart man, but I know what a good film is."

"neenahhh","10","4","7","29 January 2011"," The world from a different viewpoint
","I watched this a very long time ago, but I never really appreciated this movie. It must have been because I was very young. I wasn't even born when the movie first aired! However, I do remember a few scenes from this movie. The ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of Bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote: ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" This movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. The owner of these shoes, Forrest Gump, picks it up and keeps it. He just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. He then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story.<br/><br/>His story is wonderful. I loved everything about it. Forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. On top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. His IQ was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. But his mother did everything for Forrest. His mother was great. You could see she struggling.<br/><br/>I thought it was very cute the way Jenny and Forrest's friendship blossomed. How she invited him to sit beside her. The way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. Jenny was very protective of Forrest. When the first bullying encounter happened and Jenny told Forrest to run? That made my skin have goosebumps. It just felt good. ""Run, Forrest! Run!"" I also never realized back then that Jenny was having trouble with her father. But now, I understand. Jenny's prayer was also.. Amazing. ""Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far. Far far away from here."" That just touched me.<br/><br/>After his friendship with Jenny, Forrest met Bubba during the Vietnam War, after he finished college. During the scene where Forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! Nobody would let Forrest sit with him. Until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. That was the start of their strong brotherhood.<br/><br/>I felt like the time they spent together was so short. I didn't even cry when Bubba died. It was weird since I was expecting to cry, seeing as how Bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. I'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. But I still love Bubba. :) It was nice how Forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to Bubba.<br/><br/>The two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one I had tonight were 1.) I liked Lt. Dan more than I thought I would and 2.) Jenny wasn't all that great.<br/><br/>I'll talk about Lt. Dan first. First of all, I didn't even remember him! I was even shocked when I saw that his legs were cut off! See how much that ""didn't"" affect me. But he was a good friend. He became one of Forrest's best friends. He even stood up for him when one of the hookers called Forrest stupid. I thought Dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. They even became partners with the whole Bubba-Gump thing. Sweet.<br/><br/>Now, about Jenny. I don't see why Forrest liked her. Yes, I get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! I was so mad after she left him during ""the morning after"". At least that sparked Forrest's will to run all over America. Hm.<br/><br/>The ending was great. I forgot all about that. What a welcome surprise. It's just a shame that Jenny died, too, in the end. All of Forrest's loved ones passed away. All he's got left is Little Forrest. I guess in a way, that was nice. He had someone to look after and someone to look after him. :) There were a lot of great cameos that I was on a look out for. I loved that Elvis part! I even took a second look to check if that guy was really Elvis! Yes. I know. It's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! It seemed realistic. There were also meetings with different presidents. And a deal he had with a very famous ""fruit company"". The cameos just kept coming and coming. And it worked! The main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. Bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. It's a movie about life. Forrest Gump teaches you things. He sees the world from a different viewpoint. Not an idiot's viewpoint. But a child-like sort-of perspective. No biases at all. Just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. This is one movie you mustn't dare miss. Wonderful movie. Just wonderful."

","Robert Zemeckis is a name Cinema Salutes. Reason? He has made remarkable films, that have always touched a chord. But, some people believe his Cinema is not good enough, and he ain't worthy enough for what he has achieved. Now I advocate to those anti-Zemeckis's, Watch 'Forrest Gump', and you would yourself become a fan of this man and take your words back.<br/><br/>IMDb writes: 'Forrest Gump', while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny, eludes him. Is this really the meaning behind this 1994-Blockbuster? I am a Cinema Devotee, and My Verdict on this film is: This is a film above words, my summary correctly copies that. It's a journey of a man left alone, it's his journey to Win his LOVE, and finally become a proud citizen.<br/><br/>About 140 Minutes long, 'Forrest Gump' unfolds fearlessly. This is Robert Zemeckis's finest work to date. His cinema has never been so engaging before. Eric Roth's adapted screenplay provides liberties to it's historical HERO. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump & Gary Sinise, as one of Forrest's important people in his journey, pack in performances, that can surely be described as, ""Tour De Force"". Robin Wright as Jenny, becomes the beauty of her time and brings in spontaneity in her character.<br/><br/>On the whole, Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made, to pseudo, that sentence in Caps, is an understatement."
"george-758-202951","10","4","7","6 June 2010"," Love this movie
","I have this in my collection it is by far the most played movie I own. I love the simplicity of it, while at the same time being a complex tale of how so many of recent history's pivotal moments involved the same man. From the simple reference of Forrest teaching Elvis to dance, to meeting Presidents as an adult. I love the music and the scenery, the costuming and the special effects, which although now are common in movies, for their time were ground breaking in the way they were done with such detail. And it is the detail of this movie that makes it work so well. For instance when Lt DAN is on the floor in the motel room and spins around, his ""missing legs"" do not get caught on the table in the centre of the room. This was done by filming the scene without the table in the room so that Gary Sinise could move, then placing it back later to reinforce that this character had no legs. It is the sort of detail that is rarely noticed, unless it is not addressed. But most of all I love the fact that at heart it is really just a simple story of a man's love for his one true love, Jenny, a tortured soul who was so mismatched for him in so many ways that it was always going to be impossible for them to be together but this did not stop Forrest carrying her in his heart throughout all his adventures. It is easy to see why this movie was an award winner and remains my favourite movie of all time."

Kennedy, President Lyndon Johnson, President Richard Nixon, Governor George Wallace, before he is shot, leaders of the Black Panthers, Elvis Presley and Forrest even receives the Medal of Honor for selfishly saving the lives of his fellow platoon members during Vietnam war.<br/><br/>After Forrest's return to civilian life, he goes on to start a shrimping company named the Bubba Gump shrimping company with his former Lt. Colonel, who thn wisely invests the companies profits in a small start up in Silicon Valley called Apple computer.<br/><br/>Although Forrest accomplishes success in life, deep inside all he really wants is to marry Jenny, his child hood friend and first love, and have a family. The story takes an interesting twist when Jenny is diagnosed with a disease that we can only assume may be AIDS due to her care free and irresponsible drug use and numerous sexual partners over the years.<br/><br/>Such a movie, although fictional inspires all us to strive to be good hearted and kind, in a child like manner as Forrest Gump is. <br/><br/>This film is a modern day classic that you can watch over and over again.<br/><br/>Jose F.

","Everything about this film works! The acting. The visuals. The story. Everything is strewn together in a story of one's mans life and his journey to understand love, friendship, and destiny, leaving us with a film unlike any other that cannot be imitated.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks's performance as the main character will be the one that defines his career. He makes his character believable yet different from any other movie character ever created. Watching him grow up and learn more about the world is already well done, but what is amazing is that even though his world changes around him, he does not. As a result, he learns more about life, love, destiny, and how they all work together.<br/><br/>Gary Sinise's character, Lt. Dan, is one of my favorites in this movie. Just like Forrest, he learns about destiny and life. But unlike Forrest, he already had his own belief about destiny, and how he was destined to be a certain thing. But life got in the way, and he felt ""cheated"" out of his destiny growing depressed and alcoholic. It is not until a life-threatening situation that he comes at peace with his life and the fact that it took a road different from his destiny.<br/><br/>The way that director Robert Zemeckis uses both human emotion and creative special effects to tell such a story is ingenious. Everything flows together, creating an unforgettable story that faces issues like destiny and fate, American society and history, and love and friendship. Add that to great performances, especially from Hanks and Sinise, and what comes out is a great story that will be around and highly admired for years to come. 10 out of 10!"

","Forrest Gump is an instant classic. It is easily lovable and has a brilliant script, along with a career best performance from Tom Hanks, great acting by the rest of the cast, a wonderful story and great direction. The story itself is told in such a witty manner, keeping in mind that the narrator is Tom Hanks and as he is a bit low on I.Q, he does not take his life very seriously and merrily spends it. The movie is long but it never drags on. I thought that even if it extended for a few more minutes, I would not mind it.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a splendid performance and is one character that would be remembered. The emotions are expressed through his eyes. It is very hard not to shed a few tears or even keep your eyes dry when he cries or is sad, especially during the death of his closest. <br/><br/>Jenny's character is absolutely the opposite as she develops all wrong habits and suffers throughout her life. Not a very likable character. The other actors too give very good performances, mainly Sally Field, Garry Sinise. Bubba is also humorous with his obsession with shrimps.<br/><br/>Everything is good about this movie. The movie doesn't get boring at all.

","Hanks and Senise are brilliant along with the rest of the cast. From start to finish, most everyone will love this flick. I can't find fault with this movie, and I am shocked by some of the negative comments on this forum because it is a truly great film. I've watched this movie at least 10 times and I just love it. This movie is filled with all the emotions done with precision. Just sit back and enjoy it. In some ways it is so light on the outside and so profound in other ways. Gump is a wonderful movie for all ages and is so very deep. You will die laughing and also cry your eyes out. All you need is a pulse and you will love this movie for ever. 10 out of 10!

","Forrest Gump is a heart-breaking film of witt and startling grace. Another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable in his portrayal of Forrest Gump. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), and his great mother (Sally Field). <br/><br/>When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, his Mother knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a world-class ping pong player, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.<br/><br/>Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stick around him for long.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is an entertaining film of extreme importance. It completely reiterates the idea that no one should be prejudiced for being different. What a superb example of film-making! 9/10"

","The movie Forrest Gump is a very unusual, but a great, film. Each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. It was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. In the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only American cinemas, more than any other film made by Paramount Pictures before. The movie was first written as a novel by an American author Winston Groom. The movie was made in 1994, directed by an American director Robert Zmeckis.<br/><br/>The story has an odd setting. It is set in a small fictional town in Alabama, but also the whole world. The filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. It has a long time setting. The story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s. By covering of the world's time of losing innocence, as at the same time presenting Forrest as a symbol of innocence, he shows how the world has changed during the time.<br/><br/>The main character Forrest is an extraordinary person. He, played by Tom Hanks, is born with polio. He needed braces for his legs when he was young. He also has a low IQ of 70. He is unusual. He is different from other people in a lot of special ways. Forrest Gump represents all Humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'Everyman'. He is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. This leads to another theme of the story. Judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. The filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. The events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. This intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human.<br/><br/>Other characters are also very interesting. His mom Mrs. Gump, played amazingly by Sally Field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. She is willing to do anything for Forrest, and she always stands up for him. She symbolizes good motherhood. Forrest's beautiful girlfriend named Jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. She was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. Her childhood was like living hell for her. In the film played fantastically by Robin Wright, Jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance.<br/><br/>The mood of the film changes as Jenny comes to find Forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. The film slowly develops its high points. The first day of school is one. It is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. Later he goes to Vietnam and gets involved in the war. When he runs the entire breadth of America, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it.<br/><br/>There isn't only one theme in the film Forrest Gump. ""Life is like a box of chocolate,"" he says. You don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. Additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. It also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. The film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. He says, ""Stupid is as stupid does."" He might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. It really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. The film tells us what it's really like to be a human. It expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this movie is terrific. It doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. Both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. The movie has won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. I strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. It is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and I'm sure you'll really like the movie too."

","In all fairness and all clichés and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level. <br/><br/>If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack. <br/><br/>However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is. <br/><br/>The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film. <br/><br/>Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable. <br/><br/>6/10"

Robin Wright Penn is miscast and I have yet to see her in a movie in which she should have been in. I love Sally Field but even she cannot rescue this for me.<br/><br/>This may be the movie I dislike the most...the fact that it won Best Picture, Actor etc. makes me hate it even more, and usually I don't care what the Academy thinks since I question the whole thing to begin with."

","I remember hearing so much about this film and after a great year at the box office that had seen the release of Pulp Fiction and the underrated intersection, I thought that this film, from the director of ""Back to the future"" would surely not fail to the disappoint.<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong. Bob Gale must have thanked God that Zemeckis hired someone else for this self-absorbed piece of tripe. The film resembles the films of the eighties that were trying to show female empowerment by having them think and act like men, that you watch now with a odd sense of embarrassment. That's what this film is to the disabled. It tries hard to seem so enlightened and yet most of the film's attitude is mocking. The way he just happens to become a football hero, because lets face it, in America if you're disabled then that's the only way to get acceptance from Bullies. Firstly why would someone want acceptance from Bullies and more importantly what the hell does that say about the world that this is the message Zemeckis is sending out.<br/><br/>The film then becomes a horrible mish-mash as Tom Hanks is badly imposed in old film clips of chat shows and presidents, and the only plus of the film comes in the shape of a great performance by Gary Sinese that is spoilt by a cheesy ending where he forgives the Vietnamese by falling for a Vietnamese woman (Kind of like a really naff version of my name is earl.) If there is any justice in this world then this will fall down the list and out of the 250, but unfortunately the world is not just and if this film indicated that, then it would have a higher ranking from me."

","''Forrest Gump'' is a very beautiful movie that totally deserves to be in the top 250 from the IMDb, receiving nothing less then six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. The story is a lesson of life, showing the simple and mentally challenged Forrest in an epic journey through life, meeting historical figures like Elvis,John F. Kennedy,Richard Nixon, Jonh Lennon, among many others and experiencing first-hand historic events, while largely unaware of their significance, due to his low IQ of 75.<br/><br/>Even misunderstood by many people and considered to be ''stupid'' by them, Forrest has more success in his life then many of his ''normal'' friends, receiving many honor medals, becoming rich and inspiring many people. The movie is a lesson of life and shows how people who are discriminated can have more success then many of the ordinary ones.<br/><br/>And Lt. Dan Taylor, shows how people's minds can change through the years, when he first wants to die in the camp with his soldiers, and years later, thanks Forrest, that saved his life from the death.<br/><br/>I think everybody should watch this awesome movie at least once in a lifetime."

I'll admit that Hanks, Penn, and Sinise give very impressive performances. But I'm really starting to hate this movie.<br/><br/>I know, I know...of COURSE it won Best Picture--it's cynically designed from top to bottom to do that.

Well, gang, sorry to burst your precious little bubble, but it doesn't. You won't find guys like Forest running corporations; you'll find them in trailer parks, beating their kids.

","I had heard a lot about this film before I actually saw it, and the idea of a man unwittingly being present at the biggest moments of four decades seemed funny and entertaining enough. But I was heavily disappointed.<br/><br/>What Forrest Gump lacks most is a stringent storytelling. The movie just doesn´t get off the ground. It isn´t the fault of the actors in general and certainly not of Tom Hanks, who gives a brilliant storyteller and doesn´t make pure slapstick out of the dimwitted Forrest - the actors are doing fine jobs. It´s the fault of the filmmakers. Lots of shots and even whole motives are plainly useless, not even in adding atmosphere, a lot of plot turns vanish into nothingness. The touching moments are soaked in corny music and lose their emotional potential, the technically great TV montages get less entertaining every time because they are wasted in bad punchlines. The whole dialogue is highly predictable. The reenactment of the Hippie movement is quite sound, and details like the Watergate joke are good laughs, but the scenes in between are painfully slow, at the end even simply boring. About a thousand times you are led to believe that there is a deeper moral than ""enjoy your life with the things you can do really good"" (this being introduced at the very beginning), but it isn´t. <br/><br/>I don´t know what, except for the few gags that really function, could earn this movie the triumph that it had and still has. Watch ""Hair"" for the Sixties and ""Harold and Maude"" for the moral, you will be better off."

It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.<br/><br/>I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.<br/><br/>What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.<br/><br/>While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clichés and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.<br/><br/>The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.<br/><br/>I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive.

","In the early 90s Michael Medved wrote a book urging Hollywood to eschew sex and violence and make films that extolled the virtues of America, family, religion, apple pie, Thanksgiving, home-baked cookies blah blah blah. He was arguing from a 'moral' (read 'conventional Western family-oriented' standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the bottom line. He reckoned that more 'nice' films would encourage more people back into the cinemas.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump would appear to be the realisation of Medved's dream, to the extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the list, namely abject stupidity. <br/><br/>Because that's what MM and his cronies really want, isn't it? Movies that don't challenge, don't irritate, don't ask awkward questions.

If this movie evoked any kind of response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of pure boredom.  I was disappointed in the ridiculousness of ""Forrest Gump"", a lot of the reason being because I hold Tom Hanks in such high regard and never once thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream theory.  It completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and absolutely unrealistic. The braces bursting from Forrest's legs, his unintentional football scholarship to college, his meeting the president (and might I add his only words to Mr. Kennedy were ""I have to go pee""), his millions earned through ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for ""no reason at all"", his ""inventing"" the happy face symbol by wiping his face on a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The movie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of heart.  Very touching, but dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as entertainment and will not derive motivation to make something of themselves.

You really care about the lead character ""Forrest Gump,"" who is magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout, with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all ""peace and love;"" 8 - a sweet, tear-jerking ending.<br/><br/>The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock is just fine is not a good message. (""You didn't do anything wrong, Forrest,"" says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.<br/><br/>Overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics.""

"brysongraves-89429","10","3","5","7 October 2016"," This is the most inspiring movie of all time.
","Cast: Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field Director: Robert Zemeckis<br/><br/>***This may contain spoilers***<br/><br/>This is the most inspirational movie I have ever seen. Starring Tom Hanks, it is a story about the life of man named Forrest Gump who experiences many things. His experiences take place at a time when the world is constantly changing, and there is no telling where Forrest will end up next. Throughout his life's journey, he learns many lessons from all kinds of people. Forrest meets some of the most well known public figures of his time. Some include Elvis Presley, John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon. <br/><br/>The movie starts off when Forrest is a young boy with braces on his legs. Bullies would pick on him everyday chasing him home until one day his braces started falling apart while he was running. When parts began to fly from his legs, he realized he was running and was overcome with joy. This was his turning point when he was a boy. He grew up like a normal person would and graduated high school. After that a football coach noticed his talents as a football player and Forrest received a scholarship to play college football. Around the time he graduated, the Vietnam war was happening. He was drafted and sent to Vietnam. He meets Bubba who was his best friend and he also meets another great friend named Lt. Dan. Forrest was shot in the war and while he recovered he played ping pong. After his time served in the military, he continued to play ping pong for the United States and made a lot of money. With this money he bought him a shrimp boat and became a shrimp boat captain. Lt. Dan became his first mate and they started shrimping. One day Forrest headed back home on news that his mother was very ill. He stayed with her until she passed away. To deal with the sorrow from his mother passing, he began to run across the country. He would only stop to eat and sleep and would run coast to coast until one day he stopped running. He then returned home and lived there for a while. Then one day he received a letter from Jennie and went to see her. When he got there she told him that she was sick and that he had a son named Forrest. They then moved back to Forrest's house and lived there until Jennie passed. Forrest then raised his son. <br/><br/>Forrest meets the love of his life when he was a boy and her name was Jennie. The love he has for her is what keeps Forrest going through life and takes him to all of the wonderful places he goes. She was a sweet girl who was Forrest's best friend. She was the one who told him to just run if something bad was happening. Her advice led to his braces coming off, his survival, and his freedom from people. She was Forrest's number one fan. No matter where she was or what she was doing she would help him if he needed it. As she grew up many things changed about her life, and she wasn't the best person. She moved off to college and got kicked out. Then she moved off and left Forrest to travel with some hippies, got addicted to drugs, but eventually she turned her life around to become a good person. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks' acting was superb. He played the role of an innocent, simple man who was in large events. The simplicity he brings to the role makes you think that Forrest is an actual person. The acting is delivered well and isn't swinging between different personalities. There wasn't a flaw in Tom Hanks' performance. Gary Sinise, who played Lt. Dan, was great in his role. He pulled off the crazy but intelligent leader that he was. For the little time that Mykelti Williamson played Bubba in the movie, you felt connected as if he was your best friend. Robin Wright played Jennie perfectly, portraying Jennie as an opposite to Forrest. Lastly, Sally Field played Forrest's mother perfectly. She was caring, informative, and helpful like a mother should be. <br/><br/>All in all Forrest Gump is an inspirational movie about a simple man who lived an extraordinary life. It is full of life lessons and proves that anybody can do anything."
"ismith-49239","8","3","5","12 October 2015"," In the eyes of a 16 year old girl
","Forrest Gump Film Review by Ivy Smith<br/><br/>In the movie Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks portrays the main character Forrest, a simple man that is not very intelligent but has good intentions toward his mother (Sally Field) and best friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Throughout the movie Forrest tells the story of his life but since he doesn't know any better he was put into the middle of some major historical events that have happened from the 1950s - 1980s. This movie is like no other of the time of its release in 1994, still now in 2015 this movie is a favorite of many. <br/><br/>We first see Hanks' character Forrest on a bus bench in Savannah, Georgia telling his story to a stranger that sat next to him. He begins his story at the beginning, him as a boy having to get braces for his legs. His story goes on and he meets Jenny on the bus when no one else would let him sit down. From that moment on Jenny and Forrest are the best of friends. One day bullies were chasing Forrest and Jenny said ""Run Forrest! Run!"" and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. After a while Forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college. <br/><br/>He goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet President John F. Kennedy, The Vietnam War, he was on a TV show and met John Lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the Watergate scandal and many more events. He tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low IQ. His relationship with Jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. Through Jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. Jenny cleans up and decided to go back to Forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is based off of a book called Forrest Gump by Winston Groom in 1986. The book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. They took out some of the adventures Forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. The movie took great special effects in how they put the actor Tom Hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with John F. Kennedy and using special effects to take off Lt. Dan's (Gary Sinise) legs after the Vietnam war scenes. <br/><br/>The movie won six Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. The movie was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards. The film won three of them Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Best Director - Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Forrest Gump was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two of them, Best Fantasy Film, and Best Supporting Actor. The movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the Greatest Movies of All Time list. <br/><br/>I find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. The acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. The movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. I always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. I have always found that fascinating."

","I just saw this one. Though it was corny and I can see why many disliked it, I couldn't stop laughing. Whether the jokes were good or bad, I laughed and that is good enough for me to call it good. I was surprised as well by how well done it was. The quality was excellent. I guess if I was in a bad mood, this movie wouldn't be half as good, but I thought it to be enjoyable and would recommend it for the parents and kids to enjoy. Granted, everything in it is historically incorrect but that's the fun part! I give Tom Hanks a lot of credit for making this a good flick, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best movie of all time and a beautiful piece of art, but a movie doesn't have to be beautiful to be good."

But after watching it,i was really amazed.It made me see this life from a new prospective,although forrest was a simple man but he was able to be a very successful person with the ability to make people around him happy.He just took keys of life from his mother("" put the past behind you before you can move on.""""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" ""dying was a part of life""...) These few words was sufficient for him to make the best in his life and make people around him love him. He also said ""I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is."".This sentence shows you that you must not have an IQ of 200 to love.just with simple sweet things,you can be the best lover.

","Watching this film, I found it incredibly beautiful. Non of it was predictable, a lot of different twists that weren't expected, it was well thought through, well scripted and well casted. I thought Tom Hanks was the perfect choice of the main role, Forrest Gump, he kept to his character as if it was his real life being. The great thing about this movie was the fact that it was different, it isn't a repeat of another movie already been made. It has to be one of the best movies made in 1994, and one of my personal favourite movies too. 10/10 with no doubt. Excellent directing, amazing make-up, terrific acting and well staged/set."

"charishankar","8","3","5","9 September 2013"," Goodness, just goodness
","One of my favourite Maugham stories, one that's little known because it's so short, is 'Salvatore'. It ends with the following unforgettable words:<br/><br/>""I started by saying that I wondered if I could do it and now I must tell you what it is that I have tried to do. I wanted to see whether I could hold your attention for a few pages while I drew for you the portrait of a man, just an ordinary fisherman who possessed nothing in the world except a quality which is the rarest, the most precious and the loveliest that anyone can have. Heaven only knows why he should so strangely and unexpectedly have possessed it. All I know is that it shone in him with a radiance that, if it had not been unconscious and so humble, would have been to the common run of men hardly bearable. And in case you have not guessed what the quality was, I will tell you. Goodness, just goodness."" <br/><br/>Substitute the ""few pages"" for ""a little over two hours"", and there's 'Forrest Gump' for you, in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Goodness, unalloyed and uncontaminated, is always very difficult to portray on screen, and it's even more difficult to make a tale of pure goodness riveting viewing. Grey is always so much more interesting than white. Yet, there are the rare examples of cinematic excellence where the story is just about goodness, and the wonderful places it can take you. Told with panache, and essayed with sincerity, goodness still retains its power to hold. 'Yankee Doodle Dandy', with James Cagney's unforgettable performance as George M Cohan, is one such example. 'Forrest Gump', with Tom Hanks literally living the role, is another.<br/><br/>The story is epic in scope. It spans more than half of Gump's life, and portrays how greatness has nothing to do with IQ. There is such a lot to learn, about human nature, from the film, that it can hardly be told within the limited scope of a review. Gump lives his life on the surface, and yet the film is introspective, of life, in the extreme. It breaks the wall of entertainment and takes us to a place where celluloid becomes Art.<br/><br/>I'm saying nothing further about the story. And yet, I cannot but omit to mention the scene, near the end of the film, when Gump meets Jenny, luminously portrayed by Robin Wright, and her son. The chiaroscuro of expressions which cross Gump's face in that scene can serve as a textbook example for all who want to know what Acting is all about. The film is worth repeated viewings even for that one single shot.<br/><br/>And yet, wonder of wonders, there are those who have panned 'Forrest Gump'. Well, it takes all types to make a world."
"gregscarmel","10","3","5","29 July 2013"," The excellence of Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump
","Tom Hanks delivers one of the greatest roles ever on the big screen. Forrest Gump could not have been as excellent if somebody else was casted as Forrest Gump. Who else could play him ""Jack Nicholson"". I don't think so. He was born for that role and after he schocked everyone in Philadelphia as a man dying from AIDS he goes and schocks everyone in Forrest Gump and wins his second Oscar in a row. All I know is, from the 1st line in the movie you know he was golden and would be winner of the Oscar. He performed every scene like a true composer how good he was. When you watch the movie you don't think it is Tom Hanks up there, you think it is Forrest Gump and that is why Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever."

","Thirty years of American history seen through the eyes of a simpleton man named Forrest Gump. Watch a little boy with leg braces evolve into a man of many different talents which finds himself at a number of historic moments and yet has no clue what he is doing or why... It's a ""must see"" movie that manages to make you laugh even in the most horrible moments. Even though I had my doubts, Tom Hanks performance is surprisingly touching and funny and the chemistry with Robin Wright, playing his true love, is obvious. To top it all the soundtrack of this movie is one of the best I've ever heard if you're a rock'n roll fan (Elvis Presley, Beach Boys, Aretha Franklin...). Definitely one of my Top 10 favorite movies!"

","Amazing movie. Story is magnificent. I watched it several years ago when I was 13 or something and was very touched by it. It actually helped me change something in my life today, I am trying not to over-think everything. The film is about a man who is not smart, actually he has a mental disorder (his intelligence is 50 or sth), but he succeeded in everything he started doing because he chose a path instead of thinking about it, as we all mostly do. In addition he was also a very good person. Mistake of most people is that we all think about pros and cons of doing something. We always ask ourselves that question 'What if I fail?' and that prevents us from success. I think that 99% of people worldwide already watched this film, but if you haven't then leave anything you are doing right now and watch it, you definitely won't be sorry."

"jackcox1996","10","3","5","12 November 2012"," A wonderful piece of acting
","I do not mean to sound like a 'fanboy', but this film was simply amazing. It is one of the rare films in the modern age to teach the audience a lesson, a moral even - pure good deeds, and a kind heart are always welcomed within society.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks played Forrest extremely well. Even in the first scene where we see him sitting on a bench, without dialogue we can tell that this character is mentally challenged. He barely even uses body language. Hanks plays Forest extremely well through all the different stages off his later life. Forest is just a nice character, not wanting to hurt anyone or anything. A real heart-warming character.<br/><br/>This film has been beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis. I am a fan of Zemeckis, he has directed other favourite films of mine such as the Back to the Future trilogy, Cast Away and The Polar Express, but this is his best work yet. The way he makes the audience feel the characters is very well done. Whilst watching this, I felt so many different feelings such as guilt, sadness and joy - which is what this film is all about. His work on Forrest Gump has been recognised, as he won Best Director at the Academy Awards, as well as five others. <br/><br/>Whilst watching this film, I and I'm pretty sure everyone else who has seen it, felt the feelings of Forrest. From his school days getting bullied and his beloved Bubba dying in Vietnam, to receiving a Medal of Honour and becoming a millionaire. I cannot emphasise enough, that Tom Hanks played this role to perfection.<br/><br/>I love the way the film is told through Forrest. He tells people at a bus stop the story of his life, and the people listening in really represent the audience, as they get drawn into the story and simply do not want it to end. I also like the way in which Zemeckis has included the white feather at the beginning and end of the film.<br/><br/>As a whole, this film is brilliant, and I recommend it to absolutely anyone. It is so inspiring, and everyone can be like Forrest."
"johnmccahill","10","3","5","9 November 2012"," A Truly Riveting Movie
","Forrest Gump was absolutely incredible. There are many reasons for this; the movie was acted elegantly being one of them. Also, the story line was rivetingly moving. Lastly, there are many quotes from the film that simply unforgettable. Those are the reasons why Forrest Gump is so incredible.<br/><br/>First of all, Forrest Gump is such an amazing film because the acting made this movie so memorable for everyone who would watch it. Even though Tom Hanks has had many other amazing performances such as Woody from Toy Story, his role as Forrest is by far the most memorable in my opinion. Furthermore, Robin Wright does an incredible job as Jenny, who is Forrest's true love in the movie. The combination of these to stars was instantly recognized by many as a recipe for a film that would warm the hearts of many for decades to come. That is why the acting in Forrest Gump helps to make this motion picture so amazing.<br/><br/>Secondly, a reason that I feel makes this movie so incredible is that I have never seen a movie that has had a story line that is so moving. There are so many events that happen in this movie that make me want to cry because they make you feel so good inside that these things have happened. For instance, When Forrest meets up with Jenny fret not seeing her for a few years and meets his son was incredible. He asks Jenny as his son gets on the bus, ""Is he smart?"" Jenny responds with, ""He's the smartest in his class."" This scene is without a doubt the most moving scene that I have ever seen in a movie, ever. That is why I feel that the story line of this movie is more riveting, heart-warming, and moving than any other movie out there.<br/><br/>However, there are a couple elements in this movie that some people would view negatively about this masterfully created movie. Some events are completely preposterous, but they help make the movie's plot tremendously, and they make you appreciate reality more. For instance, there is no way that any human would be able to run across the country three times in a row only stopping to eat and use the restroom. However, this event makes the movie interesting and only makes you realize how far someone can go to overcome adversity.<br/><br/>Finally, the last reason that I have that contribute to the masterpiece that is Forrest Gump is that some of the quotes that were made throughout the film are very memorable. One quote made by Forrest makes you really think about life; ""My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'"" This is possible the greatest movie quote of all time. Another quote, which was made by Mrs. Gump; ""You have to do the best with what God gave you."" This quote makes you realize that there are always going to be struggles in life, but you have to make the best out of everything that God puts upon you. That is how the quotes from Forrest Gump help make this movie one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I challenge you, the reader, to watch the masterpiece Forrest Gump and look out for the choir group, ""The Hallelujah Singers."" This is a group led by Marleena Smalls of Beaufort, who played Bubba's mother in the movie. Also, watch for more memorable quotes, amazing performances by actors, and events that will move you an make you feel warm inside. Forrest Gump is truly one of the greatest films of all time, and it is both a memorable movies ever; this is because of all of the reasons that have been stated above."
"Walter_c","10","3","5","29 July 2012"," outta words
","It's kinda extremely difficult for me to overestimate such a masterpiece because of its glutted images and metaphors through every single moment. Every detail, every action means something in this films, there is no scenes just for eyes watching with brain relaxing. And sooth to say I'm very tired with hearing reviews about ""the film about a down"". A retard (in accordance with the medical sense)? I agree. But human after all, much more humane than anybody else because of the absence of evil within. This is the toughest issue - only a retard (or mentally challenged) person can be truly humane in the modern world? ""Forrest Gump"" is not a manual for ones who want to become a millionaire or a great player or get lucky. This film is about life with many things it contains - from life values to a country history. Furthermore, they all are shown in a different light. So, Forrest Gump is a simple guy without mastermind at all, but squeaky clean and morally healthy man at the same time. He believes in things another people forgot, he has pure heart, being naive, but honest, frank, unmercenary and true friend. He is guileless, though he seems to be an idiot in the eyes of others. Despite of it Gump does make a difference between good and bad things, truly good and bad ones. And I discern this movie as a parable about human being, human life. ""Stupid"" Gump couldn't understand what was the life: ""...if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze...maybe it's both."" But who can say the absolute truth about what is life being? The eternal mystery.<br/><br/>P.S. Another point of the film is about parenting (remember ""momma always said"") and how it affects the life time. So Keep an eye on your children, try to be wisdom as possible as you can."

","When Forrest Gump was released in 1994 it was more of an event than a movie release. This is a brilliant movie...it is full of wisdom and simple truths. Recently, some of the top physicists in the world have seriously questioned if intelligence is a good thing. The only things on earth that like intelligence are home sapiens...and they invented it. The dinosaurs were not intelligent, yet ruled the world for 150 million years. Modern man has ruled the world for only a little over 200,000 years, and with all his ""intellegence"" has made a very bad job of looking after the planet. Homo sapiens probably have very little time left here on earth. When we meet Forrest Gump (brilliantly played by Tom Hanks) he is a young boy. He has an I.Q. of 75. When he is a man he functions like a man with an I.Q. of about 85---88. His simplicity gives him implicit honesty and a foundation of pure goodness. Things always appear to go right for Gump and after a stint in the Vietnam war, he becomes a very rich man. Religion, mysticism and and the political process are three of many things that Forrest cant understand. But he is a banner holder for that dying human behaviour.....common decency. There are other fundamentally simple messages in this great movie. As a piece of entertainment it is magnificent. As a lesson to us all on how we should live...it is spiritual. Much deeper than most people realize...this is a contemporary classic."

Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam and meets one of the greatest friends on Earth named Bubba, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Hippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Also, never to forget his one true love Jenny. It is a romantic comedy for all ages to enjoy and learn about events in our past and many more things.

I avoided watching this movie again because because we've all seen it ""a million"" times, but I recently watched this movie with a more critical eye. I can now say with confidence that ""Forest Gump"" is not only a heart warming tale, but an inspiring and re-watchable film. I absolutely fell in love with Forest's perception of the world. I found my self trying to diagnose him with autism or Asperger syndrome, then realizing that he simply loves every human being. Also I realized that being intelligent isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things. If having a high I.Q. is what makes a man someone to look up to, then, the quote, unquote in quotes ""Brilliant"" Bobby Fisher would be a pillar of society. <br/><br/>Forest Gump makes one realize what is really important in humanity. Re- watching this film changed my outlook on life."
"max-swindlehurst","10","3","5","14 May 2012"," Probably my favorite film of all time.
","This film stands in a class of its own. Right from the start when we see a single white feather drifting around on the breeze until the end of the film you feel as though you are being carried along on an adventure that breathes life back into living. Tom Hanks is simply outstanding as Forest Gump and quite honestly I cannot imagine any other actor in the role of Forest Gump, Tom Hanks has made the role completely his own. Sometimes when I see Tom Hanks in other film roles I imagine him still playing Forest Gump. Forest Gump isn't extraordinary in any way, but the things he experiences are beyond the normal man. You do have to pinch yourself though at times. Is this really happening to Forest Gump or some figment of his fertile imagination. One man mocks Forest Gump for telling tall stories, while another woman present at the same time realizes that what he has been telling them is in fact true, but maybe with some embellishment thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Forest Gump does it all: plays American football, can run like the wind, has been to the White House to meet multiple American Presidents, gone to war, represented his country at ping-pong, saved peoples lives, befriends somebody who is crippled, run a shrimp fishing business, run across the United Statesand loved a girl. Some people may think that Forest Gump is stupid, but it is a fact that you will find yourself charmed completely by this simple but honest man. You will take him to your heart and see things like he does, in an uncluttered way. And, without doubt you will have a tear or two in your eyes by the end of Forest Gump."

","There is too much to be said about these masterpiece. It's very deep, sad and funny, it's pure life with many aspects and problems described very deeply and using beautiful and artistically perfect scenes(i.e. the questions of family abuse and racism (violence) in the world - in the scene at Black Panther party, when they talk about stopping any violence in the country, and their chief beats up Jenny at the same time). I cannot even count all powerful scenes of the movie(it MUST be watched several times to get all of them(for me at least:). But together with numerous genius scenes, it's really amazing how the simple truths in life are touching me in this movie. Like when Forrest admires the beauty of nature, saves his friends, happy about meeting old friend, full of emotions meeting his son, cries when loosing his closest people - there is nothing new about such scenes. But I believe and share his emotions, because he is true and honest."

","I find it very difficult to understand why people who call themselves film lovers can hate this film, while people are entitled to their opinion I truly believe some people find it hard not to over analyse films; my own sister is one of the haters!! This film is all that is innocent and morally good in everybody, not just Americans. Forrest Gump is not stupid he simply sees the good and the truth in all things, he goes out of his way to do the right thing no matter what the circumstance. This film is beautiful in every aspect, the casting is superb and the narrative itself is breathtaking and unbelievably moving. I love every aspect of this film and I do wish that people who do not like it sit down open their eyes and simply see the beauty within this film and if you still don't like it watch it again because I guarantee you will have missed something."

"ElMaruecan82","10","3","5","1 October 2011"," Simply one of the Greatest American Films ...
","""Forrest Gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.<br/><br/>Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""Forrest Gump"". There are no villains in ""Forrest Gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.<br/><br/>The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.<br/><br/>And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget ""My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump""? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.<br/><br/>And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""Run, Forrest Run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.<br/><br/>That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix  ""Forrest Gump"" is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.<br/><br/>And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""Forrest Gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.<br/><br/>This is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""Forrest Gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only ""felt like running"". Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is"". On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!"
"LloydBayer","10","3","5","17 June 2011"," As long as no one considers a sequel, Forrest Gump will remain a classic.
","When I saw Forrest Gump, Rocky suddenly became a close second on my list of favorite movies. Although both these movies are totally different in genre, budget, plot and even levels of acting, their common ground in my opinion is they are both underdog stories. But why Forrest Gump is my favorite movie of all time is way beyond its underdog factor. It is the nature of the film, with an overwhelming message of innocence of heart and purity of soul that I still find an unfathomable experience every time I watch this movie. I have watched it many, many times, and each time I am deeply moved by its simple yet profound inner meaning.<br/><br/>As Alan Silvestri's soul stirring original score plays through the opening credits, a single white feather twists, turns and drifts through the air, ultimately landing near the protagonist's dirty running shoes. Waiting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump picks up the feather and places it in a bedtime story book he's had since a kid. As another patron sits besides him waiting for a bus, Forrest narrates his epic yet unbelievable story. And what a story it is! In flash backs it narrates how as a child he was an outcast in society only because his IQ is below average and acceptable levels. But as Forrest continues his story, the one person who believes he is no different from anyone else is his mother, and through her can-do attitude, how he got to be where he is: A decorated Vietnam War hero commended by the US President, an international sports icon commended by another US President, how he influenced pop culture, and how he got to be recognized by Fortune magazine as a multi-millionaire.<br/><br/>The very few cynical critics who also enjoyed this movie, feel Gump's fortune from impossible twists of fate are implausible coincidences any real person may never encounter however lucky that person may be, more so with below average intelligence. Maybe so. But let's not forget, Albert Einstein had to re-sit his college entrance examination before he started theorizing rocket science. Coming back to Gump, you have to see him to believe that honesty and loyalty are virtues very few people possess, but for the ones that do, achieving greatness will seem like miracles from heaven.<br/><br/>And now for the people who made it all happen. Collecting his second Oscar for best actor in two consecutive years (first Oscar as Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia, 1993), Tom Hanks as Gump is absolutely outstanding and redefines the way you pronounce the word 'chocolate'. Easily the most memorable role of his career thus far, Hanks will make you laugh, cry, and fall off your seat doing both. To this day, John Travolta regrets having turned down the role, and for good reason, as I can't think of anyone else who could have done it the way Hanks did. Playing Gump's only friend, mentor and commanding officer having lost both legs in Vietnam is Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan in his first and only Oscar nominated supporting role. Another exceptional feat here, and together with Hanks, forms some of the best parts in the movie. Hanks and Sinise would appear again just a year later in the dual Oscar winning Apollo 13. Playing the women influencing Gump's life is Sally Field as his ""mama"" and Robin Wright as his one true love, building on a life long relationship since childhood. Both Field and Wright's characters are played flawlessly in a way where Gump's method of reasoning comes from his mother while the inspiration behind his adventures comes from Wright's character as Jenny. Also worth mentioning is Michael Conner Humphreys as young Forrest, who reportedly influenced Hanks' southern Alabama accent and the introduction of Haley Joel Osment as Gump's adorable son. Yes, the same kid who sees dead people in Sixth Sense.<br/><br/>Finally, kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for this brilliant achievement in contemporary film making. Adapted for the screen by Eric Roth (another Oscar) from Winston Groom's novel of the same name, Forrest Gump is to Zemeckis what the Mona Lisa is to Leonardo DA Vinci. Besides the six Oscars generated including ""Best Director"" and ""Best Picture"", the true mettle of his work lies in integrating the various components of this film into one history altering, ground breaking, block-buster. What we have here is one movie with multiple genres of war, comedy, romance, drama and tragedy all rolled into one unforgettable classic. With friends like Steven Spielberg and Josh Lucas, visual effects and CGI are incredible to say the least. And to think this film was made more than a decade before Celine Dion's duet with Elvis Presley. If I explain that last line, I'll be letting out some of the best treats of the film. The only way Zemeckis can undo himself now is if he makes a sequel.<br/><br/>For those who think Forrest Gump is too much of a dim-wit to make it in this real and fierce world, then these are the people to watch out for, because they are predators who can screw you over without so much as batting an eye lid. And for those who think Forrest is a character in a modern fairy tale, then stop for a second and reflect on what a fairy tale really is. It may be nothing but a fable, but it is always a fictitious story with a moral message. Whether this fable has a happy ending doesn't really matter, as long as the moral of the story is understood loud and clear. And so I can go on and on as to why you should watch this movie, or buy it and frame it and buy another copy just to watch it every other month; but I can never emphasize enough that each time you watch this movie, it will be like reading a chapter from Chicken Soup for the Soul."

","""Mama says 'stupid is as stupid does'"". That was a quote from one of the best movies of all time. ""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man from Alabama with a low I.Q., whose personality is different from others, but ends up achieving many goals including football, Vietnam, shrimping, table tennis, etc. The story has words spoken by the beautiful writing of Eric Roth, and it was magically directed by Robert Zemeckis. The amazing visual effects were added to plant Tom Hanks in historical landmarks, which makes that kind of movie, a magical movie. The film had a brilliant cast involving Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field, and the incredible Tom Hanks as the witted Forrest, himself. The movie was an incredible look of being different while being special, and never knowing what to do in life cause it just happens to you without knowing. That's why I respect this excellent film. This is one of my all-time favorite movies for a reason. It had a terrific cast, it had heart, it meant something, it was entertaining, and it was also quite incredible. A movie like this deserves to be recognized as a excellent movie. Next to ""Titanic"", ""Forrest Gump"" is my second favorite movie of all time. I enjoyed the hell out of everything, and my heart always feels special every time I watched. This is an amazing motion picture, no doubt about it. It's just a shame that nobody can respect the movie's Best Picture Oscar win objectively. Like my Mama always says, ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get"". You know what, Mama was right about that! ""Forrest Gump"", in my review, ""A fantastic journey seen through the human eye""."

"rezvan-bayati","10","3","5","8 January 2011"," Forrest Gump is not solely the story of a person but story of a nation throughout its history .
","America as the country which is always on the ""move"", the land of freedom, growth; these are the core ideas for many Hollywood movies. The movie Forrest Gump can be considered as one of these movies.it has got some elements of American identity. The story of a man who is intellectually and mentally under grown and underdeveloped but he appears to be appropriate and rightful in the works in his world. He becomes an icon and hits the press all over the country. His dreams turn to reality and this shows that your imaginings will come true if you try hard enough and at the same time if you are well equipped to freshness and honesty. Surprisingly, he visits three presidents, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He receives honors and makes accomplishments in table tennis, shrimp industry, Vietnam War. A ""simple"" man from Alabama who travels around the world ""runs"" across America and meets political, cultural figures like Mao and John Lenon as well. The amazing point that makes the main character of the film, Forrest Gump, lovable and believable is that he keeps his childhood innocence into maturity probably because he is not very smart; his IQ is 75 below the normal point which is 80. On the other hand he remains as a child in mind and soul even though he is physically grown. This can be drawn in the picture which he shows his wounded buttock to the President Johnson in the White House while he is receiving his Medal of Honor. This is the indication for his simplicity. He firmly believes in three things God, his mother and his lifelong love, Jenny, which remembers her all the time. Although the movie keeps eye on Gump's life career but mainly it is depicting different periods of American history. For example, it shows scenes from racial discrimination, Vietnam War, Kennedy Assassination, Watergate scandal and so on. In some cases it's hard to distinguish clearly what the genre the movie is, whether it is drama, romance or a satire. It can be argued that the director skillfully amalgamated comedy, drama and documentary into each other. Technically speaking, the movie is a flashback and a narrative mode in which the movie starts from showing the viewers that Gump is sitting on a bench waiting for a bus. At the same time, he tells the story of his life to different people waiting for the shuttle bus. His story is the tale of the nation and the country and even generally the world as well. Visually impressive, the makers could successfully have put Gump in scenes with the US presidents. Even they could have made it possible to hear from Kennedy in Footballers' visit at the White House. Due to this technicality and specialty it won the Academy Award for the Best Visual Effects in 1994. The movie is ranked as the 71st of the best motion picture of the all time by (AFI) American Film Institute. Gump's capability to be in the right place at the right time makes him exceptional, too. He saves the lives of the American troops in Vietnam War while he was looking for his intimate friend Buba. Once He ran like a wind into the football field and he made part of his life career as a footballer star by being too fast in the matches. He is the one who calls the police and apprises them the weird condition in the hotel which was the lead to disclose the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Nixon. His simplicity and honesty is playing a key role in all these situations. Despite being not ""normal"" as the doctor and headmaster tell to Gump' mother in the beginning but he makes a very successful life career which makes him well known and much more generous and giving .The lessons that Gump are given by his mother are very simple but very helpful. One of them is faith and believes in destiny. To do your best but at the same time to keep your faith and be faithful on what destiny brings about to you, to accept it and ""live"" with your ""life"". The main message of the movie can be ""when there is a will, there is a way."" And as the British people put forward ""Honesty is the best policy."" These two are as the secret to happiness which Gump finds it in his life. Other than that his life is inspiring for many such as Lt. Dan Taylor and even Jenny who accuses Gump that ""you don't know what love is"" but finally backs and returns to the ""kind but slow-witted"" man to make her own life much more ""meaningful"" and cheerful. She even gave birth to a child and named him ""Forrest Gump""; a new generation but with the old and respected values and beliefs. Forrest Gump's tale and world is ours, too; with too many ebbs and flows; with sorrows and joys; with defeats and victories. But the tool and rule to overcome the difficulties is simple; to be honest and hopeful. He is exceptional mentally but not morally. His morals help him to make the ""Forrest Gump"" an icon in the movie and in the real world as well."
"dudesweethej","10","3","5","5 October 2010"," A brilliant and well-made picture
","***Spoiler Alert*** Forrest Gump is one of the most impactive, respected and popular films of the 90's. Widely considered one of the best films o all time, and while this is very subjective, the depth of this film in itself should be enough to at least make people accept its brilliance. In case you don't know, Forrest Gump is in fact a symbol of America. The story follows the main character, who, while not being the sharpest nor most intelligent main character alive, still manages to somehow just do the right things, attain success, and always make the best of others... Don't get too excited now though, cause while we have the naive, well-meaning Forrest, for whom life isn't too serious, we've also get Jenny, who ends up as the opposite. A symbol of everything rotten within America. Don't get it wrong, she's not an antagonist, actually it's just the sad irony, that Forrest, who attains everything by luck and good intentions, Jenny, who has all the ordinary traits and possibilities which Forrest do not have, simply picks all the wrong choices. So much for the American Dream... While these two characters respectively journeys through the best and worst periods of the country, there's always a somewhat romantic relationship between the two, which of course has to result in a child. Forrest Gump deserves just as much attention as it got. Everything form acting to directing to filming is perfect, and while one could keep up the endless discussion bout which of it and Pulp Fiction deserved the Best Film Award, the outcome shouldn't bother too many... Incredibly intelligent and exciting film..."

Seriously, there are only like three movies that have made me cry and I mean real crying. This film has a soul and you can easily fall in love with the characters.

","Tom Hanks stars in his Oscar winning role in the best picture winning instant classic, Forrest Gump. When making Forrest Gump, it seems like director Robert Zemeckis' only goal is for this film to be a classic. And it truly is.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is the story of a guy named Forrest(obviously played brilliantly by Tom Hanks), a guy who has an I.Q. of 75. Forrest, throughout the entire film, is telling his life story. And his experiences. From his love for Jenny(played by Robin Wright Penn), who eventually becomes a hippie slut, to his days in the war, from his encounter with Elvis, and it goes on.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks' performance is so delightfully sweet. and so is the movie. Forrest Gump is delightfully funny, blissfully sad, and downright sweet and a ton of fun. My momma doesn't like this movie. I don't know why. I may never understand it.<br/><br/>When I think about it, I don't think it deserved best movie of the year over Pulp fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. But sometimes I do think that it did. Forrest is such a lovable character. And he has such an exiting life.<br/><br/>The ending is sad, the film is a little sentimental, but it's not a problem, the acting is terrific. Especially from Tom Hanks and Gary Senise as the lovable Lieutenant Dan. Forrest Gump is a delightful film. One of the best pictures of 94.

No matter where he was he was always thinking about the ones who loved, even for someone he knew for a little while, he always saw the good parts of people. In the end we learn that he is not the ill or the problematic one but that everyone around him were that. He was always enjoying the little things, a thing that we all don't do very often. The thing that touched me a lot and thought that was just amazing about Forrest is that he helped everybody in a way even that he didn't knew.

","The concept of the movie at the first instant might seem a bit absurd because you might seem to wonder how a man can be intelligent and act stupid at the same time. But this is exactly what Tom Hanks manages to do and do it perfectly.<br/><br/>This is a story of a man whose IQ is lower than that of a normal person but still manages to do everything in life on his own and manages to find love in his life through Jenny. Every moment in the film emotionally touches you especially the sequences between Jenny and Forrest. The dialogs are really gripping and makes you take notice of the hard-work put into writing those lines.<br/><br/>Special mention has to go to the writing department. Not easy to create a character to which audiences can relate. A very subtle story, beautifully crafted and perfectly executed. Director Robert Zemeckis has put up a commendable effort for giving us his most-prized possession of his career.<br/><br/>But the film stands firmly on its feet mainly due to Tom Hanks. The actor deserves his second successive Oscar after Philadelphia. He manages to bring out one of the best performances of his career, ably supported by Gary Sinise, a deserving Oscar nomination. The sequences between them are hilarious to watch and they share a great on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>The movie in itself is a revolution. Such movies are hard to come by. Do yourself a favor and waste no time in catching this movie. Just like in the movie all used to tell Gump ""Run, Forrest, Run."", I say to you, ""Run, Viewers, Run."""

Folks do watch this movie, don't miss it for anything.My rating is 10/10 for this. The best."
"saikrishna89","10","3","5","13 November 2009"," best ever movie made!!
","this in my opinion is the best movie ever to be made in Hollywood. the story of a guy with a below normal IQ and the wonderful things happened to him over his course of life moves you, inspires you, makes you cry makes you wanna laugh out loud it feels so real!!! i can watch it over and over again hundreds of times and still not get bored !! the story is so simple and the way it is narrated is wonderful i got tears in my eyes in the scene when jenny tells Forrest about his son and he wouldn't understand it!!! this film is one of those which tells you the value of simplicity and the successes that can be achieved by it!! life is like a box of chocolates u never know what ur gonna get . this is one film which gives you a different warm feeling in your heart each time you watch it<br/><br/>an absolute must watch!!!"

","i have only to say that when i saw this movie i became an instant fan of tom hanks and Hollywood . many people say how shawshank didn't get a Oscar because of this movie i say after tom hanks performance , i saw only one more performance compatible than this and that is of Daniel day lewis 'there will be blood'.<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing..."

","Inspiring work by Zemicks<br/><br/>Forest Gump is a masterpiece. Obviously Robert zemciks and Tom hanks make a Brilliant Duo. Tom hanks has given many blockbusters to Hollywoodbut Forrest Gump must be his Best Movie ever. This movie keeps my eyes wet all the 142 minutes no matter how many times I watch it. I can say that it is because of sheer emotions which this movie seems to be pulling out..<br/><br/>The movie is all about a semi retarded kind of Boy with a low IQ at his best innocence level. Gump never grows up or matures in the movie. He never becomes a man and remains a boy throughout the movie. This movie focuses around lot of different aspects of life mainly showing that life isn't that bad but it's only us who think down the wrong way. This movie shows us that we should appreciate all the little things we get and not let the big sorrows and pain hold us back. Lot of VfX work is done in the movie showing Gump rubs elbows with many famous personalities over the last half of the century including Elvis Presley and Nixon, General Dan doesn't really lose his legs either---they are just erased and the background is then touched up by using computer graphics programs.<br/><br/>Tom is too good in the movie along with all the supporting actors who have done a very good job. Zemicks sure knows how to get his job done. Jenny seems to be the girl gump loves the most but she been shown a selfish and out-tracked character, while his mother has been a encouraging and inspiring one creating contrast. The traditional male heroes that we have had are all dysfunctional in some respect or another and we are lost without heroes but here Gump is a new kind of a role- model; he's A Nice Boy and everyone knows they're hard to find. There are many sequences in the movie which are work of pure fiction but still seem to be amazing like Gump turns out to a millionaire, becomes a national Runner as well as Heritage.<br/><br/>The only thing I can tell u is watch this movie over and over cause art works don't repeat themselves much over a century or two. If u don't have anything else then watch this movie a 100 times. Kudos to Hanks and Zemicks."
"zardoz-13","10","3","5","1 November 2009"," A Brilliant Comedy of Epic Proportions
","""Back to the Future"" trilogy director Robert Zemeckis surpassed himself in ways that he probably never imagined when he made ""Forrest Gump."" Clocking in at two hours and forty minutes, this PG-13 rated comedy about the epic misadventures of a slow-witted dolt from rural Alabama with a below-average I.Q. who lives through several milestone events in the 1960s received the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994. Not only did Zemeckis earn a Best Director Oscar, but also Tom Hanks' took home the Academy statuette for Best Actor with his insightful, down-to-earth thesping. Forrest Gump is not the brightest bulb in the grid, but Hanks conveys this quality without ever stooping to histrionics. Above all, Hanks delivers a performance that has innocence and dignity intertwined. Moreover, ""Forrest Gump"" qualifies as Hanks' best film.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" unfolds in Savannah, Georgia, as the eponymous character narrates the story of his life in a number of flashbacks. Indeed, two-thirds of the action takes place with Forrest on the bench relating his exploits to other people waiting for their bus. The first time that we see young Forrest, he has just been fitted with a pair of leg braces at the doctor's office while his mother (Sally Fields of ""Norma Ray"") watches. She is determined to see to it that father-less Forrest gets to live as normal a life as possible. The school principal (Sam Anderson of ""La Bamba"") fails to convince her that Forrest's low I.Q. of 75 means that he should not attend regular school classes. Despite Forrest's intellectual's shortcomings, Mrs. Gump persuades the principal to permit Forrest to enroll in normal classes by having loud, noisy sex with him. The next time that we see young Forrest (newcomer Michael Humphreys) he hesitates about climbing aboard the school bus because he doesn't know the bus driver and has been warned by his mother not to accept rides from strangers. The driver and Forrest introduce themselves to each other and he steps aboard because they are now no longer strangers. Forrest meets his first best friend Jenny Curran when she is the only student riding the bus who will let him sit beside her. Later, Forrest meets his second best friend on his way to military boot camp when Bubba makes room for him to sit beside him after others have turned him away.<br/><br/>Jenny and Forrest cultivate their friendship to the point that other students decide to attack Forrest. Initially, these obnoxious kids throw rocks at Forrest while he is walking home with Jenny. ""Run, Forrest, run,"" screams Jenny to our hero as the kids hurl more rocks and pursue him on their bicycles. Forrest takes off running and his braces disintegrate and he breaks into a loping stride that the kids on their bikes cannot match. The first chronological transition from young Forrest to Tom Hanks as Forrest occurs when the same kids—only older—attack Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright of ""The Princess Bride"") and try to run him down in their pick-up truck. Again, Forrest outruns them and scrambles through a practice scrimmage that Alabama football coach Bear Bryant (Sonny Shroyer of ""Gator"") is holding. Forrest winds up in college, joins the football and scores touchdowns for the Alabama Crimson Tide. During his stay at Alabama, Forrest is exposed to the famous stance in the doorway by real-life Alabama governor George Wallace when the University of Alabama was integrated by African-American students. As one of the black students is entering the school, she drops a book and Forrest retrieves it on camera. Later, Forrest visits the White House, drinks 15 Dr. Pepper sodas, and gets to shake hands with the real President John F. Kennedy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jenny has grown up, left her abusive father to live with another person, and ends up in an all-girls' school. Forrest shows up and beats up Jenny's date because he thinks that the guy is getting rough with her. Jenny gives Forrest his first sexual experience. She cups his hand over her breast and he blows a gasket while Jenny's roommate—apparently asleep—listens in horror as Forrest admits that he has messed up the roommate's bathrobe. Jenny informs Forrest that she wants to become a folk singer like her idol Joan Baez. Forrest joins the U.S. Army and takes a furlough to Memphis, Tennessee, to see Jenny perform folk songs on stage. Forrest knows that Jenny got expelled from her college for posing nude in a 'Girls of the South' issue of Playboy magazine, but he isn't prepared for what he sees when she performs in the nude singing a Bob Dylan song. When a spectator heckles Jenny, Forrest comes to her rescue.<br/><br/>Significantly, the film pioneered some revolutionary techniques, such as inserting a live actor into historic archival footage of important events as well as enabling Oscar nominated actor Gary Sinise to appear convincing as a handicapped Vietnam veteran who has lost both legs in combat. If the structure of ""Forrest Gump"" is reminiscent of David Fincher's recent opus ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" this is no surprise because Eric Roth penned scripts for both ""Forrest Gump"" as well as ""Benjamin Button."" Roth got an Oscar for his adaptation of Winston Groom's novel. Not surprisingly, ""Forrest Gump"" was awarded Oscars for best visual effects. Interestingly, Paramount Pictures produced this film for $55-million dollars and coined over $600 million dollars from it domestically as well as internationally."

","One of the most inspiring movies I ever seen ! Forrest not only show us that ingenuity is a gift (I want mine back!) but decision is crucial in life, maybe his retarded condition private him from hesitation on important decisions, such a big advantage over the rest of regular ""intelligent"" people. While the film exaggerates a bit, Forrest with his initiative undertake and reach more goals and lives more intensively his life than the rest of average ""smarter"" men. By not having a life's vision, Forrest confront every challenge one for one doing his life an exciting playground, achieving more, doing more and helping others more, meanwhile most of us ""the normals"" are typecast in our boring routine. Who is smarter ?"
"johnmschofield","10","3","5","1 October 2009"," This film is a simple tale of goodness and keeping in the light
","I have only seen this film once but once was enough for me. This film is a simple tale of goodness and light and how somebody can shine that light on those less fortunate. Religion is not involved here at least not in the conventional sense. The light is the sheer goodness of a person who clearly cannot do or say anything to offend anybody no matter how hard some people disrespect or try to offend them. In the case of the man in the title role this is not an attitude that he adopts to win favour or even artificial posturing in order to be popular, it is who he is. There are people out there who will feed on the mans positivity or goodness and hope by association to be renewed or to have some beneficial effect rub off on them. And so Forrest goes through life as if the world holds no surprises or perhaps everything is a surprise, so when they come along he just adapts without any fuss and just moves on. People like Forrest are rare indeed and the film which charts his life is uncomplicated and just lays it out for all to see. The entire cast and crew are to be congratulated on a very good job as the film in the wrong hands could have been a disaster. I would highly recommend anybody watch this film at least once, because for me it has a very simple message and is also very entertaining."

","Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time. It tells of a mentally disabled man who has lived through so much history and who did not let his disability hold him back from living an ordinary life. In fact, Forrest lived an extraordinary life that most people do not get to experience. His innocence has made this story humorous and heartwarming. It is very difficult to not fall in love with the character Tom Hanks has created. Hanks has done a remarkable job with portraying Forrest Gump making you laugh while your crying. I have watched Forrest Gump a million times and I can watch it a million more times. I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie."

If you are a real movie lover then Forrest Gump is the movie that you'll never regret watching. It's one of those movies which brings a smile on your face even when you are feeling low and lost hope. The best part is when he is standing on Jenny's grave and Forrest speaks his lines.

This book is not as good as movie and I admire someone (Zemeckis? or somebody) who read it, removed sub-plots almost like from cartoon (spaceship, living in the jungle etc.), changed few things (meeting with Bubba, Dan), added (cross-country running, hint about Apple etc.) and made such a cool script. <br/><br/>Finding book which is decent and changing it to Oscar-winning movie is something what I like. In opposite to few movies (i.e godfather?) when book is genius and it's just remade to movie (2 chapters removed is not much of work)."

Bubba and Forrest were going to have a shrimp boat after the war but since Bubba didn't make it after the war Forrest took over the shrimp business. He made a restaurant called Bubba Gump's shrimp company. But one day Forrest's Mom passed away. So he put all the money he made from the restaurant into a funeral.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to ages 13 and over because there are some very disturbing scenes.

","Saw this in the IMDb 250, and couldn't believe it was ranked this high. Quite frankly, very sappy film about a mentally challenged individual and how he influences key events through his life. I liked it when it first came out, but every time I see it on TV, I realize that this is a terrible movie. Essentially, it's a baby-boomer's movie reminiscing about the events of times past. And the more I see it, it reminds me of an earlier, even craftier movie with a simple-minded character which was far more intelligent than this film will ever be...""Being There"" with Peter Sellers. Essentially the same story, but Sellers pulls of the role more convincingly and the story unfolds much better. Forget this film--""Being There"" is the film to watch."

"Benjy","1","13","37","4 August 1998"," A triumph of hype over content
","Surely Forrest Gump must rate as one of the biggest dupes of all time. Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Tom Hanks plays the intellectually challenged Gump and picked up his second consecutive Oscar for his over the top portrayal. A spectacular job considering the Academy do not normally fall for the same ploys as the movie going public. Even more spectacular when you consider that Morgan Freeman was nominated for The Shawshank Redemption. Gump was the Best Film winner as well, even though Pulp Fiction AND The Shawshank Redemption were nominated. I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years or Dazed and Confused, nice but nothing special. It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother, beyond that there is not much to redeem Gump, the effects are very nicely added if nothing new and the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers. For the most part it's too mushy, way too sentimental and just not much above mediocre. In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump."

We then see several poor quality green screen sequences in order to demonstrate this fact. Later, the skateboard kids steal Forest's dog and sell it to a nearby factory as a guard dog. Forest then uses his magic bike reflectors to rescue the dog. The film is padded with wildlife stock footage, and no one in it can really act, with the possible exception of the dog."

","People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea.  But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that.  The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.<br/><br/>But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here.  Sinise was excellent as well.  Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.<br/><br/>If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie.

Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.

The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.

"naun","7","4","8","26 March 2001"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","There's something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its foibles. The figure of the Good Soldier Schweik was one I remember being introduced to in my early years at university. Forrest Gump is also a soldier for much of this picture's duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum and fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good.<br/><br/>Maybe it's this evasiveness that caused this film to attract such a storm of criticism from the Left when it first appeared. Seven years on, it's hard to see the film's reluctance to take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. More likely, it's the film's unflattering portrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. For the most part, it's a gentle and appealingly whimsical picture. Australian - and more particularly, Melbourne - viewers will recognize in it something of the spirit of Michael Leunig's cartoons. In keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that could be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes.<br/><br/>
Tom Hanks is excellent. It says something about the rest of the world's stereotypes about American culture that one of America's biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors. There is charm and real emotion in his performance. If the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is not Hanks' fault. <br/><br/>The film isn't a masterpiece. As I say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me that, like Rain Man, it can't acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of one kind or another. And, as I'm sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving Gump's encounters with various historical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by Woody Allen in Zelig. However, for me the film's greatest specific failing is that it doesn't do more with the character of Gump's love, Jenny, who doesn't do much more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. I thought there was scope there to explore the nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. To some extent this does happen with the character of Lieutenant Dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight to Gump.<br/><br/>I don't expect that I will want to see this film again and again, the way I keep going back to Leunig's cartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that Zemeckis' film sometimes visibly strains to achieve. It's not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. But, a little to my surprise, I did enjoy watching it."

When I first saw Gump I thought it was sentimental and cloyingly sweet. After talking to a friend who works with the handicapped my impression changed. Underneath the sugar coating the movie presents the idea that if people with IQs below 90 wanted to they could get into the army (Gump would never have gotten into the army), be war heroes, start successful businesses and become rich. It makes believable the idea that these people need no help from the rest of us. Hanks is cute, beguiling and an altogether 'lovable little retard'.

You won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. In the movie Forrest Gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in Alabama. That is where Forrest starts. Later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. This means that he represents every human being. The time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. This time was important to the U.S. history because it was after the World War II and it was a new start for the people of the United Sates of America. Another example of everybody or universal is the character Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump. I think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. When Forrest Gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of IQ. His IQ was around 70. He lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. They had no money so Forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. On the first day of school, he met Jenny. Forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. Another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for Jenny. He had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump, she is Forrest's mother and cares a great deal about Forrest. After Forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after Forrest becomes popular. She was a very good mother to Forrest. Robin Wright as Jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. In the movie, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dane. He was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. He plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. Bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. Myketti Williamson plays Bubba in the movie and was the best friend of Forrest in the movie. He is the meaning of true friendship. The one thing that is unrealistic is that Forrest Gump cannot meet all the presidents of America and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. It is rather a symbolic meaning. The plot of this movie is very interesting. As time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. One of the themes of this movie is that the main character, Forrest Gump, represents everybody's life. One of the quotes that he said was ""life is like a box of chocolates."" It simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. Sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. The other interesting quote was ""stupid is as stupid does."" This quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. This movie was a really good movie. I would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. It would be a really hard movie to make. I think Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. The plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time. I like that the plot development of this movie was like this. I really recommend this film to everyone."

","Was Forest Gump made with the intention of being a depressing movie? I don't really think so. I think it was made with the intention of being sad at parts, but ultimately a feel good movie that was supposed to be quite funny at parts, entertaining, and even educational...not to mention a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>For me, the movie was all those things, but unfortunately, I found the film, throughout all these jokes and happy moments, to be depressing.

But since then I saw many movies that changed my whole perspective of movie making, and truly many changed my life (in the way I should live and think) - so I grow apart from Forrest. <br/><br/>Before a month or so I was in class and we had a discussion about a man's will's and boundaries. It came to me in a surprise to see on the TV screen an example of the discussed subject - I saw Forst run. Why did he ran? He doesn't know, he's just running - but people found meaning to his acts and ran with him - and he changed their life's. <br/><br/>I felt like crying.

","Forrest Gump is a good-natured simpleton. His below-average IQ has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of American society.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back To The Future) and multiple academy-award winner Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen.<br/><br/>Though he may not be the smartest person in the world, Forrest Gump has achieved some amazing things. Aside from meeting three different American presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, Forrest has also been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his courage during the Vietnam War, run across the country several times over (because he ""just felt like running""), inspired Elvis Presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the Watergate scandal. At the heart of the film is a love-story. Forrest and his life-long companion, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn- Hurlyburly, The Singing Detective), are two completely different people, and Jenny knows that he deserves better, but Forrest loves her anyway. ""I'm not a smart man,"" Forrest declares. ""But I know what love is.""<br/><br/>The acting in this film is nothing short of perfect. Tom Hanks demonstrates how he will win his second Best Actor Oscar with this performance. Nobody else could have possibly portrayed Forrest so perfectly. The supporting cast is strong. Robin Wright Penn is good, and Gary Sinise gives the best performance of his career as Lieutenant Dan Taylor.<br/><br/>""... Life is a box of chocolates,"" Forrest announces at the beginning of the film. ""You never know what you are going to get."" This film is exactly that. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you will laugh, and you will cry. This life's journey is one that you will never forget."

Anyone who really believes that ""Life's like a box of chocolates..."" is too naive to even be reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections were confections and some excrement.

Tom Hanks is an excellent actor (I don't doubt it), but despite that I hate the movie. Not the soundtrack, which is one of the best, being Almost Famous the obvious exception.<br/><br/>Not to offend most of people here (Whose lion' share is from the US), but this movie seems made only for them.

This shocked me a lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.<br/><br/>There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply spectacular.<br/><br/>This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.<br/><br/>It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).<br/><br/>Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out there just like Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and best Movie awards.<br/><br/>This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this."

",", Forrest Gump is the kind of guy that would take off his coat for a stranger if they were cold. The kind of person who forgives over and over and doesn't really want much in return besides friendship. He's not the smartest tool in the shed, but his love and compassion for the ones in his life go beyond what most normal people are capable of. Everyone knows he's basically the nerdy (but witty) underdog, and he is always teased or asked if he's stupid, to which he normally replies ""stupid is as stupid does"". He joins the army after he graduates college and meets his best good friend Bubba on the bus (a black man who is very similar in character to Forrest, and who immediately clicks with him). Bubba tells Forrest about the shrimping business, which has run in his family for at least 2 generations. They make a deal to form a ""shrimping"" team after they return home and split all the money 50-50. <br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>*DO NOT KEEP SCROLLING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE <br/><br/>Not very long after Bubba and Gump make their pact, Bubba gets wounded in battle, as does their Lieutenant, Dan...and a couple other characters. Dan wants Forrest to leave him to get killed in battle (by bombs) because he lost his legs and he wanted to die with honor, but Forrest picked him up despite Dan's orders, and tries to save both him and Bubba, but after Bubba is carried by Forrest (also against Dan's orders), he is gasping for air and dies in Forrest's arms. I think this is one of the most important parts of the movie, because it shows not only how humble Mr. Gump is towards his friends, but his sheer backbone and determination to do the right thing.

","""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" – Forest Gump.<br/><br/>Forest Gump is not just a movie it is art, which bounces around in comedy, romance and drama. The naïve life of an individual who touches lives and influences his nation as a whole. Robert Zemeckis balances this movie in such a way that when you think you are getting swayed in the comic area he moves to romance, the moment you start to smile at blind love, he switches to drama/intrigue which captivates you.<br/><br/>This movie has everything for everybody and its delivery is such that you remember the movie more for the adventures of Gump than his effects on America's history. Many Visual effects were used in the movie to incorporate Gump with historical American footages, like when he met President Kennedy.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The book and the movie do have some similarities and differences, the movie itself is based on the first 11 chapters of the book then skips to the end, some of the other occupations that Gump was involved in were omitted. Some parts that were not in the book were also added like his need for leg braces, also his autistic level in the book is more than what we see in the movie.<br/><br/>The film is about an overly naive autistic man, named Forest Gump (Tom Hanks), whose life between his birth and the time he found out about his son Forest Jr. ran through American history, touching lives and influencing others.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing to me is that Forest Gump was the man responsible for revealing the Water Gate scandal during Nixon's regime (this is bogus mind you).<br/><br/>Winning six out of the thirteen Academy Award nominations, among the six awards, Forest Gump won Best Picture, Best Actor (Tom Hanks) and Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), the movie also won Three Golden Globe awards for Best Drama Picture, Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Director (Zemeckis)<br/><br/>Forest Gump was a financial success, recouping more than 10 times is 55 million production cost, this movie has stood the test of time as a classic that all should have in the shelves.

The fact that the end tells us that Forrest is waiting to catch a bus to meet Jenny, the love of his life, after all these years was great. The scenes where we realize that Jenny has a kid named Forrest Jr. and that he is the father was nicely done. When Jenny died, you can feel the emotion and feel such pity for Forrest as the chemistry between the two was good, the music was very quiet and most importantly, they were characters we felt connected to. <br/><br/>The other two great chemistries were between Lieutenant Dan and Forrest as well as Buba and Forrest. The scene where Bubba dies was extremely sad as I would've loved to see him for longer. <br/><br/>Pretty much a classic film!"

"jackson_danie9","9","2","3","16 June 2011"," Forrest Gump proves that our lives are a combination of destiny and floating through life accidental like a feather in the breeze
","Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man regarded by most in the community as having a below average IQ, who experiences many magnificent things throughout his life. His journey takes him across the globe experiencing many historically significant events along the way. Throughout this journey full of accomplishments Forrest far surpasses the expectations that many of his critics had for him. Although his life, as full of successes as it was there was one thing that eluded him, his true love, Jenny. Jenny, played by Robin Wright, was Forrest's lifelong friend and loved interest in the film. ""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man, who despite the many obstacles' and road blocks in his live rises above these challenges and proves that a man's willpower, persistence, strength, and love are more important than any God given abilities in life. Forrest attends and graduates college on a football scholarship, enlists in the army, serves in Vietnam, meets numerous presidents, successfully runs a shrimp boat business, becomes a husband as well as a father. Throughout his story Forrest teaches us many lasting life lessons.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" demonstrates that doesn't matter if you are different. It doesn't matter if you have a handicap. You can decide how to deal with it. Every human being is worth exactly the same, and even if you are in a position of disadvantage you don't have to be depressed. All that you need is the will to look at the bright side of life. All you need is the feeling for true love, friendship and the determination to make yourself and others happy. At times in our life we will realize that things will happen to us that are out of control, but the most important thing is to remember that they way we react to these things is in our control. Intelligence isn't the most important attribute in life. The truly important values are happiness, friendship, love, courage and freedom. The film Forrest Gump proves that our lives are a combination of destiny and floating through life like a feather in the breeze.<br/><br/>The film ""Forrest Gump"" is very similar to the film ""Benjamin Button."" Both of these movies involve characters, Forrest and Benjamin, who are faced with, and overcome the unique challenges in their lives. Forrest is mentally slower than most average people are, but he proves that determination and perseverance are just as valuable in life, and with the refusal to give up, anything is possible. Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt, encounters his own unique setbacks in his life. He is born with a disorder that makes him age backwards. He's born as a wrinkly baby who is aged as if he were in his 80's. As he gets older his age makes him appear younger. Although this may seem like a big setback for some Benjamin preservers throughout his life and accomplishes many incredible feats just as Forrest did in ""Forrest Gump.""<br/><br/>The special effects in the film ""Forrest Gump"" help demonstrate the theme of the movie. A perfect example of how the special effects support the theme of this movie is that Lt. Dan, who is injured in Vietnam, is portrayed throughout the movie as having no legs. In all actuality the actor playing Lt. Dan does have his legs throughout the film. The use of computer generated imaging helps the audience see Lt. Dan throughout the movie after Vietnam with no legs. Lt. Dan, although very depressed early on after his injury overcomes his new fate and becomes a successful, functioning member of society and even gets fake legs in the end of the movie. It is obvious through Lt. Dan, much like Forrest, that in life it doesn't matter if you are different than everyone else, what matters is what you make of your life. You may be drifting through life in a breeze but with some good decisions and a little destiny everything can work out in the end.<br/><br/>Symbolism is another element that helped contribute to the theme of Forrest Gump. The white feather that is present in both the beginning and end of the film is representative of numerous characters in the movie. Each character is floating through life ""accidental like on a breeze."" Forrest is most representative of this. After briefly learning of his character, it would never be expected of him to accomplish the things he does in his life. It seems that his fate is almost ""accidental like."" Forrest never really planned his life out, things just kept falling into place for him. The symbolism of the feather is also indicative of Jenny's character in the film as well. Jenny drifts through life, most of the time struggling, never trusting herself or anyone else around her. She drifts through phase to phase in her life, but in the end, like destiny, she ends up back with Forrest.<br/><br/>Even though Forrest has some disadvantages in his life, he doesn't let these hold him back. He lives his life like the feather in the wind that is present in both the beginning and the end of the film. Forrest goes through life wondering what will happen next for him, longing for Jenny's love, but letting the winds of his life guide him throughout his journeys. And in the end, like destiny, Forrest and Jenny get to be married together and start a family."

Passionate prose requires a rationing of fist class, 'Grade A' fuel; strictly High Octane.<br/><br/>THAT WE HAVE no really strong opinion about the worth of this now classic, Oscar laden favourite, leaves us with what we fear will turn out to be a figurative stalemate, a split decision, a statistical draw. And we are reminded of former Notre Dame Football Coach Frank Leahy, whose eloquence in surmising what it is like to neither come out a victor, nor failing in the attempt to secure a win.<br/><br/>TO BEGIN WITH, the screenplay offers the telling of the story in flashback. The occurrences of what is nearly a life's worth of really unusual happenings and very unlikely coincidences, all seem to have been mixed into an emulsion of what can only be described as some of the most important moments in American and, indeed, World History.<br/><br/>WHILE FULLY REALIZING that a Film, no matter how good it may be, is still just a movie, escapist entertainment. It is a powerful form of fictional day dreaming; but still it's make believe, nonetheless.<br/><br/>WE ARE REQUIRED to be entertained by the incessant recitation of the narrative of all of these events that have led up to Forrest Gumps reunion with his life long friend and one true Love, Jennie. The long, deliberate cadence of Gump's delivery of this dialog is found to be very amusing, even to the most sour pussed stoic in the audience.<br/><br/>SORRY FOR HAVING to throw cold water on our ongoing involvement in this mirth-fest but we really out to pause and give some serious and sober analysis to this, our cause of amusement.<br/><br/>WHEN ASKED IN AN interview* about how and why LI'L ABNER creator, Al Capp, chose to build his comic strip around Hillbilly characte5rs in a most rural setting of Dogpatch, USA; his answer was delivered, quickly and in a most straight manner. Al stated that the use of Hillbilly characters was a nearly sure fire prescription for success. His reasoning being that the introduction of Hillbilly characters makes the job of succeeding in creating the desired yuk-yuks easier because everyone feels that they are superior to these American Rustics.<br/><br/>WE MUST ALSO consider the characterization of Forrest as being not just uncouth or ill mannered; but rather that he is truly slow or mentally deficient. He most certainly must suffer from some acute degree of mental retardation. Is this what the pseudo intellectuals in the Elite of Tinsel Town believe to be the polite and proper cause for merriment and mirth? WE ALSO DETECT at least a smattering of snobbishness and sanctimony. This is amplified by an unabashed utilization of patronizing preachiness, which would seam to reassure the production team's moral and intellectual superiority; at least to their way of thinking, we suppose.<br/><br/>NOTE: * This interview was done 1n the 1960's and published in a certain quasi-intellectual Men's Magazine; which also did a good business in peddling the exposition of feminine pulchritude and skin.

"Balutesiah2","8","2","3","30 January 2011"," The film is the story of a low IQ boy's life who does great works, not by reasoning, but mostly by chance or as a result of some events.
","About the film: Genre of this film is drama which also includes romance. The film is based on a novel by William Groom and produced by Paramount Communications Company. It is directed by Robert Zemeckis. Its executive music producer is Joel Sill. It was released in the US in 1994 and received many awards such as Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and People's Choice Award. The major characters are: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) , Robin Wright( Jenny) , Sally Field( F's mother), Gary Sinise (Lieutenant Dan), and Mykelti William( Bubba(. The story is during the period of Presidency of Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter. Some part of film happens in Vietnam. The film shows that many people did not agree with Vietnam War. It also shows ""Racism"" in the US. For instance, black students were permitted to enroll in college of Alabama just during the summer. During the Vietnam War, the ""Black Panthers"" were shaped against the War and against racism and unequal opportunities for blacks. The protagonist is a low IQ boy who does great works but not according to specific reasoning and goal. His mother named him ""Forrest"" after the Great Civil War's hero; General Nathan Bedford Forrest. She believed ""Forrest"" reminds him that all people sometimes do things that do make no sense. His actions are really in harmony with his name, for instance, he is a great runner, but as he says in the film, he runs without any reason. When he learns to play Ping-Pong, he plays without thinking. Once in the film, he repeats one of his mother's sentences; ""miracles happen every day"". We can see that his success in any area is somehow a miracle. The feather which is shown at the beginning and end of the film is a means to show the passing of time to a destiny; a destiny in which F's mother believes. Lieutenant Dan loses his belief in God and in destiny especially after his losing his legs in the war. F.G doubts whether we are destined to do some things-as his mother told- or ""are floating around accidental-like a breeze""- as lieutenant Dan believed- or both. <br/><br/>Plot The story is about a man named Forrest Gump. It involves two phases; in first phase, F.G speaks about his past life and takes us to different places related to his past experiences. But the events happening for him in second phase are not narrated by him as past memories but are taking place at the same time of being shown. Most of the story takes place in first phase. F.G is sitting on a bench and waiting for a bus in Savannah. He has a small suitcase in which he carries all the important things he has. During the first phase, he talks about his life to strangers who sit on that bench for a short while and wait for buses. Now, his life story: F.G and his mother live in Alabama. He was a boy with low IQ, but his mother sent him to school. When he grew up, he got a football scholarship in college because he could run very fast. The college put him in the All-America Team. After five years of playing football, he got a college degree. After his graduation, he applied at Army. In the Army he made friendship with a person named Bubba who was crazy about shrimping and suggested him to buy a shrimping boat after coming back home. The Army sent them to Vietnam. His officer was Lieutenant Dan. In the war, F.G and Lieutenant Dan were shot and Bubba was killed. In the field of war, he helped other soldiers very much. He ran very fast and rescued injured soldiers from the field. So, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson. Because he was shot, he was sent to hospital. There, he learned Ping-Pong from another soldier. He could play it as well as running. So, the Army wanted him to play Ping-Pong as the Special Service instead of returning to Vietnam. After some years, the Army decided he should be on the All-American Ping-Pong team. The Army sent the team to China. He and the team were the first Americans who visited China after many long years. After coming back to America, he became a national celebrity and was given the Congressional Medal of Honor. With Ping-Pong team, he met President Nixon. After Nixon's resignation, the Army discharged him and his service was up. After his being discharged, he bought a shrimping boat and worked on it by Lieutenant Dan. They made a lot of money in a few years and became the leaders of Bubba-Gump shrimping corporation. Lieutenant Dan's belief in God strengthened after being by F.G and seeing miracle-like situations like hurricane Carmen which led to their progress in shrimping. In second phase, we see the events at the same time as they happen. He marries his girlfriend ""Jenny"". Jenny dies because of illness. He takes care of his son whose name was ""Forrest"" too. His son was a smart boy. At the end of the film, the scenes are repeated with a difference: the roles of F.G and his mother are replaced by F.G and his son."
"magnuspy","8","2","3","26 January 2011"," A great movie... if you can overlook the historical whitewashing.
","Taken by itself, this is a wonderful movie with a compelling plot, wonderful characters played by talented actors and a balls-out performance by Gary Sinise, who in my opinion deserved the Oscar more than Tom Hanks. It is really an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that people of all ages can enjoy.<br/><br/>However, I'm rather conflicted about the sneaky the way the movie turns the truth inside out in pursuit of its aims. In the world of 'Forrest Gump', the Vietnam War was a just endeavor and its protesters were all drugged out, cowardly, sleazy hippies who turn innocent American farm girls into dope-dependent sluts. The social fervor of the sixties is presented as an irrational mania, and conservative norms are uncritically celebrated. The way this movie has been embraced by the hard-core right wing really creeps me out.<br/><br/>Still, this is one movie where the 'Willing Suspension of Disbelief' can reap big dividends."
"mahdiyeh82","Null","2","3","7 January 2011"," Forrest Gump
","Forrest Gump<br/><br/>Forrest: My momma always said,""life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""<br/><br/>It is a 1994 American comedy-drama film based on a novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, staring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. The story is of the Forrest Gump, a man from Alabama, his travels all over the world and the experiences he has had in his life. The film was first released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and was well received by critics. It earned over $677 million worldwide. The film garnered multiple awards and nominations, including Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, People's Choice Awards, and Young Artist Awards. The film starts by showing a feather floating in the sky and coming to Forrest's shoes. Then we see Forrest, sitting at a bus stop, taking the feather and telling his life story to the woman sitting next to him. As he tells his story, the listeners at bus stop change. Some of them are indifferent; some do not believe him while some others are interested and even fascinated. He was born with strong legs as we see later but with a crooked spine. The first day of school he met Jenny, the girl who changed his life. Once while they were walking among the trees, some boys tried to bully him. Jenny shouted"" run Forrest, run"" he started running and tore the strings which tied his special shoes. From that time on we see that his special ability and talent is running. While in college, again he was bullied by some boys, and this time ran through football field where he was recognized by the coach and invited to the team. After that he was taken to arm where he met his best friend Bouba who died later on in Vietnam. He saved some lives and also got wounded during the war and when he came back he received a Medal of Honor. While in hospital, his hobby was playing ping pong. He became a member of Army's team and went to China and won the competition with the Chinese and became a national hero. During his life he met different presidents and other famous people like John Lennon. All his life he was in love with Jenny and finally he married she and they had a son whom she had called Forrest. He started his shrimp business and became successful in it. Then through Lit. Dan, who he had met during war, invested some money in other businesses but went back to his hometown and lived with his momma till she died. For some years he was running without any reason. After Jenny's death he continued his life bringing up his son. It seems as if the feather which is carried by the breeze and is left in its hands and goes wherever is taken, is Forrest himself who is moved all his life by others. In the film in a scene when he was talking to Jenny's grave he was wondering ""if we are all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze"". The first days of his life it was his mother who told him what to do or not to do. Later it was Jenny who took up the role and it was by her demand that he even overcame his physical problem. This shows itself so vividly in Forrest's first encounter with Drill Sergeant when he answers the Sergeant that he was there"" to do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"". Even his success in ping pong was due to the fact that the first day he was told not to take his eyes off the ball.<br/><br/>The times he starts doing something without others ordering him, the action is misled by others. It can be shown best in his period of life when he started running. At first nobody paid attention to him but after a while he was surrounded by lots of reporters who tried to label him by some movement. Although he was completely ignorant, the answers he gave to those questions inspired some people. In the process, he forms the iconic""simply face"" logo and tells the man to ""Have a nice day"". This way others try to control his actions.<br/><br/>Although he had no plan, by his actions, which sometimes even seemed stupid, he changed the way of American history. While staying with President Nixon in Watergate hotel, it was by his phone call that the security office was informed of what was going on there and it initiated the Watergate scandal. In his interview with Dick Cavett, where John Lennon was a guest too, his answers inspired Lennon to write his famous song ""imagine"". Finally we can say he was an individual who had no will. When he was in love, he was treated in a way he even did not know his feeling and later on when he was told the child was his, he accepted it without hesitation. He was an individual who was affected by collective will. Whenever they wanted they sent him to war and when they were tired of war they took him to anti-war meeting to talk against war. During Cold War he was sent to China to beat the enemy in sport field. He is the individual human being without any will who is taken wherever he is destined to."
"iparss","9","2","3","17 December 2010"," The film is about a naive and honest American who is very successful in any job he gets in. Somehow Forrest Gump represents the United States.
","For me the film is a promoter of American culture and values and I want to look at the film from this point of view. It is the promoter of the American values using both conservative and liberal values, but the conservative values are more dominant and highlighted and liberal values are loosely used to promote just the American culture and at the end liberal values are defeated by conservative values although both ideologies are used to promote the American culture. The film also uses the American icon and figure to promote the American culture.<br/><br/>Family is and home are very important in film, Forrest mother is a devoted mother who does her best to keep the family and nurture her child although Forrest father is not present and may leave the family but the mother asserts that that he is on vacation so she wants to that they are a family. ""there is no place like home"" and ""family forever"" these themes can be seen in the film when Forrest, Jenny and their child return their home, Greenbow, Alabama, as a family. Gump is the man family, he is loyal to his love and does his best to have his own family. Gump is a hard working guy who works and tries hard to achieve happiness he expects nothing without hard-working. From the beginning Gump is running and he even runs across the US, symbolically ""chasing the American Dream"". Gump also is religious person, after returning home from China he says that people in China do not go to the church or he goes to the church to pray in order to have a big shrimping. Forrest also uses liberal gestures, like participating in anti-Vietnam War rally and taking part in a TV show to talk about his experience in China, telling that Chinese people are deprived from freedom and basic human rights. Gump is the symbol of conservative values and Jenny is the symbol of liberal values but at the end Jenny is dead but Gump as the symbol of the conservatives is the source of maintenance and continuity of the American culture.<br/><br/>Totally the film was made to appeal to conservatives and invalidate liberals but to promote the American culture even by utilizing liberal values. It also is a condemnation of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and its aftermaths. Jennifer Hyland Wang, movie critic, argued that Curran's death to an unnamed virus ""...symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade [1960s]."" Even the main structure of the film crew connote the conservative orientation of the film. Steve Tisch, one of the producers of the film is a conservative person who has produced other conservative film after Forrest Gump like Knowing and The Pursuit of Happiness that the later one alongside Forrest Gump are among the best 25 conservative movies by the National Review magazine."
"Fmobley2746","9","2","3","24 November 2010"," Somehow I can relate to this Forrest so well. Plus it has an excellent mix of comedy, sadness, happiness, and simple entertainment.
","Forrest Gump is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time if not the very best. I feel like Forrest Gump almost all of the time.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a film that everyone must see before they die. It is so touching. It just has an excellent mix of sadness, happiness, comedy, and just about everything I could ask for in a film. Some people do not even realize how great this film is. It is generally liked by the people and critics but it still does not have the credit that it deserves.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks played the role of Forrest Gump perfectly. I could not see anyone else in the role. Speaking of acting, every actor and actress delivered amazing performances. All of the acting was great.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" will always be a favorite of mine and I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it."
"jake-law123","9","2","3","26 June 2010"," One of the best films of all time
","For the longest time this was my favorite film. Even though it isn't anymore it's definitely in the top 5. I've seen this film so many times, I could recite the whole thing. This film made Robert Zemeckis one of my favorite directors, and Tom Hanks was all ready one of my favorite actors, so this really helped.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is so charming as the simple minded Forrest Gump, who, growing up in the 60's, 70's and 80's, inadvertently becomes involved with the key moments of the 20th century, including Vietnam, Watergate, winning a Medal of Honor, meeting multiple celebrities, etc. He goes through life simply doing what his mamma, (Sally Field) and his best friend Jenny, (Robin Wright) tell him.<br/><br/>This film has some of the best quotes of all time, the main one being ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". This film has so much going on. It's so inspirational, teaching you so many lessons on life.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis cleverly plays around with history, adding Forrest into key moments through great visuals and photoshopping, or just plain playacting. The visuals are really great if you know what you're looking at. The music score by Alan Silverstri will get you crying more than once. The soundtrack ranges from the 50's to the 80's, milking the biggest artists of those years as the decades flow through.<br/><br/>Possibly Tom Hank's best performance as Forrest. He can be funny, but he can also be strong willed and confident. Robin Wright is a great supporting character, being Forrest's main push in the movie to keep going. Sally Field as Forrest's mamma is also really supporting, raising him on his own at birth and supporting his decisions. More characters are introduced throughout, like Bubba, Forrest's friend in Vietnam, and Lieutenant Dan, (Gary Sinise) Forrest's Lieutenant in the war.<br/><br/>There's so much in this film, it's such a long but fun journey. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a really good inspirational feel good movie."

","Forrest Gump tells the story of, well Forrest Gump. The man was born with some disabilities, but he has overcome them and somehow seems to be present at a lot of historical moments. He's in love with his childhood friend Jenny, who constantly eludes him. <br/><br/>The film that beat my favourite film of all time at the Oscars. I'm not hating it, I think that both films deserved the title. Forrest Gump is something else. It seems to have been one of those, right place at the right time flicks. Everything about it simply works, it's heartwarming, funny, intelligent and depressing. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks gave us an unforgettable performance that goes down in history as one of the greatest. He is lost in this character and Gump takes a life of it's own. Probably one of the most lovable characters in the history of cinema. Jenny, the woman of his affections is played by Robin Wright Penn, her performance is almost saddening. Her life is constantly spiraling out of control and you can do nothing to stop it. Gary Sinise is hilarious as Lt. Dan, the hard ass in the army who loses his legs. We love to hate it at the beginning, then we come around, much like his character. <br/><br/>Speaking of losing legs, despite the film not needing a heavy load of CGI, it uses it beautifully. Inserting Gump into old footage and giving Sinise the lack of legs among other things. These are small things compared to what people are doing today, but Zemeckis has always been one to push technology in films, here he does it very well and never does it encompass the film. The story is forefront, something that he needs to get back into.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an everyman film. Meaning the almost everyone will like it. Some political messages may turn people the other way, but the overall feel of the film is something that a lot of people share. Every once in a while there is one film that touches a lot of people, I think Forrest Gump is one of those films. Even though the film goes off in many different directions, it works. Forrest in the army in one segment, then running around the country in another? I love it."

Forrest Gump was actually the first movie that made me cry at the end. One now might think that it is a really sad story but there's also a lot of happiness in there. All that great things that naive Forrest experiences made me laugh.<br/><br/>Although it is a quite long movie I could watch it again and again just because it's also very funny sometimes, it's the mix, I think between sadness and happiness that makes this movie one of the greatest ever."

I started this movie feeling sad about the situation this kid was born, slowly developing empathy for his situation and the discrimination he had to face and ended up admiring how someone who isn't aware of what he is doing can change everything.
I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got excited. I just could feel anything because this movie puts our loved Forrest trough so many situations you wouldn't imagine.

"DemonKiki","10","1","1","20 April 2020"," When I'm in a bad mood, I will watch this movie
","Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what the next one is. Therefore, all we have to do is learn how to taste, instead of complaining about ourselves and exile.
This is where A-Gump's impressiveness lies. He actually has faith. Faith in life, ""Life is like a box of all kinds of chocolates, you will never know what the next one is""; for your determination, when Jenny asked him what he wanted to become in the future, A-Gump only The answer is, ""I will still be myself in the future""; when judging the choice, when someone asks him, are you a fool? Forrest Gump's answer is still simple and profound, because ""only people who do stupid things are fools.""
In addition to the linguistic presentation of A-Gump's beliefs, there is also a moving presentation in the film, which is ""running"". From A-Gump's childhood, running has become A-Gump's life and part of his life. Running made A-Gump free from the foot support, ran across the rugby field, ran through the Vietnam War, and ran across the continent. Behind everything is obviously metaphorical. Running symbolizes the endless life, the firm direction, and the perseverance of the goal. Every step is contagious. Therefore, I think that running is not a kind of consumption, but acquisition, and you will feel that you are more powerful and will not fall into sinking, depravity and confusion. In particular, A-Gump started a three-year running journey after Jenny left.
However, faith always conflicts with certain things, such as fate. What this actually brings is the contradiction between consciousness and reality, the unity of inevitability and chance. In the film, the appearance of feathers almost expresses this kind of entanglement. Feather is drifting in the wind and is helpless, but it has its final destination and dependence. For A-Gump, the biggest joke that fate opened to him was that his best friends, loved ones and lovers all left him one after another. God let him taste the best emotions in the world and let him be lost by loved ones. pain. It's like A-Gump's confession in front of Jenny's grave: I don't know that when we have a destiny, it's not just accidents in life, like floating in the wind, or both.
When faith was hit by fate, A-Gump did not give up on it. This does not affect my judgment that Forrest Gump's life and life are happy. Because the essence of happiness is that you know what you have, no matter whether it is or now, you know that their position and value in your heart are irreplaceable. You know how to cherish, you will not forget them, nor will they. Because, when you have a certain faith, you will move towards your path, you will not be disturbed, you will have a free will, a beautiful heart and noble thoughts and firm actions. This is what A-Gump did, not only to understand but to do it. Since it is right, why not act immediately? Only doing stupid things is a fool! Therefore, A-Gump can reach the other side of happiness and have a paradise of true love."

"zeekwunlau","9","1","1","19 April 2020"," I know the meaning after running
","The correct life is generally experienced by ""running"". When running continuously, you can see the end point or not see the end point. You are advancing as much as possible. Every time you encounter a post on the way, you can choose to pass by or Staying, each choice may lead to countless results, just like you cannot predict the taste of the next piece of chocolate, and every time you think, there may not be an answer. As in the doubts mentioned in the movie, do we each have their own destiny, or Like a feather, drifting in the wind. The time background of the film is modern America. Some details of the era are seen in many details of the film. Some historical events have been moved to the screen. The film can learn about the reputation of Forrest Gump, because in many historical events He was left in the middle. The story that was asked to be quoted during the filming process must be an event that actually happened, and all of this has been done realistically, including the editing of some shots, which are all materials that once existed. This is a very serious production. A-Gump almost ran a whole movie. He experienced life and death parting all his life, and ran through many places. Every time he stayed at a node, there was a small turning point in his life. This turning point would prompt him to continue running, as if Life can no longer stop. Every time he started his long-distance running, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a khaki trousers, and later a cap and a pair of running shoes. These shoes have been in the movie for a few seconds. The close-up shot of has now become a fashion trend leader and has been loved by many friends. A-Gump also treated everything he insisted on with a serious attitude. He could even say that he had done two things of persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things made him hit by mistake and reached many unexpected achievements. He did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he is himself, not others, his purpose is only to be himself, even if he does not understand how to be himself, he actually understands, in him After running through so many corners. Finally, when he sent his son to the school bus, the scene was like his own childhood. At this time, the child was wearing a blue and white plaid shirt, a red cap, and a familiar look. When the father and son were fishing together by the river, the son tilted his head to the left like A-Gump, this is the same gesture. The connection between them has been expressed through many lenses. Forrest Gump may want to convey his spirit to his son. He does not need to do a lot of homework because he is not very good at it, but he will give his son a subtle influence. Son In the future, he will become a person who possesses his character but is smarter than him. I believe it will bring greater honor to his father."

"Pierre-Andre-17","10","1","1","5 April 2020"," The Running Soul
","I have to say that Forrest Gump is the movie which serves as a milestone in my life because of its special and unbelievable inspirational power...
I watched the movie when I was during the winter holiday in Grades 11... Before that time...I was like most ordinary students who wasted time on playing computer games and unhealthy videos... I didn't have a dream at that time... I didn't have perseverance at that time... And I didn't have confidence and always be stirred by the others at that time... All in all...I was a loser who forgot he used to be competitive in his childhood...who forgot that his parents loved him a lot but didn't he hid into the room playing games...who despoiled his talent but was not conscious of anything...-That is the context of me at that time...
By accident... the Fortuna even favored me ...who was a pariah ...just when I need her most... My mom sent me to talk with a talented student who had matriculate with MIT... Originally...we were aimed at sharing math-learning experience and I would wait for his advice...however...he ... a brilliant and prospective one...expressed his aspiration for me and urged me to think more about the world outside...which sowed a special seed in my heart... After that talk ...I asked my parents to buy a English-learning book for me and decided to master English...
Though I did work hard at that time...my heart still suspended as I missed computer games and sensory appetite... I was so confused like Pierre Bezkhov when I had to choose only one from sensory satisfaction and my prospective future... Without urge and enough perseverance ...I trespassed my rule over and over again though every time I decided to"" overhaul myself... Though I had an ideal...I didn't own strong heart to defend it... -that is my second phase...
Accidentally...I watched Forrest Gump with my parents in a evening as a so-called recreation... We escorted ourselves in the sofa and waited for watching funny things...However...what I heard was not laugh in the prelude... what I heard was not hilarious actions in the prelude-what I heard was an euphonious and soft music which made me feel I was the feather drifting with wind without knowing the destiny and touched my heart-string powerfully...
...
That was the first time that I watched a movie till 1:00am... After the 142mins watching ... I turned off the TV seemingly silent but a special power rose in my heart meanwhile... That was the first time in my life that I was touched so completely by a movie... Laying on the bed...I thought Forrest has small dream but also trys his best to defend it ... Why can't I? He doesn't care anyone's scoff and doesn't be affected by others'perverse...Why can't I? He loved Jenny truly madly and deeply and deemed her his beacon faithfully...Why can't I own this faith towards my dream? It's time for me to have a run with Forrest in my heart...
I grasped this invaluable chance and discarded my old habits decisivly ... finished the English book at an amazing speed ... I liked reading English books in the corridor and on the way to my home ... I also run to my home after school so that I can save some time to learn Engish-I know this foreign language can take me anywhere ...
With the inspiration left by the movie ... I successfully passed more and more exams and is still on the way to my ideal university-Cornell ... Though it's hard to achieve my dream Forrest Gump is still my sword and shield which will make me stir clear off the obstacles and find the best way...
I am still running and Forrest ... I hope everyone can do..."

","I often talk about Forrest Gump with my friends. Forrest Gump is so lucky! That's what my friends always say. I was dumb. I was surprised that Forrest Gump was sitting on that stool, just telling strangers coming and going: ""look, how lucky I am""? Many years ago, I was full of confusion about life. I don't know why people live. Sometimes I sit on the windowsill and say to myself: I'm jumping now, it's no different from living to death. Fortunately, I didn't jump. After thinking about it for two years, I came up with an answer: how can people live better? Although there is no answer to this question, I am not as confused as before. Why are you talking about this? Because when watching this film, I seem to have experienced the process of questioning life again. A normal person has the ability to judge. He knows what is important and what is not. A normal person can have many choices, so he is always biding his time. A normal person will not waste his energy on useless places. But Forrest Gump is not a normal person, his IQ is lower than ordinary people, he even almost entered a school for the mentally handicapped. Girlfriend, school team, army, ping-pong, shrimp farming, running, it seems that everything about him is not his own choice, but the choice of others. Of course, he doesn't ask questions like ""what is life?"" He will only foolishly do one thing after another. What exactly is this story about? I think the director said a truth in a very extreme way: choice is likely to mislead life. Because there are too many choices, some people do not work attentively, this attitude further affects his life. In the face of life, maybe you should be prepared: ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you don't know which one you will choose."" I like this film very much. I like the feather flying very much, as if it was myself."
"karladavisio","10","1","1","3 April 2020"," Amazing
","The film ""Forrest Gump"" is not just a story about the life of an individual and his family on the background of real historical events. It is permeated with love and friendship. It is surprisingly bright, although the events are very different. And far from always joyful. Interestingly, the film has very few negative characters - forrest loves people. And this is natural - people turn to him and, accordingly, to the viewer with their best side.
The original seemed to me a way to drown out the sad moments in the film with Forrest comments. Most often they were rather stupid and not quite on the topic, which distracted from sadness and helped the viewer move on to other events.
The film was liked not only by me, but also by millions of other people, as the Six Oscars can say. The film teaches us to believe in ourselves, to believe in a dream, to believe in sincere genuine happiness. Teaches to love your mother. Teaches everything that is needed for a person who has lost hope of life. Teaches you how to live and never stop.
Forrest Gump definitely deserves its popularity and praise from critics. Probably the simplicity of its main character. He is easy to believe, his stories are breathtaking, and although some stories are really sad, the hero speaks of them as something pleasant, as some kind of new experience. The film teaches you not to lose heart, to love and respect, but it is worth a lot."

","Forrest Gump almost finished a whole movie, his life went through life and death, but also ran through a lot of places, every time he stayed at a node, life will have a small turn, this turn will prompt him to continue to run, as if life can no longer stop. Every time he starts his long run, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a pair of khaki trousers, followed by a cap and running shoes, which had a close-up shot for several seconds in the movie and have become a fashion trendsetter and loved by many friends.
In fact, it is very rare for a mother to have such a consciousness of life, and everything she bears in her life is also relatively heavy. As a single mother, she raised her son alone, and the obstacles her son suffered because of intellectual reasons need to be ruled out by her.-personally, she bears the expenses of her child's growth and takes good care of a child, all of which is on her one person, but she is still optimistic and upward, and at the same time she teaches her son to be optimistic and upward. It is believed that a fool has such a thing, so the mother is actually a good example of a firm belief in a willing heart all the way, and Jenny is a key to the lock of his bondage.
Forrest Gump's biggest characteristic is his persistence and seriousness. In fact, insisting on itself is a very difficult thing to complete, but someone will still do it, just like Forrest Gump. He has been running, his life is to run, from the beginning of being chased, to run on his own, he has no other distractions in his heart, he has no interest in the purpose, he was asked by Jenny who wants to be a person, he did not understand, he said he is not to be himself.
Forrest Gump also took everything he insisted on with a serious attitude, and it could even be said that he had done both persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things had led him to make many unexpected achievements by mistake, and he did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he was himself, not others, and his purpose was to be himself, even if he did not understand how to do himself well. But he actually understood, after he ran through so many corners."

","Forrest Gump is a story that follows two characters, one names Forrest, the other named Jenna.
As  says Forrest Gump is a simple relatively wealthy kid man with a low I.Q, but good intentions. What makes this move so great is how Gump goes through many of the historical events of the 20th century. From dancing with Elvis, to entering the Vietnam war, to witnesses the original moon landing on tv, to meeting the black panther organization, and even even witnessing the WaterGate Scandal that causes Nixon to retire. Gump goes through a lot of situations throughout his life, but he never lets anyone of them disturb his happiness. From we're wearing braces on his leg, to get in bullied in school, and as an adult, to even being shot. Gump never gives up and continues to believe things will workout all right. That faith always helps him out for example when he gets his braces of he discovers he can run extremely fast, and long, all that running from bullies paid off (insert famous Run Forrest Run Here scene here). Not only that because he runs so fast Football recruiters and coaches notice him allowing him to receive a football scholarship to the university of Alabama as a running back. Which then allows him to graduate college and join the military when a recruiter talks to him. Why he joins the military no reasons he just does it no real explanation to why.
That's the thing with his character he basically symbolizes the idea that somebody can make a difference no matter who they are, even the dumbest of the dumb. When he joins the military, he quickly able to fit, you realize Forrest really isn't that dumb. He able to quickly able to reassemble his gun in the military, faster than anyone in the U.S military existence.
Anyway in the military he meets a man named Bubba and he comes the best of pals. Despite racism clearly being an issue as shown by the historical scene of the desegregation of the university of Alabama(extremely funny). Bubba and Him are quickly able to become the best of friends. To the point where the the Shrimp business he always talks with Forrest about, he eventually ask Forrest to come join him once's they leave the military. Which is sad cause Bubba ends up dying due to an injury.<br/><br/>Anyway when he went to go save Lieutenant Dan his commander and a few other solid jets, Dan tells him to leave him, but Forrest doesn't listen. This causes Gump to become a war hero although Dan ends up losing his legs due to serious injuries. While in rehab Forrest Gump picks up a new skill as ping pong which allows him join the All America Ping Pong team and even meet JFK. He eventually meets lieutenant Dan again and the dude is a mess, he a hopeless goner since he couldn't die War like his ancestors. Although he joins Gump in his shrimping business challenges god to sink his ship when a huge hurricane hit's Louisian, and his ship is the only one that remains. Allowing Gump to monopolize the business and in the end they both become millionaires, as Dan takes over the business although he makes sure to replay Gump by making him a stock shared in Gump words a ""fruit company""(Apple). Dan eventually get married and finds a wife.
Anyway let's talk about Gump Mother she is an amazing single mother who only ever wanted the best for her child. To the point where she ends up having sex with a school principal early on in the move just so that her child could go to a better school. She always tells Gump ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". Basically mean life is unpredictable, it's full of surprises. You pick and piece of chocolate and you eat it, you may like it, but when you pick again you might not like the other one. Does that mean you stop eating from those boxes of chocolate no you keep eating a trying the next, who knows you may like the rest of them. When she dies of Cancer Later on in the story it's very sad.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Jenna her and Gump relationships. Jenna starts her life of being sexually abused by her father and that's a common theme in her life in away. Which Forrest Descirbes as ""always kissing and touching Jenny and her sisters"". The men in her life are constantly abusing her yet the one man who never even think about touching her, constantly rejects him. Jenny was originally Gumps only friend as everyone else treated him like the ""idiot"" he was, she was the only one who let Gump sit with her on the bus on his first day at school. She was the one who told Gump to ""Run Forrest Run"" from the bullies. Jenny ends up posing for a Playboy while in college and ends up getting expelled. Which causes her to perform and sing for a strip club pretty much nude. Anyway Forrest Gump doesn't like how the men grabbed her just like how he didn't like her boyfriend in college grabbing her and beats them up. Cussing Jenna to be fired, anyway before leaving for the military Jenny worried about the Vietnam war tells Forrest if he is ever scared in Vietnam to just run away. She still gives him advice even though he just got her fired meaning she probably didn't like the job anyway.
Forrest is constantly writing her letter in the Military, but is never getting any of them back, although they do end up uniting a few year later in Washington D.C, following a mostly muted Anti War Speech Gump was about to accidentally participate in. The two spend the day together and converge at a Black Panther Party sage house, however Jenny boyfriend at the time and the Party members weren't happy swing Forrest there. Jenny and her boyfriend eventually get in an argument in which the boyfriend slaps Jenny and Gump goes ballistic. Forres and Jenny are forced to leave and they spend the rest of the night reflecting on there journeys. Jenny ends up leaving for Berkeley's with the same boy that hit her, although not before Gump giver her his Congressional Medal of Honor reward, and saying she is her girl to which Jenny replies I'll always be your girl. Jenny ends going though a really rough time after this she has succumbed further into a life of drugs and instability. Battered and high she comes closed to committing suicide. Jenny eventually gets her life together and becomes a waitress and ends up meeting Gump, she has a child now who she named Forrest Jump Junior. We don't really know if it's really it's Gump kid or not but he accepts Gump Jr. as his own kid. We find out that Jenny is ill and suffering from an I own virus at the time know as HIV. Which prompts Forrest to tell them to come live with him and he promises to come take care of both of them. Jenny ask Forrest if he will marry her and he agree with great happiness. She ends up dying later on, and the saddest scene appear with Gump talking to her at her grave. Jenny finally accepted the one man that truly cared for her and she ends up dying. Sad, at least Gump jr is very bright. Forrest Gump is an amazing story and it's a must watch."

","Such a beautiful movie, i believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.<br/><br/>I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.<br/><br/>The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright."

Because they can be well prepare for the opportunities and challenges and even know the lucky numbers of lottery beforehand. But for me, I don't want to have such 'ability' at all. Life is a mystery and everyone has his own way. I enjoy the surprise of receiving gift from my classmates on my birthday and running into an old friend on the street in another city, etc. There are so many amazing incidents in my life which can't be happen if I have the power to forecast the future.
To Forrest Gump, who was born with intellectual disturbance and muscle problem in his leg, he never imagined that he could become a famous American football player, a war hero and even a millionaire. Forrest won dignity and respect though his strive and perseverance.

His dedication to his roles, specifically this one stands out on a level which is highly noticeable.

","Let me start out with I love Tom Hanks, and I love the simplex movies he tends to star in. I don't have any complaints about the movie, in terms of cinematography, actors, or premise/theme. This review is about a specific character. That character is Jenny.<br/><br/>I strongly dislike Jenny and now I will go into detail.<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying, the way they wrote her character is oddly realistic in my opinion and that's part of the reason I have any judgement about her at all. As a teen (first time I saw the movie), I didn't understand why Jenny was so reckless, but now I understand that it stems from her childhood.<br/><br/>However, this is where it begins fumbling for me. Jenny went to college. This means that she has an understanding that hard-work and effort will bring some form of success. With that being said, it VEXES me how she treats Forest. She treats him horribly. She does not owe him anything in the first place, so her constant toxic, recurring and random appearances in his life are exactly that.<br/><br/>After meeting so many men that treated her bad, you would think she would have given him an actual chance earlier on. Forest, although ""mentally challenged"" had about the same understanding about the world around him as any other male his age. He was well-built and attractive, and conversational. It makes sense, in an aspect, that because she was abused; she constantly searches for comfort in men that hurt or abuse her. It also doesn't, because again, she went to college. She had in her mind that she owed herself more, and then gives that away.<br/><br/>Whether directly or indirectly, she's manipulating Forest throughout the movie and this is supported by her eventually having a child with him. Why have a child with someone you don't take seriously UNLESS you feel like they are benefitting you in some aspect? It's frustrating to watch her take advantage of his simple mind. She knows what she's doing. She's operating on a level, he can't comprehend, which is again -manipulation.<br/><br/>She has no sense of self, and apparently no empathy either. If being abused has caused her to seek negative partners, behave dangerously, and more; then why would she constantly push her way into Forest's life at random times? And if she's behaving unconsciously, with no intentions (or unknowingly) because she was abused, then why is she able to spend time with other people and give them her quality time?<br/><br/>Jenny is a careless, and a bit of a heartless individual, and her character irritates me off."

Literally, is the most effective movie you'll ever see in your life.
Idk why it's not the #1 on IMDb, it deserves to succeed the shawshank redemption ( I love this movie too) but God! Forrest?
He teaches you to not giving up, no matter what, his motto is when life gives you lemon, make a lemonade.
He made out of unstable legs a fantastic runner, he made of the 75 IQ a college student, then a perfect private in the army, he made of his simple mind a giant shrimp company, he became a millionaire, he married the love of his life and became a father, he lost his mother, his friend and his wife but remain a good hearted person.

What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie.

"Animany94","10","1","1","4 August 2019"," This is pure gold.
","Forrest Gump has been one of those movies that stuck with me even though many years have passed since I watched it the first time. The journey through the life of the dim-witted but ever lovable Forrest Gump is just so touching, funny, sad everything you know from life is represented here in some way.<br/><br/>To be honest, there are times when the characterization of Gump as a person with less the average IQ points can be a little too much, but if you look at it through the interplay with the characters he meets, then it becomes an eye-opener.<br/><br/>Especially when he is sharing the screen with either his love interest Jenny, the war time comrade Bubba or his stern but loyal lieutenant Dan Taylor. Those characters stay with you in some way, because they are som well written in the context of Forrest's story. The fact that you don't always get on well just because you're smart. Life is harsh, but when it is, look out for your loved ones.<br/><br/>And how the technicians managed to mix Tom Hank's person into that footage of historical events is still baffling. I had a blast watching it every time it appeared.<br/><br/>Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. An undoubted masterpiece."

","I think Forrest Gump is an extraordinary movie.Its timeless formula passed beautifully in such a good way.We all can relate to the character of Forrest Gump.The movie is one of the best movie in 90's.It tells the story of Forrest Gump,a guy with IQ below 70,driving his way across history and generation of America(USA).I am so grateful I can watch this movie in my lifetime.The comedy in this movie is perfect,sometimes ironic.People in this movie saw Forrest as a failure,a human that can't become what he wanted to.He has some intelligent disabilities but then he prove that his incapabilities is his power.He erases that burden like a boss.He listen to what people said and break his limit.But I told ya not all times we always obey and do what people say.Forrest Gump is special,he did all the people told him to do.It's his way of life dude.Tom Hanks,a perfect actor for this movie.Look at his acting I am so sure that's Oscar worthy.He captures perfectly the character of Forrest Gump.The rest of the star were good too.Especially the ones who play Forrest mother.I feel a kinda sad whenhis mother die.Well it's kinda predictable but in good way.I am so regretful I can't watch this movie in my childhood.The movie had ton of life lesson for everyone.The genre of comedy , drama,brotherhood,friendship,love,history lesson,tragedy mixed beautifully to create this masterpiece.My tears falling down when I saw the reunion scene at Washington memorial.Such a good scene.And also when the captain found a new way of life.I kinda dislike Jenny character.She is like burden to Forrest but then they found a happy family.I hope they make a sequel to this movie.I knew they won't adapt the second novel very soon but there is still a hope.God bless everyone who make Forrest Gump into an unforgettable movie."

"jasonmcgrath-71494","10","1","1","11 July 2019"," Mama aways said....
","Forrest is...different. He's slow, but his mother tells him to never let that become an obstacle. The message is simple and he becomes the embodiment of a good person. He meets Jenny, who dreams of escaping her abusive and chaotic upbringing. Bubba, who's slow like him and just as loyal. Lieutenant Dan, whose lineage has died herocially in every conflict, loses his legs and feels cheated out of his destiny. I think both sides of the spectrum are here in this movie and the ""American Dream"" slips into a nightmare for many that he meets. Forrest floats along without any solid goal. He becomes a football star from running away from bullies, he meets famous people and doesn't know how to react, and while trying to save his only buddy, he ends up becoming a war hero. He accidently inspires a jogging revolution. He doesn't overthink things--he can't, he's slow, but his heart is so pure, people overlook his simple nature. He's just floats about like the obvious feather in the beginning and end. His mother's sage advice is that life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. This is insight into the bittersweet nature of reality that Forrest encounters over his journey. We all strive for something, albiet fame, unity, or glory, but Forrest just runs on a different current. He gains enough wisdom that the nature of reality if up for grabs and leaves us where we began, but his footprint is there. I love this movie. His Mother's stubborn advice to just be himself is something that many preach, but few practice. He can't wear a mask and that's what keeps him pure. His every action is from an honest place and some people depise him for it. He loves running, ice cream, ping pong, his friends and mother, and his Jenny. The movie has a lot of heart. 10/10...I tend to give very biased reviews. A lot of the special effects are dated, but I let that slide.

","There are few other movies that come to mind that tackle Cold War American history and foreign affairs in such a unique way. Forrest Gump tells a heartwarming story that touches everyone that watches it. Upon seeing it for the first time in a theater for the 25th anniversary screening, I was still astounded at the movie's timeless morals and sentiment. The movie really does not get old. It has its adult content so it may not be fit for kids, but I really believe this is a movie that holds broad appeal. When I was growing up in Florida, my family and I watched this nearly every day on generator power as Hurricane Charlie blew through. As I never grew tired of it then, I still do not today."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","1","19 May 2019"," A charming romp through modern American history.
","For the longest time, I had only seen pieces of Forrest Gump (1994). After watching it in fits and starts, I finally sat down and watched the whole thing in one go probably ten years ago. Upon re-watching this Best Picture-winner, I realized how it has maintained its cultural appeal for so long. After all, it's not necessarily a story about a slow southern boy; it's the story of history and the story of America. That's not to say it doesn't have its faults, but they're relatively minor compared to the impact of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>What's perhaps the most impressive part of Forrest Gump is the visual effects. From digitally inserting the titular character into archival footage to removing a Vietnam War soldier's legs, even knowing these computer-aided elements are there doesn't hinder how real they look. Although, being able to match the visual tone and style of several decades was equally as impressive. It's almost laughable how one character could be a coincidental part of so many iconic events of the late 1900's, but I suppose that's a lot of the charm of this film.<br/><br/>My one qualm with this movie also aligns with the spot in the plot where I generally used to stop watching. When the main character starts running across the country with no apparent supplies (water, food, etc.), my suspension of disbelief was broken. If anything, it was only meant as a chance to show off American geography (and move the timeline forward a few years), whereas the previous two hours was primarily American history. Some might also fault Jenny's (Robin Wright) poor life decisions as well, but I think it's merely indicative of what can happen to people who are sexually abused as children.<br/><br/>A charming romp through modern American history, I give Forrest Gump 4.5 stars out of 5."

This is an eye opener, a motivational and a very good love story. Tom Hanks is at his best in this movie. His acting takes you to the core of character and binds you to the screen for entire movie.

The actors do a great job portraying their characters. Gary Sinese as the bitter veteran is sympathetic to watch and Jenny, Gump's love interest is a good example of a star crossed lover.

"harrylosborne","9","1","1","8 May 2019"," A sensitive journey through a tumultuous America
","Arguably Tom Hanks' finest example of his acting range, Forrest Gump is about as challenging a role a modern actor could be charged with: trying to merge compassion and inadvertent humour alongside mental impairment is a recipe for disaster, but Hanks navigates it flawlessly. The incidents of Watergate, Vietnam and several presidencies are retold through the life of a boy-turned-man swept up by these current affairs, all whilst trying to get back to his childhood love Jenny (Robin Wright).<br/><br/>By having several stories contained within one film, emotional ties are given more value, spanning years and experiences. In particular, Forrest's relationship with Lt. Dan (Gary Sinese) is enduring, lasting even after the events during their time in Vietnam. Several large historical events are (somewhat fictionally) retold, with Forrest managing to crop up in the most unlikely places - however, his naivety shines through, giving the film a lighthearted touch that can be lost when tackling issues as serious as war and racism.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump's brilliance is through making a scene funny one second, before pulling on heartstrings the next. This seamless transition is a true feat in cinema, represented by Forrest Gump's overwhelming success (winning 6 Oscars in 1995). This film is also truly unique in its ability to be entertaining for almost any demographic - represented by its enduring success 25 years later."

"jacobhunt6","9","1","1","26 April 2019"," Beautiful, and executed to a tee
","Forrest Gump is the defining motion picture of the latter half of the 20th century, in so many ways. It is a heart-warming, heartbreaking and beautifully constructed film that takes its audience on an emotional journey that will change hearts, minds and perspectives. The performance of Tom Hanks is utterly astounding. Hanks truly is what made this film a class above, and this is a sterling performance that stands out even in such an accomplished career. He brings heart, sincerity and empathy to a role that immediately captures the love and respect of the audience and leaves them in tears at the beauty and tragedy of Forrest's experiences.
The story itself is a genius concept executed to perfection. It is an exploration of the last fifty years of the 20th century through the eyes of a literal everyman. The innocent, unassuming perspective of Forrest Gump allows the audience to reflect on some of the highest and lowest points in America's history through a fresh set of eyes, seeing history from the point of view of someone without the prejudices and biases that come with educated thought and opinion. Forrest's mental handicap was necessary to create such a powerful everyman character, and yet Hanks manages to execute this without resorting to comical stupidity and dampening the credibility of the film's sincerity.
To emphasise the perfection of this film's writing even further, it is an exemplification of circular narrative, with incredible use of music and a variety of film types, camera angles and colour palettes to cover the roughly fifty-year period within its narrative reaches. Robert Zemeckis and his production team simply do everything right. This is a beautiful tale of love and hate, war and peace, comedy and tragedy that will be talked about for decades, and rightfully so. It is a testament to the writing of Winston Groom, and of course the directing of Zemeckis.
Hanks' performance is backed up by a supporting cast that executes their respective jobs perfectly, with special mention for Mykelti Williamson and Gary Sinise. Bubba and Lieutenant Dan are iconic characters that reflect tumultuous periods of American history, and their interactions with Forrest are beautifully executed to a tee.
Forrest Gump is unique in so many aspects. It is a wonderful exploration of the world through a fresh set of eyes, which is a concept so frequently attempted and so rarely achieved to such an impact as this. The world often needs to reflect on itself without its own prejudices, and there is no better film than Forrest Gump to show us all the state of affairs that we live in. This film should rightfully go down in history as one of the greats, and Hanks' performance should be hailed as perhaps the greatest leading performance in cinema. He captured our hearts from the moment that feather settled on his shoe and kept them neatly tucked in his suitcase until that feather drifted away yet again. Beautiful filmmaking at its finest."

","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."

","Forrest Gump, the main character is a very stupid and unsophisticated person. He doesn't understand the consequences of his decisions. At a very little age, he falls in love with a girl named Jenny. He doesn't know many things but he's sure that he loves her.<br/><br/>Because of his stupidity he's not good at making decisions. So, he accepts everything that comes in his way. He had to struggle a lot, for that. He lost his best friend and the love of his life doesn't love him back. But in the end, his life was beautiful. And it was the struggles that made him appreciate what he had.<br/><br/>So, I think, if people are as friendly, well behaving and positive as Forrest, they can live a beautiful life too. All we have to do is to accept the opportunities life gives us."

"vaniharish-54223","9","1","1","20 February 2019"," A remarkably enjoyable movie experience
","Forrest Gump had been one among the most anticipated movies on my watchlist for quite a while. For some reason I kept postponing the event of finally watching it, until one day, I had an unusual instinct to get it done with and after watching the light white feather from the intro scene fly away after two hours and twenty two minutes of constant amusement, I must say that I regret not having watched this movie earlier.<br/><br/>
It might be very unfair if I don't mention the sublime and magnificent performance of Tom Hanks. As always, he has done justice to the role of Forrest Gump too. Excellent delineation of the characters coupled with the unique plot of the movie contribute towards the unparalleled success of the same. The perfect pace of narration of the story in retrospect by the protagonist and the way each character has lived to adhere to their inherent traits and acquired mutations, leave us with a vehemently relishing movie experience, which most of us might have been deprived of, for quite a while.<br/><br/>
Although I was a couple of decades late in enjoying the film, I don't think that it had any major impact on how much juice I could get out of the fruit. The movie has the potential to converge your attention right from the beginning to the very last scene. It emphasizes on the relationship of the protagonist between his mother, his beloved childhood sweetheart and his peers and help us decipher the differences in the perception of life and its events from person to person.
We are given a chance to take a roller coaster which gives us an insight to the innocent and innocuous nature of Forrest, his love for the ones who love him and his views of the societal norms. Given the adorable traits of the protagonist, it is almost impossible and certainly improbable for us to not sympathize with our hero on many instances or to not desire to have such a virtuous friend like him. Although he is not remarkably smart or sharp, his benign and innocuous nature compensates for the former.<br/><br/>
To conclude, I'd like to say that Forrest Gump would be a strong recommendation especially for those who feel deranged or derailed in life. The way Forrest strives to catch a break every time, guarantees to inspire the audience too and gives them a sense of hope, indirectly spreading the message to not give up and have faith in the ones who care for you and above all, in yourself. With all this in consideration, it'll be unfair not to give the movie the rating it deserves."
"Silent_Cal","7","1","1","19 February 2019"," Life is Like a Box of Chocolates That You Totally Just Got for Free
","""Forrest Gump"" is a classic movie that everyone's seen a dozen times, and if you haven't you probably know all the quotes: You've heard ""Run, Forrest, run"" and ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and so on, and you've heard impressions of Tom Hanks's slow Southern drawl in varying degrees of similitude and awfulness. The movie ambles charmingly along with its protagonist, following him from Alabama to Vietnam to a Louisiana shrimp boat, watching him meet presidents and celebrities, and regularly churning out life lessons. A charming, amiable sort of movie, if only those life lessons weren't so sickening.<br/><br/>Forrest never does much of anything, but wonderful things just keep happening to him. His miraculous sprinting earns him a college football scholarship, and he meets John Kennedy after the championship game. He joins the army and goes off to the Vietnam War, where he wins the Medal of Honor. He becomes a wealthy shrimp-boat captain after surviving a hurricane, also rather miraculously. Everything just keeps getting better for him.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his single mother is stricken with cancer, and dies. His childhood friend Jenny, after struggling with drugs, gets AIDS and dies. His army friend Bubba is killed in Vietnam. His other friend, Lieutenant Dan, gets off easy by comparison, only losing his legs and spending much of the film in a wheelchair.<br/><br/>The obvious and unequivocal message of all this is that it was good to be a straight white man in America in the second half of the twentieth century. The movie's two women both live hard lives and die young, as does Bubba, who is black. Lieutenant Dan is white, by the way.<br/><br/>Forrest is oblivious to nearly everything. Good things are handed to him, like that box of chocolates or the Apple stock he just happened to come by. He even accidentally inspires the iconic yellow smiley face.<br/><br/>Looking at it this way, it's less of a nostalgic trip down our collective memory lane and more of a scathing satire on the inequities of American society. Someone should tell the folks who keep posting this on their ""Best Conservative Movies"" lists."

"waltersterns","9","1","1","17 February 2019"," The best movie that I have ever seen
","So meet. Forrest Gump is an ideal cog in the system, incapable of understanding the laws of its functioning.<br/><br/>At first glance, it seemed to me that the film tells about the absence of the need for a great mind for a full-fledged existence in modern society, as well as about the advantages of not understanding rotten human relationships and the fact that you are constantly used by outsiders in your goals.<br/><br/>Judging by the monologue at the end, the essence of the film comes down to humility in front of fate and hope for the best, regardless of your intelligence and the number of limbs. American standard, do not say anything.<br/><br/>But if you run through the plot of the film, you can see that the film is about dedication and the search for its purpose. Almost all the main characters of this story had their own dreams and goals. Except Forrest, naturally. And you know what? All of them caught a big bummer. They tried to use the system to the best of their consciousness, in the end the system had them and their dreams.<br/><br/>Forrest did not have the desires and skills of forecasting, which is why he was led by the system. Since He had a couple of talents up his sleeve, the system accepted him very well, and everyone used it. Moral plug for Jenny, runner for school, cannon fodder in the army, propagandist on anti-war protest. In short, his whole life he needed a master who would indicate what and how to do it.<br/><br/>The biggest host that characterizes this kind of film was a woman, Jenny. After she left home, Forrest, unable to bear the care of her mistress, ran senselessly for 3 years of her life (which I found funny, the system was able to use Forrest here).<br/><br/>So, we have a person who goes with the flow, whom life rewards with victories, money and well-being, which cannot be said about people who aspired to something. (their situation leveled off when they began to parasitize Forrest, but this is unimportant). Something wrong with the promise of the author, somewhere there is a catch? Well, I am rounding out.<br/><br/>True, one question remained: is Forrest Sr. the biological father of Forrest Jr.? That's a mystery ..."

","Forrest Gump is one of the all-time classics directed by Robert Zemeckis, who also directed Back to the Future.

Also, it's so sad that Jenny had to die on the same bed as his mama. Another reason that this movie is inspirational and motivational is that if there's something bad going on, run from it. Run from everything what is bad around and never look back. If a bully is picking on you, run. That's the solution to life, run from the bad stuff. Finally, this movie means a lot of things.

","'Forrest Gump (1994)' constantly threats to become unfocused and, really, it's a miracle that it isn't completely so, especially since it covers so much time and so many key historical events. Thankfully, its focal character is constantly, well, in focus, which is really because of the fantastic, sweet yet weighty screenplay that's delightfully delivered by the film's rightfully famous star. The flick really is a roller-coaster of emotions, running the gamut from genuinely funny to genuinely sad, sometimes within the same scene. It's all held together by tight film-making that knows exactly what it's doing, ultimately creating perhaps one of the most entertaining, affecting and crowd-pleasing experiences ever put to screen. It sometimes gets stick for being 'too mainstream' but all that means, really, is that it hits as wide an audience as possible and hits them as hard as it can. 9/10"

"jasonuemail","10","1","1","15 October 2018"," Hands down best movie to ever exist
","The phrase ""life is like a box of chocolates"" is extremely misleading. While it is true that you never know what will be inside that box, the contents of a chocolate box are always good, unlike life. If you live a life like anyone but Forrest Gump, life is actually like a box of those jelly beans that are either tasty flavors such as lime or strawberry banana, or disgusting ones like grass clippings or rotten eggs. Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, stumbles through life aimlessly and ends up being one of the most successful men on the planet. Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is one of the most iconic movies and should serve as the model for how a film should be made. Its wonderful storytelling, advanced special effects, and valuable life lessons raises the movie to a level that only a select few have eclipsed.
 Zemeckis brilliantly tells the story of Forrest's life through a series of flashbacks. The plot is intriguing by itself, but the flashbacks add a unique spin to the movie. Forrest is first introduced as a middle aged man sitting at a bus stop adorning a pair of extremely worn out shoes holding a suitcase and a box of chocolates. Although some might argue that the use of flashbacks is unnecessary, the audience receives a lot of insight about Forrest's life by telling the story through flashbacks. Forrest effectively serves as a narrator and is able to tell the audience what he was thinking and what resulted from his actions. By delivering the story in flashbacks, Forrest is also able to provide comedic relief throughout the movie. From moments when he explains how he was named after the founder of the KKK, to how he inspired Elvis Presley's dancing or even he is reminiscing about visiting the White House, the movie provides an effective amount of comedy in order to maintain its seriousness. Forrest's narration also provides a seamless transition between various flashbacks. This, combined with the fact that the plot of the story is based off of what actually happened in real life, makes for impeccable storytelling. By having the plot revolve around events like the Vietnam War and multiple presidencies, the viewers who grew up or lived during these times can easily recollect their experiences. The powerful storytelling combined with amazing special effects makes Forrest Gump one of the most memorable films.
 The special effects team demonstrates their mastery throughout the duration of the movie. Forrest is embedded into numerous video clips that display monumental moments in history and include some of the most iconic figures of the 60s and 70s. Forrest can be seen shaking hands with John F. Kennedy, showing his gun shot wound to Lyndon Johnson, and discovering the Watergate scandal during Richard Nixon's presidency. He also appears on a TV show with John Lennon. These edited videos provide laughs for the entire audience in addition to making the film very memorable by relating Forrest's life to what actually happened in real life. The editors and producers don't only excel in planting Forrest in the middle of history changing moments, but demonstrate their excellence while depicting events of the Vietnam war. The movie is able to accurately portray the scene in Vietnam with huge explosions and gunfire, as well as adding in rain that goes sideways or even seems like it's rising up. The scenes of the war are able to show men getting blown up, bleeding out, and losing their limbs. The effects team was also able to demonstrate their ability while creating the very first scene of the movie. The screen opens up and follows a feather making abrupt movements, wandering about in the air. Although it may sound simple, complicated movements in the background are also completed, and the entire surrounding area is painted by following the feather around. The scene also provides a brilliant metaphor for Forrest's life. Like a feather, Forrest goes through life without a care in the world for his future actions but makes it through without any harm. The movie is told with brilliant storytelling and visual imagery(don't forget about the top-notch soundtrack too), but is set apart by its valuable lessons.
 Forrest Gump is one of the greatest teaching movies. Since Forrest has a really low IQ and comprehension of basic topics, many of the life lessons are simple and easy to understand. Even though the words of wisdom Forrest provides seem very basic, they effectively make the audience rethink their understanding life. For example, as Forrest making his famous run across the country, he tells the audience how it is necessary to get over your past before you can move forward. Even for a successful man like Forrest, he needed to get over the past tragedies of his life like losing his best friend Bubba in war, his mother dying of cancer, and losing his childhood love Jenny. The value of true friendship is also demonstrated as Forrest gives the half of the profit from his multimillion-dollar shrimping business to Bubba's family since he wanted to keep his promise of sharing the profits. Forrest's journey also teaches the audience that sometimes the best we can do is to just try our best and hope everything works out in the end. No matter what, he always supported Jenny even though she put him through a lot of emotional trauma. In the end, their childhood romance is completed as they get married and Forrest becomes a father. Forrest's adventure is filled with models for how one should live their life, like finding what you truly love and being able to do that. What got him places in the first place was running, which allowed him to go to college so he could play football. After becoming a successful player, he became a war hero due to his ability to run. One of the most important things that stemmed from his love of running was when he got famous during his trips across America, which led him back to the love of his life Jenny. Although very unrealistic, it teaches the audience that sticking through the tough times and always working hard will result in a better outcome than what you started at. Forrest's success can only be attributed to those simple lessons Forrest was taught by his mother as a kid growing up.
 The effective storytelling of Forrest's journey makes Forrest Gump of the most memorable films. Filled with comedy, drama, and action, the movie surpasses expectations for storytelling as well as the visual effects elevating the film to a higher level. The movie effectively provides support for its audience, advising them how they can get through life successfully even if they start from the back of the pack like Forrest. These three aspects are just a few of the reasons why Forrest Gump is one of the most iconic movies and why it won six Academy Awards. Even if you are not old enough to relate to the events of the film, it serves as one of the most enjoyable and iconic movies ever created. Forrest's journey provides the basis for what a movie should be, and what film directors should aspire to make."

","This is the first tom hanks movie i saw. I was a fan after that. Dialouges like ""run forest run"" and ""stupid is as stupid does "" are still very fresh in my mind. 
The story is very much entertaining yet informative .
You fall in love with forest gump the character but still feel sad for him.
It teaches many things but what i learned is that true love is about making others happy not about being greedy and self centered ."

","This is a title that never gets boring and always makes you want to come home by the bayou to settle down. It shows you the ups and downs of friendship, how to nurture a childhood romance through space and time, and the simplistic advantage of just doing something without overthinking it. This movie is great for those who may be experiencing a transition in life and working to regain their footing. The family values presented in this movie help you realize how important it is to have a open door communication policy to communicating with different types of people without judgment.

"ryanwmullally","8","1","1","30 September 2018"," An Outstanding Achievement
","Forrest Gump is a charming work of art by Robert Zemekis, starring Tom Hanks in one of his best and memorable performances as Forrest Gump. You need to watch this film closely to truly appreciate and understand it. It has a nice message, but has a lot of humour to entertain you.<br/><br/>The story is about an man in Alabama named Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), who has been told his entire life that he's dumb, stupid, and can't do anything right. But he dosen't care what they say, and shows them what he can do. And Forrest Gump achieves many things in life throughout history, he met three presidents, and became a war hero for his combat in Vietnam. But, out of all the things he accomplished, the only thing he truly cares about is a girl named Jenny, which he has loved since they were kids. They both have different lives, he become a Vietnam war-hero, while she protests the war, but dosen't seem to keep their romance separate.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant story, funny and very emotional that tells you to don't care what anyone says and accomplish the impossible, because if Forrest Gump can do it, so can we."

","I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness."

","Watched many times and although nearly 25 years later it might be look a bit dusty now and the 90s CGI not as advanced as it is now, but is one of the greatest movies and one of the finest performances of Tom Hanks. Loved the narration and the interactions with various famous people , although again some of the CGI is dated. Favorite period in the movie for me was the Vietnam section. Its a long haul movie at 2 hours 20 minutes. I never really got the message that although he had the low IQ he achieved so much in his life. Quite the contradiction. He even comes across as autistic. Still a great classic 90s movie."

","Ah, so many references to this movie, either from comedy shows or in real life. Forrest Gump is a great movie, I love it when you get introduced to this one person's life from inside out and are allowed to see all of its futileness. At that one moment you realize how the smallest of things are the most important and how life can be lived like a feather, floating up in the air.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump lives through war, joy, suffering, but he stays human, he loves and hates, but more loves, till the end of the film. Making the protagonist disabled makes him even more vulnerable a character that more of us can relate to. Because even though most of us aren't disabled physically, we all suffer from time to time. <br/><br/>I love one sequence that really stuck with me here. That is when Forrest runs, everyone comes, asks for a cause and joins him. Forrest does not have a reason to run - life just goes on, and he simply has to do something to live, and to feel alive - Forrest runs, as he used to in the childhood. Forrest's dream is only this girl called Jenny, again, something very simple, just a man in love. But in this simplicity, one finds the beauty of existence. Which only appears when a person spreads life around, spreads kindness and existence."

"avanjit-20257","9","1","1","17 August 2018"," Movie for a lifetime
","Well first of all shout-out to Tom Hanks for making the fiction look real and owning his character. Second if this movie was a project which I think it was then let me just say that it had the best arrangements that I have ever come across in my life. To second that thought I'd say this was the right movie for the director Zemeckis to prove that even a cash cow director could bewilder fans with his movie magic.
Now about the movie, a normal person would say that this movie has got sadness, comedy, seriousness and a load of other stuff which makes a perfect blend.
But I'm sorry as I have sincerely watched this movie and found out a couple more things than just genre-defying components. To start with this movie revolves around the central character and the central character holds dear to himself a few other characters so the movie also includes extra screen time for them, now the reason I have mentioned this fact is to make you realize that this is not about a person who has lived an extra-ordinary life and has changed the world with his feats, but quite the opposite. It is instead a movie about a simple honest man who has been around only a few people his whole lifetime and although of his non-credited contributions to the society he still remains intact with his loved ones. This creates a lot a way for the movie to be so mesmerizing but in the same time also be so sweet. End of story."

"cole-22948","10","1","1","25 July 2018"," Forest Gump movie is about a young man by the name of Forest Gump who did not allow is disability to limit him from doing anything in life.
","Forest Gump movie is about a young man by the name of Forest Gump who did not allow is disability to limit him from doing anything in life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star and fighting in Vietnam. The main characters in the movie is Forrest Gump played by Tom Hanks, Mrs. Gump played by Sally Field, and Jenny Curran played by Robin Wright. 
Forest Gump was raised in the 1950's in Alabama by his single mother Mrs. Gump. Forrest who appears different from other children has to fend for himself and has gone through a lot of bullying throughout school, and also adult hood. Forrest was born with strong legs but a crooked spine, and as a result was required to wear leg braces which made walking very challenging for him to do. Forrest had a low IQ level of 75 that almost prevented him from getting accepted in school. Forrest mom who is his biggest support will do anything for Forrest by any means. Even if she had to sleep with the principal to get Forrest accepted in school, which she did. Mrs. Gump always remind Forrest not to let anyone tell him he was different growing up. Forrest also, had another supporter Jenny Curran, who was also Forrest biggest supporter. She always stuck up for Forrest whenever other children bullied him and also tells him to run from his bullies. Due to this, Forrest was able to run out of his leg braces and became a very fast runner. In fact, Forrest got accepted on the football team due to how fast he was at running. <br/><br/>There are many themes that can be taken away from the film, but the biggest one you can see throughout the movie is Love. Forrest was so in love with Jenny from they were kids to adult. However, Jenny was blinded by the love that Forrest had for her. ""The love that Forrest had for Jenny reminded me of the movie ""The Cider House Rules"" where Homer was infatuated with Candy. Jenny more gravitated to abusive men because she was molested by her father as a child. As a result, she starts doing playboy and taking drug substance. Despite Jenny's horrible lifestyle, Forrest never gave up hope on her, as well as his love for her. In fact, he married Jenny in a scene at the end of the movie where she came back sick from an uncured illness and fathered their son he met for the first time. The son was supposedly conceived from a onetime love making they had before she had fled.<br/><br/>The cinematography places and moves the camera around the characters to outline the power and significance the historical events have in influencing Forrest's life. You can see a lot of close up shots throughout the film. Such as the scene when Forrest was in the army. Many close-up shots were used to show the dirt, blood and scars on Forrest from the war. You can also find a symbol used in the movie which is the feather from the first scene. It shows a significant meaning to Forrest life. The feather plays a role as a motif through the story, alluding to how Forrest's life forms randomly, and his innocence as well as sadness stays with him as he travels down many different roads. <br/><br/>In spite of Forrest's challenges has a child, he did not let it defined what people say he cannot do. Forrest proved these people wrong by finishing high school and going to college. In addition to, playing college football, fighting in the Vietnam war and having normal feelings for a woman whom he loved that he married for one year until she died."

"El-Dod","8","1","1","14 July 2018"," Forrest Gump!
","Tom Hanks was superb you can't really differentiate him from the character of Forrest Gump. The story is unique and the direction was good. The movie's music wasn't helpful at all could have added more greatness to the scenes. The rhythm of the movie slowed at some parts and was quick at others but the only thing that bothers is that a character like Forrest after all of that could have been used better and had better situations and more effective and I really thought of it as a great performance by Hanks although I don't feel most of the scenes were the ones that could show us the character and make it way more epic but you will be taken by hank's performance which was the spine of the movie. His love Jenny I suppose wasn't that serious character that fits to guide him or help him and should have been another character that makes that great effect in his life. The telling of the story and camera movements were absolutely gorgeous and Robert Zemeckis did a great job in it along side with the scenario which reflected the characters so well.In the end a great movie! 8.5/10"

","This is a beautiful movie. The main character has a mild mental disorder, but he's never made to look like a joke for it. He's portrayed with respect and complexity. And the positive message of the movie is never about him ""overcoming"" his disability in a way that's condescending to disabled people. He lives with it and faces issues that a lot of people can relate to regarding loss, love, family, and responsibility. It's an inspiring film about making sense of life and moving on despite hardships without dwelling in the past. <br/><br/>And there is profound truth to the quote: ""I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both."" I take that to mean we're all ultimately free to give our own meaning and purpose to the random things that seem to always happen in our lives. <br/><br/>This is a beautiful, inspiring movie and certainly one of the best. Great story, great characters, great message."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Tom Hanks. The movie follows Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, a mentally challenged man as a child to an adult. The story begins with Forrest telling his story to random strangers at a bus stop.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an entertaining movie. The movie's pacing is incredibly quick and there is never a dull moment. It is astonishing to see so much of Forrest's life displayed on the screen. Each stage of Forrest's life has its own struggles and stories contributes so well to Forrest's story. A lot of this is because Robert Zemeckis' fine direction and Tom Hanks' engagement into his character. Tom Hanks narrates all of the flashbacks and often times narration does not offer much over the visuals; here in the scenes, Forrest's narration helps keep the scenes engaging. A lot of this is also helped by the pacing which keeps every stage fresh.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump follows many small stories from Forrest's youth with his inability to run to his time in the Vietnam War. All of these stories have meaning to Forrest and because of this the movie can stand on this alone. Forrest's first story with his inability to walk properly helps the audience get behind Forrest's struggles. It becomes easy to root for Forrest after seeing him overcome his disability. This continues throughout the movie and the story does touch on some surprising emotional notes.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump has a great soundtrack. Each period of time has period appropriate music and the movie absolutely benefits as a result.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is highly recommended. The movie is a complete package with wonderful directing and an excellent lead actor. This movie has something for everyone to enjoy in it like a box of chocolates.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

I also found the film overlong with possibly too much information crammed into it. The visual effects were very good, especially the war scenes.

Dan tells Forrest that when he's a shrimp boat captain that's the day he'll be an astronaut. Then, at the wedding between Forrest and Jenny he shows up with his magic legs, just like they use on the space shuttle. <br/><br/>For so much of the movie the viewer thinks Forrest to be oblivious to his mental shortfalls but he gives those little pieces of himself that let you know he's fully aware. When he sees Jenny and little Forrest and he's so worried Forrest is going to be like him is freakin' perfect. And then to find out Kurt Russell is the unaccredited voice of Elvis is just great. <br/><br/>The movie is almost schmaltzy but it's just so well done it can get away with it.

","A Masterpiece in every way. It reminds me of my rises and falls in my life and just seeing how resilient Forrest Gump became was really inspiring. He had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability to contribute to society. He did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go as far as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise. The promises that Forrest made to his mother, Bubba, Jenny and Lieutenant Dan were all kept. His love, passion, drive and spiritual understanding were all unconditional. What an amazing movie."

The characters are unique and genuine. The story flows with ease.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Tom Hanks performs exceptionally well. Robin Wright also performs well. Sally Fields and Gary Sinise both perform with power and presence.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is a little overlong.<br/><br/>One thing I don't like about the film is how Wright's character takes advantage of Forrest so many times and yet, at the end, we are supposed to feel bad for her.<br/><br/>Pros: Uplifting yet sad story, unique characters, amazing acting, and some really powerful scenes<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and how we are supposed to feel bad for Wright's character even though she is a scumbag <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.7"

","It has one of the best screenplay, storyline, acting, direction,casting. Tom hanks was at his prime as he won an oscar again next year. All the cast delivers and fulfils the character's requirements. But it actually promotes the value of giving up and run away. Run away is the main highlight of movie. The character's girlfriend tells him to run whenever he faces a problem. Thats a wrong thing according to me, as it promotes giving up. I won't support it.
But one can watch the movie for a good story, acting and screenplay."

The first two times were done in my childhood, and I really do not fully understand the movie, maybe never, maybe already. The third time was done when I was bewildered and helpless about my future. I failed an exam which I had prepared for a long time, and I literally lost my direction. Graduation draws near, and I don't know, and am afraid of, my future. However, spending 2 hours with Gump, I was spared of anxiety for that 2 hours. It makes me relieved and figure out what I should do.

Seeing it for just a few seconds makes you stick to the screen till the end-music stops. The dialogues are perfect, the timing is as a swiss watch, the story-twists are more than one could imagine, and the setting in the enduring storyline of the 60's, 70's and 80's of last century, placing the movie inside the main events of that era, just gives you the idea that this almost could be a real-life story.

The rewatchability is high. I have watched it several times now and still not getting bored. Each view presents different perspective of the movie.
Tom Hanks' acting is brilliant, it is not easy to act as a mentally-challenged person yet he did it fantastically.
A big part of the movie tries present the cultural history of the US, and this might be hard to pull off yet Robert Zemeckis is able to. 
But for me, there is an underlying dark undertone somewhere in the relationship between Forrest and the other characters, but Zemeckis' portrayal of Forrest's personality brilliantly covers it up.<br/><br/>A movie I would recommend to everyone old enough to watch."

"FallenEye","8","1","1","25 February 2018"," The ForrestShank ReGumption.
","I'll start like this; Do you want to know how it's possible to in fact consider The Shawshank Redemption as an eternal classic? Well, because The Shawshank Redemption is without question, a superior film to Forrest Gump, and the funny thing is, Forrest Gump is truly an amazing film. That's how you can tell how amazing The Shawshank Redemption was, because it is better than another amazing, super amazing film.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump was released over 20 years ago, and this is the first time I finally got to watch, finally got to see the film who's shadow The Shawshank Redemption lived under, and what an entertaining and stunning watch it was, however, I just can't get over how this film took away all the spotlight from well, TSR.<br/><br/>I guess I'm reviewing both movies in one here, because they are two films which are so worthy, while one, though received multiple Oscar Nominations, was unjustly ignored, and I'm just not able to do so while watching Forrest Gump, but in the same breath, I sincerely don't blame Forrest Gump either, because like I've been saying, it is a fantastic film.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is what happens when you just don't overthink anything, while still maintaining a pure heart. The man just, did. No words, all actions. No analyzing, just commitment. Sure perhaps, there may have been some luck, however, because of how Forrest went about his life, luck was neither here nor there, and on top of that, though he may have been lucky, he also did experience immense and intense heartbreak, and that, perhaps makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Sivestri and Zemeckis were in the zone, and that is the best way I can put it. The visual effects, especially for that time were superb. The action bits, in such a drama driven movie were so well positioned and the way this film was tying into the past and the future was appropriately humorous.<br/><br/>The relationship between him and Jenny is such a beautiful tragedy. A happily ever after between the two of them would've just ruined this film, and that sucks, because damn it, Gump deserved better than her, but we also wanted him to be with her because well; ""Forrest, I'll always be your girl"". Also, the way Zemeckis told the story, allowed for Jenny's childhood story to come through for her, and explain to us that, Jenny was lost, broken and stuck, held prisoner by her past. Without having to be graphic about it, or delve way to deep into it, we knew that Jenny's heart was bleeding, long before she knew it was, and so knowing that, though Forrest may have deserved better, she deserved him. That is so weird and beautiful and just absolutely tragic.<br/><br/>The Shawshank Redemption is better, however, Forrest Gump is not worse. 8.4/10."

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","1","23 January 2018"," Nostalgia and fairy tale
","This film is admirable because of the actor who is playing the part of a ""dummy,"" an ""idiot,"" a ""mentally handicapped person."" Tom Hanks is so natural in his acting that he really looks the part.<br/><br/>Apart from that the film is the most typical American dream fairy tale you can imagine, though often going against politically correct ideas, like the mother (and there is no father) going into fornication with the principal of the school of the town in order to have her son registered in a ""normal"" school instead of a ""special"" school, though he is just a couple of points under the minimum IQ required. <br/><br/>The miracle of his running performance is just what it is a fairy tale miracle that makes him, after having been a ""spastics"" child for years a champion runner one afternoon to escape bullies on bicycles and later on again the same bullies, but who care who they are, this time in an automobile vehicle, in fact a pick-up truck. Good boy indeed. He will become a football champion. He will go to college on a sports scholarship, will make a career there and get a degree. He will enlist in the army straight away and will go to Vietnam where he will, thanks to his limited intellect and his running capability, save four or five wounded GIs just before they are levelled into the soil by a friendly bombing of the area where they got wounded. He will get a congressional Medal of Honor for this fact. He will get wounded in the bottom and as such will be sent to a hospital where he will learn how to become the best ping-pong player ever, a skill that is just physical and in no way intellectual. <br/><br/>After being discharged he will hold his promise to Baba, his best black friend in the army who unluckily got killed in Vietnam and he will start a shrimp fishing business with the money some ping pong racket producer paid him in order to use his name and picture to promote their products. His old lieutenant from Vietnam, whose life he saved on the day when he saved four or five GIs, one of them being his lieutenant, kept his word too and became his partner, though he was legless. A storm destroys the shrimp fishing industry in Alabama and Forrest Gump's ship is the only one to survive the storm. As such now, without any competition, he starts booming. His partner invests the money intelligently, in some apple business, and they both become millionaires. Forrest Gump can retire or so from active life since he gets a very wealthy and comfortable income that counts in millions every year.<br/><br/>He can do what he wants and thus he runs around the USA, across and across again for more than three years when he is summoned by his old school girlfriend Jenny in some place somewhere in fairy land. He had had one and only sexual episode of intercourse some time before she left him again several years ago, one more time going away, one more time abandoning him, one more time departure for hippy life or whatever marginal adventure of drugs, alcohol and promiscuity. She introduces him to her being sick, in fact dying within months, and to his son, Forrest Junior who is about five and is not mentally or intellectually challenged. He takes them home and he buries her as soon as she dies. He then assumes the new role of his life, in his life, the role of father. <br/><br/>I told you it was a fairy tale. <br/><br/>Of course it is highly improbable a mentally and intellectually limited person can do all that and succeed so well, except if you consider you have to be mentally and intellectually challenged to be successful in American capitalism. But dreaming is a good thing. Dreaming that the President of the USA is intellectually challenged. That would be a good idea right now in 2018. Dreaming that this American society is managed by a capitalist system that is itself managed by such luminaries of imbecility. No future indeed. Dreaming that all American wars will be defeats and will end in some soft inhumanity. There you can dream over and over again: that is not going to happen. All American defeats will be in pain and blood, both foreign blood, mostly, and American blood, especially the blood of drones. <br/><br/>But well, it is a nostalgic trip to those days of the 1950s and an allusion to the integration of the school and university system; the 1960s with Black Panthers and some allusion to Woodstock; the 1970s and some allusion to the Watergate Scandal; and the early 1980s and some allusion to the assassination attempt against Reagan echoing the successful assassinations against J.F. Kennedy and his ""little brother,"" though Martin Luther King's assassination is not alluded to. Memory and Nostalgia Lane is still the yellow brick road of some other older fairy tale.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
"seveb-25179","4","1","1","22 January 2018"," A Forrest of complete Gump
","Everyone loves this movie... except me.
Somehow I find the contrast between the unsophisticated, often rather juvenile, style of humour, which is juxtaposed with issues like physical handicap, child molestation, mutilation from war, death from war and cancer, jarring and uncomfortable.
For me I would consider the type of broad acting in this film was fine if it were a pure comedy, such as ""Ground Hog Day"", but in this context, where serious issues are supposedly being addressed, it lacks the necessary degree of subtlety (or respect).
Tom Hanks performance is wonderful, but still essentially cartoonish, like Gomer Pyle. I don't at any time buy into his portrayal as a credible mentally challenged person. (As, for example, I was able to do with Dustin Hoffman in Rain-man)
I guess the Director's concept was for us to view the events from what is intended to be Forrest's limited perspective, but for me it doesn't work.
It's told as a fairy-tale, but personally I'm just not comfortable with many of these topics being dealt with in such a shallow fashion. Hitchcock knew how to mix humour with suspense, but it's not an easy trick to pull off, this film tries to mix tragedy with comedy and I find it an unpleasant mixture.
In the world where little girls are sexually molested by their fathers and young men have their legs amputated after being caught by an exploding shells, crippled kids don't become All American running backs (although they may become gold medal blade runners at the Paralympics!) and intellectually handicapped people don't become Shrimp magnates.
Don't get me wrong, I've nothing against a good fairy-tale, but I suspect this movie aspires to be allegorical and profound as well, which it is not.
The movie packs in so many traumatic situations that it fails to do any of them justice, and then casually throws historical ones in on top
The assassination of the Kennedys and John Lennon, along with attempts on George Wallis and Gerald Ford are mentioned, although Forrest is not present for any of them and doesn't strike me as a person who has any political awareness or would take notice of current events.
(However Martin Luthor King and Malcolm X are spared inclusion.)
The frequent use of familiar pop music from the period is another cheap trick to engage the emotions of the audience without doing the work. Much of the music has little or no connection to the story and even less to the character of Forrest, who has no interest, understanding, or emotional connection with the pop culture of the day.
Forrest is strangely detached from the World around him, and probably that's the intention?
But in that case what relevance or insight can his character have to the events through which he wanders?
I'm sure this story is intended to be very deep and meaningful, but really, Forrest Gump could as easily have been set in the 1920s, 30s or 40s for all the relevance or insight he brings to 50s, 60s, 70s culture.
The part of the movie where Forrest runs across country invites comparison to Peter Sellars character in ""Being There"", a holy fool, but FG lacks the depth of that movie, and in any case only has five minutes to spare on this topic before moving on again.
There is some tenuous and weak humour involving ""Sh*t Happens"" and smiley face tee shirts, but no actual words of ambiguous wisdom that might account for his following.
The film continues to throw issues and situations at us, like so many custard pies, hoping some will stick, but most end up being only half baked. (How do you like them mixed metaphors!)
The Apple shares bit is pure product placement, Forrest was already as rich as they want to make him via the Shrimp company.
And why would anyone offer the multimillion dollar owner of a Shrimp company a job mowing lawns?
Then we get not one, but two, tragic deaths by disease to weep about, first Mom from the big ""C"" and then ""me own me sporting Jenny"" from a cause never made clear.
Jenny only brings Forrest back into her life because she is dying, not because she loves him enough to want to share her life and their child with him. How is that inspirational?
Good things come to those who wait? The meek shall inherit the earth? 
The secret to true happiness is low expectations?
Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get (chocolate maybe?)
Chocolate Happens."

","Despite how it might sound counter-intuitive, this movie was an excellent mix of comedy and drama intertwined. Suspension of disbelief is needed, but I was very willing to go along with it. I did find Jenny to not be a very likable character (though I did pity her downfall), and some scenes were somewhat confusing for me as a child and still confusing today (to a lesser extent), but they didn't ruin the overall enjoyability of the film."

An ever-present throughout a variety of America's most defining moments in history, Forrest's story captures major events such as the Kennedy assassination, the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War, to name but a few. Forrest's own personal journey intertwines these moments in time, forever bound to his beloved childhood sweatheart, Jenny. <br/><br/>This story of innocence captures the imagination and will be remembered long after its first viewing. The story is told with care and consideration by director Robert Zemekis, who captures fantastic performances from all his cast members, including a fiesty yet friendly Sally Field. <br/><br/>A fantastic film with a feel-good centre, this is one that should be broadcast far and wide, and shown on repeat for good measure."

The subtle nuances of Forrest Gump's life totally flew over my head as a child. Seeing this movie as an adult is almost like seeing it for the first time again. I understood and felt for Forrest's mother within the first 2 minutes & learned to love Lt. Dan on New Years. I won't spoil much but in that moment on New Years eve, i believe we got our first glance into how aware Forrest actually is & it's heartbreaking to see him go through that scene but heartwarming to see Lt. Dan stand up for his friend. This movie deserves a 200 page essay on it's greatness so any review will never do it justice.

","The life of one man intersects through several pivotal and troubling moments of American history. Welcome to the very interesting life of ""Forrest Gump.""<br/><br/>Playing the extremely likeable, title character is Tom Hanks.

Despite the mental and physical handicaps, Hanks is blessed with great strength and speed; and a warm and generous heart that will always lead him to where he needs to be. His God given talents and the love of his life (played by Robin Wright) will see him through school bullies, the Civil Rights march, college, the Vietnam War and the protest against it, the loss of loved ones, and a floundering business venture. This simple yet extraordinary man will seek his destiny as he goes through life, not knowing that he already fulfills it time and again since he was a child.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Forrest Gump"" is the part when Hanks uses his speed and strength to rescue wounded members of his platoon during an ambush in Vietnam.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" deserves its place as one of the movies that should be watched before you kick the bucket.

"bibianafinkler","9","1","1","22 December 2017"," Forrest Gump: a different hero
","If you want to understand Forrest Gump, you have to pay attention to all of the movie's characteristics. This wonderful film, directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a great cast on all levels, creating a perfect atmosphere to describe the journey of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks). It shows - in a singular way - significant historical and political events (such as the Vietnam War), cultural movements (like the hippies in the 70's) or important figures (such as Elvis Presley) to American history and culture.<br/><br/>In the first scene, you could ask yourself: who is this guy? What would make this movie's story different from others? Well, you will see the world through the eyes of a mentally challenged man who has a different perception of life, people and love: Forrest is a pure heart. Because of him, we see an idealized vision of Earth that ignores grim social realities. However, at the same time, we realize that his perception of life has a powerful message: how evil and complex our society can be. It is not only about a different hero. If you are waiting for a conventional life story that does not require that you think outside the box, I would suggest another type of plot.<br/><br/>The way that Forrest sees the world is a way of softening the strong American reality of Vietnam War, the oppressive educational system, and the prejudiced society which still exists and echoes nowadays. This happens in the Washington speech scene, when Forrest said: ""Sometimes when people go to Vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. Sometimes they don't go home at all. That's a bad thing. That's all I have to say."" Unfortunately, the microphones were turned off when he was speaking these words. Other moments also call our attention to important points or personalities of American culture. For example, one of the running scenes, in which a prison chain gang works as a background to Forrest's adventures and he inspires John Lennon to compose ""Imagine"" based on his point of view of China.<br/><br/>This modern fable, full of a singular, direct and true simplicity of a man and his memories will keep you on the edge of seat. Forrest Gump needs to be seen between the lines. In the first moments you will not believe in his pure heart. However, it makes all the difference when we are watching this movie. 
If life is a box of chocolates that you never know what you are gonna get, you will not be disappointed with his stories and all the meanings expressed by this movie through photography, soundtrack, visual effects, easter eggs etc. <br/><br/>Besides all that, the film won, in 1995, six Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director (for Robert Zemeckis), Best Actor (for Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay (for Eric Roth), Best Film Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It should be seen by everyone. A classic movie, due to its technical production and its messages to the viewer. I truly recommended it."

","Forrest Gump is a wonderful film that has all the essence of 90's masterpiece. From the delightful chimes by Alan Silvestri to the marvelous performance from Tom Hanks. Every time I catch the film, it has me settled and glued."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","5 December 2017"," Forrest Gump is not just heartwarming, it is a triumphant cinematic work of art with Tom Hanks exercising the role of his career
","Calling Forrest Gump may be saying a lot, but there is nearly impossible to deny the astounding talent roaring in front and behind the camera. Robert Zemeckis, a filmmaker with a heavenly gift of storytelling, take his talent to the fullest extent with this heartwarming, charm-fueled tale focuses on the eponymous fighting to find his place in the complex world many people struggle to understand. This movie, unraveled from the pages of the screenplay by Eric Roth, lightens the flame with cinematic mastery with storytelling that blends landmark American history with a timeless tale of a misunderstood man with the heart of gold. When you are supposed laugh, you will laugh. When you are supposed to cry, your eyes will get soaked; and that is only half of the beauty that makes this adaptation of Winston Groom's novel of the same name a triumphant piece of cinematic glitter. So this film stars Oscar- winner Tom Hanks as, yours truly, Forrest Gump, a forty-something year old Alabama man who suffers a low IQ but nonetheless carries a gentle soul. Providing the framework of the story is Forrest sitting on the park bench as he tells his story to various individuals of his life from his childhood, to his adult life where he caught in the middle of America's landmark moments including the meeting with President John F. Kennedy, to his tour in Vietnam where he forms friendship with his squadmate Lieutenant Dan (played by Gary Sinise), to the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. While caught up a series of political unrest that ran rampant during the 60s and 70s, he finds himself distracted in his pursue for his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) who's life is in shambles, while reflecting his life choices all of the wisdom of his mother (played by Sally Field). <br/><br/>This movie never takes its chances to pull at our heart strings for granted, but never does so in a way that feels hammy or exploitative. It is a film with that almost always has its heart in the right place while gently feeding you the message of in the world full of darkness and despair, there is always an underlining humanity resting somewhere within. Forrest in particular, wins our hearts with his heartwarming personality as he ventures through key moments in America's history while refusing the let go of the woman dear to his heart. Each scene following Forrest in the midst of the political tension including the Vietnam War, the ill-fated JFK administration is handled with maturity with an underlining dose of snappy charm. Flowing with an uproar of social commentary without slapping the story with a bias agenda, it is satisfying to see Robert Zemeckis prevail his effort in balancing a compelling story with a sweet batch of swift history lessons. Of course, the romantic drama is the brighter star in the story. The separation between him and Jenny transpires to moments of both bittersweet and melancholy, and the emotional chemistry really grabs at the heart, especially in the beginning when we get a sad inside look at her childhood at the hands of her abusive father. And thanks to Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, the romantic affinity between them works gracefully. Robin Wright plays her role with plenty of humility to prove her talent as an actress. However, this comes less of a surprise than Tom Hanks who tackles on what may be the most triumphant role of his career. Hanks plays the title character, a man with a mental disability that requires a kind of performance that could have easily come off as mawkish and ham-fisted. Luckily for a talented actor he is, his performance is blisteringly top-notch with moments that effectively show the down-to-earth nature of his character. He is the ultimate reason why his chemistry with not only Robin Wright, but his friend Gary Sinise as the well-acted Lieutenant Dan works well. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a triumphant slice of cinematic art blooming with a a career-defining performance by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis working at his prime with a cinematic piece that is simply timeless, if not a masterpiece. For a movie that was predicted to be a critical and commercial by many prior to its release, it is definitely one hell of a sleep hit. I guess it comes to show that Forrest's mother was right when she said ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."""
"jessexisland","10","1","1","30 November 2017"," Epic movie
","Epic in scope and triumphant in spirit, Forrest Gump is a larger- than-life piece of film-making, that scored home an impressive 6 Oscars in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role. It revolves around the eventful and remarkable life of a mentally, and for some time physically challenged man, who looks at the world through very unique and innocent eyes, as he becomes part of some of the key events that shaped America as a nation. Famous historical figures like Elvis, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and John Lennon, are just some of the people that he encounters on his grand and amazing journey. Director Robert Zemeckis is a magician behind the camera, delivering world-class visual story-telling that truly captures the heart and mind in really spell-binding ways. So much love and passion have gone into its making, and it's one of those rare cinematic miracles, where all parties involved have dedicated themselves fully to create the best experience possible. Ascended by a beautifully orchestrated music score (together with some great classics from the eras it portrays), it hits all the right notes at all the right moments. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll maybe even feel inspired. For there's nothing in this tour-de-force of a film that isn't absolutely stirring. It's been almost 20 years since its release now, yet the special effects still hold and look as fantastic as ever. They way they've integrated Forrest into real historical footage, is incredibly well- done and nearly seamless in its crafting. Some things even look more convincing than the wizardry of modern features. However visually compelling it may be though, it's in the acting where it truly dazzles. Tom Hanks' sensational, award-winning performance, is definitely one of the best, if not the greatest of feat his entire career. I would say it stands between this and his heart-gripping turn as an AIDS victim in Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia. You certainly can't complain about the supporting cast either. Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson, evoke tremendous pathos and sympathy, with their exceptionally written and terrifically acted characters. Michael Conner Humphreys is really wonderful as well, as Forrest in his younger years. Cynics may have issues with how far-fetched the story is, but I don't think it matters much in the larger perspective. I'm more than willing to suspend all disbelief, for such a majestically conceived and viscerally powerful piece of drama. And I'm sure that goes for a lot of us. A movie about love, loss, war and human behavior. About discovering your inner potential and overcoming your limitations, even when everything seems against you and absent of hope. For within Forrest Gump dwells a ray of pure inspiration, with the message that life is what you make of it. We may not all come to shake hands with the President or amount to champions in ping-pong, but we all possess the power to make the best of what we have. Timeless, magical, moving and uplifting, this movie is a celebration of all that and more!"
"Josh_The_Critic","9","1","1","20 November 2017"," Deserving as a Best Picture Winner?
","Is this movie worthy of being the best film of 1996? Well, I have not seen The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction yet, though I definitely plan to see them eventually. I, myself love history and the fact that Forrest Gump is scene throughout history can be pretty funny. I love that he is but into real footage of real events or is watching even just simply watching them happen. One of my favorite scenes is when he is making a speech after the Vietnam War happened. Forrest Gump is very innocent and doesn't know what the rally was for. That's what makes Tom Hanks' character so great; he's just super likable! The score is worth noting as really good too. When Jenny comes through that water calling Forrest's name is just a nice moment...then she has to leave again...and again. Not that that's an issue, because that in fact helps the film keep moving. My one problem here is surprisingly the symbolism...a lot of people may disagree with me here. I like the symbolism, but when Forrest narrates what the symbolism is it feels very blatant and doesn't let us think much. A lot of stuff would've been much better without words, and I think would've risen my score a lot. The cinematography is, of course, outstanding. The U.S. as some great shots like the speech shot and his running shots but the most interesting one to me was Vietnam. It had such diverse colors that made the war scenes better than they already are. Lastly, it had a great story and plot, making it a story that would make you wanting to come back for more. I give this movie a: 9.3/10=9/10 overall"

","Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone must watch as it reveals an accurate chronology of all the important events in the history of the United States. A good knowledge of American History helps to identify profound ideas that further strengthen the audiences idea of the movie. The story plot is developed through a series of life lessons that changes the character into being a more responsible and mature adult. The Story revolves around Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) who is often bullied for his leg brace and his egregiousness in society. This compassionate young boy falls in love with Jenny(Robin Wright) from a very young age. One of the key points in the movie is when Forrest joins the military where the director(Robert Zemeckis)accurately portrays the mixed feelings everyone had about the Vietnam war and the consequent events that pursued after it such as the Watergate Scandal. The movie teaches a lot about the essence of American History and the events that have shaped modern society today. The story depicts an accurate representation of the rural setting and the challenges that each character had to face due to their background, identity and ethnicity. Overall, the movie is a must watch for every American and those who wish to learn the importance of American history and its implication on their lives today."

"rkhood-36802","9","1","1","5 November 2017"," Forrest Gump review - genre, quotability, special effects, acting
","The movie Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, released in 1994, is a highly awarded movie, though despite its praise it wrongfully only received a 71% rating on rotten tomatoes. This movie takes place mainly in Alabama between 1944 through 1982. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man with an IQ of 75. Despite Forrest's low intelligence, he's able to overcome that by being apart of many historical events. The movie shows pieces of these events such as Elvis Presley's appearance on TV, John F. Kennedy's murder, George Wallace's murder, the Vietnam war, hippie culture, the moon landing, John Lennon's murder, the aids breakout of 1981, and many other historical events that took place from 1944 to 1982. This movie is loved by many as it can appeal to a wide range of people with the use of genres, its quotability, the advanced editing, and the amazing acting by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>While many movies will fall under the genre categories of comedy, action, romance, etc., Forrest Gump doesn't have just one set genre. Forrest Gump includes many aspects from different genres making it appeal to a wider range of people. It includes genres such as epic, action, drama, romance, and comedy. According to stardust, ""the statistics portal"", ""Films within the comedy, adventure, action and drama movie genres generated the most box office revenue"". Creating a film the falls under the four most popular genres is incredibly smart because it is likely the film will have something in it to appeal to nearly everyone. One main point this movie shows is that someone can make a difference no matter who they are or what their intelligence level is. It's important that this point doesn't just discuss one type of person but that anyone, no matter who they are or their intelligence is can make a difference.<br/><br/>Since this movie has been released it has been quoted in daily conversations, thanks to the amazing writing done by Winston Groom. It has also been referenced in more movies and TV shows than I can count. One of the most quoted lines from the movie would be, ""My mama always said, 'Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.'""-Forrest. This quote was voted as the #40 movie quote by the American Film Institute. I think this quote really stood out as everyone knows life is a mystery. Even if you think you've planned everything things are going to come around and change that. Although Forrest didn't really have his life all planned out many things came about that quickly changed his course. He was simply handed a flyer to apply for the U.S army, which immediately led to a scene of him finding a seat on the bus that took them there. Having been given this flyer led to him enlisting in the army which led to him becoming a ""war hero"" which led to many other things and great opportunities. Despite the unlikelihood of all of these events happening to one single person, we all know that life is unpredictable.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump's special effects were outstanding for the time it was made. The special effects team on this film won an Oscar for the editing of the movie and even created a new term called ""gumping"" as they were able to place Tom Hanks' character in the previously recorded historical footage. The special effects team used CGI to edit Tom Hanks face over people who were actually there. They were then able to edit any other hand and arm movements. The editing in the film allowed Forrest to meet John Lennon, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon. Often times these characters would be shown talking to Forrest Gump but obviously that couldn't have happened so they used voice-overs to make it seem like the conversations were actually taking place. The amazing special effects team on this film won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. <br/><br/>Another aspect of this film that made it so great was Tom Hanks portrayal of Forrest Gump. When they first started filming they wanted Tom Hanks to have an eased southern accent but the little boy who played young Forrest had naturally thick southern accent that was hard for him to change. So the director talked to Tom Hanks and they decided it would be best if Tom Hanks changed his character's accent to match the boy's natural accent. Tom Hanks spent hours sitting around talking to and recording the boy talking to try to match it perfectly. Having put in the extra effort to match the accents showed how dedicated Tom Hanks was as, in the end, it's completely believable that the boy just grew up and his accent stayed. John Travolta was the original choice to portray Forrest Gump but I am so glad he turned it down as I can't imagine anyone else playing Forrest Gump. The extra effort the Tom Hanks put into this movie doesn't just show through the accent but also through his amazing acting skills and his believability.<br/><br/>The movie Forrest Gump got a very underrated score on rotten tomatoes, but I think it deserves much better as it was an amazing film that took the audience through historical events through the eyes of a man with an IQ of 75, but in the end his IQ didn't really matter as he was able to accomplish so much that the average person wouldn't even dream of. With the use of genres, its quotability, the special effects, and the amazing acting by Tom Hanks this movie has won many awards including six Oscars."

However, from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the filmmaker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.<br/><br/>The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright."

Dan (Gary Sinise, ""Of Mice and Men"").<br/><br/>The show, enjoyable as it is for the most part, is far from original in concept. Peter Sellers played to the hilt his role of Chance, the simpleminded gardener who rose to fame in ""Being There.""<br/><br/>While the Industrial Light & Magic clips of Forrest talking with presidents and other celebrities is indeed something to see, the same sort of documentary feel was featured several years ago in ""Zelig.""

","Forrest Gump, a comedy and drama film that takes people through history seeing the world through Forrest Gump's (Tom Hanks) eyes. A simple, optimistic, man, with a low IQ score sits at a bus stop as he narrates his flashbacks. It all begins from a young age when his mother, Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) taught him to choose his own destiny. Throughout childhood, Forrest spends his days growing up, going to school and running around with the love of his life, Jenny Curan (Robin Wright). As time progresses, and strangers come and go from the bench and Forrest narrates his experiences from joining the army in Vietnam and making friends with his shrimp- crazed friend, Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) to developing a passion for ping pong and meeting several presidents. <br/><br/>While getting to know Forrest's character, the theme of choosing your own destiny captivates viewers as they watch Forrest create his own history.

The feather, that appears again later in the film, is a motif that symbolizes Forrest as he aimlessly goes through life, creating his own destiny wherever the world takes him. <br/><br/>Retelling his life events, as he narrates the flashback scenes allows viewers to quickly pick up on Forrest's personality. Although his IQ score is low, it is clear that he is in fact very intelligent and chooses to see the good in situations. While Forrest may be saying one thing, his flashbacks give the audience more depth and layers to the plot. Special effects position historical characters throughout the film to uniquely communicate the passage of time. <br/><br/>As his life changes, he doesn't worry about a thing, other than his love for his long- time friend, Jenny. By not letting anything get in his way, Forrest keeps his mother's lessons in mind, and chooses his own destiny that makes you stop and consider what is truly important in life. The use of motifs, flashbacks and Forrest's narrating on the bench helps you fall in love with this simple character and his journey through life. All aspects of this movie are carefully thought out and allow the viewer to interpret and consider a deeper message, giving this film the ability to be comical, entertaining and thought provoking."

","This is a great family movie and will never get old, is an all-time classic. one of Tom Hanks best performances.<br/><br/>The movie is set back in the early years, and seen through the eyes of Forrest (Tom Hanks) as a young boy with physical disabilities who grows up to become an inspiration to all people he encounters throughout his life.<br/><br/>This movie kept me and my kids entertained the whole time.

","Nothing to say about this Movie-Hopping more just like this :)<br/><br/>Hello. My name's Forrest--Forrest Gum.<br/><br/>Do you want a chocolate? I could eat about a million and a half of these. My mama always said Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Those must be comfortable shoes. I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt . Mama always said there's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going,where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere . Gum She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gum,as strong as I've ever seen.<br/><br/>But his back's as crooked as a politician.But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me after the great Civil War hero.General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. She said we was related to him in some way.What he did was,he tarted up this club called the Clue Clue Klan.They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.And, anyway, that'show I got my name-- Forrest Gum.Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well,that just don't make no sense.This way. Hold on. Ugh! All right.What are y'all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before ? Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest.If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs.Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them. We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,about a half mile from the town of Green bow, Alabama.That's in the county of Green bow. Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago.Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms,Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that.That'show me and Mama got money.Mama was a real smart lady. Remember what I told you, Forrest.You're no different than anybody else is. Did you hear what I said, Forrest? You're the same as everybody else. You are no different. Your boy's...different, Mrs. Gum.<br/><br/>His I.Q is 75. Well, we're all different."

"dejansurlan","8","1","1","22 July 2017"," Great movie!!!
","The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.<br/><br/>I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.<br/><br/>The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!"

The story it tells is uplifting, and the film blends archival footage with new stuff masterfully.<br/><br/>The movie does tend to be a bit of a Grand Tour of Baby Boomer cultural touchstones, not that that is necessarily a bad thing! Forrest Gump has long been my movie to reinforce my faith in the universe and humanity itself, and Forrest is one of my all-time favorite characters to ever grace the silver screen.

","On the very rare occasion that I give a movie a ten I always feel the need to add a little line about how no movie is perfect. Sometimes I slap that ten with a qualifier and leave it at that.<br/><br/>I probably should have done that with Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is an acting legend that had never truly failed, but he took this character to a place I don't think any other actor could have. He was absolutely fantastic and he had a script to work with here that allowed him to shine like never before.<br/><br/>As I was watching this movie I knew, even as young as I was, that the performance was Academy Award winning good. I was so moved by the performance that I actually predicted Tom Hanks would win before the movie was half over. When the nominations were announced I predicted that Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Writer would all go to this movie (I never even thought about direction at that time and knew nothing about screenplays and all that) This movie is a classic and everyone should experience the laughter, sorrow, and inspiration it will almost certainly solicit in most viewers.<br/><br/>So wish I would have given it a ten."

"Kingslaay","Null","1","1","1 June 2017"," A film about humanity and living in the moment
","Forrest Gump is truly a remarkable film and one of Spielberg's greatest achievements. Its beauty is the simplicity with which the story is told through the eyes of a simple and unassuming character. As a character Forrest is difficult not to like and many can understand and even relate to him. This is a film that transcends a single plot as it showcases many important events in American history that Forrest experiences. The pace is simply brilliant as it does not slow down at any certain time period, it moves fast enough for the viewer to appreciate it. Through Gump's living in the moment and unassuming character this film conveys volumes about humanity and how simple values like kindness and respect really matter. Forrest values the key people in his life.<br/><br/>These are one of those films that should be on most people's bucket list. The direction and performances are first class and both Spielberg and Tom Hanks were very deserving of the Oscars they won. This is a truly beautiful film and one that has easily stood the test of time."

","The first time I watched Forrest gump, I thought to myself ""golly what a bad film"" then i watched it a second time, just yesterday. and thought ""hrmm, this film is better than I remembered""<br/><br/>the film centres around the titular Forrest gump, a possible mentally disabled man who touches the hearts of many, and influences many historical events in his life, from Vietnam to football.<br/><br/>my main grievance of this film is the way that everything in Forrest's world exists to make you feel sad. everything that happens to him is supposed to make you cry or feel bad for him. whenever something nice happens to him, there's a big ol' SCREW YOU FORREST right behind it. sure, it is supposed to be a sad tale, but it gets to a point where you just want to give the poor guy a break for once. HOWEVER, this is also the best part about the film, Forrest's unawareness of his hardships and how friendly he is really makes you root for him, its a real success story. I felt like some of the ""cameos"" Forrest made in historical events were a bit silly. but that's just me i suppose.<br/><br/>I liked it. great film with a few little hiccups.<br/><br/>8/10 for sure at least."

","Forrest Gump is a classic movie and one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie shows the life of Forrest Gump through a variety of lenses and each time it carries a simple, yet profound message. It feels like a never-ending journey through life but becoming increasingly more interesting through each new phase. This is a movie which will make you feel good about humanity and maybe make you into a better person.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks delivers an exceptional performance as Forrest Gump. There is excellent character development shown. I think the best part of his character is that despite the various obstacles he faces, his good heart and mindset always lets him continuously improve his life. His sincerity and simplicity is touching and allows the viewer to connect on every level with Forrest Gump. <br/><br/>I also appreciate this film for being able to weave the life of an individual with the historical and social background of the relevant time periods. There are some explicit historical scenes, such as the Vietnam War scenes, and they are filmed well. The social class subtleties embedded in such scenes are interesting as well. I am sure if I watch this film another time, I will notice even more noteworthy details pertaining to social issues. This film avoids the dilemma of not being historically accurate because it does not have to be - Forrest Gump creates the history himself."

","Directed by Robert Zemekis, Forrest Gump is an endearing story of the trials and victories of Forrest (played by Tom Hanks) from the time he was a boy through adulthood, and an all-time fantastic movie. We see the challenges of being bullied as a young boy for being ""different"" from his peers, and we see how Forrest's mom (Sally Field) is his biggest cheerleader. We watch as he gets his one and only friend Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and see their relationship blossom over the years. Forrest and Jenny ""are best good friends"" and are there for each other through all phases and stages of life. The layering of visible and invisible sound allows the viewer to actually feel as if they are present in the film. The use of creative editing makes the appearance that Forrest Gump is present for many of history's meaningful moments including the Vietnam War, being in the presence of President Nixon, President Kennedy, among other events. Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is one that will go down in the history books. His wisdom through innocence is what makes the viewer root for Forrest. There is sure to be tears and laughter as we go through Forrest's life experiences and trials alongside him."

The characters were well thought out and the actors stayed within their creation's limits. Quite believable and lovable. My family and I found the movie to keep us engaged from start to finish and still keeps us engaged when we discuss those lean years financially. Forest, you are all we had! The southern setting was perfect for the movie and the cinematography didn't skimp on giving us an eyeful of how people live down there. Love the south. The interaction between Forest and the events through the time line were well interlaced and seemed to explain when some of those events were the way they were. A great Saturday night movie."

What makes this film so captivating is the unique and fleshed out characters who all can be described in detail by anyone who even glances at this film. Also the way the film is told, while not original, is done well thanks to Forrest speaking before the camera cuts to him, which prevents the feeling of interruption, thus making the film feel smoother.

","This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade. <br/><br/>8.5/10."

My opinion: I don't like dramas or romances, but this film is very different. It is fun like a comedy and it is very original. This film changes the typical idea of a ""perfect guy"" and it changes this typical guy for a strange and a silly man who is so lucky. This is the first reason why I love this film, the originality. The second reason is the production and the direction; the actors are fantastic, I especially loved Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump (whose acting was incredible). And the last reason is that it has got very good visual effects that it make an interesting and spectacular film.

","Forrest Gump Film Review Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Staring Tom Hanks the movie takes you through the life of Forrest Gump. As a child Forest was picked on of the leg braces he had to wear. His best friend was a girl by the name of Jenny Curran. Forrest later develops into a college football star for the University of Alabama. After college Forrest enlists in the US Army. While in training he meets another best friend Bubba. Bubba and Forrest are sent to fight in the Vietnam War. They are assigned to First Lieutenant Dan. While out on a patrol the platoon takes heavy fire from Vietnam solders. Both Lieutenant Dan and Bubba are injured during the firefight. Forrest in an act of bravery goes into the jungle time and time again and pulls his injured comrades from danger saving many lives. As a result of is courageous act Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor. After this Forrest gets a shrimping boat along with Lieutenant Dan. Later Forrest runs into Jenny, he proposes but she turns him down initially but later comes around to the idea. While recovering from his injury sustained at war Forrest becomes a phenomenal ping pong player and competes against China. John Lennon and Forrest appear on a talk show together. John Lennon, after his trip to China was inspired to write the song ""Imagine"". This brings me to the sound track and music through out the film Forrest Gump. Early in the movie Elvis comes to the Gump's guesthouse where he encounters Forrest. Despite having the leg braces on, Forrest is able to move his hips to ""Hound Dog"". The dance moves then become Elvis' signature moves. One track that is featured is ""For What Its Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield. This song is played as Forrest and his platoon travel through Vietnam. This song has also been connected with the Vietnam conflict and the transition to the counter culture in the 60s. Another song in Forrest Gump is ""Free Bird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. This song is heard s a Drug addicted Jenny climbs to the ledge of her hotel balcony as if to jump to her death. The famous guitar solo builds as she climbs to the edge the suspense of the scene is matched with the guitar opening up. There are several instances of mise-en-scene, this helps the viewer feel a strong connection with Forrest. Forrest through out the film has a pretty consistent good attitude. However there are some low points through out the movie and the director uses mise-en-scene to capture these emotions. Once when he is struggling in Vietnam after a firefight. Another time when Forrest is running around the country and hits a wall and realizes this isn't what he wants to do anymore. During happier moments the director uses a low contrast look, which gives a mood of happiness and contentment. There is also a presence of shots that help feel emotion for example at the end of the film when Forrest is looking down at Jenny's grave. The camera looks at Forrest from a low angle and captures the emotion that Forrest feels for jenny."
"harveybdickens","8","1","1","8 December 2015"," An enjoyable, cultural, and emotional experience
","In recent years this movie has received a lot of backlash. Why? Because apparently it beat Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption, at the Oscars or something. Well yes...it shouldn't have been chosen over those two, but does that make it a bad movie? Absolutely not! The premise of Forrest Gump, is the character Forrest Gump. He is rather simple minded, but has many hidden talents, and has accidentally been at many significant events in history.<br/><br/>And when I say history what I really mean is American history. This movie is also largely about America, and American culture. This is by no means a bad thing, it's very interesting, and it's part of what drives the plot forward. At times the movie can be very patriotic, and this could be what put some viewers off. I'm not from America, and while it didn't put me off, a lot of the people I was watching it with, were so, and for that reason.<br/><br/>I personally think it's part of the story and simply take it for what it is. The biggest flaw of the movie is Forrest's love interest Jenny. I'm not saying that she wasn't well acted (the actress playing her did a great job) but her character is the problem. This movie is ultimately a love story, and on one side you have the lovable Forrest, whose character you come to love, and then there's Jenny. Is there anything particularly lovable about Jenny (after she grows up that is?) Not necessarily. She could be seen as a bad influence, considering some of the things she does.<br/><br/>Fortunately that is not in the movie all that much, but it does detract, when you really think about it. Despite this problem this is an enjoyable film, one definitely worth watching, and one you'll probably find yourself quoting afterwards...a LOT. With all that in mind I give this movie a 7/10"

There will be no boring scene in the movie if you are a movie lover. Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, write bumper stickers and songs, donating to people and meeting the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran. Who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone."

Directed By Robert Zemeckis, and starring Tom Hanks(in his greatest performance) as Forrest Gump, tells the story of the unintelligent Forrest Gump, and shows his struggles with the world, as the result of his innocence. <br/><br/>The Score is beautiful and the opening scene is just tragically well filmed. The Cinematography is fantastic, and it captures the humour and the sadness of the Film. The Special Effects are incredible, especially for 1994. Forrest Gump deserved every award it got(best picture, best actor),and it's IMDb score reflects the greatness of this film, that will last as won of the best films of the 90's.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who was awarded best actor for his performance, is at the peak of his game as Forrest Gump. Once the Movie is done, you're sure to believe Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump. One of the most convincing performances of all time.<br/><br/>10/10."
"DerekSanford","10","1","1","23 November 2015"," One of my all-time favorites!
","This film has it all! Action, drama, comedy and more, the type of film you can watch over and over again and love it just the same. Not only is the movie itself great, but it comes with a fantastic soundtrack as well. This film was released when I was still in high school. I liked it so much that my friends and I decided to do a remake of it (a much shorter version with select scenes) in our TV production class. Tom Hanks does an amazing job in this film portraying Forrest Gump, you can really get into his character and really believed that he could do all these things. I own the two-disc cd set of the soundtrack and I love pretty much every song on it. This is one of those films that will go down in history as one of the greatest ever."

Robert Zemeckis pulls all the strings and makes this masterpiece his best movie so far. You have everything in this movie - from comedy to drama, you'll be laughing and crying and the same time.

","This Movie is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, movie ever. It delivers so many emotions. Its amazing how a movie can make one actually feel with the protagonist that much! Forrest Gump, the protagonist, is not very bright, still her manages to live a fulfilled live and archives things, that many people only can dream about. All that he does with his hat in his hands. Tom Hanks manages to bring Forrest Gump to life, he delivers an outstanding actor performance. Through that, one can actually feel what Forrest Gump feels, that makes this movie so emotional. His strenght and ability to never give up and let live bring one down is delivered very well and inspires the viewer, me at least, a lot."
"shashankgiri","9","1","1","12 November 2015"," great movie
","It's one of those rare movies that everyone has seen and just about everyone loves. It's a classic and it's not hard to see why. The movie takes on the simpleness of it's title character, Forrest Gump. It's not flashy, it's simple, and the simpleness is beautiful. It isn't just a story of a man, but of the generation he was apart of. The brilliance of how these two different elements are put together is what makes Forrest Gump the lovable and great movie it is.If you're one of the few people who haven't seen Forrest Gump, all I can say is, watch it. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time. I miss you Jenny. If there's anything you need. I won't be far away."
"Adargi","10","1","1","6 November 2015"," Movie heart-breaker!
","Forrest Gump is a movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable as the sweet-natured, shabbily treated simpleton of the title. The Academy is a sucker for honoring afflicted heroes. In Hollywood, it's always raining rain men. Credit Hanks for not overplaying his hand. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright), and his good mama (Sally Field). When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, Mama knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.<br/><br/>Taking a cue from Zelig, director Robert Zemeckis places Forrest in a vivid historical context — he talks with JFK, LBJ and Nixon, among other luminaries. The effects dazzle, though never at the expense of the story. Winston Groom, who wrote the 1986 novel, saw Forrest as a modern Candide, an optimist in the face of strong opposing evidence. But Groom is no Voltaire, and neither is screenwriter Eric Roth (Mr. Jones, Memories of Me), who blunts his satire with choking sentiment. It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book.<br/><br/>In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character — honest, brave, loyal — and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long.<br/><br/>Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed."

Everything works in this movie- The music, the acting, the story, the dialog, the romance, the drama, the humor.... Everything works flawlessly !! Hanks is absolutely magnificent, his character is fantastic !! After watching this film, I really think Tom Hanks could be the next DiCaprio !! He can act so dramatic at one minute, the other minute he can be so hilarious you won't believe how excellent he can act !! Also, every character works. I won't spoil anything but even if something happens to a curtain character and you don't cry, you'll still think the actor did a great job portraying the character. This film deserves 10/10, it's impossible to feel bored in this movie, every second you can either laugh hysterically, feel so invested in the story and the dialog, or even cry when something sad happens.

The main character is Tom HanKs that is outstanding actor. The quote is ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""

"janicewaltontheactress","7","1","1","23 September 2015"," My Opinion
","I have watched this movie in Spanish class when I was in high school. At first I didn't like it , but towards the end I did. The way he portrayed his character was really good. I didn't expect for him to do that. I love how he got his accent down. It was really a nice movie to watch. It was entertaining but then again boring for me to watch because I didn't really understand it. I would recommend it to anyone else though if they like movies like that. Even if they just want to see him play someone else for a change. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. This is one of his best films, the one I like best I think is the one where he was on the beach. Cast away"

","Forrest Gump is a story of acceptance and understanding one that opens your eyes while still being the most classic version of a love story. Each of the characters in this movie is dynamic and worth watching. They all have such different paths the ultimately intertwine and the central point where they meet is him. This boy who becomes a man with a heart as big as they come and a mind thats sharp in its own right. Never to be taken for granted Forrest is a one of a kind character and human being and this movie is iconic. It teaches all of us that what makes you different doesn't make you strange it makes you powerful in your own right and anyone who does not believe that our applaud that has no place in your life."

","What can I say about this Oscar winning piece of pure geniality?! This film touches every inch of my heart. Although the story be a little bit impossible to happen in today's world, it's the strong message of the whole movie that counts for me. Showing that we should not resign at our own luck and we have the duty to change and contour our destiny, even if the odds are not in our favor or against us. This piece of sublime seventh art also makes us think and reflect about gratitude, justice, loyalty, dignity, honor and benevolence. Not all those that aren't design to do great things, are incapable to succeed. Man birth equally in democratic countries, so, why not defy all the odds, statistics, conceptions and borders? Amazing actor, message of strength, courage and dignity. And beyond all, a fantastic treatment of real historical events."

","I can't believe how long it has taken me to watch Forrest Gump but I am so glad I did. I won't cover the story or write too much as it has all already been said, i just wanted to add my piece. The story was heartwarming, heartbreaking, inspiring and emotive. I was not bored for one second of this film. The actors are all brilliant and engage you right from the start. The story is told in flashback style which is incredibly well suited to the story. This is a classic for a reason, watch it, most people will love Forrest Gump. The only negative about the whole film is how sad the story is, whilst it is careful to never linger on a depressing note, this film may as well be called Here is likable Forrest Gump, now watch as everyone he loves dies."

"rajatdahiyax","8","1","1","20 August 2015"," One of the Tom Hank's Masterpiece!!!!
","""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people."
"brianberta","5","1","1","12 August 2015"," A good movie but it's not the masterpiece that many say it is
","This is a good movie for what it is but I really don't know why people say it's one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he has accidentally been present at many historical events. While sitting on a park bench, he tells strangers about what he experienced in life and the people he met.<br/><br/>The musical score is well-done and perfectly timed. It hits all the right notes at the right time. It does a great job drawing different emotions out of the audience.<br/><br/>Also, I think that this is a very entertaining feel-good movie. It is also pretty compelling. It has a nice message as well. It's message is that you can achieve all you can in life. It can inspire many people and it does a great job doing what it wanted to do. However, then there are the flaws.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie often gets crippled under its own sentimentality. I get that the movie was trying to draw emotions out of the audience but it does it too often. Its sentimental moments can be real overwhelming at times. I'm not going to spoil anything but the ending seemed to exist just to add more unnecessary sentimentality to the movie.<br/><br/>Also, this movie is overlong and stretched-out. It could've been cut down a lot. Several scenes I felt could've been cut down or could've been completely left out altogether. I grew bored several times throughout.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a pretty good movie and I like it for what it is. I just don't think it's anything special like many people say it is."

","As much as it was sort of a quirky film, I still enjoyed watching Forrest Gump. It was very entertaining and filled with humor. This is a movie that I wouldn't mind watching once or twice a year. Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor, he definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for the role he played. I also enjoyed watching Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan, he also brought some humor to the character. In fact, he took that role very seriously and named his tribute band, Lt. Dan Tribute Band. When this movie came out in 1994 it was a really big hit with friends in the industry. Sally Field grew into her character as well and she was brilliant in playing Mrs. Gump. I really enjoyed the scenes on the park bench, where the stories were being told. I definitely recommend this as a family movie for teens and above."

His gait problems, first love, best friend, the war, making money, losing love and finding it again and having a restaurant.

"kyrat","6","1","1","26 July 2015"," puzzled by its popularity
","Maybe the book was better.<br/><br/>I get that they were going for a ""stupid is as stupid does"", to show the triumph of optimism, et al.<br/><br/>But mostly this movie just made me sad. Sad that Forrest was treated this way. Sad that even his triumphs were accidental.<br/><br/>The fact that they had Forrest get to meet Elvis, the president(s), John Lennon and all those other historical figures just made it seem even more fake than the CGI it took to add him to all those historical scenes (George Wallace, JFK, Johnson, etc.) It threw you out of the realism of the film -- AND also seemed so unrealistic that someone like Forrest could achieve those kinds of things outside of a film.<br/><br/>Finally, I don't understand anyone considering his love of Jenny as a true romance. Yes, I believe he loved her. I believe that she loved him in her own way, but not romantically. I understand that she was incredibly messed up by the sexual abuse of her father and that's why she pursued the self-destructive life she did. I understand that she felt she might not be worthy of Forrest because she was suicidal and messed up. She seems to have tried to turn her life around right before she died of AIDS, and was trying to provide for herself without relying on a man.<br/><br/>My interpretation of Jenny relationship with Forrest was either: 1. She came home because she was pregnant (cue her sleeping all the time), then had sex with Forrest, then years later when sick, claimed he was the father, so her son would be taken care of. or 2. Forrest truly was the father (and there are hints such as them bending their heads the same way while watching TV & fishing). If so, why did she not tell Forrest he had a child until she was dying? I understand maybe she didn't want to marry him and raise the child together - but that still seemed cruel. Again, I feel that she only married him at the end as she was dying to give the child a parent. Not because she felt true romantic love for Forrest.<br/><br/>Best part of the film were the performances. I did like Gary Sinese's performance, that was outstanding. His bitterness at being rescued, his life trajectory and turn around were handled very well. Tom Hanks did a good job of portraying Forrest with dignity. And Robin Wright did a fairly good job as a self-destructive victim struggling to come to terms with her life."

","Forrest Gump is an amazing movie. Tom Hanks gives what is arguably his best and most iconic performance in a movie that never ceases to surprise me.<br/><br/>There are a million things that could have gone wrong with this movie, such as Forrest Gump becoming an annoying character or thinking wrong of Jenny for constantly denying Forrest, but thanks to the performances, writing and directing by Robert Zemeckis, this never happens. Actually, it's quite the opposite! You grow to love Forrest Gump and you can totally understand where Jenny is coming from considering what she's been through and the time period they live in. This movie show us the time period it takes place in so well and it ties in the events that happened during that time incredibly well. Many people don't get the message of the movie. It's not just some dumb guy taking part in random events throughout history because of luck. No. Absolutely not. Forrest Gump tells an inspiring story about a man, seen inferior by others because he's not intelligent, who accomplishes some of the most incredible things some of us could only dream of doing. Why did he do them? Because he felt like it. The message of this movie is, anyone can do anything, no matter where they stand in society or where they come from. If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish it.<br/><br/>There aren't many, or any bad things I can say about this movie, so I'll just say this.

","Forrest Gump (1994): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson: Brilliant filmmaking that stretches many historical aspects all observed and experienced by one simple individual who lived a complicated life. Forrest Gump was born and raised in Alabama where he overcomes a walking disability, survives Vietnam, starts a shrimp business, plays football, and meets two Presidents. What is most interesting is its emphasis upon the historical elements through the limited understanding of Gump. Excellent work by director Robert Zemeckis whose impressive resume also includes such unique films as Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Remarkable work by Tom Hanks as Gump whose accomplishments never out weight his sense of devotion. Robin Wright plays Jenny who descends into drugs all the while denying the one man who has always sheltered her. Mykelti Williamson plays Vietnan buddy Bubba whose friendship with Gump would live on when a dream becomes a reality. Gary Sinise is commanding as Lieutenant Dan Taylor whose sense of duty is tested when Gump saves him thus opening other opportunities. Sally Field plays Gump's caring mother whose advice is carried on through memory. Sometimes unfairly depressing but demonstrates one's purpose to do great things. Score: 9 / 10"

","This film is a must-see for anyone and everyone. It teaches viewers many life lessons and shows the aspects of life through a different lens. Many walk away from this film wanting to embrace the little things in life. There is not much to dislike about Forest Gump as a character. He has such a big heart and because he is slow-witted, he has a very simplistic yet fulfilling lifestyle. Gump always follows his heart and does what he believes to be right, regardless of others judgment. An example of this is all the times he ""saved"" his best friend Jenny. There were a few times in the film that Forest didn't appreciate how a man was speaking to or touching Jenny, and every time Forest would immediately pry them off of her, despite her requests. This film also had comedy, drama, action, and emotion, perfectly blended together to create a great all-American film."

","This movie, widely renowned as one of the greatest of all time will forever be a great watch as well as always being relevant to our society today. It's off-hand mentions of social issues of the sixties and racial undertones mixed with the comedic pleasure of Tom Hanks captivates us throughout the movie making it pleasurable to watch over and over again. Over the course of the movie I felt myself drawn to Forrest's quest to get the love of his life Jenny. Though many times it seems as though they may be together, some force separates them until the end where she ultimately dies. My favorite character is the film is Bubba, Forrest's friend which he meets in Vietnam but is killed in battle, Forrest ends up taking over Bubba's shrimping company which turns wildly successful. This relationship is a perfect example of Forrest's unconditional love and friendship for multiple characters throughout the movie causing many tear jerking scenes."

","This movie, was always an all time favorite of mine, but now since I have gotten to know my history a little better, this film seems even more fantastic to me. There are always going to be historical errors, but there were minimal errors in this movie. This comedic romance/drama brings you through so many different emotions. Honestly this film taught me how to be grateful in so many ways, such as how in the beginning of the film when Forrest goes through his troubles but with the help of his friend, he overcame adversity and showed true brilliance in how you should always be happy with what you have. This story brought us through so many different time periods which made me realize, that with all the possible little things in life which occur that make you sad, are only temporary, while love, true love is something that can never be broken. Forrest was a man of perseverance, no matter what life threw at him, he always battled through his tough times. Which taught me to do the same whenever i encounter such bad times as Forrest did."

","It's truly a great movie,maybe one of the best I've ever seen,so I voted 10.And it worth it.If I'd watched it like 10 years ago,I certainly won't appraise it this much.But when I grows older,it all seems so...delicate,you might say,and,it's almost unfold the whole life of Mr. Forrest Gump in front of you.You can see Gump at many historic moments,and you might think he's a legend,and all the sudden,things went sideway,the tense atmosphere almost sucks all the air out.Then,there would be a natural turn take place,and the story moves to next chapter.The director surely knows his work. Then again,in this movie,if I rate the story and the screenplay at 9,the cinematography would be at 8,and the BMG would be at 10.Yes,I think the background music is the best part of this movie.It fits right in,but take it out,it's still brilliant.You can easily feel the story behind it.Especially the famous part ""Forrest Gump Suite"",it's born for this movie(despite the fact that it is born for this movie). Oh,holy god,I think I got too excited and now I don't know what I was writing about.I'd better stop."

","If you are thinking of seeing this movie, just do it. The amazing plot and the use of American history, Forest Gump became a simple phenomenon. He is the guy who shows the world a whole new way of understanding life. With many characters which are essential to the plot and his dumb way of thinking makes you fall in love with the movie. I totally recommend, and I guarantee that you are not going to be disappointed by the story. It seems old but the graphics are essential and will give a amazing look to the movie. Which has many scenes, that will need this old type graphics. To conclude my review, I will not give you any more about the movie, just watch it and you will know what I am talking about"

","If you still have not seen this movie then you are missing out on a long but entertaining story of a man, Forest Gump, who makes the best of his life and every moment. Forest is an example of a great man who comes in a broken package which is often misjudged or treated. The real reason this movie is worth watching is because I believe most people can relate to Forest and his life experience. In the movie he experiences, love, hate, judgement, fear, loneliness, happiness, war, struggle, and much more is seen and experienced with the people he interacts with like racism, divorce, abuse, and physical trauma. The acting of Tom Hanks and all supporting actors is spot on, I was never pulled from the sense of belief. I truly felt a part of him and felt what he was going through."

","At first glance, it seems a bit dimwitted Forrest, silly boy, but his kindness and simple outlook on life to persuade the audience throughout the film. Here simplicity is not worse it as a shield against unfriendly looks, she as his own credo. He just loves his mom, just to protect Jenny. He's just a good friend, he's just helping people. He just does what he likes. And for those who doubt if they were, then they evaporate when Forrest is not just a father.<br/><br/>The whole life of Forrest -neobyknovenny kaleidoscope of situations in which it is directly or indirectly affect the course of American history, and does it unconsciously, and sometimes a child himself. He taught Elvis to dance and made him famous, he was three times at a reception at the president, he founded the «Apple Computers, Inc» and came up with the famous shirt with smiles and popular slogan «Shit happens».<br/><br/>The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Forrest for me is the story of an amazing and extraordinary man. A real person. Forrest Gamp- is the quintessence of the whole person. This film is like no other, shows our world through the prism of understanding and appreciation of him as a man who is capable of a different perception, dust proof problems and cynicism. Not everyone of the people manage to see the world as it is for Forrest Gump."

","I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.<br/><br/>And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.<br/><br/><3 TOM HANKS <3"
"diogovintem","9","1","1","1 May 2015"," Interesting and Original film
","Robert Zemeckis made some great films, but this one is the best, in terms of plot, cast, soundtrack and cinematic. Well, to begin the plot was very well written (even thought I didn't read the novel by Winston Groom), I haven't finished to read the script by Eric Roth, but I am really enjoying it. The cast was great, with the stars Tom Hanks (wich I think it was one of the best 90's actor) and Robin Wright was extremely good represented. The best acting from Tom Hanks in my opinion, better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Green Mile"". The soundtrack of the movie was very well chosen and that gave some magic effect to it. The And then the cinematic, there were really interesting moments, the ones like the war in Vietnam and the feather are some examples. In overall, this film is great, this is one of the films you should see before you die! Of course there is some people that hate it, but there are always people who hate something, I hope you enjoy watching this movie!"

He wants the full josh, the full energy, enthusiasm whatever you say. The film just poured me with full satisfaction of watching a film.<br/><br/>Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.<br/><br/>I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.<br/><br/>But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.<br/><br/>I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.<br/><br/>In one word- Loved it much!!!!!! (Sorry I spoke 3.)"

","Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran, eludes him. I started to watch this movie without so much enthusiasm because I had never seen before, I wanted to be who doesn't like a movie which everyone loves, just to be different. I guessed that was really easy make a good movie about a not smart guy with some mind's problem, it's a story that everyone would like. Instead I found this movie marvellous, gorgeous, interesting, charming... <br/><br/>When I have an idea I usually keep it until the end of the movie instead in this case something changed. I really loved this movie, besides the popular sentences: ""Run, Forrest, Run!"" that is smart I enjoyed everything. I liked the choices for the songs during the whole movie, I heard Sweet Home Alabama, Free Bird, Imagine... And when Forrest met John Lennon and they began to talk about China and references about the words of Imagine songs, I laughed so much. Yes, because this is a very important movie, in several moments it was funny but in others there were deep meaning, just everything that Forrest's mom taught to him and said worth the price ticket. Besides this movie talks about how is difficult to be such a different person in our world and above all how solve this problem because Forrest Gump, with the every problem of the world became a promoted student, football player, soldier, captain, and above all he became such a good friend, husband and dad!"

My favorite childhood memories with my father would be to watch this film and ask questions throughout the whole thing (which I see now is annoying) haha ooops. Forrest Gump was an inspiring man that shows a different perspective or an altered state of reality thats chilling, yet inspiring to both children and adults! If you haven't watched, this is a must see! I would love to sit around like old times and watch the film again.

","Quite simply, the greatest film ever made. I am a big fan of Tom Hanks and I have enjoyed pretty much all of his movies over the years but it was a close call between this and the green mile but I think forest gump is my favorite Hanks film of all time.<br/><br/>It's such a nice story that is told in a clever way making you feel like a child once again, the main character played by Hanks is lovable, you can't help but hope for the best for him and simply just want to reach out and tell him everything will be OK. The movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why I love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality."
"pavlovicmstevan","10","1","1","19 April 2015"," 10 out of 10, literally
","In my opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. The way Forrest go through his life and how spontaneously he solves his problems is something that everybody has to see. Contrary to his best friend and wife Jenny Curran, there's actually no problems for him, everything is gonna be how it is gonna be.<br/><br/>As his mother always says: ""Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get"", he follows that sentence and succeeds to become the best of the best, a person who everyone else wants to be. On the other hand his undervalued, but very clear and positive mind tends to get something else, a peaceful and happy life with his future wife Jenny.<br/><br/>It seemed impossible but again as his mother said, ""Stupid is as stupid does"", he was a successful at everything he was trying to do because of his unstoppable persistence. He didn't think if he could or couldn't do that, he just did that. Because of that, this is one of the most inspiring movies ever filmed and has absolutely deserved my 10 stars rating."

","This movie has it all. The actors and actresses were terrific led by strong performances by Tom Hanks, Gary SInese and Robin Wright. The most admirable character in the film is the protagonist Forrest. HIs unconditional love for Jenny, who continuously lets him down, is encouraging to see. Forrest is not a smart man but he manages to do so many great things with his life, from winning the medal of honor to being a successful shrimp boat captain. Forrest teaches us to think less and to stop worrying about every detail, to just go with the flow and good things may happen. Although Forrest has many good moments in his life he also faces great adversity. He loses his friend Bubba, his Mother and Jenny continuously deserts him. When Forrest hits his breaking point he just runs away from it all and goes on a cross country journey. Throughout his run he learns that you can'y move forward until you forget about the past and move on. Overall this is an extremely entertaining film that all should see"

","I thought that the movie Forest Gump was a very good movie that helped show what the times were like in the 50s and 60s. It was a very interesting movie let you see all the important events that took time in this place. It was also cool how they used Forest Gump and showed his views on it and how he was able to overcome a lot of the difficult tasks such as when he went to Vietnam. My favorite scenes were when he played the ping pong game and also when he went to war in Vietnam. That part was very good because it showed what it was like during that time. The movie was also very good because it provided a moral lesson and showed the struggles Forest Gump had to overcome and it thought you to be kind to people and accept them for who they are. Overall this movie was very good and it provided looks of historical details"

","A long overdue movie experience for me.<br/><br/>This is a great movie with another remarkable interpretation by Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>He IS the movie.<br/><br/>It's like a fairy tale where we can see that in spite of our shortcomings, we can always be great or a part of something great (even if we can't understand it).<br/><br/>It is also a love story of a man chasing after his true love his entire life. On his route he finds friendship, fortune and the acknowledgment of his abilities by his friends (and not only those).<br/><br/>In the end, without knowing it, he shows true compassion for his loved one, saving her. But in his mind she is saving him, like she always did throughout his life.<br/><br/>It's an excellent movie in every way."
"scottstephens94","9","1","1","1 April 2015"," What we get from Forrest Gump...
","What a beautiful film! Capturing innocence, love and family. ""Forrest Gump"" elicits a tone of love - between a mother and son, and ultimately between a man and a woman; which results in a character development from a shy, young boy to a determined young man. Furthermore, the film conveys an underlying message that no matter who you are, you can do anything. While Forrest is not the most intelligent of men, he finds that he is more than capable, in the historic events that he finds himself in. With each event, gradually building him up as a better person. A truly stoic man. In addition, a beautiful soundtrack, goes hand-in-hand with this beautiful film. ""Run Forrest, run!"""

I see it as a perfect movie, integration is found in drama,music play,emotions,crying,laughing and of course in Hanks performance. In this movie you'll smile,cry and get inspired at the same time. The sequence of events and storytelling is amazing I've never experienced it in any other movie.Whatever your mood is, you'll enjoy watching it any time.Really it's a classy one.

We can not resist even though we do not want. That's why everyone's life would be dead. ""Life Was Like A Box Chocolates. You Never Know You're Gonna Get"" is full of life mystery.Seperti brown box.

"hhhrahulhhh","10","1","1","21 March 2015"," Simplicity! Emotions!
","This review like many of mine will be a ponderous piece without any structure or train of thought.<br/><br/>The feather falls. This is a beautiful tale of the life of a simple boy in a complex world. This story captures everything that there is to love about the world when stripped down to its most basic form. The social commentary on the complex social structures that have developed over the millenia, how would they seem to someone who was born for another time. From why we run, fight, play sports like ping-pong, rebel for the sake of rebellion, and even do the same things again and again have been explored in this movie. In this age of stress, over-thinking and complications, one big thought was how being a simple boy with an IQ of 75 was the greatest strength Forrest had and his clarity of mind was never a roadblock in what he felt like doing. It goes to show how far the upbringing of someone would shape their values and leave you craving their simplicity for yourself.<br/><br/>Not being an American most of the funny stuff had somewhat little sense to me, however I have enough of a context to be able to appreciate the big historical events events that kept popping up in the movie and boy were they put in seamlessly in the narration.<br/><br/>Finally what can I say about Tom Hanks but that I can't imagine anyone other than him bringing out the emotions of someone like Forrest Gump, it is a biased view because I do not know anyone like Forrest Gump but I would like to think that Mr. Gump is what they would be like. That's all I have to say about this. Feather floats again."
"sazzc_17","10","1","1","19 March 2015"," The Experience
","No matter how many times I watch this movie, it still manages to move me and take me on an adventure. I find myself always getting lost in Tom Hanks acting, it's not Tom, it's Forrest, which is something I find difficult to see when watching other actors. As a viewer you feel as if you're one of the people sitting with Forrest at the bus stop, listening to his compelling story. As the viewer, as you go on this journey with Forrest you're on a roller coaster of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, if a movie can make you feel all these different things, that's what I see as a successful movie, a film is supposed to connect with it's audience on an emotional level, and this movie does that on a number of levels. <br/><br/>I'd recommend this as a must watch movie to anyone."

Living through many events, like the war in Vietnam, his character changes, however is love for Jenny will never change. He, Forrest Gump, is an inspirational man. How he cares for everyone he meets/ lives with: his mother, Jenny, Bubba,and Lieutenant Dan is something every man should do. Watching this movie for the first time was heartwarming.<br/><br/>The scene that is most memorable for me is when Forrest Gump is acting as a hero within the war as a soldier. Following his lover's advice of ""To run Forrest run"" he took to action accordingly. However, he couldn't leave his best friend, Bubba behind. Searching for Bubba, he saves many other men along the way, including Lieutenant Dan. He receives the congressional medal of honor for his service. However, he didn't see the ""reward"" as the most important thing in his life, but rather Jenny is. That is why Forrest Gump gave her his medal of honor.<br/><br/>This movie is highly recommended to all people around the globe.

The storyline of a young simple lad growing up listening to every word his ""Mama"" says and trying to make friends as any other child would, but he was different because of his back was bent so he had to wear braces on his legs. But there was one little girl that was friendly to him 'Jenny' she would stick up for him. Which turns into a life-long friendship. And as you find out as the story goes on it shows that even people with a low IQ can do very well in life. This film also has a very important and very true phrase at the end ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"" this is a lovely film for anyone really.

"tinkle03","9","1","1","8 February 2015"," Endurance of His Love for Jenny
","Forrest Gump is a film that portrays the life of Forrest Gump through flashbacks and voice over narration. We meet Forrest Gump, a slow man perfectly portrayed by Tom Hanks, at the beginning of the film when he introduces himself to the first person who sits next to him on a bench at a bus stop. It is from this point that we begin the journey of his life starting with his ""philosophical"" mother Mrs. Gump played by Sally Fields and his unfortunate need for leg braces. From here Forrest takes the bus to school for the first time and we are introduced to his childhood friend and love at first sight, Jenny Curran played by Robin Wright. In college, Jenny and Forrest go their separate ways. Throughout Forrest Gump's life he experiences and causes many historical moments such as inspiring Elvis Presley's dance moves, meeting multiple presidents, and uncovering the Watergate Scandal. Although, these are monumental experiences, it seems he is somehow always drawn back to Jenny. In the film, they are brought back together several times. A significant time being when Forrest loses his mother and Jenny stays with him. The morning after their night together, she once again leaves him. In the end, we are brought back to Forrest Gump, the narrator, in present day looking for Jenny in response to a letter she sent him. The result of their one night together, left them with a son, Forrest played by Haley Joel Osment. Jenny and Forrest Gump are finally united and get married before she dies of an unknown virus. The film ends perfectly on a scene much like the one where Forrest first met Jenny, but with Little Forrest getting on the bus for school for his very first time.<br/><br/>The theme of this film seems to be torn between drama and comedy. However, the main focus is the endurance and true love that Forrest has for Jenny. Although, he is always there for her when she needs him, she always ends up leaving him and going her own way. This fact does not seem to deter his love for her and every time she comes back into his life, he embraces it.<br/><br/>A scene that reinforces this unbreakable love that Forrest has for Jenny is when they are reunited again in Washington. They are having a conversation before Jenny leaves him once again, which she has done multiple times before this scene. Even though she is preparing to leave him again, Forrest gives her his medal of honor and tells her that the reason he is good to her is because she is his girl. And then she was gone from his life again.<br/><br/>Another film that is quite a different story but relates to the endurance of true love is The Notebook. In this film a young man tries his hardest to be with a young woman, before they are separated. Years later they are brought back together, but she is with another man. When they finally end up with one another she ends up with Alzheimer's. He spends the remaining days of their lives together reading to her and trying to bring her back to him.<br/><br/>Music has a way of affecting our emotional response to a film. In Forrest Gump the use of music is very effective especially when changing scenes. When Jenny hitches a ride with a stranger instead of staying with Forrest, the musical score is soft and almost sad. However, the musical score playing when they see each other again in Washington is blissful and romantic. Another technique used in this film is voice-over narration. This narration done by Forrest emphasizes his thoughts and feelings of Jenny even though she is absent from a majority of the film. The use of this narration conveys his slow point of view on his life and the things that happened in it, but also speeds the passage of time along. The film itself is already a little longer than necessary, so voice-over used for narration is important in moving the film along at a good pace but creating an impact on his way of thinking.<br/><br/>Overall, this film holds your interest in its creativity and alterations of historical events. The intermittent connection of Forrest and Jenny's lives surpasses decades. In the end, even though Jenny has an unknown virus, Forrest marries her and takes care of her until death do they part. This ultimately paints the picture of the true love that Forrest had for Jenny and how it endured the test of time."

","Forrest Gump is quite a unique character in a movie not to mention real life. Trying to explain what Forrest Gump is a movie would be a challenge. The movie seems like a mix of different genres, there is comedy, drama, action, and its also a story about coming to age. The many different genres of this film are probably a main reason while this film is number 13 on IMDb top 250 movies of all time. It caters to so many different audiences, that anybody can find someway to relate to this film and it's message. The screenplay which was wrote by Eric Roth has the depth of modern movies and its protagonist, played by Tom Hanks, is a very honest and wholesome man who happens to have a low IQ of 75, this film shows him growing up between the 1950s and the 1980s and ends up becoming a part of every major thing that happened during that time in American history. He overcomes all of this turmoil with nothing but honesty and sayings that his mom always told him.The film is more of a look back at American history, through the narration and eyes of a mentally handicapped man.Tom Hanks is probably the only actor that could have pulled this off, he is amazing actor which has been a variety of films he isn't one of those actors that is only really good at playing certain parts. The theme of Forrest Gump is to teach a lesson about overcoming adversity no matter what challenges that you face, you never know the amazing places that your life will take you. We see that this film centers on man who isn't the brightest bulb in the closet. But he has many other amazing qualities that allow him many opportunities in his life. For instance, there is a part in the film the doctors thought Forrest was never going to walk without the help of special braces. He defies the odds by simplifying trying to run away from some bullies, and finds out that his legs are just fine. They make Forrest's legs are a big part of this film because of his incredible speed and endurance this allows him to go to college and played for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He even said the military was easy all you had to do was listen to what you are told and say yes sir. It is not that easy for most people, trust me I did 8 year in the Army. The whole film is about overcoming adversity, another example of the theme, when Forrest becomes a world class ping-pong champion He proves that you don't need to be very smart to be successful life, all you need is a little can do attitude and some elbow grease. He did all this and the only person that believed in him was his mother played by Sally Fields and Jenny played by Robin Wright. Robert Zemeckis, the director, did a great job making Forrest do his own narration, you felt that you were in the head of Forrest the whole time going on the journey of his life with him. This was a much better way of delivering the story then hearing it from a third party narrator. He also does some brilliant camera angles that show Forrest's emotions during much of the film, you can see Gump's emotions as he lives this events over again in his life, which helps you feel more connected to the protagonist. In conclusion, Forrest Gump is a great film when you need a reminder that anything is possible and can be overcome with just a different outlook and some hard work. It doesn't matter what type of genre is your favorite this movie will instantly become on of your favorite classics that you will never get tired of no matter how many times that you watch it. This movie is an easy 5 stars for me, it has so many simple yet complex elements in the story and the character development. You will surely not be disappointed."

We kind of shut out the stories that matter most about what's going on on our street or in our town, in our state, in our country, and that was just a tremendous opportunity that we had to work at doing that.

","I really don't rate Tom Hanks as an actor, I think he's highly inconsistent, and often his acting style is off-putting to me. Now put Tom Hanks doing a stupid voice, playing a ridiculous character, taking up all the screen time, in a really long film. It's like torture. I was willing this film towards the end. I didn't feel any genuine drama, the Vietnam scenes especially leaving me cold. <br/><br/>What I liked was the Zemeckis stylistic touches. It's got a nice whimsical feel, and just enough lighthearted humour to keep it afloat. For this film to work on any real level though, you would have to connect with the central character, which I just can't do. It's a very average story really focusing on one character who has very little personality. In terms of film making, it's just OK.<br/><br/>Six out of Ten."

This movie does live up to its standard, and I went in with very high expectations. You will laugh, you may shed a few tears - and you will definitely root for Forrest.

","Forrest Gump is a 1994 classic film. The movie features Tom Hanks playing the main role of Forrest himself. The story is about a young boy who has been placed with braces on his legs and struggles with walking and running. Forrest is often picked on for his disability. Forrest makes friends with a girl named Jenny on the bus. Forrest is then chased by a group of boys and must tries to flee from them, with encouragement from Jenny. While running away from the group of children Forrest's braces popped off of his legs. The film raised aids awareness. The film is also educational and is often played as an example in school History classes. The movie touched on Historical places and events. This movie shows that even the most disadvantaged can achieve greatness. The character of Forrest set a goal and achieved it. He also experienced hardships such as his mothers quite speedy death. This movie is very inspirational and I personally would recommend people to watch it."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","26 December 2014"," Great crowd pleaser with stellar acting and a very good story.
","This movie will please nearly any crowd. This is the one movie that I believe really has it all. Some films and series try to follow suit, but the one that does it best apart from Gump is the Pirates of the Caribbean series, which is primarily an action series anyways. The different events of the back half of the 20th century hit many different areas of life and many different genres of film. There is plenty of humor, bits of excitement, romance placed throughout, moments of sadness and inspiration, and a pretty good amount of history. <br/><br/>The fact that it is told out of the intellectually challenged Forrest Gump is nice. The audience still see the events from its own individual eyes, and some of those watching may have their own memories of the given points in history, but we also see the events in Forrest's simplified version. He's a great character because, while not very smart, he is an incredibly nice person that sees no reason to show malice towards anyone. So even with his impairment, he is really one step ahead of the world all of the time. Another great quality that he has is his influence. People now use his name to identify someone who has lots of important events happen around him, which is understandable. But he also happens to the events around him, if that makes sense. No historical event prompted him to do his three year run, develop his mad ping-pong skills, or be a great football player.<br/><br/>The history involves more than just events, for we see the progression of culture and everyday life in the scattered glimpses we get of Jenny's life. She pretty much is a prime example of what not to do in the seventies, or really any stage of life. Her character is shown as free spirited, impulsive, whimsical, restless, and even stupid sometimes, but at the same time good-hearted deeper down. <br/><br/>The other main characters are Mrs. Gump, Bubba, and Lieutenant Dan. Mrs. Gump is obviously the reason that Forrest is such a positively influential person. Bubba is very simpleminded life Forrest, but is a very good friend, as Forrest points out very blatantly. Lieutenant Dan is an exceedingly grumpy and pessimistic guy who lives off of his sorrows. In some ways, he's kind of what a mean Forrest would look like since they've both lost people and have some kind of impairment. What sets them apart is that they deal with their problems differently.<br/><br/>It's clear that Forrest impacts all of the people listed above, but also the people he talks to at the bus stop and the other small people he meets along the way. Examples could include the bumper sticker and tee-shirt salesmen he meets on his run, the anti-war group, and his Alabama teammates.<br/><br/>The technical execution is nothing special, but doesn't need to be either. If the whole movie took place in Vietnam, I would say that the war themed special effects should have been improved from their current state, but since there was only about five minutes of battle, the low-quality explosions were acceptable. The acting was spectacular from every character, big and small. This fact is perhaps what makes the movie as great as it is, because the characters are already well written so to pair it with great acting is like cinematic explosion.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to just about anyone, but it's best to go into the movie with a pretty good knowledge of history from 1950 to 1980. It's a good go-to movie when a large group is deciding on a movie to watch together. So if you haven't seen it, strongly consider adding it to your shelf or online movie library. Overall Rating: 8.4/10."

"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","1","27 November 2014"," Timeless masterpiece, very unique
","20 years after ""Forrest Gump"" came out, I decided to rewatch this one and it was even better than what I remembered from watching it the first time. The film won 6 Academy awards in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director (Robert Zemeckis, ""Back to the Future""-trilogy, ""Cast Away"" again with Hanks later on) and Best Actor (2nd win in a row for Hanks after ""Philadelphia""). And even if it lost ""Best Score"" to ""The Lion King"", the music, especially the main theme, is nothing short of brilliant. It starts right away as we watch a feather fly towards the film's central character. Visually and acoustically a feast from minute one.<br/><br/>Forrest sits on a bench waiting for the bus and tells his story to the other people who are waiting. Thank God he did not know that he could just walk to Jenny, otherwise we may have never found out about his stories. And as diverse as Forrest's life is, as diverse are also the reactions from those people. Some sit quietly, others accuse him of being a liar and the old lady finally is captivated by his story. The interesting thing is that Gump gets out the photo as evidence not before the man (who accuses him of lying) leaves. He could have proved it easily, but he has nothing to prove to anybody. This is the frame of the story. The real action takes place in the stories Gump tells. Some true emotional highlights are included: Bubba's death and the funeral eulogy to Jenny (great HI. reference by the way) at the end. Of course, all the moments with his son (played by the very young Haley Joel Osment) are very much worth watching too. And then there is Gary Sinise who was pretty much on par with Hanks during their comedic and dramatic moments together. He did not win the Oscar, but was at least as deserving as Landau and Jackson. With his character, early on, you could never say if he would develop into a friend to Gump or stay/become a big antagonist. Finally, it turned out to be the former. When they have prostitutes one night at their place, it becomes truly clear for the very first time. Gump serves as a great role model to Sinise's character for all he achieved despite his limitations.<br/><br/>This is not the greatest movie ever made, but there is a certain charm to it that makes it so unique in movie history, possibly because the central character is at least as unique. And finally, there is the Forrest-Jenny love story which is sweet from start to finish and one of the main reasons why this film will make you laugh, will make you cry and will make you feel for Forrest for its almost 2.5 hours . And even in the almost impossible case that you will not remain interested in Forrest's story, this film is very much worth watching alone for all the references to past decades (most of all in terms of the movements in society, music and politics). ""Forrest Gump"" is a must-watch and that's all I have to say about that."

His classic ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" quote is one heard many times over, that everyone has quoted a few times in their life.

In my opinion, this movie was the perfect representation of kindness, sweetness and all the good it may bring. The story is quite simple: it's the life of a ""simple"" man (in other words, with a low I.Q. level), who's running from one crazy adventure to another. With his ingenious look, we see him growing from childhood until the adult age, following his heart and doing everything for his mommy and the woman he loves.

"henriksengrant","10","1","1","6 October 2014"," Forrest Gump Review
","Forrest Gump is a very inspirational film about a man, named Forrest Gump, who has a lower IQ than average, but has a very exciting and adventurous life because of all of the major historical events that he just so happens to run into. Forrest Gump stars Tom Hanks, as Forrest Gump, Robin Wright, as Jenny Curran, and Gary Sinise, as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. The acting in this film was of very high quality because the actors made it seem like the story actually happened. They also did a great job at making the characters seem more relatable to the viewer. Tom Hanks actually won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Gary Sinise was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for their performances in Forrest Gump. The director is Robert Zemeckis and the writers are Winston Groom, who wrote the novel, and Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay. Forrest Gump is very well directed and written because of many aspects, including the visual effects and how most of the film is a narrated flashback. The visual effects in this film were outstanding. When Forrest was meeting all of the Presidents and when he was getting involved in the integration crisis at Alabama, it seemed like Forrest was actually there. This added on to the believability of the film. I also thought that it was very entertaining to be able to see the story from the view of Forrest Gump himself and wouldn't be nearly as fun if it weren't told like it was. One of my favorite characteristics of Forrest Gump is how entertaining and fun it is. The film never ceases to surprise the viewer. Forrest Gump is a fictional character that is getting involved with events that actually occurred in real life. Also, Forrest never really seems to realize the importance of all the events that he has accidentally influenced or walked into, which makes the film even more entertaining. There are also many serious attributes of Forrest Gump that make it a great film. Forrest seems to have a happy and successful life just from being innately good. This teaches a moral lesson to the viewer to show that good things happen to good people. A moral lesson is key to a film being considered good because it really gets the viewer invested in the story and makes the situations more relatable to their life. Forrest Gump is great because the film is encompassing the themes of entertainment and teaching a moral lesson. Also, Forrest Gump is a very memorable film, especially the quotes. Lines, such as ""run, Forrest, run!"", ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"", and ""stupid is as stupid does"", are among the quotes that many people, including me, had heard before ever seeing Forrest Gump. Many people also know Forrest Gump because of its groundbreaking plot, which just so happens to be my favorite part of the film. In my opinion, the plot of Forrest Gump is the key reason why it is such a fantastic film. The plot is a mixture of multiple genres, such as drama, action, comedy, and even romance. When a film can cover all of these genres, it is bound to connect with many people in the audience. Forrest Gump can also be included in the Vietnam War movie category because Forrest is sent off to fight the war in Vietnam after he enlists in the U.S. Army. The setting of the film was an influential part of why the plot was so good because the story took place during a very interesting and exciting part of American history. Another one of my favorite aspects of Forrest Gump is the soundtrack because it contains many songs that were produced during the setting of the story. It includes some of my favorites, such as ""Fortunate Son"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, ""California Dreamin'"", by The Mama & The Papas, and ""Mrs. Robinson"", by Simon & Garfunkel. The songs that were featured were very popular when they were released and continue to be popular in today's culture. The soundtrack simply adds on to the list of reasons why Forrest Gump is such a fantastic film. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest films of all-time and will continue to be for a very long time. I believe that it will definitely stand the test of time very easily and will be a classic in the future."

It will always be one of the best.<br/><br/>I can't believe how low the rating is. It deserves to be even higher up there. The plot and acting is magnificent. I've seen it at least three times and it's always good to see it again, because it's just that good. There is something that makes this really unique. It is really difficult to explain what that exactly is. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it. 10/10"

","Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.<br/><br/>A story of a man, who had everything going against him and yet he did whatever best he could. And when you do your best in whatever you have taken upon, you would mostly succeed. And there in lies the story of FORREST GUMP. When you are determined, even Gods would come down embracing you. Look at that scene in which there were no shrimps and after the hurricane there is plethora of shrimps and they become millionaires.<br/><br/>Yet, most of it is untrue and even hypothetical, like running coast to coast for 3 years. Even such fabrications will be loved and embraced, if we love this man called Forrest Gump. He does everything from meeting the president to running the whole of America to being a war hero and setting up his own business and becoming a millionaire. And did I say, this was against all the odds, he had, yes, he did not have legs and he got them back by running, he is mentally retarded, yet he proves all of them wrong by being successful in everything he does. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, has given us one of the best performances ever and this is a great character in itself. I have learnt from wikipedia that Robert Zemeckis the director, deviated from the novel written by Winston Groom. Now, what he did as a the director was a good thing and that is what I strongly believe. I did not read the novel though, but I loved Gump the way he is, so I think the changes were good. <br/><br/>Technically, I liked the editing, though nearly 2 and half hours long, it was not at all so boring. Also, the screenplay by Eric Roth was good. The direction, I loved it. Look at that feather fly from skies to Gump's feet and then fly away at the end, just a glimpse of what direction is. Special effects were great specially in terms of putting Gump with the presidents and even John Lennon, I just liked the way it was all done. Also, I loved the dialogue and what a piece of writing this was, you can turn simple things interesting by saying them in an interesting way, and this movie does that through dialogue.<br/><br/>Above all, I loved Forrest Gump as he is and more than anything, I loved Tom Hanks as Forrest, this is a great portrayal of a character. From dialect, to walking style to costumes, everything was appealing and interesting about Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>It's a 4/5 for a movie that is great in terms of characterisation of a man who has has a ""JUST DO IT"" spirit and for Tom Hanks who has given one of the best performances."

","A nice and inspirational movie. Loved this movie very much. I like the story very much its funny, and also touching. Forrest Gump, despite of his mental incapacity he meets popular person in the world, influence other people and helped them. He had a company and become rich.He is also part of some popular events. My favorite scene in the movie when he start running fast he breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Also the war in Vietnam where he met his friend Bubba who like to talk about shrimp.During the war he save Lieutenant Dan and become partner of his company and also heartbreaking when Bubba his friend died. While Forrest is in recovery for a bullet shot to his buttock he discovers his uncanny ability for ping-pong, eventually became popular and rising to celebrity status, later playing ping-pong versus Chinese teams.He endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles, earning himself $25,000, which he uses to buy a shrimping boat, fulfilling his promise to Bubba.

"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","1","26 August 2014"," A Historically-Gazing Slice of Life That's Sometimes Lost Amongst the Clouds
","Still very sweet, earnest and emotive after all this time, though it very nearly drowns in a perpetual stream of fibs and exaggerations. The constant pop culture references, and Forrest's appearances in just about every last hallmark moment of his generation, act as both a blessing and a curse. They represent a majority of the film's enduring identity, with a certain amount of charm attributed to the seamy, not-quite-there execution of the archival footage, but it's often a case of too much of a good thing. His silly contributions during the continent-spanning run that seals the second act are particularly egregious - good for a very quick snort, but ultimately damaging to the story at large. It's got a big, heavy heart though, and that carries it a long way. Tom Hanks, of course, is to thank for a great deal of that, but Gary Sinise is almost just as good in his cigar-chomping, world-loathing, hat-hanging support role as Lieutenant Dan. A one-of-a-kind classic that may have been just a smidge overrated at the time it was released, its cornerstone scenes still hold up very well and the classic cast of characters may as well be family at this point."

","I'm spoiling the end of the movie. <br/><br/>I believe this was a made for TV movie. Had a boy in it, who was early twenties I believe. He was driving somewhere and his car fell off a cliff. His mom got a search party with police and they had a hard time finding him. I think he might have took a different route to wherever he was going. In the end his mom finds him and it was days later and she thought he was dead but he was just barely alive. <br/><br/>I try to find an old animation movie that I watched as a kid on TV in the 90s (it could be older) and made an enduring impression on me. I remember the ending most vividly: a bloody battle on the top of a hill where two armies clashed, apparently led by a man and a woman inside cyborgs or some kind of robotic vehicle. These two seemed to share a history (fling?? / siblings??) and confronted each other beside a nearby river. They both died. The movie ended tragically with a shot of the great tree on the top of the hill, surrounded by corpses of both armies.. <br/><br/>The only other thing I recall is a young man and a woman that spent the night in a house and in the morning the woman transformed in a butterfly and flew away. The man tried to catch her but without success. The butterflies (souls??) seemed central to the movie. <br/><br/>It was all very depressing (as you can imagine :-P) but it was so powerful animation that stuck to my head for years! I tried to find it in IMDb, google and anime sites through keywords but to no avail. It seemed to be Japanese animation but I cannot be sure.. <br/><br/>Sorry it's so vague I saw this on CBC years ago. Thanks!!"

I think it's got that typical boy chasing girl routine which is expressed so emotionally and sensitively. I like the realism of this film, how it focuses on real life issues and how they're incorporated into Forrest's life. I think this film is brilliantly written, shot and presented so that the audience feels the true depth. I especially love how everything Forrest gets into is the simple ""in the moment"" attitude which says a lot about society which I especially enjoyed the most. A fantastic film, recommend to all.

"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","1","22 July 2014"," Everyone has got to see it at least once!
","There are certain films that literally anyone who participates in viewing films has seen and should see and ""Forrest Gump"" is a prime example. ""Forrest Gump"" is a unique type of film that is a narrative/flashback/current time style film about one man named Forrest Gump, one of the biggest cinematic character icons of all time from legendary actor Tom Hanks. Forrest is mentally challenged. He doesn't suffer from mental retardation, but it can be implied he is slightly autistic. Forrest Gump has had an incredible life. After being bullied as a child for having braces on his legs and being autistic in Georgia, he went on to be an all American football player due to his tremendous speed and ended up meeting JFK. He was a war hero in Vietnam where he lost his friend Bubba but later took care of his family financially due to becoming very successful in Bubba's shrimp business. To add on to Forrest's talent, he became an international ping pong player after becoming skilled in the war hospital and makes a national news landmark by leading many others to go for a run around the country. But the events that shape Forrest's life are not by his achievements but from his relationships. His childhood lover Jenny (Robin Wright) has always been Forrest's main motivation. After a fun childhood and having an abusive father, jenny ends up making mistakes. She became a model for an inappropriate magazine, became a singer at a sex club, joined the hippie movement while Forrest was ironically fighting the war where she became a drug addict, and became highly depressed. Forrest also met his friend Lieutenant Dan, his war leader who lost his legs in Vietnam before Forest saved his life. The two have a fascinating relationship. Forrest and his mother are also very close and encourages Forrest commonly. Forrest Gump tells his story to various people on a bench while sitting on the bus station. What writer Eric Roth does to this adapted story is show us how the simplest people can be inspirations and even heroes. I bet 10/10 people 9/10 times would ignore whoever is next to them and find no interest what so ever. Forrest Gump is a man of amazement and can teach us that no matter one's disability mentally or physically, they can be important people. Director Robert Zemmeckis takes us throughout American History and shows how one man's life related to some of the most crucial times our country faced. He uses great time change and uses the shift between flashbacks, narration, and modern time beautifully. We get great film aspects to show this inspiration come to life. The different types of locations are designed beautifully, from Vietnam to the white house, we see amazing settings to portray the life around one simple man. The beautiful character development and classic text allow us to be wrapped around in pure movie magic and experience world class cinema from a talented team. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump is genius and fun to watch as we see this man be brought to life by one of the greatest actors we will ever see. The supporting cast is terrific and everyone in this picture gives tremendous effort to give us a classic film. It isn't recognized this widely for no reason. The most famous quote from this film is ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your going to get."" Well, with Forrest Gump you definitely know what your gonna get... an amazing film that is inspiring and reflecting on how each person is beautiful."

","Forrest Gump is a 1994 movie directed by Robert Zemeckis starring Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, a mentally handicap man who tells his life's tale to anyone who will listen while he awaits the reunion with his childhood sweetheart. Despite being told that he is different, Forrest's mother raises Forrest with love and advice, which leads to Forrest having crazy adventures as he ages and leaves his home. Throughout the film, Forrest is reunited briefly with Jenny as they both live out America's history in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Forrest Gump is a heartbreakingly honest and breathtakingly funny film capable of captivating audiences.<br/><br/>The message behind Forrest Gump is simply that a true innocence of character will get he anywhere in life, even if he does not mean to go there. Forrest was always just in the right place at the right time, minding his own business. At one point, all Forrest is trying to do is go to class and he ends up on the news in a racial battle at his college. However, Forrest managed to stay innocent and kind in a crazy time, which shows that if even those that are said to be destined to be different are not always destined to fail. Jenny often talked about how destiny influenced everything, and she was right, only from most perspectives, despite his handicap, Forrest still had a better life than her.<br/><br/>One of the best parts about Forrest Gump is Forrest himself. Forrest is not stupid; he is just a bit slow, but he is pure and honest to the core, which makes for both hilarity and heartbreak during such a turbulent time, with racial issues dividing the country, assassinations of people who prompted peace, and wars raging across the globe, not to mention all the other drugs, politics, and moral issues tearing America apart. Characters aside, my favorite part of Forrest Gump was the use of actual historical events that gave the film a more authentic and realistic feel."

I argue back saying it only won 6 Oscars (compared to others that won more), that the academy just loves Tom Hanks and Robert Zemekis, and how they are better movies than Forrest Gump. We have to put the argument on hold due to the fact that we were walking to a wedding and had arrived. While sitting in the church at the ceremony, the priest's first words in his sermon are, and i kid you not, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you are gonna get"".

","In the movie Forrest Gump made in 1994, is about a man with a low IQ, who become a friend to Jenny as a child. His mom teaches him about life and to chose his own destiny in life. Tom Hank plays the role of Forrest Gump. Robin Wright is Jenny Curran, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dan, Mykelti Williamson plays Bubba, and Sally Fields plays Forrest Gump's Momma Mrs. Gump. <br/><br/>The movie opens with Gump sitting on a park bench and he picks up a feather. He will begin telling his story starting when he first met Jenny. Jenny has helped him when he was little by telling him to run from his bullies. Forrest were leg braces as a child, and when he ran one day, his braces broke off, and he never wore them again. Forrest began to fall in love with Jenny, but she had her own demons. Jenny would move away, and Forrest would begin his journey in life. First begin the Vietnam War. At the end of the war, he would once again be reunited with Jenny. And she would also once again leave him again as she does a couple of times. <br/><br/>As he sits and talks to everyone that would sit on the park bench, he remembers everything that he has done in his life up to the time he is sitting there. His love for ""his Jenny"" is strong. He also makes some good friends along his way. The first being Lt. Dan from the army. And Bubba from the war. He would lose Bubba in the war, but Gump tried to save him. But as Gump moves forward, he would honor his friend Bubba when Gump gets some money. Lt Dan would help Gump in the shrimping business.<br/><br/>Another major scene takes place when we find out why Gump is sitting on the park bench. He goes to see Jenny, and finds out that he is a father. Gump also learns that Jenny is sick. They end up being married, where Lt. Dan comes back to attend the wedding. Gump spends the rest of the days taking care of Jenny, and then taking care of his son, once Jenny passes away.<br/><br/>Thinking of a movie that is similar to Forrest Gump would be the Notebook. In the Notebook, there is narration like Forrest Gump. There is a man in love with a women, and they go different ways, but do end up back together. Both movies are symbols of love. <br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Forrest Gump. He goes beyond everything to find his love. Even though they weren't together, he still loved her, and only her. That love he has for Jenny, would bring them back together and they would have a son. Just like his mom told him to find his own destiny in life, he never stopped searching for ""his Jenny""."

","I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. This movie is an amazing movie, with themes still relevant today although its outdated nature. well worth watching for people of all ages. I personally watched it with my family and siblings 4, 7 and 9 and they loved it. Tom hanks pulls off the Character of forest gump amazingly, and the new restaurant chains dedicated to the movie are also a great hit."
"sme_no_densetsu","9","1","1","19 June 2014"," One of the best films of the nineties
","1994 was a pretty good year for film. Along with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" we got ""Forrest Gump"", an idiosyncratic movie that became a global phenomenon. Popular with both critics and audiences, it accomplished the rare feat of winning the Best Picture Oscar while also ranking #1 at the box office for the year.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the title character, a dim-witted Alabamian who unwittingly plays a part in some of the key events of the 20th century. From inspiring Elvis Presley's signature gyrations to meeting the president (twice), Gump pops up all over the place as either a participant or an observer. This tour through American history will hold special appeal for baby boomers but those from subsequent generations with a reasonable grounding in American history will also get a kick out of it. However, the movie isn't just a nostalgia trip. The central love story supplies a strong thread linking everything together, as does Gump's relationship with his mother and his two best friends.<br/><br/>That being said, perhaps the main reason why the story comes off as well as it does is the actors. Tom Hanks, in the title role, is the movie's anchor. His performance is by turns funny and touching and it led to a well-deserved second consecutive Best Actor Oscar. The rest of the principle actors were scarcely less impressive. Sally Field as Forrest's mother, Robin Wright as his long-time love interest and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan all gave awards-worthy performances. Also worthy of note is Mykelti Williamson, whose relatively small role as Bubba was nevertheless highly memorable.<br/><br/>In terms of film-making craft, the movie shows exceptional polish. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is always well handled and the production values are excellent. The story's breadth provided ample opportunity for striking visuals and varied settings. ILM's Oscar-winning visual effects (which memorably inserted Hanks into archival footage, among other accomplishments) also deserves credit, though some of the effects are admittedly a little rough in comparison with future efforts. Throughout, Alan Silvestri's Oscar-nominated score provided a solid backdrop in tandem with countless shrewdly chosen period-specific pop songs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, ""Forrest Gump"" is not without its detractors. Some claim that the movie is overly sentimental and that the title character is less than endearing. I don't agree with that at all. The movie's poignancy is well-earned and Gump himself is an iconic character vividly brought to life. In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, even considering its tough competition."

He is running his childhood with his best and only friend Jenny (played by young Hanna Hall). His mom (played by Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his own destiny. Then he goes to college and makes the football team while in college, and then goes to the army for the Vietnam War finding new friends Lt. Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise) and Bubba (played by Mykleti Williamson). He wins medals and creates a shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, create a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, with bumper stickers and songs, donating to the people, and meeting the president several times. However it's all irrelevant to him when he can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright). This was an inspiring masterpiece for the whole family to watch and also one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his entire career and Robert Zemeckis' boldest feature film he had ever made."
"mpalmer118","9","1","1","4 May 2014"," A timeless movie
","Tom Hanks, stars as the title character in the novel turned movie, Forrest Gump. The movie depicts Forrest's many adventures, as he narrates them to a string of strangers at a bus stop. ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" Forrest states to a stranger reluctantly listening to his story. Despite his low IQ, Forrest has inadvertently become a part of many of the history making moments in second half of the 20th century. The film follows Forrest as he teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a college football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, punches a Black Panther, defeats the Chinese in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, builds a successful shrimping business, and becomes wealthy through an investment in a ""fruit company"" aka Apple Computers, and becomes an icon by running across the country for several years. Intertwined throughout his adventures is his undying love for Jenny, played by Robin Wright. Sally Field's stars as Forrest's mother, whose wisdom is extolled throughout the movie. Gary Sinise stars as Lieutenant Dan, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam and reluctant friend.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump uses a series of flashbacks and voice over narrations to tell the story of a seemingly less than extraordinary man living an extraordinary life. This style of storytelling has been used, with mixed results, in movies for years, including the iconic Citizen Kane. The opening scene find Forrest sitting on a bench as a feather slowly drifts in the wind and lands at his feet, this sets the pace for the movie and subtly introduces one of the themes, is life a series of coincidences or are we the masters of our own destiny? Forrest tells one of his listeners, ""My momma always said, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna to get."" His life certainly seems to reflect that sentiment. Through a series of well-timed coincidences Forrest influences some major historical events, including The Watergate Scandal, and falls into some incredibly fortuitous opportunities, like his college football career. Other events seem to be more of guided destiny, like his service in Vietnam, which led not only to meeting Lieutenant Dan, but also his ""best good friend"" Bubba. He subsequently goes on to save half the platoon, including Lieutenant Dan and brings Bubba's shrimping boat business to fruition and becomes very wealthy. The antithesis to these opportune events is Forrest's unrequited love for Jenny. Throughout all the stories Jenny pops in and out of Forrest's life, even when it seems that she is gone forever. He has loved her forever, but she keeps running from her past, in which Forrest is irrevocably entwined. Eventually destiny wins and Jenny, now terminally ill, returns a final time with their son, Forrest. The ending scene ties the theme back in, as the same feather falls from a book and is again carried away in the wind. <br/><br/>The movie's portrayal of all these incredible events hinges on some incredible CGI and special effects, but not the fast-action, explosive effects we often see these days. Forrest's image is superimposed on historical news reels, at times with humorous results, like showing his unfortunately placed war wound to President Lyndon Johnson. One especially noteworthy example is the editing to reflect the loss of Lieutenant Dan's legs. In every post-Vietnam scene that includes Lieutenant Dan, his legs had to be digitally removed. The digital editing is so seamlessly done that some viewers thought that actor Gary Sinise had actually lost his legs. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump successfully uses a mix of CGI enhanced flashbacks and voice-over narration to cause the viewer to reflect on destiny and the ripple effects we may have on the people with whom we interact. Are our lives just a series of coincidences or the destiny we chose?"
"green35","Null","1","1","3 May 2014"," My Review Forrest
","The movie starts off with Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) at a bus stop telling his life story to all the strangers that sit next to him on the bench. As new strangers sit on the bench with Forrest, we get a different decade of Forrest's' life. Forrest's story starts when he had to wear leg braces as a kid and how the other kids teased him and bullied him, but Forrest's mother Mrs. Gump (played by Sally Field) tells him that stupid is as stupid does. Those words help Forrest to tolerate the bullies. Forrest's mother is determined to enroll Forrest in a regular school but she is told that his IQ is below the learning level and a special school would be more appropriate. Instead of listening to the school officials, she enrolls him a regular school against the odds and his first day of school he meets Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) and falls madly in love with her. As Forrest would say, ""Jenny and I are like peas and carrots."" Forrest had two special friends that he met in the military, Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue (played by Mykelti Williamson) and Second Lieutenant Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise). Forrest also finds out he has a son Forrest Gump Jr. (played by Haley Joel Osment) that he later raises.<br/><br/>There are several themes in Forrest Gump. The first theme would be dealing with death and that death is a part of life and we all have to deal with it. Forrest had to deal with the death of his good friend Bubba, his mother, and Jenny. Another theme is not to give up. Forrest deals with so many obstacles throughout his life and by him being mentality and physically challenged, but he always pulls through those challenges by remembering things his other taught him. Forrest dealt with the legs braces and being bullied by other kids and he dealt with the rejection from Jenny not wanting be his girlfriend or to marry him. The last theme would be accepting yourself for who you are and value your own personal worth despite the odds. Forrest's mother taught him to love, always be pleasant and polite and to remember that life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. The movie Radio would be similar to Forest Gump. Radio (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) deals with similarities as far as being raised by a single mother, dealing with death, along with physical and mental disabilities.<br/><br/>The lighting in the movie for the themes was very appropriate, for example when Forrest spoke with his mother the day before her passing the lighting had a serenity essence almost as if to state Mrs. Gump would have eternal life in heaven. When Forrest's lost his very best buddy Bubba, the lighting was dark and gloomy, but I'm sure that was due to the two being in the middle of a war. If you pay close attention the lighting changes when Forrest takes pride in himself and practically referring to the part when Forrest is asked to mow and service the lawn at the university he attended. He was mighty proud.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump was raised with values and morals and the movie portrays those values and morals, but it also makes a statement how America needs to embrace those values and morals."
"matthewpwillson","10","1","1","3 May 2014"," The best film that I have ever seen
","In my opinion Forrest Gump is the best film I have ever seen. It is incredible how they have managed to fit a man's whole life into one film, that lasts just under two and a half hours, and not compromise on quality. They spend just enough time on every point in the film, so that you get enough detail but still don't get bored. <br/><br/>The character may not be considered clever but he still manages a lot in his life. The film sees him achieve a lot from going to war in Vietnam, to being a professional Ping-Pong player. However, The main aspect that keeps popping up in every section is how great he is at running. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks portrays the Forrest brilliantly and makes him a unique character unlike any other. The fact that he does not understand the world around him makes the film only funnier, especially in his narrated parts.""They said it was a million dollar wound, but the army must keep that money cause i still ain't seen a nickel of that million Dollars.""<br/><br/>Another clever thing about the film is that Forrest always seems to be there when famous events happen, and you see them from his perspective (normally him not understanding what's going on.<br/><br/>This film is great spanning across many different genres including romance, drama, action and always comedy."

","Forrest Gump is the best movie ever made. When I first saw it I only sat through the first minute of it and turned it off. After growing with my age and watching a lot of other movies, Forrest Gump was the one that I couldn't take my eyes off of. Forrest Gump is the first movie since Titanic that has made me cry because of Tom Hanks and Gary Sinises outstanding performances. Almost never in my life have I been captivated by a movie and how it played out. Forrest Gump is neither too long or too short, for me it never dragged along and made me bored. Out of the six Oscars that Forrest Gump won, this movie rightfully deserved all of it. Pretty much everything made sense to me which made this movie really great for me. All in all I give Forrest Gump a 10 and think that this is a movie that should be watched for the rest of time."
"English-Class2014","8","1","1","28 April 2014"," A must for everybody interested in films.
","'Forrest Gump' is a movie that tells the story of the life of a fictitious character called Forrest Gump, who would probably be diagnosed with a mental disorder nowadays. In Gump's life, he must overcome many obstacles, which he does in a way we might call a wonder. The movie is a literary adaptation of the eponymous book by author Winston Groom. In our opinion, the movie is a must for everybody interested in films. It convinces with its great story, its humor and the love with which it was made. Historical events are indicated and changed in an amusing way. For the most part, the look is kept simple, but in some scenes - like the one with former US-president John F. Kennedy - the video editing exceeded everything imaginable at this time (1994). Other points why the film is close to perfect are the music, the message and, last but not least, the incredible performance of main actor Tom Hanks. The movie won six Academy Awards and was nominated for another seven. In addition, it won three Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for four more. We think the awards speak for themselves and if you don't believe us, watch it!<br/><br/>Andreas S. and Jakob W."
"vhugo2210","10","1","1","27 April 2014"," Largely enjoyable and brilliant
","For me this movie is just Tom Hanks. The story is there and it is fine, but everything depended on the 1st role actor. I hear often that is is easy for an actor to play an imbecil but I sure doubt that anyone could play it as well as Hanks. At first I did not find the character believable. It seemed to have Hanks in the wrong flick. After like 15minutes of dubbing I found myself totally submerged in the story. A young, stupid boy who somehow managed to live his life with honor and without hurting anyone else. Everything thanks to his mother who loved him so much. This movie sneaks up on us like we never seen it and a simple little chain of events becomes a huge story of a man and life and what it is all about. Serious, funny and dramatic at the same time."
"efrainr1974","10","1","1","21 April 2014"," The year was 1994....
","The year was 1994, an absolutely amazing year for film. Never since I was born, or to my recollection, since that year, has there been a better year for movies. Pictures like The Shawshank Redemption, Legends of the Fall, Pulp Fiction, even The Crow all came out that year. And then there was the year's crowning jewel - Forrest Gump. This is probably my favorite movie of all time. Anytime I feel down, or just tired of the world beating down on me, I can watch Forrest Gump and for a few hours, just forget everything. Twenty years later (and I can't believe it's been 20 years!) the movie still has the same effect on me. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Forrest Gump, and man born with both physical and mental challenges, but with the wisdom and guidance from his mother, suggestion from his best friend Jenny (to just run if he was in trouble) and his kindness and good nature (and somewhat bumbling nature), he succeeds in life. Whether he's running from bullies, or bullets, or just life and heartache in general, Tom Hanks performance (coming off his first Oscar Win for ""Philadelphia"") was his absolute best. He rightfully won his second Best Actor Oscar for his performance here. The trials and tribulations Forrest overcomes, while humorously interjecting himself in some of the most memorable events in American History from the 60's and 70's makes the film that much more fun to watch. The supporting cast (Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields) and really everyone in the movie does an exceptional job of bringing it all together. Forrest Gump is a feel good movie, and a true staple of the 1990's. The soundtrack is one of the very best ever compiled for a movie, and one of the few times I ran out and bough a movie soundtrack. I almost wish I could go back to 1994 and experience it again in a movie theater. But I'd want to do that for every major picture of 1994. <br/><br/>If you've never experienced Gump - I highly recommend that you do! Even more-so if you're in need of cheering up."

This story is full of emotion and makes us realize that there are true heroes living among us. The soundtrack to the film is one of my favorites of all time because it fits to the time period of the film as well as to the emotion of each and every scene. As far as war films go, this is the best of all, although it does not focus on the actual wartime for more than a few minutes. Furthermore, I have never been a big fan of romantic films yet this one is a tear jerker through and through. It makes you understand just how loyal Forest is to Jenny, yet she doesn't give him all of her love until near the end. Then the hearts of every viewer are broken when she dies after such a short period of time together."

It is not until the end of the film that they are able to come together and stay together, this time is but short when Jenny passes away.

","Do we have a predetermined destiny or is it all just a coincidence? Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, is not quite sure but, he is going to take us on a journey throughout his life and try to figure it out. Mama or Mrs. Gump, (Sally Fields) serves as his moral compass and tries to direct her son through life's lessons. She encourages her son to be himself and he is not different than anyone else, even if he has a low IQ of 75. His school age love, Jenny (Robin Wright), whom he will always love, takes on a role to protect him and his innocence. She even tries to protect him from her life choices.<br/><br/>Hank's outstanding and convincing performance takes us through life and American history through the eyes of incorruptibility and taking each interaction at face value without the cynical perspective of the outside world. When faced with life's diversity, Gump equivocally responds with one of Mrs. Gump's famous life lessons such as, ""Stupid is, as stupid does!"" Forrest achieves a lot in his life like, becoming an All- American football player, being awarded the Medal of Honor, and last but not least becoming a millionaire. He even meets three different Presidents. Unintentionally proving that he is capable of more than what the outside world had imagined and became more successful in the process. As with anything in life, his great fortune is also accompanied with loss. He struggles to understand why it has to be a part of life.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's magical composition carries us through the emotional ups and downs of love, loss, and life while smoothly transitioning us through time. Each piece of the soundtrack corresponds appropriately to the time period, convincing us even more that that is where we are.<br/><br/>In ""The Notebook"" we are taken on a similar journey through love and life lessons that spans over a period of history. Throughout the film you are left to wonder if the two main characters have a predetermined destiny to be together, much like Gump and Jenny. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis brilliantly utilizes the floating feather at the beginning and end of the film as a metaphor for human life. Gump decides at the end ""I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we are just floatin around accidental like on a breezemaybe it's both happening at the same time.""<br/><br/>If you have not watched Forrest Gump, I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed!"

Tom Hanks had been a big time actor in Hollywood even prior to his outstanding performance in this movie as he also starred in films such as Big, A League of Their Own, and Sleepless in Seattle. Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) was not an easy movie to play the lead role in as he had to play the role as a mentally challenged man with an I.Q. of seventy five and keep that role consistent through the entire movie. This role cannot be easily achieved by just anyone, but Tom Hanks went above and beyond playing the role of Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks earned himself an abundance of awards from this movie that consisted of a Golden Globe, an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a People's Choice Award for Best Actor, becoming only the fourth actor to win consecutive awards.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) is another aspect that makes this movie so great. A movie's soundtrack can really set the tone for a scene, and the soundtrack of Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) succeeded in setting a good tone with its choice of music. The movie's setting takes place from the mid to late twentieth century, and the movie's soundtrack is mostly based around that time setting with songs from that era. The soundtrack consisted of many 1960 and 1970s artists and bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and many more. The soundtrack of the movie really set the feel of the time setting it was placed in. The soundtrack was rated among the top ten for several months in the Billboard 200 album chart when the movie was first released.<br/><br/>The historical references in this movie make things a little bit more interesting through the way Forrest Gump somehow finds himself contributing to them. Throughout the movie Forrest Gump found himself in a lot of significant moments of US history without even knowing it. The first reference was in the beginning of the movie when Forrest reveals that he was named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Another example is when Forrest was a young boy his mother had a bed and breakfast, and they had a young musician staying with them by the name of Elvis Presley. Forrest had braces on his legs and was dancing to the music Elvis Presley was playing on his guitar. This dance that Forrest had displayed to Presley ended up being Presley's signature move when he became famous. Later on in Forrest's life, he was staying in the Watergate hotel where he witnessed the Watergate Scandal. Forrest called the front desk and told them what he saw, and, without even knowing it, he was the reason President Nixon was impeached for the Watergate Scandal. Many other significant parts of U.S. history were referenced in the movie such as the Vietnam War, in which Forrest fought in, the Black Panthers, the hippie movement, and even more. This movie does a good job of showing how the U.S. progressed from the 1960s through the 1980s to make this movie more interesting.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) not only provides a sense of humor and drama throughout the movie, but it also has a twist of love throughout the movie as well. Forrest fell in love quickly with a girl named Jenny when he meets her on the bus for his first day of school. He and Jenny spent most of their childhood together, but seem to fade apart as their lives went on. However, this did not keep Forrest from maintaining his love for her. Despite Jenny eluding him, Forrest did not let her go and continued to love her. Forrest and Jenny end up having a baby together and get married in order for Forrest to be the father of the child. This love story puts a great twist in the movie to put an emotional toll on the audience. It shows that anybody can love anybody despite any circumstances.<br/><br/>Overall, Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) is a great movie with a great message that will go down as one of the all-time best. The movie contains many different aspects that lead it to being such a great film. The use of Tom Hanks, the memorable soundtrack, historical references, and the heart-warming love story, all make this movie what it is. Forrest Gump (Zemeckis, 1994) will be a film that people will watch and love for a long time."

","Forrest Gump. Is simply impossible to dislike this film. While it don't has nothing groundbreaking or 'special' about it, is so...pleasant. Is a pleasure to watch this film, really. Is pleasant to the point of being almost a fault. If there is any film that deserves the title of 'greatest crowd-pleaser' , that one for sure is Forrest Gump. <br/><br/>It's above all a story about happiness, overcoming, driven by a uplifting atmosphere and involving segments(the Vietnam, the famous ending, the president's meetings) and while it has a few dramatic moments, it never takes itself too seriously to the point of turning the moment in a 'manipulative mess, like some directors usually do. Forrest Gump, believe in it or not, is not a manipulative film. It flows naturally. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is spectacular here. He is brilliant as Forrest Gump, I honestly believed he was 'retarded'. All his child mannerisms were convincing. And the ending is so...great! He watching his kid entering in the bus, realizing that he would suffer the same troubles that himself passed through, is arguably the most heart-breaking scene in the entire film.<br/><br/>Thiw film is not really...how can I say...well, Forrest Gump isn't really important for the filmmaking story, like Pulp Fiction is, for example , but still a very good film, regardless. You will not regret watching it. 8.5/10"

","Such and inspirational movie. Had watched this movie 3 times already (not in a purpose) and had such impression like I never watched it. It shows us that some -what so called not ordinary- people can do better than ordinary people. Never look down on what people do, there must be something in the end. ""Forrest"" in this movie did whatever he feels right and when he did it, he gave maximum effort without ever compromising it (at least that was I saw). I would suggest this movie for those who has little faith in his/her self. I myself see this movie as wake up call. That's the reason why I wrote this review. Pardon my bad English."
"shelovestravel73","9","1","1","8 February 2014"," Amazing movie!!
","Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely a classic you have to see it. It starts when Forrest is a little kid and being bullied. Jenny helps him run away from the bullies. He loves Jenny, even more when he grows up. He loves being at her place, by the tree. He lives with his mother but when he's about 20 he needs to go to Vietnam and there he meets the Genera (Gary Sinise). He saves the general but he isn't happy about it. But they eventually start being friends.<br/><br/>This movie is about friendship and love. But my absolute favorite from the movie is Forrest's quote; Life is like a chocolate box, you never know what you get."

","I think Tom Hanks did an excellent job along with all actors and actresses involved. This film is a classic piece and will always cherish it. Great job to everyone participated on this project. For the director, great cast members. Also the sound track was excellent, great stuff. My favorite part of this film was when Forest was running, it was like ""Run forest, run. That lines got me hooked into the film. However, as the film continue, you can see that Forest was a great, going to war, helping others around his community. I also like the Captain,I think the captain did a fantastic job as supporting actor. I always that guy in Ransom with Mel Gibson, he has a face of great character."

"essenceepperson","10","1","1","20 January 2014"," My opinion of the movie compared to the book.
","Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time; I even liked the movie more than the book. (Which is rare.) I saw the movie before I read the book; because the movie convinced me to read the book. Naturally, I thought the book would be outstanding because the movie was amazing and usually the books are better than the movie adaptations. The book was good, but had nothing on the movie. Sorry I'm not sorry. The book had a lot of profanity, which I didn't mind until it became overkill. The book does not have the ""run Forrest run"" scenes, nor did Forrest have a brace on his leg. Jenny and Forrest in the beginning of the book didn't even have a good relationship. Also, in my opinion, the book made Forrest have more of a rough personality, while in the movie, although tough, he was a sweetheart. I was so frustrated with the book that I didn't even finish it, it's sitting on my dresser; still containing a bookmark and all."
"Hamish_D","10","1","1","20 January 2014"," Forrest Gump
","""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get...""<br/><br/>And that famous quote begins a masterful story of a man named Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump who basically tells his life stories to people on a park bench around the bus stop. His life stories include the Vietnam war, genius Ping Pong skills, being in the All American football team, meeting President Kennedy, great running, making friends, falling in love with a childhood friend and being in a great shrimp company. We see his life story as flashbacks and we enjoy them, of course. I've never seen a movie quite like Forrest Gump. This movie made me laugh, cry and warmed my heart. Robin Wright portrays Jenny, Forrest's best friend since they were six years old and Sally Field is fantastic as Forrest's wise and caring mother. But the character that is considered to be my favorite character is Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan, who was with Forrest and the rest of the troops during the war. At first, his character's lifestyle made me feel sad, but later on Lt. Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and enjoyed life as it is. Forrest saved his life during the war and later on, he had to be amputated. This movie is one of my personal favorites and Robert Zemeckis' best film that he directed. The ending works out perfect too. Forrest is at the park bench because he's meeting Jenny and an elderly woman tells him that the apartment she lives in, is just around the corner. Forrest hops out of his seat and manages to find Jenny and also finds out that he is the cause of Jenny's 8 year old son. Afterwards, Forrest and Jenny get married and Lt. Dan shows up at the wedding with his new fiancée. Now we see that Lt. Dan is stabled and has changed his life. Later on, Jenny tells Forrest that she has an unrecognizable virus. At first I thought that it was because of Jenny's bad decisions in the past. And then Jenny passed away of sexually transmitted diseases. We later see Forrest talking to Jenny's grave and promising her that he will take care of their son... And he does. I have to be honest with you, when I first saw Forrest Gump, I was disappointed because of Jenny's death, but then I saw it again and I love it. I now realize that it was meant to be. She can't just live, knowing that she made risky and bad decisions. But the movie still had a heartwarming and sweet ending, involving Forrest saying goodbye to his son, who is going to school. This beautiful scene reminds me of Forrest's first day at school. <br/><br/>And as Forrest says goodbye, the feather that he collected at the start of the film, flew out of the Curious George book and it took us away from a film that is built to perfection. Definitely one of my classic favorites."

"agalbraith-633-379277","10","1","1","16 December 2013"," Has it all
","""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best contemporary films in the last couple of decades; it sees Tom Hanks's portrayal of an innocent, humble individual who goes by the name of Forrest Gump and sees his humble side conquer all as he becomes a success at everything he does but deep down behind all the success and fame is just a simple man who cares for human nature and loses everything he once loved.<br/><br/>This timeless classic has everything from drama, to romance, to violence to comedy to heartache. As a result it is difficult to determine what genre of film it really is.<br/><br/>A truly inspirational and heart-warming film that also allows for a bit of American History, and helps people who don't know a great deal about United States of America a further insight into their heritage and culture. Although admittedly some of the historical events are not portrayed that factually. <br/><br/>What makes this film so good is Robert Zemeckis attention to detail and is simply wonderfully directed. The story is what attracts so many people to Forrest Gump and it is wonderfully told through the direction of Robert Zemeckis. The super-imposed clips are superb in which Forrest Gump meets John F Kennedy, it looks like he was actually there at the time of recording through superb visual effects. <br/><br/>Alan Silvestri music is chilling and beautiful as well and simply adds to such an iconic film, the simple tune at the beginning when the feather is seamlessly flowing in the wind. Eric Roth's script work is excellent and achieved some of the most memorable film quotes of all time.<br/><br/>However, not everyone agrees that it is contemporary classic and some feel that it is totally overrated, echoes right-wing views and is too soppy and sentimental. However, I totally disagree you have to delve deep within the story to really understand the message."

The love he had for his mother was very touching as was her belief in Forrest. The combat scenes were terrifying. The love story playing out both beautiful and tragic. The lifetime friendship and bond he had with his lieutenant was awesome. Some of the best boot camp scenes EVER. I learned 100 different ways that one can prepare shrimp.

That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it.

","""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"

","Forrest Gump sums up American pop culture from the 60s to the 90s. The impossible to dislike protagonist Forrest Gump takes the film on an unforgettable journey through some of America's most famous moments. One of Tom Hanks' best performances and with a top notch director like Robert Zemeckis, it is hard to go wrong. Every single aspect of the film falls together perfectly, the supporting cast, cinematography, and especially the soundtrack give this movie everything it needs. At times, it may seem clichÃ© and unrealistic, but its really the heart of this movie that makes you fall in love with it. Forrest Gump is a must see for everyone."

","I LOVED this movie. It was so cutely written. The fortune's of a man who decided to take all the steps he needed to not only run, but to run for the one he loves. Forest Gump isn't just a POV of the 'simple minded' on heir views of love, but it's also the triumph you feel for him. Despite everything, home really was were the heart is. This movie will cause you to open your heart and your mind, following Gump on his journey of determination to prove he could be a real man for Jenny. He didn't stay down when he was bullied and he didn't, as most humans selfishly do, think of only himself. I would definitely recommend this movie for families to watch, it will always be a family classic."

"boisthebomb","9","1","1","24 September 2013"," Support makes the Difference
","This movie is excellent because of its supporting characters. The movie takes place during the 1950's to 1970's, and follows the journey of a simple man living in Alabama, named Forrest Gump. The movie starts off with him describing his childhood to a complete stranger, while waiting for a bus at the bus stop, and continues to tell his story to several different strangers. When he is telling his story he reveals that he fought in Vietnam, met a few presidents, and even won the Medal of Honor. Throughout his story, Forrest has a huge impact on the people in his life, which also have the same effect on him. I like the movie Forrest Gump because the plot hooks you right from the beginning, with supporting characters that make their own unique contribution to Forrest's life. <br/><br/>In Forrest Gump there are four supporting characters named Mama, Lieutenant Dan, Jenny, and Bubba. Each of these four supporting characters has an effect on Forrest's overall story. Mama is Forrest's mother, and is the foundation for his life. Mama is the character who raised him, taught him right from wrong, and was always able to help him by explaining the aspects of life in a unique way. For example, when Forrest asks what happened to his father, his mother says ""he is on vacation"" and uses this to explain that the father left them. Lieutenant Dan is the Lieutenant in charge of Forrest while he is serving in Vietnam. Lieutenant Dan is the man that inspires Forrest to be a better person, and to never leave a man behind. After Vietnam, the two of them go into the shrimping business together and make a lot of money. Initially when Forrest first meets Lieutenant Dan, Dan is very hostile. Once they go into the shrimping business together, Forrest mentions that Dan has ""coming to Jesus"" moment, which I think was influenced by Forrest. Jenny Curran is in my opinion the most important supporting character in the entire movie, because she is constantly Forrest's object of affection. In the beginning of the movie, they first meet on the school bus, where Forrest compares Jenny to an angel. From that point on, they become best friends and is mentioned that they are ""like peas and carrots"". In every significant event in Forrest's life, Forrest always mentions something about Jenny or that he misses her. They have several encounters throughout the entire movie, with one of them resulting to parenthood for Jenny and Forrest. Towards the end of the movie, Jenny reveals that she has some kind of virus but the doctors do not know what it is, and ends up asking Forrest to marry her. Forrest and Jenny get married, but unfortunately Jenny dies shortly after. This leaves Forrest to raise their son on his own. Bubba is the last supporting character, and is Forrest's other best friend, besides Jenny. Forrest meets Bubba in Vietnam, and persuades Forrest to go into the shrimping business.<br/><br/>Overall this is a must-see movie because of its use of supporting characters to heavily influence the main character's thought process and way of life. It is more interesting to watch a movie or TV show when you care not only about the main character, but the supporting characters as well. You're more intrigued to watch the entire movie because you want to know what the resolution is for everyone, because it is fairly easy to predict the outcome for the main character a majority of the time. In conclusion, I like the movie Forrest Gump because the plot hooks you right from the beginning, with supporting characters that make their own unique contribution to Forrest's life."

","Forrest Gump is a feat in cinematic history. It has set a new (high) standard for movies. So, why the hate? This movie I have seen on both most overrated and worst Best Picture Winners list. It is my favorite movie. However, on the other hand, it is also on Top Best Picture Winners lists. Forrest Gump has virtually anything you could want in a movie (besides crime). It has action (war violence), comedy, drama, romance... This list could go on and on. I'm simply saying this: this movie is fantastic, I love it, and it is a MUST-SEE for film fans (and anyone else). By the way, I cried, and I have never cried in a movie before. This movie is golden, it won six Oscars (and should have won more) and ignore the negative reviews.

She tells him to ""run Forrest, run"" and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt.

He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again...<br/><br/>Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it.

The period feeling of he times that Forrest moves through from meeting Elvis to serving in the Vietnam War are so real.

The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and starred Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field. The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a naive and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982."

"kcorder91","Null","1","1","9 July 2013"," Forrest Gump
","Forrest Gump Forrest Gump has to be one of the greatest stories ever written. Not only does it have a great plot and love story, but lots of historical context throughout. . It covers, wars, influential people at the time, famous people who have passed away, and how they impacted the world can be tied to the movie It starts' out in the late 50's and moves on through the late 80's, covering most major historical events. The movie starts out by an older Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting at Savannah, GA bus stop telling his life story to the fellow bus riders. Some are very attentive, some indifferent and some are simply in disbelief listening to the stranger tell them of his accomplishments, even though he doesn't view them that way. Forrest, a kind and faithful soul, grew up in Greenbow, Alabama in the early 60's, he has a low I.Q., which leaves him very prejudiced with the schools and other residents of his town. Along with the low I.Q., he has leg braces for most of his early childhood leaving people to believe he was going to be crippled for life.<br/><br/>His mother( Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to create his own destiny, despite the challenges she knew he would face because of his mentally capacity. He doesn't have any friends except a young girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), whom he loves from the second he lays eyes on her. Forrest and Jenny get into a altercation with a group of older boys from their school, and he breaks free of legs braces only to reveal that he is lightning fast, which leads to a college scholarship. Forrest and Jenny were inseparable until Jenny decides to run away from her abusive father and go travel the United States with a band of hippies.<br/><br/>After Jenny left their home town, Forrest enlists in the United States Army, only to be drafted to Vietnam. There he makes friends with a black man named Bubba, and LT. Dan. After many weeks together, Bubba convinces Forrest to open up a shrimping company once they are discharged from the army. Later on the platoon is attacked and Forrest has to run back into the chaos to rescue his fellow friends, Bubba dies from his wounds, and LT. Dan lost his legs, but survives thanks to Forrest. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor from the President. Forrest then goes on to be a famous ping pong champion and ends up winning thousands of dollars to help in invest in his and Bubba's Shrimp Company, Bubba Gump, which then becomes a giant multi-million dollar company.<br/><br/>Forrest is asked to speak at the Washington Monument about his life in Vietnam, since he was awarded the Medal of Honor and Jenny happens to be there protesting against the war. They end up going back to Savannah, GA because Forrest's mother is dying of cancer, and she was like the mother Jenny never had. Along his travels Forrest meets, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, John F Kennedy and many more. This movie is very rich historical context, it also is showing the audience that no matter where you started in life, you can always be the best you can be if you just try your hardest. I think this movie should be seen by every generation of young adults, because it's so rich a full of the past that is captured so well in the movie. The historical context just translate so much better than reading it out of a book, because of how the main character and his fellow friends have to deal with the problems of the world. I really loved how even though Forrest is so innocent, you really get a feel of how people in the 60's and 70's felt about segregation, their government, about the Vietnam War, and how the government evolves from the 50's all the way to the 80's. The movie has Forrest walk through the first desegregated school and help a young African-American Woman as she is walking almost what seems like hell on earth for her with screaming white protesters. Forrest also stumbles upon the Watergate scandal and actually calls the police on them. If you get the chance, watch the movie, if you have already seen it, go see it again"

","This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. It's so damn funny when Jenny dies.<br/><br/>Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time."

Although I am a girl I think it wouldn't be that bad to see how it was like to have Forrest's point of view and his experiences. There are also lots of things that you can learn from this film. So I would agree that you should definitely watch it ! I think Forrest is more of a child than a grown up which is also why I like him. This film cheers you up, makes you laugh and appreciate life."

","A heart warming tale of love, deception and greed. Forest Gump is a local idiot with a big heart and a fine pair of Nike trainers. This film follows Forest as he stumbles into one catastrophe after another in his endless pursuit of 'Jenny' a somewhat cynical tramp who inadvertently catches the young Forest's eye. Jenny allows Forest a seat on the school bus, triggering a life long obsession in which Forest is rejected time and time again. Happily for Forest he eventually wins through and by sheer perseverance and strength of character our hero finally worms his way into Jenny's bed, accidentally spawning a child, who Jenny tragically also names Forest Also seen sporadically throughout the film is a foul mouthed alcoholic named 'lieutenant Dan' one of life's losers, lieutenant Dan loses both legs in a horrific accident and holds Forest solely responsible. Dan often berates Forest until a touching scene towards the end when Dan shows up out of no where sporting a brand new pair of prosthetic legs and a lovely Asian style wife, apparently forgiving Forest and simultaneously giving him his blessing for his union with Jenny. We also learn of Forest's sound financial brain as he makes millions through some very shrewd investments. Overall this film is a tad far fetched for my pallet, having said that I was very moved by Hanks performance, it brings to mind two questions 1. Where did he get his inspiration? 2. How far will Hanks stoop to win an Oscar?"
"kechhh","Null","1","1","19 March 2013"," The Best in All of Us
","A great comedy and a great and touching drama. I felt this movie achieved a perfect balance of comedy and drama and depth. A balance that pure drama and pure comedies often fail to achieve. To me, this film was more touching than movies that were intended to be mainly touching turned out to be. In that, Forrest Gump was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>You see the small things he does and the greatness he inspires and causes in people all around him without having much intelligence. This helps remind us that no matter what kind of person we are, no matter what physical or mental capabilities we have, we still can cause so much greatness in people's lives both intentionally and in ways that we don't even know.<br/><br/>The movie is also inspiration in that you see a picked on persevere and either not notice or completely ignore the ridicule and setbacks he faces. He takes it and he runs as hard as he can.<br/><br/>His plain and complete niceness reminds us that it doesn't take much to be nice and cause positive change in other people's lives.<br/><br/>Also, the bus scene setups were great, enabling the great flashback style and narration storytelling that made it great. It was finally great to see in the end someone who actually stayed to care and listen and skip their bus.<br/><br/>Great movie. One of my favorite."

"InternetFamous","9","1","1","3 March 2013"," A fantastic heart-warming classic! (I give it a 9.5, but that's not an option!)
","I will be honest, this genre of film is not my favourite; but in order to write this review, I cast all of my pre-judgement views aside. I was fully aware that Forrest Gump was an excellent film before watching it, and afterwards I felt exactly the same! Tom Hanks was a near-perfect cast decision and he executed the role brilliantly as an innocent, less- able boy (who turns into a man throughout the film) and one can almost feel some physical chemistry between Hanks and the writer(s). I.e. *During his conversation when he first meets Bubba* '""My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.'"" This, along with many other lines is delivered brilliantly with Forrest's slow, ubiquitous Alabama accent. <br/><br/>Anyway, the film centres around an adult Forrest who sits at a bus stop telling people sat next to him about the story of his whole life (this is all shown throughout and shapes the film). Plenty of significant things occur during his life/the film; his friendships, losses, jobs and his determination - which is what most people capture after watching it.<br/><br/>All in all a film of many mixed emotions, and one that everyone should one day see"
"neightb","9","1","1","22 February 2013"," The Importance of a Shoe
","I'm reading a lot of reviews. There's a lot that say that this is a great movie, and most I see say this because it is very sentimental, and there are a few that say this is an annoying and poor movie, because of what they see from it. Both may be right, I don't pretend to be the know all of answers. I just have my opinion. To those who love this movie because it is sentimental and powerfully overwhelming, it's true. First time I saw this movie a fear tears leaked out here and there, but I think there's a lot more under the surface here. More depth than just a sentimental movie. If you think about it, shoes make many appearances in this movie. In the very beginning Gump talks about his very first pair of shoes, ones that limited his mobility and left him vulnerable. As those broke away (albeit in a very cheesy way) he got new shoes, ones that allowed him to run away from danger and run to success, in the form of football. This allows him to graduate from University, which, one might say, is part of the American dream. But that is a whole other side to the movie. He joins the war, and while he's there he runs from danger, acting the hero by saving lives. When he leaves, he runs into a man who has no shoes, mainly because he has no legs. Lieutenant Dan, now a cripple, is bitter and angry because he cannot walk, and he is limited both in his ability to move and go places as well as limited in his ability to see beyond anything in life other than when he should have died. When Gump and Dan start the fishing company, Lieutenant Dan realizes the importance of life, (once again, cheesy) and he swims off. We don't see him for a while. Annndd Gump gets bored. So he runs, all across America (part of American dream, to travel?...) He returns home, Jenny comes back, random scenes occur blah blah blah and we come back to Gump's wedding. Lieutenant Dan comes back! He has legs, even! And with his legs he has a beautiful fiancée. I'll skip the rest. Yes there are random side stories of his life that are cheesy or don't contribute to the movie, but those are fun and lively, if a little unrealistic. Ping-pong? Hah! This is only one part of the numerous layers that make up this movie. A satire of the American dream, viewing American history through innocent and unbiased eyes, a description of life even! This movie is powerful in its complexity, and intricate in its depth. And yes, it is sentimental and fun to watch as well. To those who critique it for the ""ignorance is bliss"" view, perhaps look a little closer. This movie is not saying that one can succeed by doing nothing but being lucky, (though that is the end result, so I see how you can believe that) but is looking back through all the things I mentioned just before in a unique and entertaining way. Gump views the world as he walks through it, wearing whatever pair of shoes, doing whatever it is he's doing. He watches events as they occur, and he participates in them in his own way. He shows, through his simple-minded example, that you do not need to be brilliant or manipulative, or even fully functional in order to succeed."

So there's the 75 IQ boy, with braces on his legs, no friends, no money, NO father, no school, ... living a dream. First he manage getting in high school football team on the RUNNER POST. That was good enough for a collage scholarship too and from this point he never stopped running: army, war in Vietnam, saving lives, Medal of Honor, three times in White House, ... .

The final act it's in the buss station Forrest taking his son at the school buss, just how his mother toked him at his first day of school. And just like that it ends in a perfect circle, Forrest waiting his son. When an actor plays very good in a movie you feel calling him after the name from the movie, like House for example, there is no Hugh Laurie for me after the serial, just House.

","I have never seen Tom Hanks in a role like this before, playing simple, oblivious Forrest Gump. This film is a real tear-jerker, causing me to cry several times as Forrest retells and lives through his toughest moments. Tom really makes you feel for his character, whether it be cringing, crying or smiling, you live every moment with Forrest. It is a story with many layers including love, war and achievement of Forrest's, unbeknownst to him, significant life. Forrest is a very easy to like character as he is brave, confident and dedicated, and you just want everything to turn out alright for him. This film is based on a book of the same name, but they have very different endings. I haven't read the book, but I doubt it could have similar success without the life that Tom Hanks breathes into the role of Forrest, Forrest Gump. I highly recommend this film to those who like feel good films and don't mind to cry a little, if you have a heart."

","Tom Hanks' convincing portrayal of an Alabama simpleton made for a remarkable story portrayed in a kind, entertaining and very poignant way. Movies should challenge your acceptance of your own status quo and capture your imagination. Robert Zemeckis understood the opportunity to tell his Hollywood slant on American history through Forrest's innocent eyes. With the bitter veteran act of Gary Sinese, and beaten path of Robin Wrights' Jenny, the focus is more on our individual choices despite life's hard knocks. Forrest grows alongside of America and even has his hand in that growth, as we all do. Idealism is as idealism does, right?"

","Forrest Gump (1994) Director – Robert Zemeckis Cinematographer – Don Burgess Writer – Winston Groom Editor – Arthur Schmidt<br/><br/>Favorite Quote – ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are going to get.""<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a great modern day fable. A fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. It's a very compilation of innocence, honesty and love. Forrest Gump (protagonist), named after a civil war hero, grows up in Greenbow, Alabama, where his mother runs a boarding house. Although Forrest is a slow learner, his mental impairment doesn't seem to bother him, his mother or his best friend. During the next thirty years, Forrest becomes a star football player, a war hero, a successful businessman and something of a pop icon. Through it all, however, there is one defining element in his life: His love for Jenny. She is never far from his thoughts, no matter what he's doing or where he is.<br/><br/>A trio of assets lifts Forrest Gump above the average ""life story"" drama, its optimism, freshness and emotional honesty. After graduating, Forrest enlisted in army and was sent to Vietnam. He has a very particular singular viewpoint on his time spent there which shows the essence of the title character's nature. Forrest Gump has several messages with several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, some of which are less obvious than others. The most frequently recurring theme is an admonition not to give up on life. Why surrender when you don't know what lies ahead? By contrasting Forrest's life with the lives of those around him, and by showing how the passage of time brings solace to even the most embittered hearts, the movie underlines this point.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an epic journey of a naïve and slow-witted man who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century. <br/><br/>Review by – Mayank Bhattacharya"
"florine1","10","1","1","18 March 2012"," All Time Classic!
","This is one of all time favorite movies. Forest achieves what many other people of higher IQ didn't, including being honorably discharged from the military and receiving a medal. He leads a practically healthy and successful lifestyle, and it is beautifully depicted here in this movie, with superb acting, heartwarming events, hopeful music and awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the stressing times of Vietnam-era 1960s.<br/><br/>In this film, Forrest touched the lives of many people, and does so with innocence and humility, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, he pursues goodness and success in life by helping others and being a football star, while rejecting drugs and all that bad crap. This is also a heroic film where Forrest Gump saves the life of fellow soldiers, including Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise), who at first condemned Gump from saving him because he wounded up having both his legs amputated. Later, it turns out he lead a recovered life afterward, walking on artificial legs and getting married. And, the part where it showed Forrest Gump running non-stop around the country for 3 years gave us a feeling that you should just let go of your worries, and strive for the best, for the sky is the limit.<br/><br/>This is another day in the life about a man with a low IQ, but he sure strives as depicted in this story. It is fun to see Forrest trying endlessly to win Jenny's heart, and he still treats her well even though she is not interested in him.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a very sweet, powerful, innocent and hopeful film. One of the best in cinema history, and surely worth is Oscar wins."
"joenasc","Null","1","1","11 March 2012"," An amazing movie.
","Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man with a low I.Q., but a good outlook on life. He lives through many historical events and always seems to run into his childhood friend/love interest Jenny.<br/><br/>Where do I began to start describing this film? Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, so he did a great job being Forrest. Gary Sinise also did a good job being Lt. Dan. Sally Field did good portraying Mrs. Gump, Forrest's mother. I loved how the movie showed many historical events, just to name a couple: the Vietnam War and the Reagan assassination attempt. Some of the lines were pretty funny and even heartfelt.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about this movie is how some of the characters talk about if we all have our own destiny or if we're just floating in a breeze. Something like that always gets me thinking about the life God has given me. <br/><br/>Overall, Forrest Gump is an amazing movie that anybody will enjoy and that everyone should see.

"Kubris","9","1","1","13 January 2012"," Touching- Zemeckis offers another serving of movie magic
","Kids these days don't see the right movies. While teens flock to the latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. But there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can say I've joined that rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see.<br/><br/>There's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. You probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. But if you haven't, read on! There are better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40's. The film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he doesn't care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny. At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop.<br/><br/>There's a reason the Blu Ray box says ""Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP"". His performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like ""the loving father who liked to touch her"", ""the men who dressed up like ghosts"" and other such things the audience understands. And the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated.<br/><br/>But Hanks isn't the only great: the film is host to a group of great characters. There's Jenny, Forrest's childhood friend and love interest. Bubba, Forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education.<br/><br/>There's a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero: he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'Nam, the hurricane, and the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm.<br/><br/>A note to those who saw Zumeckis' first great film, Back to the Future. Do not expect more of that. 'Future' was a comedy with drama added, Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene. <br/><br/>I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, Forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific: such events as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in ""that fruit company"" make for some historically accurate humour, one of Gump's greatest strengths.<br/><br/>One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question ""if he's smart"". This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn't see it at first. The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin' President JFK? The effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. I still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen.<br/><br/>On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a ""tonic of the weary in spirit"". That's the perfect description. Forrest Gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt. In a decade remembered for its cultural violence (Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Pulp Fiction) Forrest Gump is a beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs. 9.1/10"
"hall895","9","1","1","10 December 2011"," An amazing life. An amazing movie.
","Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as Forrest Gump. He's such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what ""smarter"" people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.<br/><br/>The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.<br/><br/>The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.<br/><br/>Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have been the smartest one of all."

","I was very shocked to see this movie only has an 8.3 out of 10.<br/><br/>There is sooo much going on in this movie...<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie, is that Forrest ""always did the right thing, no matter what cost."" People in the movie made fun of him for being ""stupid"" yet we as a society seem to reward/idolize people who are cunning who often do bad things. When Forrest had to go back into a jungle that was being blown up, he didn't even think about whether it was a good thing to do for his own safety, he just did it. He always stuck up for Jenny when someone was hurting her in any way; again he didn't hesitate, he just did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>The other thing is, all the historical parts of this movie. So many pieces of American History were visited! That alone was worth watching. Working Elvis into it was really funny, as was the part where he gets shot.<br/><br/>I also loved the music, almost every song in the movie was perfectly-fit for the scene it was in.<br/><br/>The acting, obviously, was superb... Gary Sinese was a breakout role IMHO. Loved him in this.<br/><br/>What an amazing, epic movie. IMHO, this was 100x better than the Godfather, or Gone with the Wind, which often gets rated much higher. Forrest Gump was simple and pure, a timeless movie no person should go without watching.<br/><br/>-Tracy Milburn"
"veerazeguet","Null","1","1","6 August 2011"," A well written, well acted, and well directed masterpiece with a great message
","Rating: 9.5 /10<br/><br/>Teenagers often wonder which roads will bring them to success in life. Should I do what I am told to do? Or should I do what I want to do? Forrest Gump has the answer. Forrest Gump won Oscars awards for Best Picture, Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best director(Robert Zemeckis), Film Editing, Visual Effects and Adapted Screenplay, winning over its competition, Pulp Fiction, in every category. What makes this masterpiece so successful?<br/><br/>Forrest Gump has it all: entertainment, comedy, and drama. It is both serious and funny, entertaining but thought provoking, powerful yet charming, and it could make you laugh and cry with equal degree of ease. Forrest Gump touches every human's emotions and inspires everyone in different ways. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis, known as the undisputed master of film technology, puts Winston Groom's novel to screen. He creates a masterpiece that combines the beauty of special effects and storytelling together. Adapted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Eric Roth, This film follows the journey of a not-so-smart man Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) through 30 years of trails and tribulation, placing Forrest within historical moments of history. How does he do it? He simply does whatever he is told and goes wherever the wind blows him. As Forrest would say ""Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you are gonna get"" However, The audience can hardly say that Forrest Gump is just an idiot who does whatever he is told to do. In fact, in his innocence, he does what he feels he has to do, no matter the situations and people around him, guided only by his inner sense of right and wrong. <br/><br/>Throughout the journey of Forrest Gump, he meets different interesting people who are each valued very highly by Forrest. His mom, played by Sally Field, fought for his son in every way possible despite the fact that he is gifted with an IQ of just 75 and Jenny (Robin Wright), the love of Forrest's life, whom he met at school. There is also Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), Forrest's Vietnam War friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day, and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) Forrest's lieutenant during his military service.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis uses the techniques of characterization and symbolization to express the message of Forrest Gump. The main characters in this film represent different types of people in our society. They are all different in terms of how they live their lives and travel towards their destinies. Forrest is the feather, floating in the air, with no direct route or known destination whatsoever. Jenny is more like the birds; she chooses her path with more awareness. While Lt. Dan is represented by legs, shoes, and roads; he knows what he is destined to do in life.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis, the director of the Back To The Future trilogy, once again accomplishes what he knows best: Special effects. The film covers a brief history of America for over a period of 30 years. Bringing this film credibility is the ability to place Forrest in history making events. These events range from Forrest teaching Elvis how to swing his hips to meeting Presidents for various accomplishments. These television clips are terrifically and creatively done in black and white by Zemeckis considering this is a 1996 film when Special effects haven't developed as much as they are today. <br/><br/>The camera work in this film is very beautifully done balancing a variety of camera techniques. For most of the film, the movie seems slow paced by the way camera work is done. The camera is kept very still but somewhat poetic and moves slowly as the film carries on. It symbolizes the calmness of Forrest's life that is always changing and moving along until he reaches his destiny. However, when the film calls for action, the camera shots do not disappoint. The shaky camera and close-ups showing the characters' emotions work well during action sequences. At one point in Forrest's life where he travels to many different places, Zemickis uses establishing shots to show all the different settings that take place in this film.<br/><br/>The actors' success in portraying their characters is a major factor in the film's awards. The on-screen chemistry between Tom Hanks and Robin Wright was phenomenal. Tom Hanks brings Forrest Gump into life and gives one of the best performances in his career. Gary Sinise is convincing as a man who is cheated by his own destiny. Eric Roth deservingly won Oscar for the beautiful screenplay he wrote which belongs in the company of sweet classics such as Rain man and Harvey. Forrest Gump could also be appreciated as a classic version of The curious case of Benjamin Button which has similar theme and message. Certainly, Forrest Gump deserves its place with all the classics in Film History. <br/><br/>The message of Forrest Gump is a life-changing advice for teenagers who are struggling with their lives out in the real world. Forrest Gump offers them a simple but straight-to-the-point advice. It doesn't matter who we are or what we do; whether we are stupid or smart, rich or poor, black or white. Forrest teaches us to do everything with the best of our abilities. Forrest is an ordinary guy like we all are. He is teased and bullied about his stupidity from those around him. But he, with a heart of gold and a low IQ, never gives up. He goes out there, lives his life, and puts effort in everything he does. If only we all do everything with effort, we will one day reach our destinies like Forrest did."

","To say it with a cliché: they don't make 'em like this anymore. ""Forrest Gump"" is pretty much everything that was great about 90s cinema and more. It's incredibly long, but it isn't boring for a second. The dialogues are all things at once, one moment they're fast-paced and hilarious and two seconds later they're slow and horrendously saddening. The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president. Everything just feels right in this movie, the script doesn't have a word too few or too many. If you haven't noticed, to me this is one of the best movies ever made."
"ComedyFan2010","8","1","1","10 July 2010"," It is overrated but far from bad
","The movie is a bit over-hyped. And I do think that Pulp Fiction should have gotten the Academy Award that year. But there are many times when I disagreed with the winner and this is the one time where I am not too upset because it is still a great movie.<br/><br/>It shows us the history through the eyes of Forrest Hump. He has a low IQ and this makes them look at things with the eyes of an innocent and pure person.<br/><br/>I disagree with the people who believe that the message of the movie is that one should never question authority. Forrest doesn't just follow. While he doesn't analyze his actions much, he usually does what he feels like. He does save Lt. Taylor even though he is telling him to leave him. He has a bunch of people following him on his run, which I think is another example where it shows that one should not just follow but try to understand why. And I never saw Jenny as a bad character. She was an abused person trying to find herself. Her death is not some kind of punishment for her actions and the fact that she was fighting for social changes. It is just a ""part of life"", and her life ends well because at the end of it she is finally at peace with herself. She lived a life that she wanted and at the end had a family and realized that Forrest is the one who loved her more than anyone even though she used to think that he doesn't know what love is.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. I loved Robyn Wright as Jenny and Gary Sinise as Ltd. Taylor.<br/><br/>I don't think it is a political propaganda of any kind. I don't know what the political beliefs of the director are, but I didn't feel it was pushing us in any way.<br/><br/>The movie has many messages. One would be to take all of lives opportunities. That even when it seems like nothing good will happen it might. That one should fight for what one believes in. That one can find love in the most unusual places It is a very sweet movie. One shouldn't take it to seriously, analyze it on a political level or wait for it to be believable. It is very unique and interesting. A bit too long and too sweet maybe, it is still very good"

","Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.<br/><br/>As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext ""In America""). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.<br/><br/>And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours ""disease of the week"" performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" - why did that get overlooked?).<br/><br/>But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special."
"leegilady","9","4","9","31 May 2007"," ""Like a Box of Chocolates""
","The movie ""Forrest Gump"" sends some very important messages to its viewers, by using different themes, a special setting, an unusual plot, and an ""everyman"" characterization. I think this movie is amazing. It follows the life story of Forrest Gump. It is a modern classic, which will probably be famous always, and will always be applauded.<br/><br/>This movie has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. Forrest repeats the phrase ""stupid is as stupid does"" many times in the film. It shows how people judge others on their academic intelligence, not on their emotional intelligence. Forrest has a very intuitive emotional intelligent, but he is judged by his academic intelligence, which is not very high. It presents to people how ""life is like a box of chocolates,"" and how you can choose what to do but you can't choose what you are and what your destiny is. The main character, Forrest Gump goes through many incidents in his life, which he doesn't choose. It also shows how Forrest is like a ""mockingbird"", bullied and judged unfairly because of his actions, appearance and understanding of things happening around him.<br/><br/>The setting of this movie is special. It takes place in a small fictional town in Alabama, and in the wider world for 3 generations, from late 1950's threw to late 1980's. The film begins in Forrest Gump's hometown. Forrest is born with a low IQ of 70. He has polio and has to wear braces on his legs. He has troubles being accepted by a school and has a very difficult time fitting in. He meets a girl named Jenny. Jenny has a horrible childhood that involves a father that drinks and sexually abuses her. Forrest has a very strong feeling of wanting Jenny as a girlfriend and follows her through the whole film. He goes through many realistic incidents, but his response to them is surrealistic. One of those incidents was the Vietnam War, where he meets two new friends called Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dane (Gary Sinise). He learns from both of them the meaning of friendship and commitment to one another. He also teaches them a couple of lessons; the real meaning of ""stupid is as stupid does"" and that everybody is equal and have feelings. Jenny appears in his life many times and leaves each time, mostly in the end; she leaves some ""foot steps"" after her. Those ""foot steps"" always lead him back to her and her influence on his life.<br/><br/>Both the actors' casting and performance were very good. An American director named Robert Zemeckis directed the film. Tom Hanks, who plays the role of Forrest Gump, does a good job of talking in a southern accent although he is not a Southerner. His character is used in a surrealistic way. Tom Hanks narrates the movie. He talks as a first person narrative. The way he talks creates an unintelligent impression from the viewer's point of view. Sally Fields who plays Mrs.Gump, Forrest's mother symbolizes a good motherhood, determination and protection of human values. Jenny (Robin Wright) represents total acceptance; she is the first one to really accept Forrest as he is. She never judges him on his academic abilities.<br/><br/>The movie sends its themes and messages in very unusual but interesting ways. It basically tells about the real and significant incidents through a long period of time. The movie definitely earned the 6 Academy awards that it received. It influenced so many people of many different ages in different ways. The script was very touching and the performances were amazing in presenting it. I think ""Forrest Gump"" is a film that everybody HAS to see."

","A clear case of mass appeal prevailing over cinematic substance. The uber-conservative approach takes to US history is frankly misrepresentational at best. In a technique reminiscent of Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the title character involves himself in all of the most famous events of the last forty years. Basically, the movie vilifies the protest movements of the 60's and preaches blissful ignorance under the apparently Gump-invented slogan: ""S**t happens"". Why create a hero who celebrates stupidity as a national characteristic is anyone's guess. Any true American patriot with an intelligence quotient above 75 would be deeply offended by the disservice the film does to our country. But even on a purely objective level,  ""Forrest Gump"" is deeply flawed. Not only does the film shamelessly borrow (or makes a very conspicuous ""homage"") from such masterpieces as ""Midnight Cowboy"", it is also poorly structured. Lacking any visible climax, it has a potential to end at any point during its third hour. Alas, it pointlessly drags on and on, as Tom Hanks gets into even more of his ""stupid"" adventures."

","Judging from the box office success, Forrest Gump is a film that has touched many millions of lives. It seems to work on many levels, some of which have been exhaustedly discussed in other opinions here. Shortly after seeing it at the cinema (a decade ago) it occurred to me that the character of Forrest Gump could be regarded as a metaphor for 20th century America. Starting from a difficult childhood, Forrest finds he has outgrown his disability, just as America's economic strength found its feet from 1900 to 1950. His pursuit of Jenny represents the American dream, lost to promiscuity and the moral blight of Vietnam. The death of Forrest's mother represents the passing of ""Norman Rockwell's America"" (for want of a better expression) and as we all know - a lot of sh** happened in the 70s. That Forrest finds wealth easily represents one of the great myths/truths about 20th century America - the land of opportunity. The parallels are numerous.<br/><br/>It might seem a simple film about a simple man, but it's resonance is far from accidental. This film should be compulsory viewing for anyone seeking to understand the psyche of modern America."

","This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my lifetime.  Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS.  This film is a very touching document of the second half of the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it is."

It starts with some shocking vulgar scenes of Forrest's youth such as his mother sleeping with the school's principal in order for her son to be accepted at a `normal school' and other kids bullying him around because he can't walk -or act- normally. Throughout the movie we see Forrest succeeding at everything he tries, not because he really tries, but because things seem to fall from the sky right in his hands. Example: he becomes wealthy after investing in an `apple company' which was in fact Apple computers. Oh, oh the irony. Plus to most viewers annoyance (yes even the ones who think the movie is a classic) he keeps faithful to his girlfriend Jenny, a personification of the decadence of 60's America, even after she dumps him badly a couple of times.<br/><br/>He have taught Elvis to dance, he was a hero in Nam, he met President Kennedy, John Lennon, he unveiled the Watergate Scandal, he played ping-pong in communist China.question is.what didn't he do?

","FORREST GUMP was a much more enjoyable experience for me when I was a boy. I thought it was a wonderful, magical tale about taking life slow and easy. But now I am older, and I see it as little more than an overlong showcase of clichés in which Tom Hanks talks in an embarrassing Southern drawl and plays a cardboard caricature.<br/><br/>I admire Forrest for the good old boy that he is; unfortunately, that's ALL he is. If you will pardon the hyperbole, our mentally retarded hero is so pure and innocent and decent and good-hearted that he makes Jimmy Stewart's character in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE look like a child pornographer. Whether he's the knight in shining armor protecting girlfriend Jenny from any menace; the selfless warrior rescuing all his comrades in the heat of battle; or the pious Christian whose faith remains fervent even as Lieutenant Dan Taylor curses God, Forrest Gump never does anything morally questionable.<br/><br/>In addition, throughout the film Gump displays an ""idiot savant"" personality type that really gets on my nerves. Now I know that some autistic people are blessed with highly unusual skills, but it is simply not feasible that Forrest is perfect at everything he does. He runs faster, plays better ping-pong, assembles a rifle quicker, is more successful in the business world, and in general proves to be a whiz at almost everything through a combination of freakish talent and dumb luck.<br/><br/>Not to be insensitive, but I think Gump had it pretty swell. After miraculously overcoming a childhood infirmity (really!) by busting the braces on his legs through sheer willpower, Forrest has an infinite string of good luck while all of his friends and loved ones either die painful deaths, surrender to their personal demons, or become human vegetables. These are the characters we should feel sorry for, and not Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>If Gump had been plagued with at least ONE character flaw - alcoholism, for instance, or some kind of sexual disorder - then maybe I would find it easier to sympathize with him and rejoice in his many accomplishments. As it is, however, Hanks's character is hopelessly squeaky-clean.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that FORREST GUMP is an inherently bad movie. It's fine, I suppose, if you like simpleminded morality plays. For the more cynical among us, however, GUMP is just too gummy."

And please, don't think I subscribe to the new-age physco-babble sensitivity training induced brain-damaged politically-corrected point of view. Gump, and movies such as it, are not meant to be pulled apart scene-by-scene. They are works in full and as such can only be truly understood when viewed as that. Works that try to show lifes experiences and the journey that is life are often hard to tolerate, much less understand if we become so hardened and cynical the we see only the entertainment value in them. It is like going to the La Boheme and seeing only a sad story about poor people, or going to see a Ballet and remembering only that you saw some people dancing about.

Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother.

The negatives included a few problems with continuity (such as the happy face being supposedly invented by Gump in the late 70s--it had been around for nearly a decade already) and perhaps too much emphasis on episodes as opposed to story.

It sends a strong message that even some people with low IQ could achieve the greatest in life. <br/><br/>Forrest touched the lives of many people, without any idea what he is really achieving due to his low-IQ. Still, his successes like becoming a football star and saving the life of fellow soldiers are evidence of the superb acting, heartwarming events and awesome directing. There is spirit and humor in the film, which provides some comedy-relief to the turmoil of the 1960s. <br/><br/>Overall, one of the best films in cinema history and certainly worthy of its Oscar wins. <br/><br/>Grade A"

","I think I've seen this film now about five or six times, the most of them when I was between 10 and 15, and now from a little distance it seems not illogical. ""Forrest Gump"" definitely is a film very suited for children with much of its not too subtle humour and you can recognize that it is generally made for a large, large audience with all its political correctness and clean showing of sexuality (I mean you can't offend anyone, can't you?). The background sound is provided by a huge amount of popular classics of the time. It's also funny how the film connects different historical occasions and persons and weaves them into the overall story, what makes a big part of the films charm. This film has heart, that's why I still like it, although there are some negative qualities that are reaching surface more and more for me. The main thing is that it's just too overly soapy dramatized. And after multiple viewings also Tom Hanks' acting starts going really on my nerves."

","at its best. When blockbusters work they do so through creating an alternate universe near enough to find our emotions while effecting magical art, beauty and experience. Forrest Gump is a shining example of that clarity. Hanks' performance is so natural that no wheels can been seen turning, astonishing when compared to Rain Man, the several iterations of ""Of Mice and Men"", and a myriad other movies where low IQ individuals are portrayed. Hanks brings to Gump dignity and individuality that allows us to love him without sympathy for his condition. All the supporting actors play off this lead wonderfully, without exception. The result is a fantasy as heartfelt as any in my experience. A truly wonderful film."
"TxMike","Null","3","7","2 September 2001"," A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.
","Once again, I watched ""Forrest Gump"" for Christmas. While it isn't a ""Christmas Movie"", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.<br/><br/>To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.<br/><br/>This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way ""A Wonderful Life"" has become a classic."

","I was shock with disbelief when I saw the top movie of that year was Forest Gump (1994) instead of Angels In The Outfield (1994) which was second from the bottom. It was as though society was sucking up to trash. I don't care who puts this movie up as something it is fact not worth watching, as most of it was boring, not very entertaining and certainly not funny. There's nothing interesting about a nerdy Peter Pan adult whose stupidity can easily be taken advantage of. I see nothing morally right about someone showing their bare buttocks. I got the impression that whoever came up with this concept really didn't have any good ideas and just slap this together to throw at the audience, just to make a buck. There's nothing worse than insulting the audience intelligence. The only drama in it is the unpredictability of what this wacko character would do while loose in the community. If running you through different scenes/locations is adventure, then that has certainly taken a back seat."

Tom Hanks is still one of my favorite actors and along with Robert Zemikis directing you can't go wrong with that combo.

","Just watched Forrest Gump again in a very casual way when I was actually watching a Korean sitcom. I already watched this movie several times before.<br/><br/>Gump is below level IQ but he is happy in some degree. At least he could love Jenny although their relation is kind of complex. You can say it is fragile but deeply rooted in both hearts like nostalgic. You can say this movie is not a masterpiece but it is very touching. In 67th Academy Award, it is the winner against other four movies like the Shawshank Redemption and FW and AF. Either have strong advantages over Forrest Gump. But Gump is deeply rooted in the red soil of southern USA- this great continent.

","This movie has been on TV a lot lately, and just last night the excellent TCM channel showed it---I'm not sure if it was edited, because it was so engrossing and moving I would not have noticed an F-word or any other classless anomaly that sprung from the baby-boomer generation. ""Forrest Gump"" is a masterpiece, placing Robert Zemekis on the same deserved pedestal as Spielberg, Ford, Fleming or Minnelli.<br/><br/>The emotional similarity between ""Gump"" and ""GWTW"" is evident by the end of the movie. In GWTW we watched as the Old South died and passed into legend....in Gump, we watch the beginning of the death of our entire nation as drug-addled baby-boomers and minorities who never knew a day of slavery in their lives began the slow destruction one of the truly greatest nations in the history of the planet. At the end of Gump, the America that some of its citizens today still insist exists, is actually dead...it's long march into chaos marked by a black wall with over 50,000 names engraved on it. Ironic to realize that the greatest of all American generations, the WWII generation mistakenly pursued the path of war in Vietnam. They thought they were doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese were luminous in this film, and Robin Wright Penn was haunting as she mirrored almost every hippie girl encountered in the years from 1968 to 1978.....there is horror and humor and impossible coincidences as Zemekis' Everyman GI tries to get along in a post-American world. In the end it is the white feather of love and life that is blown into the blue skies of Alabama as Forrest watches his little boy get on the school bus.<br/><br/>I realize I have now written of this movie, but I really sit and watch it speechless. When Forrest punches out the yippie freak who manhandles his beloved Jenny, and the lush jangle of Jim McGuinn's Rickenbacker 12-string announces the song ""Turn, Turn, Turn"", tears fill my eyes every time. One of the greatest match-ups of screen and music I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Ecclesiastics, Pete Seeger and The Byrd's were right....to everything there is a season.... and in 1968, the season began to wane for the American Camelot. ""Forrest Gump"" should be preserved in a time capsule."

I know a lot of us have heard our parents talk about how things were, but the movie and every character really fit into their role and really captured the life of that time. forrest gump as we all know was ""special"" and had to face many hardships. because of that it would have been a little harder for him to succeed than the other characters in the movie. however we see that with his honesty, kind and good hearted character that he is able to surpass everyone in the movie and become a well respected, loving father that we all could call a role model."

","I thought that Forrest Gump was a great overall movie. It was a comedy but also could make you sad. With all that it also did a lot of good history background. I also think that Forrest Gump is a very inspirational movie for anyone. It showed that someone like Forrest Gump can show others what life is all about and also what is important in life. They mention and show many different historical events. One example is the Vietnam War and what things were like there. I think the thing I liked the most is how they made Forrest Gump the character show people that the little things in life are more important. Such examples are being a love and caring person towards your family and friends. I also think a message of keeping promises to the most important people in your life is showed through this morning. That is a very important message."
"pgwhite95","9","2","4","27 October 2008"," Great Story!
","I'd like to say first of all, that I absolutely love this film. When I first saw this film in the theater I was taken back by how flawlessly, the Director expressed the story of the title character Forrest Gump. I am surprised however, by all the Forrest Gump haters out there, who view this as some sort of propaganda machine, or film about a man who skates his way through life and achieves everything. Boo hoo, are those haters jealous because he did everything right or because he made ""a gazillion dollars""? Well, life is different for everybody. Maybe somehow, these people don't believe that something like this is possible? How could a simple, southern man from Greenbow, Alabama succeed when all he does is follow the direction of others? This films theme after all, (SPOILERS), is whether life is governed by destiny or, by chance? I won't get into a debate about that here but, lets remember this is fictional, and it's for entertainment. Don't take it so seriously...enjoy it! The acting by Tom Hanks is beautiful. It is hard to view Tom Hanks, now, as anything other than Forrest. His character was completely submersed in this role. The accent was spot on, and the journey through the south, (Alabama, Savannah Ga., etc), was remarkable. Forrest is portaied as immediately different from the supporting cast. He goes through the same course of life as everyone around him but, he achieves his milestones in a unique way that only makes sense, but possibly not, to Forrest. The title character always brings his definition of life back to what he was taught by his ""Mamma."" I think this is a very real, and touching way of showing respect to all the mother's out there who are constantly defining for their children what the world is about. The life of Forrest is logical only to him. He doesn't question the advice given by his mother as being wrong, and he stops at that. No further thought is involved, he takes the advice and uses it as he ""floats"" his way through life. Every scene in this film is used to convey how destiny and chance usually occur at the same time.<br/><br/>All in all I give this film two thumbs, way up. I recommend for anyone who loves a great story, and wishes their lives could be this easy."

","So, what the hell is wrong with having a simple outlook on life? I think the reason we have a lot of problems in life is because we're too smart for our own good, that we always try to complicate things. I think that's what this movie was saying. Forrest Gump took life on its own terms, and he didn't sweat the little things. He just kept on keepin' on, and that's what the movie is saying. ""Don't sweat the small stuff."" You don't have to have an IQ of 75 to just relax and take it easy. Gump may have been smarter than most of his ""normal"" contemporaries. Contrary to what Jeanie said to him, he knows better than most people what love is. His loyalty to her in spite of the way she crapped on him until she was almost dead is a testament to that. Until the end, she was a dingbat.<br/><br/>Forrest first lost his best friend Bubba in Viet Nam. Then, he lost his mother. Then, he lost his Jeanie. Through it all, he remained stoic. There is something very noble in that. Intellectually challenged or not, he was still a human being with feelings. He was smart enough to know what dead is, what right and wrong are. When it gets right down to it, that's all we really need to know. This is a great movie. My only complaint about it is this guy who wrote the screenplay obviously didn't know diddly squat about Bear Bryant. Bear was not a very demonstrative coach. He wouldn't have been jumping up and down on the sidelines screaming, ""Run you sonofabitch, run!"" Bear was always pretty stonefaced on the sidelines. Also, I can't help wondering how they made Gary Sinese look like he lost his legs. That was very impressive, whatever they did to do that. Also, intermixing Gump with now dead historic figures was very impressive, showing him shaking hands with JFK, LBJ, Richard Nixon, John Lennon. Still, number one is it is a good story. 9 out of 10."

The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse turning in performances that deserved Oscars. Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R.

The film editing was great as well.<br/><br/>The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).<br/><br/>The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing.

","The best thing in this movie is Gary Sinise. He growls, smirks, and spits his way through a terrific performance before his character is converted to Forrest's religion. Other than that, there's not much meat in this movie. I thought Hanks was pretty good as Gump, but it's not a role that you can screw up too badly because there's very little character to slip into.<br/><br/>
The biggest problem with it is the artificial, plastic directing job, something that other Zamekis productions suffer from also. The sequence of dying Lt. Dan ancestors is particularly egregious - it's supposed to be funny, I think, but doesn't quite make it. I'm also at a loss to explain why we needed the Gump within a Gump voiceover narration. It only adds to the syrupy tone with the kind of pseudo-humor you see in many TV commercials. This story could have told itself quite well without this and similar directorial tricks.<br/><br/>I was a little bit bothered by the right-wing sensibilities present, but not all that much. I'm used to the co-opting of counter-culture product to prove alternate ideals (like the idea behind John Lennon's ""Imagine""). Using a false history as a dramatic device is OK with me, just do something interesting with it. Hollywood has a tendency to de-legitimize creativity as merely the accident of situation. Zamekis has done this before in Back to the Future, where Chuck Berry supposedly gets his inspiration for ""Johnny B. Good"" from one performance (instead of years of hard work). I hate it when this is used for a joke - and not a very good one, usually. Just like many things in this movie, it's pandering to the nostalgia of the audience. Similar things are done to Bear Bryant. But I digress.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie is when Hanks sees Sinise at the dock and runs into the water to greet him. It sums up both characters beautifully. And despite (or maybe because of) the heavy borrowing from other movies, other good scenes are the barroom scene with Hanks and Sinise, the orgasm scene, and the initial meeting of Hanks and his Drill Sergeant. I mention these because they don't typify the piled-on heavy sentiment that the rest of the movie employs."

Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career, one year after his other brilliant performance in Jonathan Demme's masterpiece Philadelphia. The supporting cast is flawless, and the soundtrack would have to be right up there with the Star Wars soundtrack as the best ever, including my personal favourite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Anyone who says this film only won Oscars because, like Rain Man it was about an idiot, has no idea what they are talking about. Citizen Kane may be the greatest film of all time on a technical level, and I do love it, but is it as magical as this film?I think not."

","Forrest Gump is a wonderfully comprised film that follows the life of Forrest Gump through a series of events that are often comical, influential, and powerfully emotional. Forrest Gump only has an IQ of 75. Ask him if he's stupid. He's going to respond ""Stupid is as stupid does."" His wit and wisdom here will never leave you, the film just boasts famous quotes after quotes. My favorite quote out of the entire film, is when he tells Jenny ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is."" Forrest Gump, simply put, is a walking miracle, which is amazing, because were talking about someone who once had braces on his legs. And he never goes anywhere without being noticed or heard. If you're sitting next to him waiting for the bus on the bench, he'll have no problem opening up a conversation with you, as he always seems very friendly and polite. That's not to say he's not in touch with his mean side. His protective anger flares up at least once, when he becomes very protective with Jenny in a situation she should have never been in. As he puts it, him and Jenny are like ""two peas in a pod"", although they seem to wander their own directions, but Gump likes to keep her under his wing. Eventually, they get married, and have a child. Forrest Gump chronicles the legend of over a 30 year period for a person who has been proud to serve his country, have a family, shakes hands with the President of The United States, and make miracles and dreams come true. A film that reminds us all that you don't have to be smart to be this epic, either."

","""Forest Gump"" is a generation's life review where the innocence of a generation of baby boomers grows up through iconic people and events of the fifties through the nineties. The musical score tells the story behind the story - did you notice, for instance, when Forest meets JFK and uses the White House bathroom, the song, ""Camelot"" is playing in the background. This generation was defined by their music, not that is was all good. This generation produced the angry clashing heavy metal sound. The Viet Nam War was the first war you could watch on television, and there was no escaping the horror of war for the average citizen. This generation had opposing camps - those who followed patriotically into a poorly defined war, for them, and those who fought against the war, dropped out, dodged the draft. How many of us let life open our doors, close our doors, and we follow blindly? A promise is a promise, said Forest. Somehow the shrimp boat worked out for him and especially, Lt. Dan, who was saved once again by Forest. Forest and Jenni are our representatives, of innocence, of abuse, of somehow finding humanity in the end, before it's too late. Favorite line, ""You don't know the first thing about love, Forest."" Such paradox. That was all that Forest knew."

","I understand what is the reason for considered Forrest Gump the best movie of his time when it was released in 1994, directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Erick Roth, although the movie was inspired in a novel with the same name, both are different but the movie continue being interesting
The movie plot is about Forrest´s life who is a simple person with some problems because he was considered mad but, despite that, he could do more things about his life than the expected. Forrest is performed by Tom Hanks who developed the personality of a man with low intellect reflected in his accent and gestures, these qualities do the movie more engrossing and witty due this character is involved in different adventures also we could think that only people who have some kind of special resource or intelligence have the capacities of getting achievements but Forrest can do us to think we can be part of some like that whether voluntarily or involuntarily.
Another characteristic of Forrest is he did not think much before to act, so in the movie, as a consequent of his actions, he is part of some historical events including he had been face to face with important historical characters and greet them, in those scenes, there are visual effects which allowed to Tom Hacks be in those moments and alter the speeches of those characters according to the situation, and other special effects in the movie for generated different atmospheres or setting like war moments or events with a lot of people were innovative to film technologies in that times.
Sync up Forrest´s life with historical moments allow us to imagine some characteristics of that age and understand some consequence in the plot, also some characters like Jenny performed by Hanna R, Hall, and the captain Dan performed by Gary Sinise, who appear in different moments of the movie and every time with changes physically or in their way of mind due to his age or relationships with another people, causes a notion of time and the thinking that the people change.
This movie is accompanied by whit classic music compounded by Alan Silvestri which generates different feelings about you are watching at that moment, doing more emotive the scenes.
The end was lightweight, in comparison with the rest of the plot but this is thought-provoking due you could think or have different feelings about the movie after watching it, although in the majority is amusing.
In my opinion, it is one of the best movies that I have watched, also I recommend it for people who want something classic and comical with different messages about life."

",""" You can reach everything if you only want to!""<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is just an epic movie that touches people throughout all ages and generations. The simplicity of this film is the main reason to love it. This is a movie of a heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long.
Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed."

","Forrest Gump is a film that documents Forrest Gump's life and all the adversities he has faced in his life including being bullied in school due to his mobility, and being found with an IQ of 75, however this does not stop Forrest to do great things including geting in the All-American football and ping pong team, getting a medal of honor for his military service, to running a successful shrimp business and meeting 3 US Presidents.<br/><br/>I love the characters of Forrest Gump, Lieutenant Dan and Jenny Curan both have diverse backgrounds which deifines their personality. In my opinion, my favorite character is Jenny, because of her complexity as character and the difficulty to fully understand her decisions that she makes including leaving Forrest after he was awarded the medal of Honor and being defended by him from one of her hippie friends.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing of this film is absolutely fantastic and surely deserved the Oscar of ""Best Film Editing"", the movie is very well polished imagewise. Not to mention how great of job the filmmakers did to remove Lieutenant Dan's legs using CGI and of course incorporating Tom Hanks into archive footage of JFK, LBJ, Nixon and the Dick Cavett interview of John Lennon, when the archive footage scenes appears, it is almost impossible to realize that this was edited and that Hanks was originally not in the archival footage, I mean that's how it was when I first watched it.<br/><br/>Another note, is the story and plot, I was blown away by how Forrest Gump was easily incorporated into the real world and has even shown to give people some ideas about how to take off their career, including Elvis Presley with the ""Hound Dog"" dance moves which in the movie seems that he has gotten the movies from Gump, or Gump first witnessing the Watergate scandal leading Nixon to resign and him and Lieutenant Dan's investments they make into Apple.<br/><br/>Also, throughout the film has many emotionally touching moments, including when Forrest first meets Jenny and how they quickly become friends, Bubba and Gump's mother's death, Jenny suffering a breakdown after attempting to commit suicide while high and every single Jenny and Forrest reunions but in my opinion the two scenes which were the most heartreaking and touching scenes were first of all when Forrest was rejected by many of his peers on his first day on the bus and his description of the first time he met Jenny and his friendship with when children, another very heartbreaking and teary moment was of course Jenny's death and Gump's speech to her grave telling her that he misses her and that Forrest Jr. is doing just fine and wrote a letter to her which Forrest Sr. is not able to read.<br/><br/>One thing that I obviously have to mention about this movie is the acting which was honestly fantastic and some of the best I have seen on a film. Especially Tom Hanks' acting and portrayal of Forrest Gump which in my opinion looks really natural it looks like he is actually Forrest Gump and he is not playing a role.<br/><br/>Overall, Forrest Gump, for me is considered a classic and one of the greatest films I have ever watched. If you did not watch it yet. GO WATCH IT, you will not regret, and I do not think we will see a movie this phenomenal in quite some time."

","On July 6, 1994, Paramount unveiled Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump in theaters. The Tom Hanks satire would go on to win six Oscars at the 67th Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is not stupid. Although his IQ is 75, he sees the world far clearer than most. Through his decent, childlike eyes, we too see things in a less confused and muddled way. In this cheerfully straight-arrow moral tale, Tom Hanks stars as the ""wise fool"" Forrest Gump and delivers yet another Oscar-level performance. Paramount will win sensational box office with this Robert Zemeckis-directed film.<br/><br/>Raised in the '50s in rural Alabama by a single mother (Sally Field), Forrest, being ""different,"" must fend for himself, struggling against not only perceived expectations but boyhood bullies. He unwittingly finds that he's blessed with a talent - he can run like the wind, which wins him a football scholarship to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. And there's no stopping him after that.<br/><br/>An uplifting saga about one young boy's earnest and good-natured attempts to overcome his disabilities, Forrest Gump is also a cheeky social satire of the past 40 years of U.S. social-political history. Eric Roth's screenplay, adapted from Winston Groom's novel, nimbly intertwines Forrest's life with the seminal social events and players of the past several decades. Unassuming Forrest, with his golly-gee enthusiasm and decency, encounters the likes of Elvis, George Wallace, presidents Kennedy through Nixon, Dick Cavett, John Lennon and Abbie Hoffman as he graduates from 'Bama, fights in Vietnam, competes in international ping-pong, founds a shrimping company, engages in philanthropy and jogs cross-country.<br/><br/>Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness.<br/><br/>While Forrest's foray's into the dens of the big and powerful are cheekily amusing, the film ambles along over a deeper, darker layer: Forrest's love for his childhood girlfriend, Jenny (Robin Wright). An abused child, Jenny's life path is a desperate wander to find solid ground. She falls prey to every social movement and fad of the times; unlike Forrest, whose unwavering strength and sense of right and wrong protect him from being caught up in social slides, Jenny's genuflections reflect her lack of firm values and inner confidence.<br/><br/>To some extent, one could argue that Jenny symbolizes most of us. If any criticism might be leveled at the film, it is that its most heart-wrenching moments are too adeptly skirted, but, then again, that's in keeping with Forrest's strength. Highest praise to Zemeckis, who has reached a higher maturity plane with his gracefully, technically eloquent direction.<br/><br/>Carrying his torso in an erect, straight-arched manner, Hanks' body language is all-telling. With each strange or perplexing situation, Hanks erupts with the smallest twitch or turn, signaling Forrest's deep-seated disapproval or, in special other cases, his gleeful, thankful wonderment. Mykelti Williamson, as Forrest's simple-minded G.I. buddy, is also outstanding, while Gary Sinise is sympathetic as Forrest's bitter platoon leader, legless after the Vietnam War."

"biswasbanoshree","10","0","0","24 April 2020"," Power of Innocence and Willpower
","Undoubtedly the character 'Forrest Gump' played by Tom Hanks is the best in his acting career. This movie is beyond just a story. It tells the philosophy of life. An innocent man with an IQ of as low as 75 achieves many milestones in his life only due to strong willpower. It also shows that our subconscious mind can create wonders if we stop doubting ourselves. The love story of Forrest and his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright) is really heartwarming. The movie also takes us through few important historical events of US in the last few decades.
Probably the best part of the movie is its storytelling. The whole movie can be described in a nutshell with the help of a tagline ""Life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get"". This movie also teaches us that honesty and innocence is required rather than cleverness to achieve something great in life.
This is one of my favorites. It may happen that you cannot comprehend the movie first time you watch as it happened with me. The second time I watched with more attention and undoubtedly I can say ""Forrest Gump is a masterpiece."""

","One of the funniest movies to me period. I love the great scenaries with Gump he a great actor. Only perhaps his character can sometimes causes a dramatic feeling but overall great movie!!!I also love the part when he like run Forrest run and he's slowly making effort I feel that this movie is a generational movie that should be introduce in the youth and upper comings. Like they say history wouldn't be the same without Forrest ""Forrest Gump"" spans some 30 years and touches on many important chapters in U.S. history, including the Vietnam War, the '60s anti-war movement and the Watergate scandal. Along the way Forrest encounters a young Elvis Presley and three U.S. presidents and even appears to inspire John Lennon's ""Imagine"" when he meets the ex-Beatle on a talk show. Some teachers have shown the movie in high school classrooms as a jumping-off point for discussing the '60s and '70s. Many believe adapted liberally from Winston Groom's novel, is not meant to be taken literallyAlthough ""Forrest Gump"" beat ""Pulp Fiction"" for the 1994 best picture Oscar, many film scholars rate Quentin Tarantino's film -- with its vivid antiheroes, nonlinear plot and pungent dialogue -- as the better movie. ""Pulp Fiction"" and its gallery of colorful criminals didn't stand a chance of winning top honors at the Oscars that year. But Tarantino's brash movie inspired countless imitators. If you ask a film critic to list the most influential movies of the 1990s, you probably won't hear them mention ""Forrest Gump.Forest Gump"" blends drama, comedy, reality and fantasy into a genre-busting saga that almost defies description. It shouldn't work, but it does. Its scenes, and lines, are indelible to many of us: ""Run, Forrest, run!"" ""I gotta pee."" ""Stupid is as stupid does."" ""That boy sure is a running' fool!"" ""I'm sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party."" ""There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp ..."" The list, and ""Forrest Gump's"" legacy, goes on and on. And that's all we have to say about that."

","Forrest Gump is the kind of film that shouldn't work on any level. It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works. It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America. And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a slow-witted Alabama native. But indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop. <br/><br/>Despite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, Forrest Gump actually fared less well than critics. It holds a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one. This is largely because Forrest Gump will not appeal to the cynical. And Lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it: Film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer. Those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy. But if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of Steven Spielberg or renaissance Disney, you may find Forrest Gump to be an eternal 142 minutes.<br/><br/>One of the problems with Forrest Gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make Forrest as endearing and likable as possible. And honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character. Additionally, Forrest Gump just seems to be an expert at everything. When we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that. But after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale.<br/><br/>On top of that, Forrest Gump also has a running gag in which Forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of Elvis Presley's dance moves, to the creator of the ""smiley"" face, etc. Forrest Gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister.<br/><br/>In spite of the film's many problems, however, Forrest Gump is a good film, largely thanks to Tom Hanks. His performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap. On paper, the Forrest Gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see Tom Hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life. This is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing. This is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it. It gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned.<br/><br/>There are genuine moments of beauty and grace. In fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful. When the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture.<br/><br/>The visual effects are superb. Forrest Gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today. Even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them.<br/><br/>I've already praised Hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too. Robin Wright plays Forrest's love interest, Jenny, in a more serious role. She captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands. Gary Sinise as Dan Taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving Hanks a bit of a run for his money. Sinise's performance is powerful and gripping. Sally Fields portrays the most charming of the cast, Forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna R. Hall portray young Forrest and young Jenny respectively in excellent child performances.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time. It gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end. You hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period- accurate, pop and rock songs. While they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one. They end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by Silvestri's much more palatable musical score.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer. The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great. The over- sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave Forrest Gump without feeling at least a little better about life."

","I really love this movie. It's so adorable and I love the little things they put into it. Like manipulating footage of presidents to put Forrest into them. Making him part of some of the biggest things in his lifetime. <br/><br/>In this movie, we learn about a special man named Forrest Gump. We see his pretty much his entire life. He, as a middle aged man, tell random strangers whilst waiting for the bus. We see him meet his longtime friend, Jenny, when he was a young boy with leg braces. We see him grow up, sleep with Jenny, join the army, go to war in Vietnam, open a shrimping business, with his deceased friend in mind, him buy a share in Apple Computers, him play college football, him meet three presidents, him teach Elvis his iconic move, his mother dying, him run across America for no particular reason, him finding out he had a child with Jenny, him marrying Jenny, Jenny dying of aids, because she was a giant hippie then a giant druggie. And everything important or relevant in his life. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10."

","Forrest Gump was one of those movies which I thought would be 'alright', but turned out to be better than that. The role Tom Hanks plays and how he does justice to the character is impressive. Throughout a multitude of scenarios, the story of Forrest Gump truly keeps one entertained if not excited about what will happen next. Interestingly, a rather long movie, it did not make me feel ""When will this get over?"". Not that I always ask this rhetoric question, mind you, but overall time passes without consideration of a break.<br/><br/>With rather random occurrences, it is quite instigating to the viewer what is going to happen next. By not out of the blue but a frenzy of events which are not to be thought would happen in that chronological manner, this movie not only surprises but changes viewpoints. It delves with multiple issue, no matter how discreet and implicated.<br/><br/>Generally, the genre of this movie applies to me but to see these genres posed like this truly enlightened me and rather than judging it harshly, made me reconsider to what extents the listed genres may apply to all cinema."

","I never knew how low the Academy could stoop when bestowing the coveted ""Best picture"" award when it chose to do so for the movie, Forrest Gump. It is a movie celebrating mental retardation and toss in some Frank Capra of ""Its a wonderful life"" fame and the mantra, ""you're never a failure if you have friends"" and you get the fabulously contrived piece of cinematic drivel that is, Forrest Gump. This film is rarely talked about these days, matter of fact, you never hear it mentioned AT ALL. It's become the most forgotten ""Best Film"" Hollywood has ever produced! Sort of ironic when you think about it because a best film award should entitle a movie to some longevity on the shelf. But no. This crappy piece of celluloid demonstrates more the short term memories of the American people as they the were the ones who seem to identify most with the character of Forrest Gump. This intellectually stunted individual is celebrated as the pure embodiment of American ""innocence."" How pathetic! You have been warned. Please, don't support movies of this ilk. It belittles your claim to being a lover of cinema when you love such trash."

","Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and excellent special effects), but doesn't measure up to its epic pretensions. It would've benefited from sticking to comedy and eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clichÃ©s and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but they've become clichÃ©s themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible saint to be very interesting."

","Forrest Gump (1994)- 5/5 <br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, Mykelti Williamson, Haley Joel Osment. Directed by Robert Zemeckis.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>Fantastic Best Picture winner of 1994 that is heartwarming and hilarious, ""Forrest Gump"" is a perfect example of a film to watch on a bad day. The titled character is just so likable and understanding that I don't know how anyone could give a negative comment about the movie. Many dislike it merely because it won the Oscar over films like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" Don't get me wrong, those two are great films, but there are some qualities in ""Forrest Gump"" that are simply superior. The main character, played as an adult by Hanks, is... ""different."" He grows up in the small town of Greenbow, Alabama with his mother (Field) and the love of his life, Jenny Curran (Wright), but manages to leave the town and go to college to play football due to his incredible speed. After college, he enlists in the marine corps and is taken to Vietnam. After enlisting in the war, he returns to America to find Jenny and to see where his life takes him, and it's an amazing journey to say the least. Robert Zemeckis' direction is excellent and probably the best of his long career. Tom Hanks never ceases to amaze me in this; it may very well be one of the best performances in an American film I've ever seen. Wright, Sinise, Williamson and Field all do great in their supporting roles. The editing and cinematography are just perfect. A great blend of both comedy and drama, ""Forrest Gump"" is a truly unforgettable film that is just about for everyone."
"DonutLover","10","3","8","25 February 2007"," Simply, a beautiful movie
","This has to be one of the most beautiful movies ever made. I remember the first time I saw it, I was in some department store, and I saw a scene playing on the store t.v. It was the scene where Forrest is on Merv Griffin (?) I believe, talking with John Lennon, and actually my first impression was that it was forced, and contrived. Corny. So, I never really watched the whole film, until a year or two ago. This movie brings so many tears to my eyes, not because of sadness, but because of the simplicity of life, relationships, and different stories. The little feather in the beginning of the film seems to be on a journey visiting different lives, and by the end of the story, when the little feather moves on on it's path, you are so touched and moved by the beautiful story of Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>My favorite character is probably Lt. Dan. Forrest meets Lt. Dan in Vietnam, and when Dan loses the bottom half of his legs, he has a ""problem"", putting it lightly, with God, and his destiny. But, through the years, and by knowing Forrest, he comes to terms with his situation, and one of my favorite scenes is where Dan is swimming in the ocean. It shows how much he CAN do, as he can swim just fine, and enjoy that wonderful, cool, free experience available to most of us. By the end of the film he has come such a long way; he is happy, engaged to a nice girl, and walking on titanium legs, with the help of a cane. And boy is he easy on the eyes, at that! <br/><br/>I liked the character of Jenny, but I hated how she kept leaving Forrest, and not telling him why. She deserted him quite a bit. Yet he could not hold it against her. She was a survivor of child sexual abuse and incest, so that helps to explain her lifelong struggle with depression. In the end, she does give Forrest a wonderful gift in the form of his son, Little Forrest. However, I thought it a little strange how they handled the A.I.D.S. idea. I mean, if she had A.I.D.S., wouldn't they allude to some form of protection, for Forrest, after they got married? Even though she died in 1982 (according to the headstone)the medical profession did know at that time, that it was a sexually transmitted disease. And, I am assuming that she meant AIDS, when she said that she had a virus that the docs didn't know what it was, and that there was nothing that they could do about it. I never read the book, so I don't know if it was explained a little more there. <br/><br/>One other little question I had was the scene where Forrest opens a letter from Lt. Dan, telling him that he would never need to worry about money ever again, because of their investments in Apple. The letter head says 1975. Hmmmm. I guess I'll have to do my research and see when Apple became a multi-million dollar company, and went public. I know that when I was in high school in 1982, we were still learning Pascal, or whatever those old fashioned computer languages were at that point, before user friendly p.c.s hit the market. I didn't know that Apple was that big, already. It may prove that I am just ignorant, and can use a lesson in business history. Other than that, and the two scenes of John Lennon, and President Kennedy, which I thought were hokey, the movie was a huge success in my book. It's a truly beautiful film, and I also like the woman at the bus stop who ends up staying, missing her bus on purpose, so that she can listen to Gump. She is a neat character, who is moved by his story. If you like beautiful, moving films, see this one."

It is a story so compelling, so well thought out and so brilliantly portrayed it goes down in history as one of the most imaginative films of the 20th century. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a boy with a very low I.Q., 75 to be precise. All he is trying to do is to go through life and be happy. Forrest never registers much, he takes in a lot and is always looking to be nice to anyone he comes across. Always an entertainer he is capable of a great story which you'll see right off the bat. The movie of Forrest Gump is not really a story but more of a biography of a fictional character. It is brilliantly done.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has grown to be one of the best actors in Hollywood. His sense of character development is beyond belief. He is able to take a pretty much simple character as Forrest Gump is and make him into one of the most interesting characters in the past 20 years. His sheer genius and comedy made the movie what it is today and that is a classic.<br/><br/>Gary Sinise adds a very strong supporting role as Lt. Dan who is an old military 'buddy' from Vietnam. A lot of the mid story of the film follows the friendship that kindles between Forrest and the stern Lieutenant Dan. Sinise does some amazing work and is a highly underrate actor. He brings the fear of life to his character and when him and Hanks are on screen together, it is some of the best acting in the film.<br/><br/>The film has gone down in history as its amazing presentation of historical events with a character from the movie in them. Forrest goes through a variety of events including: Vietnam, the Watergate Scandal, meeting John Lennon along with some other events of history. Along with Hanks acting, the special effects used to put characters in those events captures a lot of people attention and interest.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump should not be missed. It's funny, it's smart, it's brilliantly acted. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a good time. Don't miss Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>5/5 Stars"

","I have loved and appreciated many movies in my lifetime. If someone asks me what my favorite is, the one that comes to mind first is Forrest Gump. It doesn't matter that some other films might be greater, or more important, or more beautifully executed. I think ""favorite"" is still a measure that shouldn't be dismissed.<br/><br/>Maybe the major reason it's my favorite is what I consider the main message. Jenny is a *perfectly* beautiful woman who is focused on herself. She seems determined to please herself, get high, pursue whatever adventures she can, without much regard for others. And she ends up more miserable than satisfied.<br/><br/>Forrest is an *imperfect* man, whose every action is focused on serving others as best he can. He knows how to take risks, make sacrifices. He knows what love is. And ultimately, imperfect as he is, he is blessed by being a blessing to others. Everyone he touches in his life is blessed by knowing him.<br/><br/>The fact that he also achieves material success is not the point; we all know that's a fleeting reward. I think the most meaningful point, the heart, of this lovely movie is that true happiness depends more on being blessful than successful."

","""Forrest Gump"" dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques.  ""Forrest Gump"" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of ""Schindler's List"", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5."

"naywunnthu","1","4","13","18 April 2016"," The best movie I've ever seen
","The film ""Forrest Gump  is about a simple man's journey through complicated times. Forrest is played with the grace of a tightrope walker by Tom Hanks. He (Gump) is mildly retarded; he has an IQ of 75 at the movie's start and stays pretty much on that level all the way through. His trove of facts increases, but his basic methodology of handling the world never changes. As a boy, with braces on his legs, he peers at life and expects little more than to be heard and acknowledged, and the first person aside from his doting mother to do that with him is his lifelong love, Jenny (Robin Wright). Then one day the braces come off, more or less by accident, and Forrest discovers he can run like hell. He couples that with advice from Jenny (that the best thing to do when you're in trouble is just run) and this becomes the big asset that gets him through college on a football scholarship. And the one thing that gets him through Vietnam, allowing him to save most of his platoon and receive the Congressional Medal of Honor. Although he rescues his platoon leader (Gary Sinise), the man has nothing but rancor and bitterness, since he lost his legs, while Gump only got shot in the rear. After Vietnam, Gump goes on to be the captain of a shrimp boat, a Ping-Pong champion, a multi-millionaire, and a cross-country runner. The sly thing about the movie is the way he just sort of backs into everything, doing what comes naturally, and is even happy when nothing happens. All he wants out of life is the love of a woman, even."

"kira02bit","4","2","5","27 December 2014"," Minor plot completely runs out of steam by midway
","Conventional wisdom back in 1994 stated that one must either be a huge fan of Oscar nominee Pulp Fiction (which purportedly signified the new cinema) or of its polar opposite, Oscar winner Forrest Gump (which signified old school film). Truthfully, I am a fan of neither film and of the Best Picture nominees for that year, I would most assuredly have picked The Shawshank Redemption over both without hesitation.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a simple story about a simple man - expanded over an arrogant nearly 3 hour running time. A Southern man of low I.Q., whose good intentions and well-meaning heart allow him to triumph over the obstacles and adversities life throws his way. The film opens with Forrest sitting on a park bench regaling others with his exploits, such as his outrunning bullies and becoming a football hero, his tour in Vietnam which led to a successful shrimping business and his enduring love for his childhood friend, Jenny.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis can be a great director and the first hour of Forrest Gump is very good. It establishes a tone of bemused whimsy that the material requires. Unfortunately, bemused whimsy is a hard tone to maintain, especially when your film has such a slight plot, a running time that would be a strain with the best material, and a central character that is, let's face it, not particularly fascinating. By the midway section, the film starts to stumble and then completely implodes right around the time that Forrest starts running back and forth from coast to coast for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>For comedic measure and a degree of relevance, the story tries to shoehorn Forrest in with historic figures, fads and events, some of which work well and some not at all. The tie-in with Watergate and Forrest showing his wound to Nixon are amusing, but his scene on the National Mall at an anti-war protest where the microphone cuts out so the crowd can remain clueless that he is an imbecile is ridiculously coy. And the sequence with John Lennon, where it is obvious the words do not match the lip movements is downright embarrassing. The Oscar for special effects here is a real stretch.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks can be a great everyman actor (like James Stewart). He can also be overrated and it is to his misfortune that the two films for which he won back to back Oscars are two of his most overrated efforts. One can see politically in Oscar circles why he would win for Philadelphia, but the win for Forrest Gump the next year is most puzzling. Forrest has very little range emotionally or intellectually, and he largely reacts to everything the same way.<br/><br/>Sally Field seems oddly miscast as Forrest's mother, who apparently gifted her son with his low-rent fortune cookie advice. Gary Sinise provides the film's only really great performance as Forrest's Vietnam superior and later friend - providing some of the grit and emotion that the remainder of the film lacks.<br/><br/>In the pivotal role of Jenny - the girl who Forrest has loved since childhood - Robin Wright is a complete wash-out. The film keeps returning to her character, who has become an embittered drug addict and it founders every time it does. Jenny may have her reasons for her addictions, but she is often played as a shrewish selfish person, who takes Forrest's help when convenient, and shuns him when she is finished with him. Hanks and Wright have no chemistry together and because of her shoddy treatment of Forrest, I cannot imagine anyone rooting for them as a couple. A foolishly lengthy mid-film sequence with Jenny on a ledge contemplating suicide actually had one witty film-goer in my audience begging her to jump - I concur. Her final moments in the film are especially absurd - as she once again shows up to prey on Forrest's good will - this time announcing that she is dying from some mystery illness which seems to be AIDS although the filmmakers refuse to say and she wants Forrest to care for her son, which she assures him is his (although we as an audience are not really sure given the characters chronic dishonesty). This strange disease seems to have been borrowed from Love Story, as Wright's only major symptom seems to be that she gets more luminous and has better lighting the closer to death she gets.<br/><br/>The final hour of the film is near unendurable. The whimsy has been lost and the events surrounding Forrest just seem to get sillier and more pointless. As a character on which to hang a film, Forrest is largely a slow-witted blank. He ends the film almost exactly as he starts it. He has had no great epiphanies or insights or much in way of growth - he has been largely a passive passenger riding the wave of life. The film's meme that good-hearted people will always get what's coming to them is beyond naive and a tad insulting - as there are many good-hearted people who have the opposite happen. Ironically, we never get to see the expressions or reactions of the people Forrest victimizes with his tales, which may be intentional since they may have run screaming from the park bench or just passed out in bored apathy."
"Snowgo","3","2","5","20 November 2014"," Over-rated and Pointless
","Probably the most over-rated movie of the 1990's. Who is Forrest Gump? What is inside his head.., or heart, for that matter? All we can establish is that he is unintelligent enough to make it in the army. Is he handicapped? Not? He is like an anti-person, whom everything happens to, instead of making things happen.., until he acquires inspiration and ambition out of the blue and goes on an impossible running tour. I have not been able to discern an actual point this movie is trying to make, nor establish just who this mentally-challenged millionaire really is. Maybe he appeals to so many people because they identify with him? That is a truly scary thought, but apparently, it seems to be the case. A pointless, stupid movie.<br/><br/>A salute to powerlessness and vacuousness."

","This is one of those rare films of which I am very aware, but had never seen. Nineteen years on I decided to put it right. Director Robert Zemeckis has gone on to have a distinguished career and is a Hollywood stalwart, a traditionalist in the Spielberg mould. Unfortunately, as the story unfolded, i became aware that my subconscious had been a shrewd judge of what I enjoy.<br/><br/>As a modern day, conservative, fairy tale it is well crafted , easy on the eye, tugging at the heartstrings and rich in warmth. But the sub-text is as stodgy as a toffee chocolate. Gump, a man of modest talent, but great determination and opportunism, triumphs in life. We never see the Commies in Vietnam, just Gump's bravery, we do see those subversive anti-war protesters and Black Panthers though, but even dim Gump manages to see his way through.<br/><br/>Told in flashback, and with amusing and inspired manipulated archive footage to put Forrest at the heart of historic action , much pivots upon Forrests's star crossed relationship with a girl, played by Robin Wright. Gary Sinise shines as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Yet for me the sentimentality is mawkish, the message awkward and simplistic, and the treatment a cynical manipulation of the audience that loves The American Dream. Its appeal is obvious. Its claims to greatness over stated."

"DKosty123","8","2","5","25 September 2010"," Enjoy The Entertainment, Don't Read Into This
","While this one rates as the premiere performance on film of Tom Hanks, I think one thing that prevents it from being an all time best film is the entertainment factor. Robert Zemekis direction efforts are always solid entertaining films (with the exception of a few of the remakes he has done in recent years which thankfully are getting buried without ceremony).<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is not just Gump in this movie but he is the narrator for pretty much the whole film. If they had stuck with the book this is based on, there would have been a lot of missing drama. Would this movie be as effective if the drama was a lot less? I think it would be. The death of Jenny while making for a dramatic ending does not really add to the film other than making you reach for the hankies.<br/><br/>For a Zemekis film, this one is slower moving than most. It pulls at the heart strings as Gump is presented as a stupid person who lucks into many historic moments by accident. Really, Gump is not stupid, just slow & partnered for much of the film with his commanding officer from the service, a double leg amputee, there is a good chemistry between these characters.<br/><br/>There is the dream girl Jenny. Gump claims to always be thinking of her. Good touches in the film include the party with the girls & the guys where Forrest breaks up the party by complaining that the one girl trying to make out with him tastes like cigarettes. There is the simile of ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" which is the most quoted line of this movie.<br/><br/>Too many folks don't like the reading of politics into this, so don't look for this. If you just sit back & enjoy the story telling & not look for holes in the plot, then everything is fine. The same applies to the Back To The Future series Zemekis directed. The plots in many of his films are full of holes when you analyze them. So don't do it, why get a headache when you don't need too."
"Aaron1375","6","2","5","8 July 2010"," The movie works overall, but like a box of chocolates there are way to many bad pieces here and there.
","This movie had its humorous moments, but with that came way to many sappy scenes and suffice to say I did not love this movie. Nothing I hated, but nothing I try to watch when I see it on the television either. The story revolves around the character of the title Forrest Gump of course. It basically goes through different parts of his life and shows how a very simple man led a rather astonishing life. A rather unrealistic life filled with a bit to much melodrama for my tastes. I can see why others like this movie, but once again just not really my type of movie. Tom Hanks is good in the lead role and I also thought Gary Sinese was good in his role too, however I did not care for the character of Jenny as she just ticked me off to no end. The film is also better in some places than other as the film really has a rather disjointed feel to it. It goes from here to there and is not hard to follow at times though it just feels like a patchwork movie. The Vietnam portion of the film to me was the highlight, here the comedy was good and even the drama worked too. Other sections of the film at times just felt to underdeveloped. Here is Forrest entering college, now he is done two minutes later, here is Forrest playing ping pong, now he is back Washington D.C. at a black panther party. Like I said it has its moments, but for me it was a bit to all over the place like they tried to get everything that was in the book up on screen. And as short as some of this segments were you then have a rather lengthy scene of just him running, though that one was rather good even though it was simple. I will never see how this film beat out ""True Lies"" for the best special effects Oscar, I was not overly impressed with the scenes Forrest was inserted in as it simply looked like they animated the mouths of those he was supposed to be meeting and they sort of stuck him in there using file footage of John F. Kennedy for example. I just thought it was just a bit better technique used than that of a Steve Martin film ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"". Overall it was okay, but just not going to be in my personal top 100 movies of all time."

"Robert_duder","10","2","5","3 July 2008"," MY 700TH REVIEW and what a great one!! I think Forrest Gump might be one of the best films of all time
","It had been a little while since I watched Forrest Gump and it wasn't but a few minutes before everything I loved about it came flooding back and by the time the credits rolled and I had dried my tears I realized that I think this is quite possibly the best film ever made. It may be my favourite movie of all time and for good reason because it is stone cold brilliant in every way and deserved everything from awards to box office glory that it received. Previously I have stated that JFK is my favourite film and in a complete league of it's own and now I state that Forrest Gump belongs in that category of elite films. The story is infamous and brilliant and touching and disturbing and covers every aspect of genre you can think of. The cast is absolutely brilliant. The direction is stunning and the special effects are unlike anything you will ever see. Director Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director and has directed his way through many of my personal all time favourites including the Back To The Future Trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and What Lies Beneath. The thing about his story telling is that it's completely unique, there is something completely and utterly different about his films and Forrest Gump is truly the pinnacle of that talent. He seems to know his cast and surrounds himself with the best performances possible.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor, there is no doubt about it. But he gives the absolute performance of his career as Forrest Gump, a man who is not quite as smart as the average person and yet pure of heart and indeed in many ways smarter than all of us. Hanks makes this character his own, no one could ever play Gump. His tone and body language and everything just embodies the character and it is one of the best performances in film history. Robin Wright Penn plays Forrest's true love and the romance is far beyond just your average romance. Penn is good although I'm not sure she lives up to the rest of the cast. She does do a great job at being versatile and playing her character through the decades and through the different situations in history from Southern girl to Hippie to mother. The chemistry between her and Hanks is undeniable mostly because of the story that makes their love so important to Gump. Gary Sinise is undeniably amazing in his role as Lt Dan Taylor. I don't know who got the Academy Award that year in the category he was nominated for but he was robbed!! His performance is ground breaking and creates one of the best characters in film history. Him and Hanks are just incredible together. Mykelti Williamson, in a bit of a smaller role, is also brilliant as Bubba, Forrest's best good friend in the army. His character is short lived but pivotal and he does an amazing job. I wish I could cover the rest of this amazing cast which includes Sally Field in an amazing role as Forrest's mama. This cast is truly one of the best ever period.<br/><br/>What else can I say about Forrest Gump? Beautiful romance, action, drama, laughing, crying, life and death, I mean there isn't anything this movie doesn't give you. It's just this brilliant epic journey that just makes you appreciate life and tells history from a completely different perspective. I've seen this film many, many times and yet for the last half hour of the movie I sat there and watched it bawling my eyes out. It isn't many movies that ever make me cry and it is even less that a movie I have seen so many times can do that. If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you're missing out on a film experience unlike any other and an absolute classic the minute it was released. I understand they are looking at turning the second novel, a sequel, into a film and because I want to revisit these characters I would love a chance to see it but I don't think it could ever live up to this original classic and if the entire original cast including director Robert Zemeckis won't do it...DON'T DO IT...see this movie now or again. 10+/10"

","""Forrest Gump"" is a story about a boy and later a man who has the IQ of 75, but even a person with normal IQ is not so noble. Forrest Gump stays true to himself till the very end of the movie thought he realizes that he is not as smart as other people. This understanding makes him able to accept anything that happens in his life and be ""strong"". The theme of ""Forrest Gump"" seems to be easy but at the same time it is very serious because it touches important issues such as war, not being like other people, fight for the right to be equal and many others. Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor that he gets into the skin of Forrest Gump's silly role. He expresses a wide range of emotion that I empathize with his acting. In the beginning of ""Forrest Gump"" -- ""Life's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" This is with a young nurse gives a hint what the main actor's life will be. ). Forrest Gump is very strong as it strives for fighting the stereotype of discriminating disabled people. It may be said that it is one of the greatest movies"

","I must say that one of the best movies I've seen in the past ten years has got to be Forrest Gump. The writing alone is more than anything than I could have thought, even after hearing so many people quoting the movie and Forrest. As far as acting goes, Tom did a wonderful job as Forrest. However, I must admit that sometimes Forrest's narration got slightly annoying. Nevertheless, all of the actors in the film did a wonderful job. A particularly surprising performance by the Actress that played Jenny sticks out in my mind.<br/><br/>The editing was good, although I think it could have been slightly shorter. But there isn't enough wrong with the editing to complain about. The characters were all made to immediately grasp the audience's attention, which is what happened moments after they were introduced.<br/><br/>None of the music really sticks out, but it definitely wasn't anything to complain about. The overall mood of the film, though, is what really helps bring it together. I was half afraid I might let a tear slip close to the end of the film; not really because Jenny dies, but more because of how happy Forrest is just having the life that he does with his son. And as he flashed back to the scenes on the boat, in Vietnam, and his running as he looked at the different skies at different times of day, I realized the beauty that the film makers were trying to capture through the eyes of this slightly retarded man.<br/><br/>All in all, I could really not ask for much better of a film."

","Two people, Forrest Gump and Jenny Curran, form an unbreakable bond as children. Forrest, although lacking in the brains department, manages to witness and play his part in some of the greatest events in American history. He meets JFK, wins the Medal of Honor in Vietnam, and manages to accidentally start the Watergate investigation. Forrest lives the American dream whereas Jenny lives the American nightmare; she has an abusive father and grows up to have a string of abusive boyfriends, works as a stripper, takes narcotics and ultimately contracts AIDS. Despite the pair going in completely different directions in life, they are still drawn to each other and Forrest and Jenny's story is one that will make you smile, laugh and shed a tear.<br/><br/>Every once and while, you see lists of the worst films to win Best Picture Oscars, and usually Forrest Gump makes that list. I think the reason for this is that we live in quite a cynical world and the majority of people do not really warm to lead characters that are innocent and pure of heart. This should not be the case. We should adore characters that are completely honest and very insightful despite their low IQs, and Forrest Gump is one of those characters that we should love. People who watch this film should check their cynicism at the door and just enjoy a film that is about the everyman battling the world using only truth and a deep-seated sense of what he believes is right. After all, this film has a noble tradition, it follows in the footsteps of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's A Wonderful Life. If Frank Capra were alive today, he would make films like Forrest Gump (if he could come to grips with all the CGI) and that's all I have to say about that"

","I don't know Tom Hanks and the likelihood is i will never meet him. However i would be very surprised if this film doesn't rate amongst his best/favourite/one to be proud of when he is talking to his grandchildren It is a timeless classic. i fully expect to be many a persons favourite film of all time. There is nothing about this film not to like, from the catchphrases, the audacious dips into world history and celebrity, its cheeky nods towards serious issues such as child abuse, racism, politics etc. The performances are superb, led from the front by Hanks. I think Bubba is hysterical, Sally field was an inspirational choice for the momma role, and lieutenant Dan nearly steals the show, and would have done if Hanks hadn't absolutely nailed it! THe best thing though about this film is its appeal, you can watch it on DVD on a Monday but if you happened to find it on television in the same week you would watch it again, and yes you would still be saying the catchphrases at the end........My name is Forrest Gump, people call me Forrest Gump."

","There are few films that possess a truly breathtaking and epic feel to them these days. Many try, but don't succeed. Forest Gump succeeded in feeling epic to me, even though when it boils down to it, the film is about one person.<br/><br/>That one person is one of the most remarkable characters ever to grace the screen, a simple man who nevertheless embraces what life brings him and as a result, has some amazing experiences. Tom Hanks shows how versatile he is, making what must have been a demanding role look effortless and natural. The result is that you really care about what happens to Forest, whether he's running, fighting in Vietnam, or seeking to prove to Jenny how he feels.<br/><br/>Gary Sinese is also great in this film- his was a truly challenging role- he played a soldier who ends up losing his legs, and feels that Forest cheated him out of his destiny of dying in battle. To simulate having no legs is a true challenge, but he does it, and it's believable.<br/><br/>The only thing that lets this film down is that it goes in for a somewhat predictable, sentimental ending, in which Forest's angel, Jenny, dies, shortly after they are married. Nevertheless, Forest Gump is an excellent film and it's no wonder Tom Hanks took home an Oscar for it."

It is deeply moving as she recognises that walking on the wild side will not bring her happiness.If I have one complaint about this film, it is that Jenny is almost used as a cipher to depict the drug culture and the permissive society of the 1960s and 1970s.Anyone who is conservative in their politics, could be comforted by the arc of Jenny's character including her demise.<br/><br/>Gary Sinise is terrific as Lt Dan Taylor.He is good in so many films like Ransom,Snake Eyes and Apollo 13.Here he portrays a complex character who evolves in much the same way as Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July.<br/><br/>It is an emotional film about love and its various incarnations, that at the heart of this movie.Forrest's love never changes even though his country changes all around him."

","Pure and emotional, strong and up-right, this film has it all. Wonderful characters, beautiful direction and a very strong story. Tom Hanks is in his wonderful best as Forrest Gump, a man who may not be very clever but indeed carry's a good and caring heart. This is a truly mesmerising and heavy film, with all the right ingredients. Hanks has donned his best here, and created an academy award with his stunning performance.<br/><br/>But see this film without a doubt, carry it through life and watch it time and time again. The emotional charisma makes it the whole more better.<br/><br/>Cry, stand and salute a brilliant film. Forrest Gump is right up in the front row of Hollywood's all time masterpieces."
"dobbin-4","7","2","5","1 July 2007"," Forrest Gump is and always should be a remembered movie.
","Forrest Gump is a classic movie about a not so bright man who was in a lot of historical moments but because of his brains he does not realize the effect of his life so he does such things as teach the to be Elvis his(Elvises) famous walk,tell JFK that he had to pee and became a famous Squid salesman. Whats really good about Forrest Gump is that it shows that while he had an adventurous life he did not have and overly great happy fun life and the movie shows a lot of Forrest Gumps life and does not leave anything out which makes it one of the most famous movies ever. Tom Hanks performance in this movie ranks 2nd on my favourite performances ever(first being Leonardio Dicaprios performance in ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"". Overall I rate this movie 91% for being an enjoyable movie and putting in more information then most other movies definitely a must see for everyone."

","This contains spoilers. This movie is fantastic. It is excellent. It is great. Only one word can describe this movie. Perfect. This is a perfect movie that was a landmark film. This is a great movie. It is incredibly well made with a great story and script. Tom Hank's performance is just amazing. He does an amazing job. It is easily the best performance of the 90's. It is also the best performance as a mentally retarded person. It is just amazing. I love this movie. I think that the greatest part about this movie is the fact that it teaches you a lesson. It teaches you that you don't have to be a smart person to do incredible things. That is why I love this movie. It's amazing. I mean, he has leg braces, which he breaks off when he tries to run, he becomes a college football all-star, he becomes a Vietnam veteran who wins the congressional medal of honor. That is just amazing. I don't want to tell you anything else if I haven't already ruined it for you. It is is just amazing. I can understand why people hate this movie. I am not like them. I love this movie. *Spoilers* What I also find to amazing is the fact that he only has four friends throughout the movie. Three of which die and the other loses both of his legs. His mother dies of cancer, Bubba gets killed in combat in Vietnam, Jenny has AIDs, and Leuitanit Dan loses his legs in Vietnam. That is amazing. I love this movie. This is one of my ten favorite of all time. I think that it is one of the ten best of the nineties, and is easily one of the best 30 over all ever made. I think that it is underrated, even though it is at number 80 something. This is a great movie. 10/10."

","I found the movie Forrest Gump an enjoyable and interesting movie. This movie makes me think about other people. I like the quote when he says, ""Life is as a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get."" By this quote Forrest Gump makes us think that it is like a box of chocolates. When you pick one out with out looking at the wrapper you won't know what will happen, this makes us think about real life. How do you know what is going to happen in our lives. This is one of the most popular movies in 1994. It won 6 Oscars.<br/><br/>The setting of this film is based in a small fictional town in Alabama. Then later it goes through the whole world. The director, Robert Zemeckis wants you to see that this movie goes all around the world. The director shows us that this movie is surrealistic. The author is trying to tell the audience that this film has a very long time setting. In the movie goes from 1950-1980.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a surreal character. The director makes him surreal when he starts running with his braces and they suddenly burst off him. He is supposed to be an ""idiot"" but he helps many people around him by accident. He teaches people lessons. And helps them and himself. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump; she does one of the best Alabama accents. She is an example of a good mother. Jenny is realistic character. In the movie her father abuses her, in the story she needs a friend, she becomes friends with Forrest. She doesn't want to be with Forrest in an other way because he is too much child-like. Then later she finds something in him and she marries him. Lt. Dan is good and super-realistic character played by Gary Sinise. He helps Forrest during the Vietnamese war and when they open the shrimp company. Bubba played by Myelti Williamson. He is a non-realistic character. He is one of Forrest's best friends. Myelti Williamson plays Bubba really good. In the movie he shows the meaning of true friendship.<br/><br/>In the movie there is a really big use of plot but it is surreal. Forrest Gump was born with a low IQ. But he still makes it into college by playing football. Then he becomes one of the biggest hero's in America because of the Vietnam War. He starts with ping-pong and reaches the champion ship. In memory of his friend Bubba he opens a shrimp company. He falls in true love and wants to be a father. There are many themes in this movie. The biggest one I think is love. His whole life is with love. There is also a use of friendship. The use of friendship is very big through out the whole movie too.<br/><br/>My rating for this movie is very high. I would give it a 9 out of 10. I really liked the movie and I really enjoyed the movie. I think that other people who want to see it won't be disappointed about it. And for the people that have seen it, I think they learned something from it. Through all of the story elements, there are many things and this movie shows how it is being an idiot."
"stars-echo","9","2","5","4 June 2007"," An Everyman For Today
","The movie Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zmeckis and written by Winston Groom, is a fascinating film with a lot of great themes. It was released in 1994 with a great actor, Tom Hanks playing the main character Forrest Gump. It won six Academy Awards, which proves that many people liked the film.<br/><br/>This story is set in a very small fictional town in Alabama, which presents the whole world. It is a microcosm of the world. The filmmaker wanted viewers to empathize with Forrest. He wanted us to know how stupid it is to judge people by intelligence and appearances. This film has a very long time setting, from the late 1950s to the late 80s, to show the growth of America and its loss of innocence, in modern times. <br/><br/>Winston Groom presented the characters in a very interesting way by using some of the characters surrealistically but some very realistically. Forrest Gump, who is played by Tom Hanks in the film, is presented as an ""everyman"". He is used surrealistically and is a character that is used symbolically. This has a universal appeal. His story applies to every single one of us. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump was born in a small town in Alabama as an idiot, and had an IQ of 70, which is low compared to ""normal"" kids. He is judged upon intelligence and appearances, but some of the things he says actually have deep meanings. Tom Hanks was perfectly cast. His gestures, face expressions, and the way he talked made the character seem alive and very realistic. Sally Fields, who played Mrs. Gump, did a great job presenting the determination of the mother's character. She is a very realistic character. Mrs. Gump is willing to do anything for her son. She is very protective and she didn't want Forrest to go to a special school, so she even slept with the Principal of a school to make him allow Forrest to go to that school. Jenny, who is played by a wonderful actress Robin Wright, is also a realistic character. She was the only child who was nice to him in school, and that's why Forrest falls in love with her. When she was young, her father physically but also sexually abused her. Jenny's dad symbolizes bad fatherhood, whereas Mrs. Gump symbolizes good motherhood. Jenny has a lot of disappointments in her life and also tries to commit suicide, which shows how parenting is important and can ruin one's life. Lt. Dan is a super realistic character that Forrest meets during the Vietnam War. During the war he loses both legs and nearly dies, but Forrest saves his life. Forrest helped Lt. Dan not give up his life, but start a new fresh life catching fresh shrimps together. They start up a shrimp company and make a lot of money. This develops the theme of true friendship.<br/><br/>There are many other themes in this story, such as determination, tolerance, and parenting. But I think there are two very clear and important themes. ""Life is a like a box of chocolates"" is one famous Forrest Gump quotations. This quote hints us one of the theme of this story. It sounds unintelligent, because he is holding a box of chocolates and says it while he's taking one out and eating it, but if you think about it, it has a very deep meaning. You don't know what's going to come up in your life, just like you don't know what kind of chocolate might come out. Life's unexpected. But is it really just destiny, or can life be chosen? The quote, ""Stupid is as stupid does"" tells us another important theme. It's telling us not to judge by appearances or intelligence. Winston Groom is giving us a very important lesson: judge on actions, not reputation.<br/><br/>Overall, the casting and acting of the actors, and each of the four story elements were well presented. The setting and the idea of the universal theme were very well developed. Also, the idea of Winston Groom to present the characters both realistically and surrealistically was brilliant. I think that this movie is very effective and it has messages that teach people a lot of things. Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone definitely should see."
"forrestwrs","10","2","5","29 May 2007"," Forrest Gump Rocks The Boat
","I must say that one of the best movies I've seen in the past ten years has got to be Forrest Gump. The writing alone is more than anything than I could have thought, even after hearing so many people quoting the movie and Forrest. As far as acting goes, Tom did a wonderful job as Forrest. However, I must admit that sometimes Forrest's narration got slightly annoying. Nevertheless, all of the actors in the film did a wonderful job. A particularly surprising performance by the Actress that played Jenny sticks out in my mind.<br/><br/>The editing was good, although I think it could have been slightly shorter. But there isn't enough wrong with the editing to complain about. The characters were all made to immediately grasp the audience's attention, which is what happened moments after they were introduced.<br/><br/>None of the music really sticks out, but it definitely wasn't anything to complain about. The overall mood of the film, though, is what really helps bring it together. I was half afraid I might let a tear slip close to the end of the film; not really because Jenny dies, but more because of how happy Forrest is just having the life that he does with his son. And as he flashed back to the scenes on the boat, in Vietnam, and his running as he looked at the different skies at different times of day, I realized the beauty that the film makers were trying to capture through the eyes of this slightly retarded man.<br/><br/>All in all, I could really not ask for much better of a film."
"p_lake_91","9","2","5","11 March 2007"," great movie
","use of various techniques highlights how change is inevitable and how it is always going to occur. The imagery that is used is incredible and i had never seen anything like it before. For example, take the seen where Forrest is running from the bullies, he is running as hard as he can with his leg braces on when suddenly the braces break of and he is transformed into a free man who can run for himself and do what he wants. <br/><br/>The plot is also excellent. a movie that is some ways similar to ' rain man' brings tears to your eyes as well as explores the change that was occurring in the society that surrounded Forrest. Things such as the Vietnam war, the political side of things and the change of social standards to 'hippies' changed the society which shaped the way Forrest grew up. The way the movie is set out should also be applauded, the setting on the bus stop bench and the changes that occur to him even while he is sitting there indicates how well this movie links together the changes that have shaped Forrest in the past, and the new influences on his life that are changing him more and more into another person.<br/><br/>9/10"
"hugo91","9","2","5","3 February 2007"," What an amazing film...
","In truth, I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks - films such as ""Big"" have left me cold - but the first time I saw Forrest Gump I went out of the cinema, bought another ticket and went straight back in. Hanks is fantastic in the lead role, he lends a tremendous sense of reality to the role of the social outcast that is Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>What's great about this movie is that there's undoubtedly something in it for everyone. Love, humour, history and war all come together in this cinematic masterpiece. Some of the historical allusions are executed perfectly. I won't mention any as they are some of the best parts of the film, but anyone with any knowledge at all of American popular history will love this film.<br/><br/>Some of the war scenes are a little graphic, but certainly not to the extent of other films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" etc. Besides, the military moments just endear you yet more to Gump.<br/><br/>If you can, you must see this movie - there is NO way you will be disappointed!"

","""Forrest Gump"" is a heart-warming and always enjoyable drama about a little clueless Forrest (outstanding Tom Hanks) who thinks with his heart, not with his head. And that is why the audiences love him so much.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie without a doubt hundreds's of times. It is so sad and touching but it always gives me an extra optimistic boost.<br/><br/>The movie is a journey that guides us trough the life of Forrest. We visit Forrest's life from his Alabama childhood to presidential visit's to Vietnam War all the way to his days of adulthood. The director Robert Zemecis has directed this monumental piece with great sense of humor and a touch of sensitivity.<br/><br/>The story begins at a bus-stop where Forrest waits his bus to come and while waiting he tells his amazing stories to any one who ever sit down with him on the bench. Forrest has an interesting life. He had a crooked back when he was a boy and had to have special metal-braces attached to his legs. People are always teasing Forrest because of he has low IQ. Fortunately he has a strong-minded mother (Sally Field) who is behind his son when the world turns its back on him. He has also Jenny (soulful Robin Wright, nowadays with Penn) as his best friend. Forrest is in love with wild and troubled Jenny but she is hard to tame. Later in his life Forrest meets some of America's most famous people like three presidents (JFK, Lyndon Johnson and Richard ""Water-gate"" Nixon), John Lennon, the king of rock'n'roll Elvis Presley etc. Forrest becomes a football star, Vietnam hero, pin-ball champion, famous enterprise owner and many more. Even he don't got the smarts he still manages to get fame, fortune and respect. Nevertheless the most important thing to Forrest is Jenny. Jenny is in his thoughts all the time.<br/><br/>The absolutely beautiful music composed by Alan Silvestri is breath-taking. Additional music is a massive collection of 60's and 70's feast. Nothing can't beat the good old ""Break on Trough"" by The Doors. I have also a copy of the unbelievable soundtrack.<br/><br/>Robert Zemecis grabbed a subject that was and is still somewhat forbidden matter in modern-day society. With these kind of abilities and talent you can make a successful combination. And I don't understand the people who bark on ""Forrest Gump"". Or that fact which is suggesting that Tom Hanks didn't deserve to win the Oscar from his marvelous lead character! You doubting Judases should make watch ""Forrest Gump"" 24 hours in a row to convince you that you have been seriously wrong...<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is a timeless classic of the enduring love and finding meaning in life. Everyone who enjoys great music and underdog stories ""Forrest Gump"" is just right movie for you.<br/><br/>Forrest: ""What's my destiny, Mama?"" Mrs.Gump: ""You're gonna have to figure it out for yourself."""

","Give me a break, this is nothing special. The only reason this movie has the kind of reputation is does is because of the proved fact that it is impossible for someone to play a leading role in which a character is mentally handicapped and *NOT get a nomination, let alone have the movie received well. Think about that for a second and you'll see that's true. There are no movies that weren't received well where an actor played a *main character with a *mental handicap. (keep in mind the asterisked words, that's what qualifies my statement)<br/><br/>There are movies like this I do like, this is simply not one of them. This was boring because the film had no direction, it simply feels like you're watching the biography of a person from some historical text played out on the big screen. It's just one episode after the next depicting the heroic acts of Forrest and showing the relationships between him and the people he meets, but all these events don't build into any storyline you can care about. Each individual episode presents its own challenges to Forrest, but these feel isolated and doesn't build to any kind of payoff.<br/><br/>If you like stories like this, go watch Sling Blade, it's a much better movie that doesn't put on a facade of being some grand spectacle of our time."
"yawn-2","8","2","5","6 July 2005"," Vastly overrated, but still a very good movie...but please see ""Being There""
","Way, way too many people think this is the greatest movie ever made. They clearly haven't seen enough movies and their idea of a great book must be something like ""Tuesdays with Morrie."" <br/><br/>Americans do tend to be a sentimental lot, fond of oversimplification and easy answers. Still, my China-born wife, daughter of a party member who didn't know ANY of the cultural or historical references when she first saw it, thinks it's the best American movie she's seen. So there is something universal and powerfully emotional here.<br/><br/>More than anything else, this is a work of superior craftsmanship that seems to inspire many people to read far too much into it. This is not a profound film, but it is a very well-made, highly entertaining one.<br/><br/>So many others have mentioned ""Being There"" as the smarter, meaner version of ""Gump"" that I'd like to add my voice to that chorus. It is a travesty that ""Being There"" is now largely forgotten. If you admire the structure of ""Gump"" make sure you get around to renting it. Hell, if you hate ""Gump"" get around to renting it."
"maltcavet","7","2","5","23 December 2004"," Doesn't stand up
","I remember the hype over this movie and the build up to the Oscars. I too, got caught up in the ""isn't this marvelous"" stage, until I saw it the third time -- well after the Oscars and Tom Hanks' win # 2. DO I think he deserved it -- yes, but the movie itself doesn't stand up. The movie itself is sweet but the historical edits -- and pure impossiblity of the story doesn't help. The tone of the film isn't fantastical enough to carry such a story -- it's too far in the realm of the real to carry something as impossible, and this effect is far better achieved in the book and in examples of films like ""Big Fish."" Overall, the players are what make this film good. Never mind Hanks but Robin Wright is perfectly understated as Jenny and Gary Sinise was my personal favorite as Lt. Dan, but the story, direction tone and absolutely horrific historical editing, prevent this movie from being brilliant. In fact, should anyone ever consider this the best movie of it's year? One might, until they see ""The Shawshank Redemption."""

","I found this to be an entertaining film, certainly. However, I just don't see it as one of the top 250 films of all time. Tom Hanks does a great job playing Forrest Gump throughout the film. Sally Field as his mother is also quite good, so the problem isn't with the acting. The story is a shade weak, I think. It skips around a good bit and ends up slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story. I just don't think it was quite in the league that it currently finds itself in. All in all, a very good film, but not a great one. Looks like I'm in the minority, though!"

","Oscarmovies are mostly the kind of movies that are enjoyable to watch but with a very overrated factor but luckily for me (the movie lasts 3 hours) this movie ain't like this. Believe me, anyone who says this is the best movie ever made must have lost some brain cells but it is just entertainment with a high standard. Forrest Gump shows you the American history of the 21st Century in where anything that is of historical worth is linked with a so-called stupid (from Lennon to Reagan). The acting of Tom Hanks is as usual genius, just one of the best actors ever, and you can start saying this movie is totally Americanized (it is, but never works on the nerves) but the focal points are clear : humour and an outstanding Hanks...."
"Angry_Arguer","Null","2","5","11 August 2003"," Shining over the darkness
","Forrest Gump is touching to the melodramatic and sensitive.  Problem is, Robert Zemeckis is more concerned about glossing over the moments that viewers would find objectionable in order to make it more of a ""happy-family-safe-crowd-pleasing-money-maker"".  With Back to the Future and Death Becomes Her he wasn't as concerned about that, hence they were better movies.<br/><br/>Such moments as drug addiction, exploitation, PTSD, the horrors of Vietnam, and the tirade of political violence that flows through the movie are done more for laughs or extracting faux-sentimental emotion from the audience rather than any actual history lesson in the works.  I can only imagine how Terry Gilliam or Oliver Stone of all people would have handled this.<br/><br/>On the technical level, Forrest Gump is a trip.  As Zemeckis said, ""It's not trying to wow you"" and it doesn't.  CGI is used here the way it was supposed to, as a supporting element that enhances the experience.  The editing is also pretty good, many scenes flow into each other effectively and create interesting parallels.  Zemeckis also is finally concerned about what he puts on the screen, thus the cinematography is far better than anything else he previously did.  Hanks' performance is certainly inferior compared to Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  What was the Academy thinking?<br/><br/>While some may wax nostalgia about the passage of time from the 50s to the early 90s in American history, I will try to be supportive of the fact that the film keeps moving.  Unfortunately, the message (and hence the purpose) of the movie is constantly hammered at the audience in a fashion that celebrates foolishness.  How uninventive from a Hollywood ""whiz kid"".<br/><br/>Overall, halfway decent, albeit sugarcoated, film.  If you want real history, watch Schindler's List instead.  3 out of 5 stars."

Sally Field is good as Forrest's Mom. <br/><br/>The movie is well written and pretty well directed. But I just dont think it deserved Best Picture.

","Hollywood produces this kind of feel-good movie all the time: They're corny and over-sentimental, they promote traditional family values and are an example of how the little guy can live the American dream, y'all. And Forrest Gump is guilty of all of this, but somehow it all fits together and is an entertaining and genuinely moving film.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks excels as lovable half-wit Forrest (kind of a cross between Homer Simpson and Superman) and gets into all sorts of nutty adventures whilst exploring America's recent social history. But essentially this is the story of Forrest's fruitless pursuit of his childhood sweetheart Jenny. Forrest's mental backwardness is never really taken too seriously in the film, but it forms a constant and unspoken division between Forrest and the girl of his dreams, and it is this subtle undercurrent throughout the whole film which makes is so watchable.<br/><br/>However, it's cringe-worthy and moving in equal measure - the scenes in which Forrest meets Elvis and John Lennon are incredibly naff. But overall it succeeds. Bizarrely, the film  won the 1994 'best picture' Oscar ahead of Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, and whilst it's clearly not in the same class as either of those two, this is the best corny, over-sentimental, feel-good  film I've ever seen! 7/10."

Forrest Gump is a wonderful film, but in this year against Pulp and esp. Shawshank it shouldn't have won.<br/><br/>This (Forrest Gump) is a great indication that the academy awards don't always get it right, this comes mainly through the hype which surround some movies therefore maybe the oscars should  be held a year later when the hype is gone.

The more the film goes on the more annoying the character becomes. So many people recommended the film as an uplifting experience but I found it dark and depressing. Hanks was hugely lauded for his performance yet the role required little range. If over the top fairy tales about the mentally handicapped are your cup of tea then you may find the movie enjoyable."

I wish a lot of people would hate this stupid film. The reason why I actually hate this film because it is too boring. <br/><br/>Another reason why I want people to hate this film is because the picture is rubbish, the cast and crew should not have won any Academy Awards, and nobody should ever like this stupid film.

"SmileysWorld","5","2","6","18 March 2008"," On second thought..............I like it.
","This is one film that I have to say did not leave a lasting impression on me all of those years ago,but since many factors play a part in whether or not you enjoy a film,and since it is obviously an Oscar winner loved by many,I recently decided to give it a second chance viewing.I am happy to report that I have had a total change of heart.We have here a story about a young man who is,to say the least,seemingly a bit slower than you and I.Yet,unlike many who are slow,he gains fame and prestige.The sweet thing about Forrest Gump is that none of that fame and prestige ever seemed to be that important to him.True love is the only thing that he ever really wanted,yet it always seemed to evade him because the girl he loved was always running away to find herself.Foolishly,she couldn't see that where she belonged was where she always seemed to be when she failed to find herself elsewhere:right there with Forrest.With Forrest Gump,you will laugh at the way he stumbles his way through the history books,yet you will be touched at the way he touches those around him,and will cheer for him to find the love he deserves.You will ultimately learn that you don't have to have that much book smarts to know what is important in life."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","2","6","17 March 2007"," I am usually indifferent about comedy movies, but this one is different than the others
","Most comedy films are pretty much the same: weak story lines, so-so acting, pretty much pointless plots, and so on and so forth. However, ""Forrest Gump"" is a comedy film which is totally different. Because it's not just a comedy. It's a very well-made drama. More than that, it's just a well-made movie. Even if it wasn't funny, it would still be great. That's my concept of a good comedy movie. A good comedy movie needs not only to be funny, but it needs to be able to still hold out even if you totally eliminated all of the humor in it. And ""Forrest Gump"" is the perfect example.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, pulled off what may be his finest performance on the big screen. That and what he did in ""Saving Private Ryan"". While he's definitely not unintelligent in real life, he is talented enough as an actor to make himself appear to be one. Yet he can still make his character appear not only to be a half-wit, but a real person as well. Like Forrest Gump is an actual man and not an actor pulling off a spectacular performance. Gary Sinise was also excellent in his role.<br/><br/>Like I commented earlier, ""Forrest Gump"" is a well-made movie and it would still be just as great even if it wasn't funny. The drama between Forrest and Jenny can be at times, heart-breaking or just simply powerful. Even if Hanks was playing just an ordinary, everyday person with an ordinary, everyday life. And it also has many moments of dumb luck.<br/><br/>Of course, being a comedy, it must also be given credit for being funny, which it is. Tom Hanks, again.<br/><br/>If I ever had a choice to pick just one comedy film to ever see again in my lifetime, I would choose ""Forrest Gump"" because it is not just a good comedy film, but a good movie. And it's one of a rare few that I can give credit for being both at once. It's one of the finest films ever made. Worthy of Best Picture, which it won."
"melissa-feagin","10","2","6","28 January 2007"," How could someone dislike?
","I'm not sure at why I read some of the ""hated it"" reviews, but what I read was shocking and disturbing. If people can't go to the movies and relax their tight political, antagonizing viewpoints for a few hours to relax and take it a pure bit of goodness, then they obviously don't need to see a movie that advertised just that. Forrest Gump is what many ""special"" people are in the world... I have a close family member who is mentally challenged, and he sees the world in a much different way than the rest of us. He doesn't think of money first, nor of popular opinion, and sometimes he doesn't even think of the consequences. He acts upon his upbringing, his knowledge of right and wrong, good and evil, and what will bring a smile to the faces of others, and that is the mentality that carried the character of Forrest Gump through some of the toughest times in our nation's history.<br/><br/>My parents went through the same time period as Forrest.. I guess if he were real they'd be around the same age. They stuck to their guns (and morals) during the 60's and didn't partake of any of the drugs, partying, etc... (and yes, they voted for Reagan), and they are the two most conservative, Boring people I know. So I'm not naive enough to believe that everyone who sailed through those times on the coat-tails of Jesus himself emerges wealthy...being naive and stupid does not result in wealth. However, speaking of Jesus, he does say, ""The meek shall inherit the earth"" and to have ""faith like a child"". And those are the two themes that I personally believe are being conveyed throughout the movie. Lt Dan's injuries and consequential behavior had nothing to do with his political views..it had to do with him being unappreciative that his life was saved!! Instead of being thankful for having more days on earth, he was cynical and jaded and almost drowned in his own self-pity...forgive me if I don't see a connection to his political affiliation there. So I'm confused by the critics who try to over-politicize this ""feel good"" movie and make it more than it is.. this is a simple statement on mankind and the pleasure of living the good in life. Tom Hanks has a stellar performance, and I can watch this film over and over and over, as it is truly my favorite."

This film is an epic. It shows that people who actually care, who are nice people can actually make it in life and that they can influence others to do good. This film shows that a good guy like Forrest can be a successful, and i love the fact that he still chooses to cut lawns for free.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is also hugely funny, and is full of hilarious moments, like the list of ways you can cook shrimp. It also has a few famous lines - ""Run Forrest run"" and ""Life is like a box of chocolates...."" - which are instantly recognisable.<br/><br/>Its also really impressive when he plays ""ping pong"" (or Table Tennis as we call it in UK). Was that really him? If so - he's got two good careers! <br/><br/>This film is a classic, and everyone should see it either for its meaning, its comedy or how touching it is.

","Forrest Gump is my all time favourite movie (shared with Pulp Fiction!). And I'm not American. I don't know what the movie is trying to achieve, and I don't really care. All I know is that it touches every part of me. It's the perfect entertainment. If you ever feel depressed or life is getting the better of you, watch this movie. For all its pathos and sadness its the most emotionally uplifting, good-natured movie ever made. And it achieves all this without an ounce of schmaltz. It is a movie full of humour, profound wisdom and many magical and memorable scenes. I love it. And unlike many it only gets better the more times you watch it.<br/><br/>There are some people here trying to load political baggage onto this movie. I just can't agree. Every institution, belief and value system is treated with exactly the same irreverence. While the world revolves violently and tumultuously around Forrest Gump, he takes it all in his stride with the simple application of his steadfast sense of decency and love. If the movie tells us anything, it tells us that if we could all act a little more like Forrest Gump and a little less like we know it all, the world would be a far better place."
"dmoser1","10","2","6","10 November 2004"," Zemeckis and Hanks redefine ""strength of character""
","Before I ever saw this film, I heard it criticized for being anti-intellectual, for proffering Forrest's limited IQ as a virtue to be applauded. That was enough to dissuade me from actually watching it for a long time. When I finally watched it, though, I found it deeply moving, despite my negative expectations. Yes, it's practically an exercise in non-stop emotional manipulation. Some of it is so heavy-handed that even a softie like me could see it coming and sidestep it. Still, there are other scenes that affect me every time, even after many viewings. There are moments of pride, humor, loneliness, gratitude, fear, heartache, and joy, moments that are true down to the bone, even though the film is obvious fantasy.<br/><br/>Still, it took me a long time to embrace this movie. Forrest did indeed have a low IQ, and is indeed held up as an American hero, and at first I had trouble with that, just as others did. Our culture has suffered enough ""dumbing down"" without popular films promoting stupidity as a positive thing. Also, the character of Jenny was problematic for me, enough to keep me ambivalent about the whole movie; Gump's love for her was almost pathetic and she never seemed to grow in understanding. Forrest offers his heart each time they meet, and each time she leaves him behind without explanation or apology, even after the conception of Forrest Jr., when it seems that she has finally gotten her act together. Ultimately, she only returns when she knew her time was nearly ended.<br/><br/>Through the years, I came across ""Forrest Gump"" occasionally on cable and I would give it another try. I tired of the historical CGI, inserts, and other pop culture jokes pretty fast; they were mildly entertaining the first time around, but after that they seem like they're just in the way, serving only to space out the really meaningful scenes in order to let you catch your breath. But, oh, those good moments... I knew I had to get past my reservations and figure out why I loved this movie. And finally I have.<br/><br/>First, I realized that the review I referred to earlier was wrong. Gump's limited intelligence is not presented as his strength; it's simply a fact of his life that allows the plot to develop in a certain way. It also makes him a more balanced character, since everything else about him is so exceptionally good; his low IQ is a device that allows us to relate to him on a more equal level. The proof that intelligence is not denigrated by this film is the very moving scene when Forrest inquires about his son, fearing that he passed on his only source of (unearned!) shame to his offspring. (IMO, this single scene is good enough to justify Hanks' Oscar.)<br/><br/>No, this film isn't about the thing Forrest lacks; it's about the things that he has, and he has them in spades: honesty, generosity, loyalty, honor, integrity.<br/><br/>The most moving story line, for me, is that of Lieutenant Dan. Forrest saves his life twice, first physically, by dragging him away from a firefight in Vietnam, and then spiritually, by being a beacon for Dan, a lighthouse leading him from a tempest of self-destructiveness to a haven of sanity and peace. I cannot watch Dan's arrival in Bayou le Batre, or walking at Forrest's wedding, without tears.<br/><br/>Jenny? Yes, she fails to appreciate Forrest's better qualities too often. But there is some explanation for her behavior towards the end of the film, and in that light I've decided to cut her some slack. Again, the film just isn't about Jenny's failings, but Forrest's loyalty.<br/><br/>So, after all this time, I'm happy to finally rate this film... 10/10."

","Forrest Gump is the typical underdog that will be loved by almost anyone. He isn't the smartest of all men, but he has a heart of gold and a lot of luck. I guess some people already start running, screaming and kicking when they read this kind of comments, but it certainly isn't as bad as they think.<br/><br/>Of course we all know that what happened to Forrest Gump would never happen in real life. He met Elvis and learned him to dance, he met John Lennon and two presidents, he was in Vietnam and started the Watergate scandal ... he even got rich and famous. Of course it is impossible, but I didn't mind a bit. I thought it was a very nice way to show how time went by and how he got older. Why do we always need a little subtitle telling us that it now is ""November 1, 2004 9.00 PM local time""? I loved the idea of showing us everything with memorable moments in history. OK, some of the viewers don't know their history, so of course they don't know which time period the movie is talking about. Well, perhaps it is a good wake-up call for them: learn more about your history!!! <br/><br/>I loved the twists between drama and humor. It made this movie really special. But a good script alone doesn't make a good movie of course. Tom Hanks did an excellent job as well, he really made Forrest Gump look believable, but so did all the other actors. <br/><br/>All I can say now is that I really liked this movie and that I gave it a 9/10.

","Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickson once said, ""If you're gonna die, die with your boots on.""  I feel much same way about Bobby Z's FORREST GUMP.  A pure star vehicle for Tommy Gun Hanks.  He basically plays Jesus Christ without the ability to be a pacifist all of the time; which, I will admit, at times is touching.  Especially when he watches Jenny (Robin Wright Sean Penn) play guitar at a strip joint, mistaking the event for a legitimate concert, and then slugging the skum balls that harass her. <br/><br/>
I also praise this picture for not being preachy.  It deals with large chunks of American history and treats them objectively, letting us decide what really was going on during such turbulent times.  Gary Sinise is also a charm.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, huge parts of FORREST GUMP lack the firepower to keep us glued to the story.

","I just re watched Forrest Gump on Netflix and it was excellent. I usually don't get surprised if a certain movie has a criminally low score on Rotten tomatoes since I don't expect the people who claim Black Panther is the greatest movie ever made to have brains. But the 71% tomatometer score of this movie was just down right insulting. This is a heart warming yet powerful movie that deserves a spot in the list of greatest movies ever made.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie for some odd reasons, this essentially is a historical drama telling major events of American history through the eyes of Forrest Gump, a low IQ Alabama man who coincidentally encounters those events. He experiences many worlds ,many occupation all because he trusted this world and the people he met. Many criticize the film for having a very bad moral that the more stupid you are the more successful you will be. If you are one of those people, you are misunderstanding this whole movie. If this movie was just about Forrest acting stupid that argument will be valid. But what this movie wants to ask you is whether life has a purpose or it is just a coincidence. The movie does not offer a answer, but it does offer hints. Throughout the movie Forrest meets many people that shape him and become a influence in his life. Those are his mother, Jenny, lieutenant Dan, and Bubba. Yes Forrest did live a life that was full of coincidences. But the people he met and how they shaped him serve as counter point to the idea that life is coincidental. If you have this movie a negative review, I ask you to review watch it and think to yourself as you watch it. I am pretty sure you would have a different view on the movie after you watch it.<br/><br/>Overall this is a phenomenal movie that is a heart warming feel good movie that is powerful at the same time. It is filled with great lines and memorable performances of course from Tom Hanks and many other. Though I don't give a lot of these out, I think I will give this a 10/10 and a A+."

","""My momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" - Forrest Gump<br/><br/>Who doesn't love Forrest Gump? He is, like, one of the most innocent human beings on the planet. He may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has gone on to achieve greatness that most of us couldn't even imagine he could do. Emotionally uplifting, often funny, and inspiring, this movie still retains the magic and positive feeling that Forrest left on millions of Americans when it came out 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Winston Groom, it follows Forrest Gump, a simple-minded Alabama guy who has a heart of gold, as the story chronicles Forrest's life that spans through four decades; from his childhood years, to him being a top college running-back, to him serving in Vietnam, becoming a star ping pong player, owning a successful shrimp company, and going on a 3-year cross-country marathon. While that's going on, he also witnesses and, unintentionally, influences certain key events in the second half of the 20th century American history. However, there's one thing that he truly cares about more than all of the achievements that he has made in his life, and that's his childhood sweetheart, Jenny, who, unlike Forrest, has since been living a self-destructive lifestyle and never reciprocates his feelings for her.<br/><br/>An excellently told story that shows us the world through the eyes of Forrest and how, simply for being at the right place at the right time, he achieves all sorts of accomplishments that no one thought he could do. It does takes some liberties from the novel and there are some parts that feel a tad bit sentimental at times. However, the focus still remains on our main character.<br/><br/>The overall look of the film is fantastic. Aside from being excellently-directed, the cinematography is great, the music fits the time periods, and the editing moves at a steady pace. The visual effects, surprisingly, even for the time, are pretty impressive, particularly when Forrest meets famous historical figures like JFK, John Lennon, and Richard Nixon. What they did was they took archive footages of these historical figures and digitally integrate Tom Hanks as Forrest into the footage seamlessly, as if Forrest is actually there interacting with these historical figures. Another one, in particular, involves Lt. Dan after he loses both his legs. This was done by wrapping blue fabric and ""roto-painting"" around Gary Sinise's legs and then digitally remove them through CG. These effects were done a mere one year after Jurassic Park, which was considered a major game changer in the visual effects department, and while Forrest Gump isn't really a major game changer in that department and there are some small blemishes here and there, still I can't deny that these were impressive for the time; it still looks good though.<br/><br/>The performances from the full cast are all excellent. Tom Hanks is the heart and soul of this movie; he delivers a strong and hypnotizing performance as a guy who is gullible, but very likable. Gary Sinise is outstanding as Lt. Dan, Forrest's lieutenant during Vietnam who loses his legs during an ambush and has became a cynical and bitter cripple who feels that he should carry on his family tradition of dying in a American war, until he finds his purpose again when he joins Forrest in the shrimp business, Robin Wright is great as Forrest's love interest, Jenny, who lives a self-destructive lifestyle due to being sexually abused as a child to the point where she becomes a drug addict and nearly commits suicide, Sally Field is also good as Forrest's loving and caring mother, and Mykelti Williamson is great as Forrest's war buddy, Bubba.<br/><br/>Overall, Forrest Gump is just as impactful as it was in 1994. Dealing with themes of love, friendship, redemption, and destiny, it's one of my all time favorites and has inspired countless people to follow their dreams, live life to the fullest, and to find their destiny. As Forrest would say, ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" Highly mandatory for any movie buff.<br/><br/>""That's all I have to say about that."" - Forrest Gump<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness."

","This movie is so beautiful. It portrays a human, who wasn't smart neither hungry for the success. However, he only did one thing - the common good for the humanity. He was naive and he was too genuine for a real world. But maybe that's what the world needed in 20th century?<br/><br/>And I'm even more certain that we would need a hero like that in these days as well. It's a good example, that no, you don't have to be selfish, you don't have to be arrogant and self-centered and mean to ""win"" the game. You just need to be kind. Kindness wins in the end. With so much noise nowadays, about being and working only for yourself and not the humanity itself - it's really nice to have a piece of art like this.

","I watched this movie about 12 years ago. At that time i wasn't able to watch it completely for some reason, so for a long time i wanted to watch it again and this time right from the start to the very end.
I just watched it an hour ago today and man what a movie this is. It literally makes you feel so many emotions at the same time, and it indeed tries to convey such a powerful message that one's destiny is in his own hands and one should definitely make the best use of all the things that he/she is given by God which is perhaps the main theme of the movie according to me. 
It really doesn't matter how you look or how the society really perceives you, but all that matters in the end are your good intentions and a lot of heart and courage in whatever you do, and all these things do really matter in our lives. This movie just touched my innermost soul and literally shaked it to the core!!...
This move is beautiful and inspiring at the same time without being overly graphic, violent or dramatic like today's movies. I can definitely watch it 1000 times and never ever get bored out of it. And i will recommend this movie to just anyone, which will be a big favour to them, of course!!...
Tom hanks definitely proves in this movie why he is one of the very few true legends out there!!..."

","I must have seen 'Forrest Gump' 4 or 5 times now and it seems to get better with every watch. Few people would dispute that this film is a classic, with many memorable individual scenes and lines, but it's more than that for me. This is a film with heart and soul, with meaning and purpose - a film that is just as effective and moving the second or third time you watch it as it is the first. There aren't many films that can achieve that and that's what makes it so special.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is just perfect as Forrest and his performance is one of, if not my favourite, of all time from an actor. You know an actor has made a character his own when you just can't imagine anybody else in the role - Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump. His performance, just like the film as a whole, is not to be missed.<br/><br/>There aren't many films that I love enough to watch over and over, but 'Forrest Gump' is one of them.

You could write out all of the life lessons learned from this film and have enough for every week of the year.

It shows how friendship and love can still flourish, even after you've seemingly grown miles apart.

Music is perfect for each scene. So full of emotion. I get goosebumps every time with the scene of Jenny and Forrest hugging at the rally in Washington. This is a fantasy movie and should be taken as such. It is artful and meant to be fantasy set in the real world. Gary Sinise is brilliant and deserved is nomination. Robert Zemeckis is under-rated as a director and this movie shows why he should be taken seriously. There are very few true anti-hero stories out there which is too bad. The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books were but changed in the movies (which were fun just different than the books). Forrest Gump is a true anti-hero with no real powers except just being good natured and pure. Watch this movie and then watch it again!"

","What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...<br/><br/>

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>Forrest Gump tells the slightly funny yet saddening tale of Forrest Gump. The story is uplifting, sad, brutal, and at times very funny. The characters are unique and genuine. The story flows with ease.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Tom Hanks performs exceptionally well. Robin Wright also performs well. Sally Fields and Gary Sinise both perform with power and presence.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is a little overlong.<br/><br/>One thing I don't like about the film is how Wright's character takes advantage of Forrest so many times and yet, at the end, we are supposed to feel bad for her.<br/><br/>Pros: Uplifting yet sad story, unique characters, amazing acting, and some really powerful scenes<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and how we are supposed to feel bad for Wright's character even though she is a scumbag <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.6"

Forrest Gump and Jenny are the two characters that stay consistent throughout the entire film. It is clear that Jenny is one of the only people that were unconditionally kind to Forrest from when he was little and throughout his entire life.Forrest's love for Jenny is unwavering through out Forrest's entire life.The film follows Forrest through some of the major events of his life such as college, being drafted into the Vietnam war, and many others. Throughout the film, Jenny stays on Forrest's mind, even when they've been apart for years. This is a theme that persists throughout the entire film. This movie is very realistic, almost as if Forrest is sitting right there, telling you the story himself.Overall, this movie is an all american classic. I would consider it an untraditional love story."
"furkantumay","10","1","2","10 April 2018"," Life of Forrest Gump! For the drama and romance lover
","Forrest is innocent, warm-hearted and adoring man who has lower intelligence level. Actually he hasnt got any important purpose, he lives his life like a feather on the wind. Always keeps the promise and does his job as best he can while thinking about Jenny. The film indeed a lot of important American histroical events and all of these unfold through the perspective of Forrest in tragicomic way. 
 If you are looking for action, reality, heavy drama, intelligence or high-dose romance, do not watch this movie and get on the first bus. (Type A)
 If you are looking for a tragicomic, sad, emotional, pure love story, take a sit next to Forrest Gump and listen him while do not care about when the bus will come. (Type B)

"stormhawk2020","10","1","2","5 May 2017"," Excellent!!
","Converted into a classic of the 90's and for me in a classic of all time, Forrest Gump is a story that marvels, excites, amuses all types of public. It tells the story of the United States through a poor backward named Forrest who is involved in the great events that have occurred in the ""country of opportunity"", with a realistic look at the Vietnam War and other more fantastic ones such as The birth of large companies (such as Apple). But what most envelops me is the background story of love, with an almost unreachable Jenny, which keeps the viewer on the verge of tears in several scenes. (Exciting when he asks for marriage) Notable performances, Hanks was born for this role, great is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, plus special effects first hand, necessary to be able to tell us the dynamic and fun story of North America seen through Forrest's eyes. There are phrases that are immortalized such as ""Run Forrest, Run !!!!"" Or ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to play .."", make this movie a masterpiece of cinema of all time."

"sherryshin","10","1","2","2 March 2017"," Forrest Gump Movie Review
","""Like a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you're going to get"". Like a box of chocolates, in the film, Forrest Gump, you never know what you're going to get. Directed by Robert Zemeckis in 1994, the Academy Award winning Best Picture, Forrest Gump, follows the life of main character Forrest Gump through some of his most important life events. Played brilliantly by actor Tom Hanks, audience members empathize for Forrest as they watch him overcome tremendous hardships as a handicap, growing from a mentally unstable little boy to a successful war veteran and business owner. Through heartbreak, triumph, and loss, so many elements of emotion can be felt through the movie. Also, with the events of Forrest's life very much paralleling with America's history, historical moments of our country's past can be reminisced through the film. The film's main story line with regards to American history, with the variety of elements such as comedy, drama, and romance woven together in the plot, all brought out through Tom Hanks exceptional acting, makes the movie Forrest Gump, one of the most iconic of all time.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump's plot not only follows the story of Forrest's life, but gives a glimpse at various historical moments of America. One of the many historically significant scenes includes the The Hippie Movement and their anti-war protests, as well as the Black Panther Party, which Forrest's long time lover, Jenny, was a part of. The movie also displays what some may say is the most ""accurate depiction of the Vietnam War"", as Forrest, for most of his life was a veteran of the war. The Vietnam War is one of the most controversial armed conflicts to ever take place in the 20th century, and during the movie, viewers experience a realistic depiction of the ""desultory"", ""purposelessness"" of it. The historical significance that the movie encapsulates is important as it provides viewers a glimpse into the history of America through a first person point of view.<br/><br/>The roller-coaster of emotions that are felt in the movie by various elements including comedy, drama, and romance, makes Forrest Gump an enthralling film to see. The first time I watched the film, in the beginning, I thought that the movie was just a comedy, something that would make me chuckle here and there. Little did I know that the movie contained so many lessons and morals that hit me on a deeper level. I say that the film is like a chocolate molten cake, which from the outside has the appearance of a normal, one flavored, typical sponge cake. However, delving deeper into the cake, breaking the outside, chocolate oozes out, similar to what's really under the surface of the movie, Forrest Gump. I feel like many expect the movie to just be a comedic one, but really there is so much more than that. There is romance, drama, and heartbreak, all encapsulated in one two hour span of a film. The movie's twists and turns and the various life events of Forrest are so unexpected that I found myself crying one minute and laughing hysterically the second after. You can experience so many emotions in just this one film.<br/><br/>Without Tom Hanks' brilliant acting as Forrest Gump, the movie's inspiring story line and captivating emotional elements would not have been exhibited at its greatest potential. What was most exceptional about Hanks' acting was his ability to naturally and accurately display a slightly disabled man, a very hard task for any actor to do. There is a fine line between overly exaggerating the role of a handicap person and slipping out of the true character of one, and in my opinion, Tom Hanks perfectly maintained his character throughout the entire film. In 1995, a year after the film was released, Tom Hanks won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Golden Globe for Best Actor, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor, and many other titles. Tom Hank's was and still is admired for his performance as Forrest, which was a tricky role to play, yet a powerful one that made the film so iconic.<br/><br/>Without the deep rooted American culture and various elements evoking different emotions in the plot of the film, as well as Tom Hank's brilliant acting, Forrest Gump would not be the iconic movie that it is. Released in 1994, still today in 2017, Forrest Gump holds its magic and makes for one of the most iconic movies in history. Silly, heartwarming, and inspiring, Forrest Gump is an American classic that everyone should get the chance to watch."

He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.<br/><br/>Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.<br/><br/>Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country."

","Another tremendous movie by Tom Hanks. Throughout the movie Hanks shows amazing acting and gives a brief history of the past century of American culture and life. A great movie to show the family, a few ""cover-the- eyes"" moments for the children. Other than that it is another wonderful, high-quality American movie."
"urge311","10","1","2","16 February 2017"," One of the best films of the 90s
","Winston Groom's Forrest Gump was a novel that was complicated, but (Oscar winning) director Robert Zemeckis brings events together with visual effects that boggle even George Lucas. <br/><br/>And leading the film in this odyssey of American life is Tom Hanks playing Gump (he won his second Oscar for his portrayal) in a film that shows one man who goes through many events in history to find the one he loves. Well done, well acted, and well directed."

","Definitely, a good watch! I learned a lot from this movie! It is an old movie but still one of those that I would love to watch over and over again. I like the choice of characters and the plot itself. It moved me. The actors chose acted well.The movie made me cry. I cried a number of times while watching it and every time, I watch it again. This was brilliantly done! It showed different cultures. Though some scene broke my heart, still I enjoyed watching it. The movie made me understand grief and loss. It made me understand the realities of life more. This made the movie more powerful. I love the play of different emotions, matched with the wonderful performance of the actors. In the last funeral that I attended, I was reminded of the movie."
"DiamondBatiste","10","1","2","12 February 2017"," One of my top five favorite movies
","This movie was absolutely stellar and I love how the story was able to make me feel like I was the one telling it. Whenever you can share an experience that makes you forget it's not your reality it is a job well done. This is my first review ever for a film and I knew if I did one I would have to start with this classic. The music was also amazing and complimented the film as well. Lastly, Tom Hanks gave one of his best performances ever. Another thing of note was how they were able to cover so many major events throughout pop culture in just one film. There has been other films to attempt to capture the same magic as Forrest Gump like Benjamin Button which is also good but haven't been able to do so. It's one of the few films that have adapted a novel perfectly."

","I out off watching this movie for years because I thought it was going to be boring and drag on. I finally watched it last thanksgiving and I regret not watching it sooner!!! It is such a touching story and has meaning to so many people. I wont speak to the meaning of the movie, because as a writer I realize that everyone takes something different from a work of art. <br/><br/>My advice is don't listen to people and their crazy ideas and beliefs. Listen to your heart or gut or head. Which ever you prefer. And do what you want. Read what you want. Write what you want. Watch what you want. (As long as it is appropriate for your age.) You can always ""regret"" doing something later on."

I'm very into history and fun facts and seeing that on the movie made me laughed and i felt intelligent watching a movie which it doesn't happen very often.

"Rahal97","9","1","2","1 January 2017"," Outstanding but overrated!
","Let's get one thing straight, Forrest Gump is spectacular! <br/><br/>Tom Hanks delivered one of the best performances ever. His performance is the best thing about this picture. The movie has a very deep message and anyone at any age should enjoy it. The story told is like no other and is a very great one that touches the viewer, motivates him and affects him in many ways. Definitely worth of being a classic and one of the best family movies.<br/><br/>But the reason why it is overrated is that it won six Oscars the year Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction came out, the two so-called best movies of the 90s and in my opinion both of them are better than Forrest Gump. I definitely understand Hanks winning best actor, but best picture over Pulp Fiction and Shawshank? As usual the Academy got it wrong.<br/><br/>But this does not stop Forrest Gump from being a beautiful movie."

","Forrest Gump, what a brilliant movie. I just love how it contains so many messages and symbols, plus the acting is basically flawless.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is the kind of movie that you can watch for the tenth time yet still get a hold on new perspectives and witness unseen details.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump has got that atmosphere to it that I really love in a movie. I mean, really, the soundtrack is stunning and graphically speaking the movie is nothing but breathtaking.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump can teach both you and me a lot about love, friendship, loneliness, grieving, the consequences of bullying, how people are affected during times of war and how important the childhood is, to name a few."

","They say the biggest compliment you can give an actor for a performance is that during it, you cease to see them as an actor and only see the character as the real person. Well, that is the case for Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>After watching the film last night for about the 20th time, I found it was the first time I experienced this. As soon as young Forrest starts college and the role is passed to Hanks, he as an actor just seems to slip away completely and only the character of this simple gardener from Alabama is left on screen. Hanks both makes you laugh and cry with his portrayal and so deservedly won Best Actor at the 1995 Oscars.<br/><br/>The basic story of Forrest Gump is about a young man who all through his life overcomes many obstacles. From an early age he is given braces on his legs in order to mend his posture, and eventually he is able to run like the wind. Also from an early age, he knows that he is not the smartest or most able man who ever lived, but despite this he goes on to be a part of some of history's most famous, and infamous, moments.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is truly, and I hate to use the clichÃ©, an emotional roller-coaster and is one of those films that everyone should see at least once before they die, as it will change your outlook on life, I know it has with me.<br/><br/>10/10, wonderful film"

He was always thinking about her but she always avoided him knowing that he loved her...Finally they meet and marry when she is just about to die..and she dies weeks later..I personally wanted to see both of them together enjoying life and having good time..but that never happens..She loved her and one night when they met for a brief time they had sex which got her pregnant...she never told him and finally Forrest saw his son years later..when she finally wanted to be with him...That was one of the most emotional scenes of movie..when jenny told him that he was his dad...<br/><br/>But that's what Life is all about.Sorrow,Grief,Happiness,Sacrifice,Innocence,Purity,Integrity, determination,strength of character,valor and above all Love...All these Precious life lessons in One movie..feels like dream...there's much to say...there are still many many important points i am leaving because review is stretching miles..the most important mentions are Sally field..Her role as Forrest's mother is depiction of serious determination and will....Gary Sinise as Lt Dan is best supporting role one can have...He wanted to die in battle field just as his ancestors had died in every American war but Forrest saved him..His character reflected valor,sacrifice and determination...Unlike his ancestors..he lived and became successful even after losing both of his legs. All 10 points from me...Watch it dozens of time..Its only going to turn out better.."

","I must say that I did not expect to love this movie so much the first time I saw it. I thought people were overreacting when they said it was an amazing movie and that it was overrated. I strongly enjoyed watching it because it has everything I'm looking for: it's a mix between a comedy and a drama. You are going to laugh out loud but also cry your eye-balls off while watching. It was very compelling, never boring and the main character, Forest Gump, is very endearing. I also liked the fact that there are some big historical events in the plot which makes the story less fictional. The whole plot consists of following the live of Forest Gump, there isn't a big plot-twist or turn or event but it doesn't make the story boring which I personally prefer. The story is also very surprising because the main character does a lot of things in his life so you'll never going to guess what he's up to or what he'll do next. I have to say that Tom Hanks made a good job of acting as usual (he is very talented)."

","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."

","Forrest Gump is a great film that shows that even though there may be a lot of obstacles if you keep a positive attitude you can make it through. They do this by having Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump, tell the story of his life and the obstacles he overcame without letting the audience know he was already very successful. Tom Hanks does a great job portraying Forrest Gump, he always seems to have a great attitude, even though Forrest goes through a lot of hardships but always seems to get lucky and make out the best, but at the same time looks like he has no idea what he is doing or what is really going on. This film shows that you can always make it through whatever you are going through."

"utkarsh-00205","9","1","2","19 September 2016"," Great Movie is a word too small for this tale
","""Destiny is what you make of your life""<br/><br/>This is what the movie portrays. It is the story of a man named Forrest Gump who has a low IQ. He is the person who instead of making a deal out of his inability, accepts it. He shows that life is all about accepting and moving on. Life is not a fight neither a tussle it simply is ACCEPTANCE. He is a simple man who finds happiness in what he does, it does not matter for him whether he is a national star or a simpleton what matters for him is his morale and happiness. The most influential thing this movie teaches us is that we need not be ashamed of who we are rather we need to acknowledge the fact and accept it for good.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis. He has presented the story so simply yet effectively. The screenplay is more than perfect, cinematography is awesome.The movie is a phenomenal blend of emotions, with everything happening at the right moment. For me what a director thinks of the world is what he/she presents on screen. The director challenges the orthodox society which believes that everyone has a destiny and one should do what he/she is assigned to do by this falsely claimed destiny. The director tells a beautiful tale of an intuitive man ""Forrest Gump"". The director clearly believes that destiny is nothing but the result of one's choices made in life (For eg: Jenny's decision almost destroyed her but Gump lived life to its fullest). The director truly deserved academy award for this fable.<br/><br/>Perfect acting was what the director needed to convert one of the best scripts into a memorable movie, and who could've been better then Tom Hanks. Yes, Forrest Gump is one of the best role that Tom Hanks has ever played. His body language is just perfect. Robin Wright is great as Jenny. Gary Sinise as Lt Dan and Mykelti Williamson as Bubba are perfect. Giving Tom Hanks an academy award for this role was the right decision.<br/><br/>The movie depicts the story of a simple man Forrest Gump who loves his childhood friend Jenny unconditionally but she keeps on going away from him. Gump shares a special relationship with his mother. He becomes best friends with Lt Dan and Bubba during his time in army in Vietnam. The story is great. The movie does not consist of a single story line, it has a no of story lines which finally converge into one phenomenal moment at the end. <br/><br/>Talking about music, for me it was an average music and hence the 9 I've given instead of 10.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a movie, it is this phenomenal narration of a man who never gave up on life and did what he thought was right irrespective of what the society thinks.<br/><br/>At last life is like a box of chocolates you never know of the mysteries it holds."
"julpreciado","10","1","2","18 September 2016"," It's not Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump.
","The first time I saw this movie was one Sunday in 2007, I do not remember which, to be exact, is the day that my father rest from work, remember seeing my father laugh for all the things that passed Gump, and I stayed out of curiosity that was what my father laughed. I sat on the couch with him, to see if it was as funny as he did seem. At that time I did not understand all political situations, racists in the movie had, only understood one thing. I liked Forest Gump, it was such an incredible person, it was fun, friendly, and could do everything.Tom Hanks's performance is second to none can not imagine anyone else today who can do that role as perfect as he did. When I grew up I went back to see the movie to laugh like that day, but did not find what funny anymore. All experiences and situations that happens to Forrest were never more funny. The film completely changed my perception of the world was like at that time and it made me think a lot of what happened in the movie. No doubt Forrest Gump is a movie beyond the fun, a masterpiece in the history of cinema."
"georgeavgeusau","7","1","2","8 September 2016"," Great Movie
","I loved it the first and second time I watched it. Tom Hanks really nailed the roll of the ""Slow- witted"" American that he played. A Beautiful movie that can show how despite our imperfections we can still live very active and exciting lives as Forest Gump does and that ""life is like a box of chocolates"" as Forest's mum said. Although originally this can be seen as a love story between forest and his childhood friend Jenny (played by Robin Wright), it is more than just a ""Romeo and Juliet"" or typical Rom-com, it is a movie that fits into many genres. So if you like action, romance, thrillers and even comedy this can be a film for you. <br/><br/>Overall I would say it was a good purchase. For those who haven't seen it I would suggest like Forest does in the movie to ""Run Forest! Run"" and go watch it."
"taylorhammons","8","1","2","6 August 2016"," Simple, but great for what it is.
","I managed to go 20 years of life without seeing this movie. When I mentioned that to some of my friends, they took it as some sort of travesty of justice and insisted that I go home and watch it immediately. Though I doubted that any movie could live up to the hype they gave it, I was intrigued by their unfailing praise of the movie, so I watched it. It really was very good. It seems to be widely considered one of the best movies ever made and I think that's justified. The film handled the issues of the time with tact and respect, and though the story line was simple, it made sense seeing that it was told from the perspective of a simple mind. Even Forrest's mental state was handled tactfully. Throughout the film, it is made obvious that Forrest has some idea that he is different but he doesn't let it stop him. Many people seem to take issue with the fact that he accomplishes more in his life than a person at full mental capacity could ever dream of, and I wouldn't argue. But movies aren't always meant to be realistic. I think this movie was just realistic enough in the areas it needed to be, while still being uplifting and encouraging. No, it wasn't exactly realistic all the time, but it wasn't meant to be. Yes, it's simple. But it needs to be. Forrest is simple. And that's what makes him great. Tom Hanks' phenomenal acting puts the character over the top and makes him one of the most endearing and lovable characters I've ever seen. Tom Hanks is a true genius, and this film is no exception. In fact, it may even be a standout performance in an already brilliant career. I don't think this movie would have worked with any one else as the lead. But when Tom Hanks does it, Forrest Gump becomes an instant classic. It took me a while to get around to watching it, but I'm glad I did. I laughed, I cried, it was two and a half ours of my time well spent."
"cartesianthought","7","1","2","24 December 2015"," A coy Republican anthem
","It's an anthem to the American Dream and hymn the country's history in the mid to late 1900's. But it's also an ambitious movie with lots of iconic and funny moments. The main character is the simple ordinary Forrest who finds success in everything just by doing what he's told and following societal conventions without questioning them. Of course, it takes a heaping amount of luck to make it happen but it is satisfying to see the good guy win. <br/><br/>The antagonist, of course, is Jenny, who does happen to question society, becomes a counterculture protester, and she ends up dying from AIDS. There's pretty binary system of morality at work in the film and a dearth of actually complex or interesting characters, but whatever it's a movie full of quotable dialogue. Definitely overrated, but good."

In my years i've yet to come across a film to impact me on such an emotional and profound level. Forrest Gump as a character is so dynamic and relatable. His arc is so intriguing to watch, and the friendships he makes throughout his life are just as relatable as the character himself. This film nourishes love and acceptance in it's purest and most human forms. I felt joy and anger and sadness all at once. It truly is one of the greater cinematic works of our time.

The saddest part of the movie that triggered a couple tears was when Forrest Gump and his comrades were fighting in the war and he watched one of his closest friends fatally die slowly by the enemies. As he watched, others were getting shot as well. Another sad part of the movie was when the woman he very well loved left him to search for a better life. This left him devastated.

Gary Sinise's character has always been my favorite character besides Forrest as he brings such a deep presence in to the film, you feel very sorry for him as you follow him through the movie and learn his story. One of the key things I enjoyed about this was the fact that it included so many historical events and managed to bend the story to fit within them, the use of the CGI was nicely done and really gave you that sense of realism.

","This film brings us the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a southern young man with a little mental retardation that, despite don't allow him to be the top in his class, cannot deprive him of the innate goodness that brings in his heart. Owner of a large sympathy and gentleness, maintains an imperishable love for Jenny (Robin Wright), a childhood friend who will lead a very different life from his. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, features Eric Roth's script based on a novel by Winston Groom.<br/><br/>This is perhaps one of the most moving films of the nineties, and a turning point in Tom Hanks' career, which entered its maturity phase, already visible in the film who filmed before this one (""Philadelfia""). And it's very difficult not to feel an immediate empathy for his character, which constantly shows great kindness and sympathy towards all. Forrest, always running, will watch and even take part in many important moments in the recent history of America without, however, set aside his goodness. It's like he passed through life but remained so pure that worldly vices couldn't affect him. Jenny, his love, will follow a different path that will determine the fate of the link between both.<br/><br/>A love can last forever, even without seeing the beloved? Can a person live a love that is pure and without malice? This film is especially dedicated to those who still believe in that."

Although I love Action Movies I really enjoy this one without having any really interesting fight scenes (except the war in Vietnam) - but that's not what this movie is about. It's simply a journey from a simple man's life to your own life..."

","Forrest Gump is probably one of the most well known films of all time. By now it is a classic of cinematic history. To talk about this movie in anyway would be futile, because everyone has their opinion on it by now. It is an excellent film, but I feel it is a bit over-hyped. Since everyone has seen it, its popularity is astounding. The acting is great, the cinematography is outstanding, the story original and interesting. It is quite a long film, but that is cast out by the enjoyment of the film. Tom Hanks brings a magnificent performance, as to be expected. There is not much to talk about this film, so I will leave it at that."

"blackbaryam","10","1","2","24 February 2014"," I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before
","I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.<br/><br/>And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.<br/><br/>I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.<br/><br/>Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid,"" his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.<br/><br/>That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.<br/><br/>It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She is a stripper by that time.<br/><br/>The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the ""Back To The Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.<br/><br/>Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.<br/><br/>Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox."" And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love-ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie."
"Shopaholic35","9","1","2","15 February 2014"," A true classic film.
","This movie will always be a classic. It really tugs at your heartstrings and makes you care about Forrest. There's moments when you feel sorry for him but every negative Forrest turns it into a positive. Sometimes life maybe easier with a simpler existence and an always look on the bright side attitude. Sometimes you envy Forrest and the fact that he is happy with every success he obtains. There will always be haters who can't move on from their abysmal lives but there are always plenty of good souls out there to maintain the balance.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must-watch movie that ages very well. It never feels like I'm watching a good old dated film, it feels like I'm watching a completely relevant movie. I cannot recommend it enough."

"Arcturus1980","10","1","2","20 February 2012"," I couldn't be more pleased with this film
","Forrest Gump achieves a Rockwellian canvas without being head in the clouds about America. Beyond the great pleasure of following Forrest through his storied life, a protagonist neither long on intellect nor burdened by it, the depth of the all around character development has me completely absorbed from beginning to end. It is really something special for a protagonist to have four relationships so well cultivated. I also consider it the best cinematic treatment of the Vietnam War. The nobility and absurdity of it is evinced.<br/><br/>Well deserving of its many accolades in one of cinema's best years, the film blends humor and pathos perfectly. It creates a world for itself whereby the few poetic licenses do not detract from the experience. I find no fault in it. It doesn't even have a notable production mistake. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. restaurants are nice, too! <br/><br/>Simply put, Forrest is pure innocence, free of pretense and calculation. A great character unlike any other I have known. I was recently delighted to screen the film for someone who had not seen it, so it is to such people, however few they are, that I address this review."
"brownman83","9","1","2","19 February 2012"," A brilliant movie, a new addition to my favorite films of all time.
","My first time watching Forrest Gump was this past Saturday, and I left my media room feeling, well, Gumpish. Meaning, I felt like I was Forrest Gump. I talked to my brother in a sort of Forrest Gump accent, and when we went downstairs to discuss the movie like we usually do, we felt it was proper to get out what else than a box of chocolates. Now, hearing quotes from this film my whole life, I knew I had to see this movie soon. After weeks of waiting for it to arrive from Blockbuster, I finally got it on Blu-ray. That night though, we were gonna watch Chronicle, a new movie that seemed pretty cool to watch. My father said fine, but my brother said he'd rather not waste another day from Forrest Gump, for he wanted to get this film over with so he could have felt that same sensation that almost everyone else in America has felt. So we went home, popped in the disc, and started to watch. And it was definitely at my high expectations. At the end, I had experienced Forrest Gump, and I can only say one thing; I was pleased. Yes indeed, Forrest Gump was fantastic film, with great acting and a great story just like everyone had told me so. Tom Hanks blew me away as a sort of ""disabled"", you could say, man who spends his whole life wanting one girl named Jenny, his childhood sweetheart. Not many words can describe the brilliancy in his acting, but the fact that he won for Best Lead Actor at the Academy Awards should some it up. The many adventures he had running through America, fighting in the Vietnamese war, hopping into China to play ping-pong, raising a shrimp fishing empire, and especially chasing the girl of his dreams made this film fully brilliant and gave Tom Hanks a chance to take his character to full heights. My favorite part about the film, though, had to be Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Gay Sinise played his role, and received an Academy Award nomination for his role, and definitely deserved it. I wasn't expecting a character like his anywhere in this film, for he was so dark and corrupted later in the film. He first arrives in my favorite part of the film, in the Vietnam war which had an epic battle scene. Over there, he was supposed to die with honor, but Forrest Gump saves his life from the hand of war, and Taylor loses his legs. Throughout the film, he lives of booze and regrets his life and hates Gump, but later learn to work together. A strange friendship is made, and that is another beautiful part of this film. The editing in this film was spectacular, for there are many scenes in which Gump arrives in famous footage of America. The only problem I had was the dubbing, for that was bit off and edgy. I also felt the film was bit unrealistic at parts, like when he's child and he starts to run and suddenly his back is fixed. The only explanation for that in the whole film was that it was a ""miracle"". Also some parts were unnecessary and only for comedic use in such an epic, broad film, and it kind of ruins the moment. This film, though, still was at the height of my expectations. But it wasn't any higher, just perfect, so I kinda already knew how I was supposed to feel at the end of the movie; emotional. The only problem though was that I didn't feel very emotionally invested in the film at all, and just looked at it from a sense of enjoyment. So, that's why this film deserves a 9. It was very good at many aspects except a few, but if it wanted to get a 10, it should've felt me emotionally, which it didn't.<br/><br/>In the end, Forrest Gump is a masterpiece with great acting, excellent character development, and a broad plot line, but not much emotional feel(depends on whose watching, though) and a few flaws. All in all, this is an excellent film of the 90s and a story to behold.<br/><br/>9/10 A"
"dougpaul","9","1","2","17 February 2012"," The character Forrest Gump inspires me.
","The character Forrest Gump inspires me to push my limits and to do my best.<br/><br/>Forrest has many limitations that would normally hold him back his whole life long. He has trouble walking and has to use leg braces and crutches. But when he has to run away from a gang of bullies, his braces unexpectedly fall away and he finds himself outrunning the bullies. This is the first time he has ever run. Forrest understands he has special abilities and that he must use them wisely. Jenny screams, ""Run, Forrest, run."" This admonition echoes at other crucial moments in Forrest's life. <br/><br/>Forrest has a low IQ. He is nearly turned away from public school because his entry exam score is so much lower than that of any of the other students. He only manages to enter after his mother ""befriends"" the director of the school. He struggles throughout school, but to everyone's surprise, he is accepted into a famous university on an American football scholarship because he easily outruns the opposing players as he carries the football to score a touchdown. While in the army, Forrest is considered a genius by his superiors because he works well under pressure, follows orders and doesn't complain. <br/><br/>Forrest deeply cares about the people in his life. While in the army, he constantly remembers his mom and Jenny and writes to them regularly. Another recruit in the army, a big black man named Bubba, becomes Forrest's first best friend and Forrest looks out for Bubba until the end. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is determined to succeed in his life despite tremendous odds. As I watch Forrest Gump struggle to overcome his limits, I feel hopeful that I, too, can overcome the obstacles that come up in my own life."
"NOXiFy","10","1","2","2 February 2012"," Greatest movie of all time
","It almost seems pointless to write a review for this movie because by now I would like to hope that everyone in the world has seen this film. This is truly one of the greatest films ever made because it explores many important events in American history and explores the life a seemingly slightly retarded young man who manages to make out in life even when all odds were against him. The filming is fantastic throughout the film as is the sound and the orchestra. The orchestra actually does a lot in the film, just the sounds of the violins and the moments that the orchestra plays seems to bring audiences to tears. It's really unexplainable how touching this movie is, honestly anyone if you're reading a review and have never seen this movie I advise you to watch the movie and you will love it. Nothing is more heartbreaking then the ending of this story so if your not one to like tear-jerkers steer clear because even as a tall muscular man I still break down in tears every single time. <br/><br/>I'm honestly surprised this movie isn't rated a solid 9.5, I give it a 10 because everything about it is perfect, it's got probably the biggest Hollywood actor of modern time starring in it (Tom Hanks), and truly is a phenomenal movie."
"tru_blond_2","9","1","2","31 January 2012"," A must-see classic movie!!
","I believe that Forrest Gump had the criteria for a great movie including its plot, characters, rating, and graphics. The plot is one everyone can relate to. The plot consists of someone not fitting in and breaking through the standards that people placed on him and finding his true love. The actors that are playing these roles could not have been more perfect. Forrest is an average man with a very low IQ but he has an optimistic view of the world. Tom Hanks plays Forrest and he plays it well. Along with Mykelti Williamson playing Forrest's very good friend Bubba Blue. There are many actors and characters in the movie, but every role was successfully played out to its full potential. The rating on this site is an 8.7 out of 10. This rating is an accurate one because it reflects not just what one or two people think of it, but a multitude of people. The movie won six academy awards including best picture. An 8.7 is a good rating, it could be even higher for the amount of awards it got and how many people loved it. The graphics, for when the film was made, were great. The war scenes, the presidential scenes, and the segment with Elvis Presley and all the other famous characters, were portrayed well. It made the movie seem less fictional and more relatable. With the great plot, awesome characters, accurate rating, and exciting graphics, the movie Forrest Gump is a must-see."

And he is in many imortant world events, e.g., the Vietnam war, meeting the president and so on and so forth. And he has influenced many people to follow their dreams. I have seen this movie so many times, and it is one of my all time favourites. Easily Tom Hanks' best film role. And Hands off to Gary Sinise for his role as Lieutenant Dan.

"bigverybadtom","8","1","2","16 January 2012"," Overlong, But It Works
","The book this movie was based on, which I haven't read, was more satirical in tone, which explains the basic concept of a simpleton managing to have such great influence on American politics and culture without being aware of it. His childhood leg problem inspires Elvis Presley, he unintentionally mocks Lyndon Johnson's showing off his surgery scar, he goes to Maoist China to play Ping-Pong, he unintentionally starts the 1970's jogging fad, etc. The book's story was purposely contrived; the movie plays everything straight.<br/><br/>As for those who claim the movie glorifies stupidity, the phrase ""Stupid is as stupid does"" has a more honest message, namely that stupidity isn't an inability to think but an unwillingness to. As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered. Remember the scene where the legless Dan described being told he could ""walk with Jesus""?<br/><br/>The acting serves to make the movie work, just as Monty Python's comedy worked by everyone being able to play it all straight."

"Desertman84","10","1","2","28 December 2011"," Forrest Gump: Implausible But A Masterpiece
","Forrest Gump is an epic comedy-drama romance film based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis and it stars Tom Hanks on the title role together Robin Wright and Gary Sinise.The supporting cast also include Sally Field as Mrs Gump,Mykelti Williamson and Haley Joel Osment.The screenplay by Eric Roth depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a native of Alabama who experiences firsthand, and contributes to, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century while being largely unaware of their significance due to his below-average intelligence.<br/><br/>""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny, the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon.<br/><br/>This is a sentimental film with sweetness and charm are occasionally enough to approximate true depth and grace.Although Roth's screenplay may somewhat look implausible as it is a chronicle of the long journey taken by a slow-witted boy through American history and politics,it definitely would provide sympathy to any viewer watching this film.Tom Hanks rose to the occasion with his unforgettable performance as Forrest Gump by providing high-caliber performance. This film simply belongs in company of such sweet classics as Rain Man and Harvey for it is moving,compelling and simply wonderful.And most of all,it is truly a masterpiece."

Historic events were never treated the way the have been in this film. You see it from the perspective of Forrest Gump who doesn't realize what is happening, and just goes with the flow. But for the viewer the contrast of someone like him in some of America's darker events is clear. Without preaching it is a comment on what America is.

Zemeckis weaves Hanks into archive footage and his combination of satire and sentimentality is what makes this masterpiece so beautiful and effective. It's a beautiful story and has Zemeckis's signature visual creativity for good measure. I could not hold back the tears at the arguably beautiful ending and I doubt few can."

","1994 was probably one of the best years for movies, at least from the movie's I've seen. Pretty much every movie I've seen from that year was great, and for me, the best of all those good movies was Forrest Gump. Now some people say this movie wasn't that good, and didn't deserve best picture against other movie's like Pulp Fiction and Shashank Redemption. Well I tried, I tried really hard, to nitpick this movie, find any flaw, and I found so few that they are probably barely worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Sometimes Jenny could come off a bit unlikable, like, why does she continue to leave Forrest and come back to him, just to tease him. I've heard some people complain about the moral, saying it's OK to be stupid because eventually you'll be good at something, or something like that. Personally I see it as don't let disability's get you down, you can do anything no matter what, also God is good.<br/><br/>This movie gives you almost everything, you want comedy it has comedy, you want action it has action, romance, drama, historical fiction, even a little bit of fantasy. As long as you aren't looking for sci-fi or horror, this movie will give you something. It looks great, the production design transport you back to the middle of the twentieth century. And the special effects are phenomenal, and the best part, they aren't noticeable. Seriously you would be surprised how much of this movie used special effects. The acting is great, Tom Hanks giving the best performance of his career, the direction is great, and the writing is fantastic. It sort of gives a history lessong while being hilarious at the same time.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is just one of those movie that is almost perfect, it came out in a year of great movies, and managed to be the best."

Like many others, I deem this as one of my favorites movies ever. Why is it so good? Many good reasons. One for sure is the natural entity of Forrest. He may seem a dumb guy who can't think 'logically' but he has a good heart. He has a good intentions and people recognize that. People love to see someone who has an ability to look by all the bad events which happen in the life. Forrest brings that kind of peace and aplomb which people need in their life. People need to have hope. And Forrest shows that if there's an attitude, there is always hope for good things. Good things happen to good people.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is one the best actors. His peak was in 90's and this is his masterpiece. He'll be always remembered as Forrest Gump. He is perfect for the role and a worthy Oscar winner. His character is so likable that people care about him immediately. The supporting cast is also memorable. Great performances by Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, Robin Wright and Sally Field.<br/><br/>The life of Forrest Gump is fascinating. He did things that made people love him. Not to express sympathy for him, but truly look up to him. It is a story of a lifetime. A story that moves anybody who believe in good things. A compelling, touchy and emotional movie. Forrest says that life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you gonna get. Pick a candy. It's probably delicious."

","this film is by far the most emotional film i have ever seen.everything in it works perfectly the script is amazing with interest all the time.the story depicts us that the most important thing in our life is the love we have for our beloved ones,and the nostalgia we feel for them when they pass away.the story has elements of comedy and adventure but the meaning of the film is completely emotional.the acting in the film is amazing.the three actors that take your breath away is tom hanks gary sinise and robin wright.tom hanks depicts perfectly a person that has a minor mental disability but with some great talents also a person with a pure heart who would give his life for the people he loves. it is extremely sad and maybe makes you cry that such bitter things happen in his life i don't want to give a spoiler but in the end forrest has only two reasons for living, that are the memories he has from his mother his friend bubba and especially jenny.and the other reason is his son he had with jenny.it is a really bitter movie truly a nostalgic masterpiece.forrest gump titanic and cinema paradiso are by far the greatest nostalgic films ever that i will never forget as long as i am alive"

","I saw ""Forrest Gump"" several times at the theaters and also at home on a DVD I bought since it has become available. I believe this movie is inspirational to what men can accomplish, despite of one's limited intelligence. However, even men with limited intelligence have feelings and can fall in love as did Forrest with Jenny, his life long sweat heart from childhood. Through his life Forrest always loved Jenny and under the most adverse circumstances he always kept her in his mind and close to his heart. Despite of events in Forrest's and his life's direction, he never forgot Jenny as his true love. After Forrest returned from the Vietnam War, he ventured into the shrimping business following the suggestion of his friend Bubba. By coincidence Forrest met Jenny again, by which time she has become infected with an incurable disease (I think HIV). Despite of his best efforts to give her a loving home and try to have her cured, he was not able. Near the end of the movie, I burst into tears when I saw Forrest tending to Jenny's Grave. Beside of all the 60's and 70's historical events Forrest stumble into, I believe this movie was a beautiful Love Story of his Love for Jenny. by Steve Horvath, Chicago, IL"

","Tom Hanks delivers a nuanced and cunning performance that cements his status as one of the most talented actors of his generation in this touching and beautifully rendered masterpiece.<br/><br/>On the surface, it is the story of a mental midget who is haphazardly thrust into pivotal and prolific moments, in history and in the lives of those he loves. But Mr. Hanks imbues in his title character a tugging and ironic mystery: Is he really the small-minded dolt everyone assumes him to be, or is there something much more to him â€“ something we all wish we had?<br/><br/>An impeccable supporting cast helps lift Mr. Hanks up. We see Robin Wright as Jenny, the true and only romantic love of Forrest's life, battle demons on the road to her own personal and transformational peace. Gary Sinise is nothing short of marvelous as the semi-crazed Lieutenant Dan, and Sally Field hits the mark as Forrest's doting and insightful mother.<br/><br/>Wonderfully paced and chock-full of memorable quotes, the film inspires viewers to ponder questions so large as destiny and the true nature of the just man.<br/><br/>Lovely cinematography and an outstanding, apt soundtrack also help to make this one of its decade's finest films."

","This is an intriguing social satire in the guise of a quirky comedy-drama. Tom Hanks is good but his performance wasn't award worthy. The film takes a (MINOR SPOILERS) conservative view of American politics but it is deeper than its critics suggest. In fact, the film pokes fun at the average person who goes through life blissfully unaware of the importance of events happening around him/her.

"gcd70","6","1","2","27 January 2008"," Emotionally powerful journey is at times patchy and disjointed
","Comedy-fantasy director Robert Zemeckis (""Romancing the Stone"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Death Becomes Her"") branches out on a new tangent with the comedy-drama ""Forrest Gump"", which tells the rather unlikely tale of a simple Alabama boy's incredible journey through life.<br/><br/>At times Zemeckis manages some subtle and observant comedy, but at other times his attempts at humour fall completely flat. The same too can be said about the dramatic element of the film, with many emotionally powerful moments being contrasted with the bland and ineffective.<br/><br/>Potentially, ""Forrest Gump"" could have been a strong, intensely moving saga of the life of an extraordinary - though slightly 'stupid' - human being who's outlook on life could certainly teach us all a thing of two about what should really be important to us. Gump's naivety and basic values of friendship and love make him akin to another delightful yet simple character, Mickey Rooney's ""Bill"", a mentally challenged man who's only care was the people close to him.<br/><br/>Zemeckis does achieve inspiration occasionally -symbolism is interestingly used at the beginning and end of the picture, to represent Forrest's biggest responsibility coming into his life and then moving on in it's natural course - but for the most part he approaches the movie as a comedy and so wastes the opportunity to create some truly memorable cinema.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks successfully tackles yet another challenging role, though hardly triumphantly. Though Forrest's life is a roller coaster of ups, downs and sensational events (too much so I must say), Hanks gets very little chance to display a versatile range of emotions, and he doesn't even have the most interesting character.<br/><br/>As Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny, Robin Wright portrays with conviction a troubled, tormented and haunted character whose terrible childhood has left her with no self worth. Forrest is the only man who has ever respected and loved her for who she is. Also in strong support is a very impressive Gary Sinise as the bitter Lt. Dan Taylor, a man infuriated with Gump for saving his life, only to have to live it as a cripple. Trapped in a wheelchair and feeling cheated out of his destiny, the Lieutenant turns in desperation to booze and fast women.<br/><br/>It is these two people, both of whom influence Forrest's life greatly, that are by far the most intriguing characters, and it's a shame their parts weren't developed more fully in this film. One mustn't forget the evergreen Sally Field either. She plays Gump's momma, and her small role gives us another glimpse of this fine actress.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Don Burgess jumps at the chance to capture some marvellous images of war and peace, with rural America photographed splendidly at times. Rick Carter's production design maintains the authenticity from the sixties to the eighties, as does the rock soundtrack which even doubles as a narrator on occasion. Arthur Schmidt, as editor, had a tougher job though, and it would appear he had little idea what to leave in and what to take out.<br/><br/>As a result Zemeckis' film is patchy and disjointed, inconsistent, episodic and a fraction over long. Our director and his script writer (Eric Roth-Groom) have tried too hard, and attempted to say too much. Perhaps they could learn something from Anthony Page's ""Bill"" (1981), which was brilliant in its simplicity.<br/><br/>Rest assured though that the promise shown in this movie indicates Bob Zemeckis has a definite future in the genre.<br/><br/>Friday, December 2, 1994 - Croydon Twin Cinema"

I think that everybody would like to be a Forrest Gump in some way he is something like a working class hero of the 90's. Zemeckis did a great job with this movie, he managed to repeat it with CastAway in a different way.

","I'm about to publish a book, called the Bubba Book of Knowledge. One of my quests has been to travel to take photographs of famous movie scenes. I've lived in Savannah since 1983 and was thrilled that Gump was filmed in and around my town. The bench was in downtown Savannah. The Gump House is near Beaufort. The tree they sat in is near the entrance to the Beaufort Marine Base. The bridge that Jenny almost jumped from has been torn down, but was the Kings Ferry Bridge near Richmond Hill, Georgia. Love's Seafood had a temporary ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" neon sign on their restaurant, next to the bridge. Gump was running in front of the houses on West Bay Street in Savannah. I spent a night across the street from the Santa Monica Pier, where he ran to the end and stopped. The grate the young Gump caught his foot in was in Ridgeland, South Carolina. <br/><br/>It's such a thrill to recapture the scenes.

","Maybe the greatest film of the contemporary cinematic age. A heart-felt tale of love, loss and life. The films meandering account, of a selfless man, in search of destiny; portrays vivid historical events and landmarks, affirming an aura of surreal realism. ""Adversity does not create character, it uncovers it"", and this statement is no truer than for Forrest Gump. As the film suggests, perhaps life IS as fragile as a feather, moving from place to place for no rhyme or reason. But maybe, just maybe, there is reason; an underlying human hope, that there are no coincidences, that there is a plan and you never know where it may take you. To pass off this film as 'great' or even 'excellent' would be an insult of unfathomable proportions. An insight into the fragility of life and the unbound nature of 'destiny'; maybe we're all just feathers, blowing on a cool summer breeze."

","When I hear the music, I think of how wonderful the world can truly be if there were more Forrest Gumps out there. When the film came out, it was truly breathtaking. It showed that the great and talented Tom Hanks can perform anything. Had this film been released a year before? He would have probably have gotten his first Academy Award for Best Actor. Truthfully, his role in Philadelphia was good but not Forrest Gump. We don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that he played a Philadelphia attorney dying of AIDS and suing for justice for his termination. While the film, Philadelphia is good. It's not Forrest Gump. What separates Forrest Gump from Philadelphia is that there is so much more going on around the character. I think it's a shame that Sally Field did not get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for playing his mother and Robin Wright also did not get a nomination for Best Supporting ACtress for playing the love of FOrrest's life. They were some of the best female performances of that year alone. When you hear the music or the soundtrack, you are reminded of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly remarkable character named Forrest Gump. Gary Sinise was also worth mentioning because he was nominated for BEst Supporting Actor as the man's Vietnam comrade who he saved. That touching moment of when Forrest realizes his gratitude for saving his life is still chilling and touching and remarkable like the film."
"Cryogenic","10","1","2","18 January 2006"," A tangled and troubling journey
","Not one to have quite made a classic (though the first ""Back to the Future"" film and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" come close), Robert Zemeckis never makes less than interesting work. (I have a particular weakness/affinity for it). In some senses, ""Forrest Gump"" may be his magnum opus - if only because it showcases all of Zemeckis' nuances and idiosyncrasies whilst also somewhat disguising and flaunting its own off-beatedness in a fairly linear - albeit curious - narrative. How do you criticise a film like this? For every negative thrown at Gump, I've seen the film produce a reasonable rebuttal in my own mind. It seems to defy criticism altogether. This unique quality of Gump stems from its refusal to completely yield to its conflicting tonalities and messages. Is it satire, drama or something else? Does it favour the American Dream, slander it or alternatively embrace and shy away from it? Does it champion Forrest's virtuosity, outright demean it or look impartially at it? Do these labels and divides exist at all - is the film merely disinterested in these things or maybe trying to suggest that we shouldn't be bothered and stop dealing in labels and monikers? Many questions - few answers.<br/><br/>Hanks' performance embodies the film. It's pleasant, slick and affecting - yet was it really more Oscar worthy (he won, the others didn't) than Gary Sinise's in the same film or Samuel Jackson's in ""Pulp Fiction""? Was the film as a whole deserving of ""Best Picture""? Are you sick of reading questions? It's all so damn hard to pin this work to one thing. The film offers itself up for criticism in a number of areas - in its flagrant sentimentality, in its gimmicky ""Forrest interacting with famous people"" sequences, in its vast extravagancies (e.g. any time Forrest runs and inevitably performs a remarkable feat) - but all these things seem woven into a greater fabric that spins and toys with them and its pure protagonist, like the wind spinning and toying with the pure white feather and contriving it to land at his feet, not to mention the viewer, in a knowing and powerful manner. Truly, there is nothing quite like ""Forrest Gump"" - nor is there anything like Forrest Gump. Perhaps that is at the root of it all. The film is possibly nothing more than a celebration of individuality. What makes it so profound and transcendental is that the individual of Forrest gives us a unique look at varied and turbulent American history, and more broadly, even more varied and turbulent human experience. We should probably be thankful for that.<br/><br/>I'm sorry for the slightly unconventional review, but as I've said and implied all over, it's an unconventional film and needs to be handled as such. We can all look tough picking up broken glass with Kevlar gloves; when the sharp diamond-like edges can't get to our skin so easily. We can all look good destroying a film with sweeping words; when we've ""gloved"" ourselves away from its smaller details. But how many of us can dispense with the gloves, picking up broken piece after broken piece, constantly risking exposure to the finer qualities of the glass - glass that may cut us? How many of us can dispense with our harsh words, patiently resolving to consider and explore the finer textures of ""Forrest Gump"" - a film that may be saying nothing of interest and reward our patience by ""cutting"" us? It's a tough one. This review has been non-committal. So is the film. See it. Feel it. Live it."

","(Original comment September 2005)<br/><br/>I saw the critically-acclaimed 'classic' Forrest Gump just the other night. The story revolves around a slow-witted, unintelligent man by the name of Forrest Gump. As Gump waits at a bus stop, he decides to tell those sitting next to him his life story. As it turns out, Gump has been present at many historic events; the problem is, he's too stupid to realise their significance. He also tells of his one true love, Jenny, who was the only person in his life to accept him for who he was. However, from adulthood onward, she often eluded him, instead preferring to live a life involving sex and drugs.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough about the plot. Judging by what I saw the other night, Forrest Gump definitely deserves it's status as a 'classic' movie. First off, it is original to an extent, as it focuses on deconstructing a low-intelligence person, rather than putting one in just for cheap laughs (as in There's Something About Mary). Another interesting aspect of the movie is that there is no real villain who is constantly at odds with Gump, as there are in other movies. It also takes on so many moods successfully. Most movies choose one mood and stick with it (comedy, romance, etc.), whereas Forrest Gump provided me with laughs (like when, in a football game, the crowd flashes 'GO FORREST' and then 'STOP FORREST' when he reaches the try line) and romance (Gump and Jenny).<br/><br/>Second off, some of the acting here is great. Tom Hanks really does deliver as Forrest Gump. His accent never wavers and he portrays his low-intelligence character in a touching yet funny way (two signifiers which are pretty much opposites in today's movies). His facial expressions are also quite realistic (see his look when he discovers that he has a son). Gary Sinise (or as I called him, Steve Waugh) puts in a pretty good performance as the embittered lieutenant who believes that his destiny was to die in Vietnam and is 'pissed off' at Gump for robbing him of it. Mylketi Willamson (I think that's his name), also gives a decent turn as Gump's black buddy. <br/><br/>Thirdly, as aforementioned above, this is like a documentary on American culture in the 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's, as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump. During the movie, Forrest meets JFK, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, begins the Watergate scandal, serves in Vietnam and makes national TV, to name a few. This part of the movie, I believe, is presented in an interesting manner.<br/><br/>I find it hard to criticise a movie like 'Forrest Gump', however, I do have one issue with it. It is a little too righteous. Gump has no personality flaws other than being a man of low intelligence. Jenny, on the other hand, is constructed as a woman with many flaws and pays the ultimate price as a result. This is a touch unrealistic. However, this is a minor issue which most people won't even see. Other than that, it is perfect.<br/><br/>I've spoiled enough of the movie for you, so I leave you with this parting advice: See this movie as soon as possible. I saw Forrest Gump, hoping that it'd be good and I wasn't disappointed, but bear in mind that good is an understatement when referring to this movie. This is probably the best movie I've seen this year (over Memento and The Dirty Dozen).<br/><br/>5/5 stars"

","This movie narrates the life of an ordinary man who becomes part of some extraordinary events.<br/><br/>His life revolves around 3 persons. His mother - Though Forests school was not ready to accept Forest as student (due to lack of intelligence), but her mother never gave up and went beyond her limits to give proper education to Forest.<br/><br/>His childhood friend Jenny - Jenny is the person whom he loved and most in his life and always cared for her. Jenny has always treated him as a true friend. She knew he is not a smart person, but he is a very nice person.<br/><br/>His friend Gary - He saved his life in Vietnam war. But Gary lost his both the legs. They started a shrimp company and become billionaire.

","I saw Forrest Gump when I was around eight years old, and to tell you the truth, it was boring to me then. Now I am old enough to understand how the director uses symbolism to represent how anyone, in this case a young man with a mental illness, can change the world by following his heart. That sounds cheesy, but it is very much true. Forrest Gump, beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks, is extremely naive, yet maybe that is why he withdraws affection from any audience (that can comprehend basic symbolism, of course, a huge part in this movie's nature.) as you watch his amazing life unfold. I recommend this movie to anyone in the mood for a sad, moving, and intellectual movie. Forrest Gump truly deserves to be called a 'classic'."

","You can not watch this movie and empathize with Forrest. When Jenny leaves him, you weap. When they reunite, you get that warm, fuzzy feeling. When he exposes his rear-end to the President, you are embarrassed for him. Tom Hanks plays the role of ""clueless child trapped in a man's body"" superbly. Gary Sinise's character, Lt. Dan, also insites a lot of emotion. Mostly pity, but emotion nonetheless. This movie also contains two unforgettable scenes: The first being when Lt. Dan makes the leap from the shrimp boat after asking ""Where the Hell is this God of yours?"" and receiving an answer. The other being when the birds take off in flight at the end of the movie. Thinking back on what Jenny prayed when fleeing her abusive parent, that scene is truly powerful. A must see!"
"Filmcritic624","10","1","2","19 December 2005"," Run Forrest Run!
","TBS showed this movie last night, and none to say the least, I've seen it a thousand times, and all those times, I kept thinking to myself. How can a man with an IQ of 75 become a millionaire while us regulars are pulling in a regular salary of $45,000? The answer: Perseverance, Character. Ambition, Pride, and finally, Inspiration. That's what gets it done, and this movie gets it done with great fashion. It preservers through the rough times Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) possesses (the death of Bubba, his mom, and Jenny). The character he had for going back to get the wounded men on the front when Gump was in the Vietnam War, and allowing people to run with him in his mindless running. Ambition to try and succeed with what he wanted to do with his life (be something, and get there), as well as braving out a storm during a day out on the sea looking to catch some shrimp. Pride, his confidence in himself, the way he handles things around himself, and the ability to handle his own situations. Finally, there's inspiration, as he gave the normal human a reason for hope, and an ability to start anew after making a bad mistake.<br/><br/>The film itself is true in the exact word of it. A man who had limited potential to be something in the world, who then becomes a wealthy tycoon with millions of money. He doesn't run away with it either. He gave it to families that needed the money, build a church, a hospital, and helped his old war companion Lieutenant Dan out of some financial troubles that he was suffering.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Gump with terrific fashion and expertise as southern with a low IQ and skills of a 3rd grader. His performance gets a round of applause from all and standing ovation from many. Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), though drafty at times, looked pretty as Jenny, who struggled in life and her obstacles, and finally, there's the man Gary Sinise, who portrays the enigmatic Lieutenant Dan. He's terrific as a supporting role as one of the friends that Gump develops, and is a great sidekick to his downfalls (see the New Year's Eve party scene).<br/><br/>Based on true current events behind him, its a superb movie that should be watched with the entire family. I wholly recommend it.<br/><br/>That's all I have to say about that."

","although many people thought that forrest gump was boring and were frustrated by forrest's simpleness, this movie is actually a great source of symbolism of how simpleness can lead to happiness. As viewed in certain religions, such as daoism, simpleness is the way to truth and understanding of how the world works. <br/><br/>Forrest gump never tried to change things, and never had egotistic and meddlesome efforts to turn something into something else. This made his live simple and care-free, and ideal life style. Whenever he gained something, he did not take advantage of it or try to manipulate its powers. Instead, he accepted it, and if it happened to leave his hands, did not ponder over its departure. this attitude of life led him to be truly happy, something that is hard to do, even though it may not seem so. he never stopped loving, even though his friend from childhood took twists and turns and they grew their separate ways. It was a very touching movie. he took things as they came, never stopped loving,was truly happy, and that,therefore makes him one of the wisest human beings."

","While 'Forrest Gump' is a good movie, it is a victim of being an over-rated movie. It was one of those films that was in the public eye for a few years, and people quoted it until it became less than a novelty. Finally, it died down, and it is nearly forgotten by the fickle mainstream now.<br/><br/>The film follows a southern United States boy with a below-average IQ into adulthood. It is a film about love and longing as much as it is a comedy film and a historical film. (I know that there are a few rated scenes, but this would be a good film to show to young adults because it is as entertaining as it is a lesson in American history.) Forrest happens to be involved in some important events from his childhood in the 1950s (where he meets and inspires Elvis) to the end of segregation, the Vietnam war, and meeting the president. Despite his low IQ, luck plays a big part in Forrest's life except in his love life where he yearns for Jenny, a girl he knew since his childhood.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film, even though it is over-rated."

","A mentally-challenged man is telling his life to random people on a bench. Good idea? Sure, it doesn't sound too promising, but trust me-it is! The film starts out with Tom Hank's wonderful performance of Forrest Gump. He sits on a bench telling his about his life to people that will listen. What exactly is his life? Forrest has lived a dramatic, passionate life full of love, romance and laughs.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump plays out in chronological order. We start out in his childhood, which Forrest lives through without a father. When he goes to school, he meets Jenny, the girl he is destined to fall in love with. The childhood is a bit embarrassing- the kids are all very odd, but luckily, that is soon over when Forrest goes to high school. He is picked on for his low IQ, and only Jenny sticks up for him. When the kids throw rocks at him, he runs. And thus, one of the most famous lines in Cinema History: ""Run Forrest, run!"" So, Forrest lives through life, often meeting historical figures, which are seen through Forrest's eyes. (The tag line is ""Your world will never be the same, once you've looked through the eyes of Forrest Gump."") Meanwhile, Jenny goes in her own direction, having boyfriends, becoming a hippie, prostituting, and much more.<br/><br/>Through the thirty years Forrest lives, only a few moments are spent with Jenny. Because of this, those moments are the sweetest moments of them all. Well, they might be. There are so many moments; it's hard to pinpoint just one.<br/><br/>I know this film has some flaws such as some gross jokes, and embarrassing moments. I cannot deny these flaws, but I also cannot deny the warmth that was in my heart after the movie was over. <br/><br/>The acting, witty humor, drama, creativity and romance will do noting less than put a smile on your face.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

Pretty impressive for a man that everybody called ""stupid"".<br/><br/>People say that the movie has no plot, no line to follow, but there is. It's Forrest, Forrest Gump.

"bradleyadita","9","1","2","3 September 2005"," gump as allegory / history
","In the film Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks actually plays allegory and myth-in-the-making (aka history) as a ""slow"" individual floating through the decades. The cinematists used this technique of ""history personified"" uniquely to full effect in this film. No other film has gotten away with such an entertaining stroll through the years. Not necessarily to be taken literally; this film was so lauded (possibly unknowingly) for its seamless ability to compartmentalize and package the most recent years of American history up to 1994. Much like the writing of a history textbook, we watch the years unfold as Forrest Gump glides through the ups and downs, stoic to the signs of the times.<br/><br/>Though the film also tells the stories of Jenny, Lt. Dan, Bubba, and Momma, it is Forrest through which we see the world. Though each of these characters *(and the many lesser characters) who come in contact with Forrest each have their own some what negative first response to him, they each, in surrender, are redeemed. Much like each person's relation with history. In the end it is Forrest sitting alone on a rock in a small town Mississippi once again alone. For alone, history sits on a rock in small town Mississippi watching his son ride the bus to kindergarten.<br/><br/>Through this lens, all the devices of the film take on new meaning. Forrest's sporadic television appearances and brushes with celebrity are in fact their own brushes with history. While many films use a boy-girl love relationship as a centerpiece around which to build elaborate stages, here the relationship of love is wrapped around the passage of time. History loves you and history survives you. History is slow and history is a minimalist. The feather device is yet another metaphor for history but one which would not have connected with the audience nearly as much as Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is the feather, the loose leaf, the page from the Curious George book. Our myth/history set free in the wind yet marked by the past; the pages of our lives."

The movie is about a man named Forrest (played by Tom Hanks) whose IQ is a 75. In the movie, he shares his life with people at a bus stop. He shares about all kinds of different events that happened from the 1950's to the 1980's.<br/><br/>This is not a story about a man who is mentally retarded. It is more of a man who manges to get through life, despite all he's been through.<br/><br/>Forrest was born in Alabama to a boardinghouse owner (played by Sally Field). During his childhood, he is forced to wear leg braces to correct his posture. When they finally fall off in his high school years (during a chase by bullies in a pick-up truck) Forrest realizes he can run like the wind.<br/><br/>In his adult years, Forrest accomplishes so much. First, he joins the military and is sent off to Vietnam, he becomes a ping-pong champion, he becomes a shrimp boat captain (in memory of one of his military buddies, Bubba), he becomes a millionaire stockholder for Apple Computers and he runs across the country for no reason.<br/><br/>The thing that impressed me most were the carefully-selected TV clips and the voice dubbing.

"spatrickjr2","9","1","2","22 July 2005"," Forrest Gump packs a good wallop
","Forrest Gump is a timeless film that has won the hearts of millions. It's attraction is a combination of an inspirational story that has heart, the likable innocence of Forrest as the pivotal character during significant periods of recent national and even international historical events, and his genuine affection towards the people who become a part of his life. It is a story about life that the audience can relate to on many different levels, containing elements that provoke every human emotion. There are quite a few catchy, memorable ""one-liners"" that have real meaning for us to ponder, and we can even learn a lesson or two from the simple examples that he sets. Played by actor Tom Hanks, Forrest was a slow-minded southern boy who overcame his disadvantages and challenges through his own sheer will. Often times people are ridiculed by others for being ""different"", as was the case with Forrest starting in his youth. Whether it was for the braces he wore on his legs or for his below-average IQ, there would always be others who would pick on him for no good reason. Forrest did the best he knew how and overcame these obstacles in spite of those who looked down upon him. With a strong upbringing by his ""Mamma"", played by Sally Field, he was instilled with a basic sense of good southern values that propelled him to accomplishments of greatness that can be admired by people from all walks of life.<br/><br/>On a few occasions when somebody actually treated Forrest with the decency and appreciation that all human beings deserve, they won a loyalty from him that would last beyond a lifetime. It doesn't take much sometimes to gain somebody's friendship. Maybe it starts with just a simple gesture, like on their first day of school when nobody would let him sit with them on the bus except for the little girl Jenny who let him sit with her (and then she had a friend for life). Forrest's ""best good friend"" Bubba did the same thing for him when they first met on that Army bus. Since they were both a little slow-minded, they had a lot in common and there was an instant chemistry between them. Bubba shared his dream of being in the shrimping business and invited Forrest to become a part of it with him, but unfortunately Bubba got killed in the war at Vietnam and could never realize his dream. However, Forrest kept his promise to him and followed through with it for Bubba, and when it became a successful business, he remained true to Bubba and gave his half of the profits to Bubba's family. While in the Army, Lieutenant Dan became a part of his life and was right away someone who Forrest looked up to and admired, with the memorable one-liner, ""I sure hope I don't let him down"". After saving the Lieutenant's life, their friendship and loyalty continued after the Army. When he showed up to fulfill his promise of becoming Forrest's first mate, Forrest was so excited to see him that he jumped out of the boat and swam towards him, leaving it unmanned. When it then took a whole dock out, only half-embarrassed, Forrest looked and proudly said in another one-liner, ""that's my boat"". Out of continued respect and appreciation, Forrest always referred to him as Lieutenant Dan. Forrest can run, which is a favorite pastime of many people and also can be a source of solitude. When he ran just to run, all of a sudden it just made sense to people and many thought he had ""all the answers"". ""He sure is a running fool"", but when it comes to defending the honor of his girl and doing what's right, he is truly a man on a mission and isn't afraid to fight for what he believes in. These all show qualities of friendship and ideals that everybody can strive for.<br/><br/>Not only does this film appeal for it's heart-felt entertainment value, but it also has a lot of replay value as well. It's the kind of movie that, each time it is watched, more is learned about the depth of each character and their relationships with Forrest. The one-liners are always just as enjoyable and, after all, what red-blooded American couldn't be inspired watching Forrest clobber some guy in defending the honor of his Jenny? In every way, Forrest Gump packs a good wallop."

Most of the story is narrated by Tom Hanks's Forrest with him telling passers by his life story, he is looking back on his life and it is evident that he has played an important role in history unaware though he is. Forrest's story is a heartwarming, heartbreaking tale, despite his fame and fortune the one person he's ever wanted will never truly be his for any length of time and what can you do but cry? Without doubt this is Tom Hanks's film, I doubt that any other actor could carry off the role of Forrest, the other characters are acted superbly but Tom Hanks's fully deserves praise for this film. In my eyes Forrest Gump is a real person who has led a very real life, his heartfelt monologues will stay with me forever & I will always remember what ""Mama always said..."" I am yet to find another film that has stayed with me the way this film have, I have never waited years to see a film and will probably never do again. This film stands out, it is one of a kind, there is no other film like this film and there is nobody else like Forrest Gump. ""The World will never be the same again once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump."""

","As said in previous reviews, 1994 was a good year for movies. But in the end one stood out among the crowd. This was ""Forrest Gump"". With its compelling story, lovable cast, and filled with memorable, and hilarious, moments, it blew away the competition.<br/><br/>Hanks is probably one of my favorite actors, mostly because of this role. I also enjoyed Gary Sinise and Sally Field in their roles. If I had any complaints, it would be Robin Wright Penn and her character. I mean Forrest isn't smart, but he can do better.<br/><br/>Other than that, and a little unnecessary language, I simply loved this film."
"paul_mampilly","8","1","2","31 January 2005"," The American Dream Lived Out Through The Eyes Of A Simple Man
","1994 was the year where being dumb ruled in the cinemas. Two out of ten top grossing movies of this year was about really idiotic or simple-minded people. The first one being the Jim Carrey vehicle ""Dumb And Dumber"" and the other one being ""Forrest Gump"" Though the first movie just made the viewers laugh with puerile humour, the latter movie provides a nostalgic travel through important events through history. It is the second movie that I am going to talk about in this review.<br/><br/>Spoiler Plots Dead Ahead!!! The movie's story is really ""simple"" to pardon the pun. It is about this character that has a very low I.Q., who while waiting for a bus, seems to tell his life experiences to folk next to him. It can be considered that this plot seems to be really going nowhere, however Forrest life is pretty unique. He seems to bumble into very important historical events in America's history without ever realising. These events last from the 1960's to the 1990's. He got to meet very famous people like J.F.K., Lyndon Johnson, Elvis, and John Lennon during his life. He fought in the Vietnam War, and made a million in the shrimp business and investing in some kind of fruit computer company. Even though he has experienced all these amazing events and people, the only thing that makes him going is his relentless love for Jenny, who is a childhood sweetheart who seems to push him away.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks acting is absolutely amazing in this movie, and probably did his best role as the slow-witted Forrest Gump. He seems to play the everyday man who seems to be in extraordinary events in most of his movies, so therefore he is ideal in this movie. Sally Field plays one of the most understandable and lovable mothers who do not seem to be so saccharine sweet. Gary Sinse seems to play a really good role of Lt Dan Taylor, and I thought that Robin Wright Penn was pretty good as Jenny.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was essential to this movie, since it seems to accentuate each scene with great poignancy. Also the music in this movie got me at least singing to it, though I was not even born in half the decades that the soundtrack had in it.<br/><br/>It would have to be said that I actually liked this movie. I am not a big fan of nostalgic movies, since I don't usually seem to connect to such films like that. Also I am a bit of a cynic when it comes to such films like these. Yet this movie seems to hit a a nerve with me and I really enjoyed it and makes me escape to such a fantasy life like Forrest Gump. Also this movie seem to show some social undertones, such as the constant aftermath of Vietnam, (nowadays this would be Gulf War II), the fighting against racism, (befriending Bubba during such racial tensions), and sexual and physical mistreatments of women (shown many times with Jenny). A final point to say is that in this movie, the portrayal is that Mr Gump is seen as a stupid person. However, it is the line which portrays the irony in this movie, ""Stupid Is As Stupid Does"".<br/><br/>It shows the rest of the people in this movie who seems to act out this line, such as Jenny who seems to be in a constant spiral downwards into hedonism and drugs, and Lt. Dan who seems to have gone mad when he lost his legs. The movie shows that Gump only views the world in simple terms and his morals are never waivered when everyone else's are flipping back and forth over the blurry line of right and wrong.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think this is one of the most heart warming movies I have ever seen and it is up there with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" sentimentality with dark overtones. However I am still a cynic when it comes to movies."

","First, let me say that 1994 was an excellent year for the Oscars. Such movies as Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Quiz Show, and Four Weddings and a funeral were the contenders for best picture. It was a tough choice for the academy, but Forrest Gump went home with the Oscar.<br/><br/>The movie is a look back upon the life of a naive man named Forrest Gump. He believed everything his mom taught him, and he was innocently involved in some of the key events of the 20th century.<br/><br/>The movie is funny at times because the audience clearly knows what is going on around him, but he thinks almost nothing of it. There is some good historical information in this movie, in fact, a high school American History teacher could consider showing this movie at the end of the year, because Forest Gump takes us back to the beginning of American History, and progresses all the way through it.<br/><br/>This is a long movie, but it is of very good quality, and I think it is well worth your time."

Towards the end she tells him that he has a son Forrst Gump Jr.(Osment) and that she has a virus and doesn't have much time left. They get married and Jenny dies not too long after wards.

The film chronicles his accidental experiences with some of the most important people and events in America from the late 1950's through the 1970's including a meeting with Elvis Presley, John F.Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, fighting in Vietnam, etc. The problem is, he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Forrest becomes representative of the baby boomer generation having walked through life blindly and has the time went on he learned a whole lot more. The one thing I thought was pretty cool about Forrest Gump is the way he plays ping-pong (or sometimes called table tennis)! I was amazed during one part of the film where Forrest Gump ran all the way to Arizona!<br/><br/>This movie won 6 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Effects/Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Writing Screenplay.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: LIKE MY MOMMA ALWAYS SAYS LIFE IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHICH ONE YOU'RE GOING TO GET."
"Pengzhongman","Null","1","2","5 November 2004"," Technological miracle
","What Forrest Gump tells about is a man, named Forrest Gump , who has intelligence as low as going through American past of 40 years. Forrest Gump is the most amazing film I have ever seen. The way the director directs is a miracle. The first scene, i.e., at the beginning of the film, one feather falling down to where Gump is sitting .It looks like a long and continuous moving scene. Even though you gaze at the feather (I ever did it), you could not tell whether it is true .The shade and reflection make it real. I am really confused the way to make the feather authentic. Beside of the technological miracle, the way the story tells is kind of self-reflection: Gump picks up the feather and puts it into a book. During the whole film, the feather has not been taken out any more until the end .So I am convinced easily that it is a comedy as leisurely as a feather. Definitely, the feather is one of highlights. Begin with the falling of the feather, Gump picks up the feather and begins to tell his experience to strangers. Afterward, he stands up and runs to find Jannie and his son. With the possession of the feather, something different from the former relation between Gump and Jannie: they ultimately marry each other and have the short happy time. Jannie dies of a serious disease. However, she leaves prosperity to Gump and his son, i.e., the prosperity for the next generation. The small family is kept after all (it seems to be prosperous). With the present of the feather, at the time when the old Gump sends his son to get on the school bus, the circle is made full and it is the end of the story. What¡¯s more, what I am thrilled is another revolution of directing: Gump is put into the historical events presenting with the historical big names, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, by switching the scenes of the old documentary with Forrest Gump, which is a milestone in film-making history."

It is a perfect, -perfect- example of a movie-making masterpiece, and deserves every bit of praise it has, and then some. The scene where Lieutenant Dan Taylor is fighting the hurricane, is showing that man can triumph, even when, and literally in this case, life cuts your legs out from under you. The reason I love this movie so much is not just because of it's wonderful figuratisms and outstanding symbolism, but because of it's un-opinionated view on American life from 1950 to 1985. It shows a man, who yes, may be a little slow, that sees the world for what it is and takes everything literally, without watering it down or making it seem better than it really is. He takes everything in, and usually through one word, or on occasion, a long speech, sums everything up, and makes everyone understand it the way he understands it. In conclusion, the critics can keep their petty under-scored ""reviews"" to themselves. I loved the movie, and would recommend it to -any- person who loves good movies."
"basrutten","8","1","2","18 July 2004"," Very clever and funny movie that succumbs a bit to sentimentality
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is a very creative and clever movie that tells roughly thirty years of recent American history through the eyes of a rather stupid person who somehow manages to be present at many important events of the last half century. Tom Hanks, as Forrest Gump, meets three american presidents, inspires Elvis and John Lennon, becomes a war hero in Vietnam, and much more. <br/><br/>I must say that I had my doubts when I heard about this movie, but much to my surprise I found this movie to be often very funny. It's not a movie that constantly has you laughing out loud, but several jokes like Forrest teaching Elvis to dance are priceless, and there are a lot of quotable one-liners. Looking at other comments, I see that people have tried to see all kinds of political agendas behind this movie, but for the most part I think it should just be taken as harmless fun, although there are a couple of clear points of criticism (e.g. the movie claims that stupidity is the key to succeeding in the army, and that you can get a college degree by just being good at sports). <br/><br/>Technically, this movie is great. The special effects people have done a great job of making it look like Forrest Gump really was a part of history, and the costumes and settings are all completely convincing. The acting is also superb. Tom Hanks makes Forrest totally convincing, and the rest of the cast is great as well. Gary Sinise is probably the most underrated actor ever, this man deserves to get leading roles, not just supporting ones.<br/><br/>
I do have a couple of gripes with this movie. For one, at over two-and-a-half hours, it's a bit on the long side. After about one-and-a-half hours, the novelty wears off a bit and while there are still some good scenes in the second part of the movie, the first half is definitely better. Also, towards the end the movie succumbs a bit too much into sentimentality. I mean, was it really necessary to overdo the tragic romance (including very tragic ending) between Jenny and Forrest in this way? In a movie that's mostly fairly lighthearted, putting so much emphasis on the rather melodramatic romance just seems a bit misplaced.<br/><br/>All in all though, ""Forrest Gump"" is a very amusing movie and often hilarious movie with a clever plot and superb acting, that unfortunately drags on for a bit too long and succumbs a bit to sentimentality in the end.<br/><br/>

","!!!!!WARNINGS SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>I have just watched this for perhaps the third or forth time in its entirety and once again found it to be an uplifting experience; I have read various comments on its Academy competition in 1995 which was perhaps the steepest in recent times, comparisons to the book, (which I haven't read). I think though to truly reflect on it on its own merits. It is a simple tale of a simple man's journey through an amazing life. And although it requires a heavy suspension of disbelief, is that not the purpose of such pieces of entertainment? Are we not similarly uplifted when a Big Foot and two Abbot and Costello type robots help to save the galaxy? Or are we not transfixed with the characters of Jackson's LOTRs? The fact is that Forest is a lot less able than most of us yet he seems stumble into these wonderful adventures that through experience perhaps gives him a better level of understanding that we with our higher cranial capacity can't hope to emulate. Right to the last two scenes in which we see Forest having come to terms with the ambivalence losing the love that for so long eluded him, and yet getting to know the love of a son he never knew he had. In essence it's that old classic tale of the underdog. It is one of those old friendly cloaks that we can wrap around us for warmth on a cold night!<br/><br/>
If any the message perhaps that Bob Zemeckis is aiming for is that many of us go through life missing the good things along the way - the whole film being a metaphor for most people, no matter their place or station in the world, are given a number  of unappreciated blessings. Even that our own more complicated view of the world gives us a tarnished view of it. Where as Forest just does what he feels 'he' should or says exactly what he feels and is encumbered by the need to present himself in a light that requires the approval of his audience. Perhaps that is to philosophical a look at this film but then I am as I said more impressed with ability to entertain, after all is that not the first job of any films, if we were not able to be entertained through fiction perhaps we would sit at home watching CNN and The Discovery Channel. And as the man would say 'that's all I wan't to say about that right now!'<br/><br/>As for the technical aspects of Forest Gump, well were do I start. The acting I thought throughout was excellent Hank's portrayal is more than just good, he sucks you in to the story and helps you form a bond with the main character early, and towards the end were most of the Dialog is by way of metronome precision narration (that keeps the timing of the film together) we see Forest running or on his mower or even just sitting around pondering what has gone before, Tom's facial interpretation of this is excellent. The direction is a major triumph for BZ and the supporting cast turn in stellar performances especially Gary Sinise who chemistry with Hanks has been called upon on two subsequent occasions. (Answers on a post card - EZ really!) All this under one of the best soundtracks ever and of course that wonderful Alan Silvestri score!<br/><br/>Forest Rocks *****"

The movie's unique sense of humor makes it clear early on how it doesn't plan to take its subject matter too seriously, and when the occasional sentimental scene does crop up, it's executed in a way that is surprisingly not cloying or embarrassing.

","It seems that when a story is told on film, the most difficult thing to do is NOT use a narrative voice over. Sometimes film makers get lazy or lack creativity and decide that the viewer would be lost without the narrative, so they feel trapped into adding the story-telling voice over (or even worse, long paragraphs scrolling between each act). It is especially hard to avoid when covering a long time span. While being informative, to me it can dumb a movie down. This is the ONLY complaint I have with this whole movie. Beyond the small annoyance with the voiced over narration, I thought this was a near perfect movie, combining every element of great modern movie making, from beautiful scenery, to comedic genius, to action, to romance, and on to gripping drama. Further, this movie contained a great cast.<br/><br/>
***************Spoiler Warning*************** My gripe about the narration being voiced over in order to inform the audience is tempered by the creativity which was used to present the narration. It wasn't your typical story telling of an elderly person wisely reflecting on the life he or she had lived, telling the story to the audience as if we were his or her grandchild. The narration was brilliantly inserted as Forrest met different people at the bus stop, giving us even more insight into this man. He is a simple, friendly and interesting man that wants people to know about him and the love and pain he has endured through the years. He didn't even realize the impact his life had on the culture of the past 2 decades.  Or more interestingly, maybe he DID know what he was saying and just PLAYED dumb. After all, stupid is as stupid does.  Maybe Forrest Gump was a genius (as his drill sergeant put it) and just wanted us to think his life was more important than it really was.  Or how about this, maybe his life really did have this huge cultural impact and he was just being modest.  It's incredible when you think about the number of possible explanations as to why Forrest seemed to so quickly spit out the grand story of his life and it's impact on the world without much regard to how important it REALLY was. He seemed to trivialize each major impact his life had on the world while maintaining his focus on his love for Jennie, his mother's wisdom, or his friend Ltnt Dan.  This creativity, along with the layers it brings to Forrest's persona is why I am able to forgive the lazy approach to story telling in the narrative.<br/><br/>It was also interesting to me how some holes were closed, but left to the viewers imagination exactly what happened... most notably Jen's disease. Did she die from AIDS? Did she pass it to her son? Just an interesting tidbit, IMO.<br/><br/>In summary, this was a near perfect movie. I believe this movie will hold up for years to come and eventually will be considered a classic. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 points.<br/><br/>If you like good music (especially 60's and 70's), get this soundtrack. It's the best movie soundtrack made, for my taste anyway."

","If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you really shouldn't even be on this website, this is one of the greatest films ever so you must go and watch now in order to make a judgement on any other film ever made, this one sets the standard for the films of my generation and is an asset to Hollywood. But for me, what makes this film stand out more than any other with a genuinely moving intelligent screenplay is not the unforgettable moments with quotes such as  'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you're going to get' which eloquently explains the questions of the universe nor is it the endearing character study supported by some of the finest actors in the industry (Sally Field, Robin Right Penn, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson are all exceptional) but it is one man- Tom Hanks. Although 'everybody casts Tom Hanks'and the question why? is always asked, well this answers all questions.  In his best performance of his career he earned his Oscar with every-compelling moment he is on the screen. Every aspiring actor should be frantically taking notes of this outstanding display of acting. perfect."

"darrell-garrison","10","1","2","25 January 2003"," My all-time fave!!!
","(10 out of 10)  When I was 15, I saw 'Star Wars' on the big screen for the first time.  I saw it many times that summer, and as a 15 year-old boy, it had a tremendous influence on me.  No movie came close to supplanting Star Wars as my all-time favorite movie until 'Forrest Gump.'<br/><br/>
I saw 'Forrest Gump' on the big-screen six times, and many times on video since then.  It is the most life-affirming movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I don't give 10's to movies very often.  A great movie should get a 9.  The difference between a 9 and a 10 is feeling.  How does the movie make you feel after you've seen it?  How long do the images stick with you?<br/><br/>There is not a single scene in 'Forrest Gump' that is without thought and feeling.  The movie is hilarious and tragic.  It is soulful and charming. It is incredibly sad and emotionally uplifting.  A true rollercoaster of genuine feelings.  Set against the backdrop of the 50's through 80's, it has that nostalgic and true ring to it.  It has to, since what happens to Forrest, Forrest Gump, is incredible.<br/><br/>The movie is audacious to say the least.  Any other film that puts its no-name central character with people ranging from Elvis to Nixon will seem like a copycat of this one.<br/><br/>Hanks is absolutely superb.  The previous year he won an Oscar for his most sincere work, 'Philadelphia'.  He won THIS Oscar for his most seminal work. It will probably be the movie he will most be remembered by, even though he has decades of movies ahead of him.<br/><br/>The team that put this together, most notably Robert Zemeckis, did a great job with everything from characters to celebrity appearances to classic music setting the mood (listen to ""Camelot"" playing in the background as Forrest is in the JFK White House).<br/><br/>The weakest parts of the film are Robin Wright Penn, who is a good actress, but not great, and the running scenes.  But since Robin is not in the film that much, it's okay.  And the running towards the end actually give a bit of a breather, I feel, so I'm not bothered by it.<br/><br/>With all of the ups and downs in the film, how can I say this is the most life-affirming movie I've ever seen?  Because at the end of the day, Forrest Gump is a man who has been to hell and back, who has lost loved ones, who has struggled with his place in the world, and managed to come through it all with sweetness and love.  The world changed, and in some ways Forrest changed with it, but he is not jaded by it, as you and I are.  If we could be as simple as Forrest, mightn't we be happier?"
"pgiuntol","10","1","2","16 January 2003"," one of the best movies ever made
","When watching this film, you just have to let yourself get caught up in the movie itself. Looking at the unrealistic aspects of it and critizising them won't allow you to get the full affect of the movie. It is just a story. An illogical one that could never have happened in real life, but if you accept it as being true and let yourself get caught up in it, the story becomes incredible. The story combined with the outstanding acting by the five main characters (Gump, Jenny, Bubba, Lt. Dan, and Momma) shows the influence of major historical events on our society. But it shows it through the eyes of a person that doesn't recognize the importance of each of them. The other characters are affected a great deal. Vietnam killed Bubba. It nearly killed Lt. Dan, but instead sent him into a depression that only Gump's naiveness could have saved him from. And of course Jenny might have been the most influenced of all. She represented an abused child, a runaway, a hippy, a drug addict, a slut, and the aids virus. This girl probably went straight to hell when she died but Gump couldn't see her faults.  He was in love, which was the only thing that affected him throughout the movie. Nothing else really mattered to him in the end. He cared for people that cared for him, or that he thought cared for him. He did things for his friends that none of us would ever do because we would be looked at as stupid or crazy. He bought a shrimping boat because of a promise he made to Bubba. What kind of moron would buy a shrimping boat if he had never done any shrimping before in his life. Forrest Gump did and he eventually became a rich man because he didn't know any better. For those of you that don't like this movie, you're looking at it the wrong way.  From what I've heard people either love it or hate it. I love it and apparently most other film critics do if it won best picture. Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies and so is Shawshank. They were both incredible and unforgettable. But they weren't quite as good as Forrest Gump."

Solid supporting cast is highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for Sixth Sense's child star as Forrest's son.

Without giving away any crucial elements in the picture I will simply write...pay close attention to his shoes in the picture and everything they ever say about feet.  Pay even closer attention to Forrest's first conversation with Lt. Dan.  It foreshadows their entire relationship.

","FORREST GUMP  was the best movie of 1994. Tom Hanks is completely endearing as Forrest, a simple guy shortchanged in the IQ department, who proves that brains aren't the only things needed to succeed in this world. The movie, beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a nostalgic sweep that will carry you away. The opening shot of a feather on its way to earth is enough to make you gasp aloud, and the movie is just barely underway. Forrest Gump is also a wonder of special effects, but the less said about them, the better. The trailer and promotional pieces gave away much too much of the story. Admittedly, this movie has more than its share of plot, as it covers the decades of the '50s through the '90s. It also makes numerous pit stops along the way to encompass the momentous events that molded the times.<br/><br/>
The Gump saga begins back in the 1950s under the cloud known as polio. Throughout the years that follow, Forrest must contend with his score of 75 on an IQ test, but the braces on his legs don't hold him back for long. Forrest, who sometimes brings to mind the innocent simpleton hero Charlie Babbit, manages to make quite a few surprising contributions to society without even trying. Sure, some of the movie is sappy, but it is served up with consummate skill and a loving heart. The supporting cast is cannily chosen. Sally (""You like me, you really like me"") Fields, who plays Forrest's mother, may hereafter be known as Sally (""Life is like a box of chocolates"") Fields. You never know what you're gonna get."
"de_niro_2001","Null","1","2","18 May 2002"," The South's greatest hero since Huck Finn
","Some moral high grounders were up in arms over this film because of the depictions of sex, violence, drugs etc in it. Yes, the sleazy side of life features heavily in Forrest Gump but the film laughs at it. The film does not make out that there's anything admirable about sexual perversion, violence, heavy drinking or drug taking. Forrest always knows the right things to say and do and although he might not be too bright he is a better person than many of the people he encounters. He shuns the sleazy side of life (although in some ways he doesn't fully understand it) and this is symbolised in the scene when he pushes the hooker away when she tries to make love to him. Jenny poses for Playboy, plays the guitar naked in a perverts' club, takes drugs but Forrest is there for her as her gallant protector and moral guardian. Forrest is also only violent under extreme provocation such as in the scene with Wesley. Wesley sees Forrest in his army uniform and calls him a baby-killer but like many holier-than-thou pacifists Wesley is at heart a violent person who hits Jenny. Forrest duly lays into him and if this scene is violent it's no worse than the handsome hero in an old silent film giving the villain a good thrashing for what he's done to the heroine. Forrest is pleasant to everyone, be they people on the street or US Presidents. He speaks sadly about President Kennedy and John Lennon being shot. Also, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour not for killing or destroying the enemy in Vietnam but for saving the lives of other soldiers at great personal risk to himself. He is a decent guy who is successful in life and the film is not patronising to handicapped people as some people have said. The portrayal of the single parent family has also been criticised but frankly the message here is ""always be nice to your Momma"". It is a feel good movie and although life from the 60s to the 80s may not always have been great this film show it in a positive light. Some scenes remind you of Midnight Cowboy and I think this is intentional. However Midnight Cowboy was a downbeat movie made at the end of the cynical 60s. This is a pleasant upbeat film. It is incidentally very different from Winston Groom's book and I think it is better than the book. The only thing I would have changed about the film  is that I wouldn't have had Jenny die at the end. To conclude, funny, heartwarming, original and brilliant."

The feather and the feather only is great in this movie; the rest is capable at best (Hanks' performance, some of the cinematography) and hackneyed at worst.  This is the sort of movie, like THE SOUND OF MUSIC, which cues its sentiment so strongly it's insulting.  It's interesting to take a movie like this and compare it with something like BIRDY (which has certain thematic similarities); BIRDY's premise is so much more far-fetched, and yet the movie has an authenticity GUMP can't manage.

Robert Zemeckis has the power to exhaust me, whether it's my emotions (""Contact"", this film), my visual cortex (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Contact""), or my funny bone (""Used Cars"").  His screenplay is responsible for anything positive that came out of Steven Spielberg's 1979 flop ""1941"", (except for that astonishing dance sequence).  Here he tops his past films and screenplays and has not done quite as good since then.<br/><br/>I'll be honest:  sentimentality has its proper place and time, and must be done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb with awe.<br/><br/>Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians were robbed blind, but let's be real, folks:  they're Academy Awards.  It's a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just sit back and enjoy them.  ""Forrest Gump"" wouldn't get any prizes from me, for the simple reason that any category would be won by another film.  But an Oscar?  Sure, what the heck."
"Ken-120","6","1","2","14 February 1999"," A Film with some other Flaws People have ignored.
","While this film has good points which others have already mentioned, I wanted to point out some points that really irritated me.<br/><br/>The #1 thing is that this film would shed tears for the shooting of George Wallace, an opportunistic politician who curried racist favour for his own cheap political gain, yet have NOT ONE mention of Martin Luther King in any way, shape or form.  This was even though he was working in Alabama at the same time when Forrest was growing up and it would be certainly more believable for Forrest to meet King than 90% percent of the celebrities he meets in his life.  I'm not asking him to meet Malcolm X, considering he was working in New York at the time.  Yet, King is ignored as if he didn't exist.<br/><br/>Second, the cross country marathon screams of being tacked on.  I fail to see any humour in it and my eyes rolled how the media completely ignores in their reports that this ""mystery marathonner"" is an All American football player, a Congressional Medal of Honour recipient, a ping pong company spokesman and a millionaire owner of a fishing fleet.  You would figure this would make a lot of hay for any reporter writing this up about a man who can do all this and have a IQ of less than 75."

","I had not seen ""Forrest Gump"" in many months, but upon seeing it once again, I can't think of a better way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV.

In such a dramatic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so funny- or, in a comedic movie, it's amazing that it can still be so dramatic. The shots of war are brilliant, and it's easy to believe that the action is real. Tom Hanks played Forrest as well as he acted in any movie, and Sally Field did not get enough respect for her performance.

"Twizm","10","1","2","2 May 2002"," Magical!
","Forrest Gump (1994) Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is undeniably an incredibly gifted actor, and this is his best performance. In Forrest Gump, he creates an unforgettable character, arguably the most memorable of the 90s. Forrest, Forrest Gump is a good natured guy who only has one weakness: he's a little slower than average. But in many ways, he's superior to most so-called ""normal"" people. You rarely see a man with so much enthusiasm and good will! His great personality added to the undying love of his mother (Sally Field at her best) helped to give him an unbelievable life, filled with memories. And as the film begins, Gump, sitting on his bench with a box of chocolates, tells strangers his fascinating story. The film's ingenious script has him involved in every major American event from the 50s to the 80s. He meets everyone from Elvis to John Lennon, from Kennedy to Nixon. Star quarterback in college and world champion Ping-Pong player some years later, he even finds the time to go fight for his country in Vietnam. Perfect example of the American Dream, the simple little boy who even achieves to become godzillionaire!<br/><br/>Just then, director Robert Zemeckis and Hanks would have accomplish a great task, namely telling their country's recent history through the eyes of a simple man, putting everything under a new, uncynical light. But the film also contains one of the most touching of love stories between Forrest and his lifelong love Jenny. She might have been a ""normal"" kid, but she didn't have it as easy as her buddy. After a traumatizing childhood thanks to an abusive father, Jenny goes through all the downsides and fake hopes of that same Dream, from strip clubs to thankless waitress jobs. And in the midst of that, she follows the traces of Timothy Leary and gets into San Francisco's acid culture, go hippie and protest war and even end up snorting coke in 70s discos. But Forrest still looks after her, and they have the sweetest moments together...<br/><br/>Zemeckis sure can be proud of his Oscar-winning work. While telling a deeply involving story that walks the thin line between drama and comedy, he shoots countless references to events and people. Even though none of them lasts much more than 15 minutes or so, each of Gump's ""adventures"" feels like a movie of its own. Just take the riveting war sequences, or the man's 3 year-long run. Zemeckis directs his cast perfectly. Besides Tom ""two-Oscars-in-a-row"" Hanks, there's the talented Robin Wright as the lovable if flawed Jenny (who I can't believe wasn't even nominated for an Oscar), Gary Sinise as the intense Lieutenant Dan and Mykelti Williamson (whoever that is) as Forrest's shrimp-lovin' war buddy Bubba. The soundtrack by itself is incredible, covering pretty much all the important music over 30 years, and Alan Silvestri's score is restrained but efficient at underlining the film's emotional core. There's only one word to truly describe Forrest Gump: magical."

My only regret is that this movie came out the same year as another classic, ""The Shawshank Redemption"". That is my only regret- that ""Forest Gump"" took most of the major awards at the Academy Awards that year. Both deserved Best picture and both are gifts to the world of entertainment."

As a man who was honest, caring, and with high morals, he's stepped on by others who engage in their own selfish pursuits. Forrest Gump may not have been the brightest person of all time, but his loving heart more than made up for what he lacked in his IQ. This is a great movie. I strongly advise you rent it."

"XRANDY","Null","1","2","1 February 2002"," A good story
","The Germans have a word for events that appear to be the result of a joke played by fate or history.  It is called treppenwitz.  I don't know if the filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit of it.  Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as his naivetÃ© impels him not only through his own life, but also through many critical moments in history.  But, where many quirky takes on history dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the touching nature of its simple protagonist.  As the story slips in and out of historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest, because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening impartially.<br/><br/>Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and sententiousness.  But we realize that while we condescend to the verities that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth within them.  His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others.  His credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier aspects.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in.  I'm not a big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the magic of Hollywood."

","'Forrest Gump' is a wonderful movie. Forrest grows up as a mentally and physically challenged kid who goes on to inspire others and represent what is good and bad in American life, essentially embodying the idea of 'The American Dream'. The wonderful and clever use of inserting Tom Hanks (as Forrest) into the famous clips of notable people (from JFK to John Lennon) is gimmicky but it works and makes for a marvellous film. The period feeling of he times that Forrest moves through from meeting Elvis to serving in the Vietnam War are so real.

After watching this movie I started to watch Hollywood movies with more curiosity and fascination. The role of Forrest Gump was portrayed brilliantly by Tom Hanks (one of his best performances ever). The director Robert Zemeckis has subtly shown us thirty years of American history in three hours. This movie is an interesting way to learn about a slice of American history. Though Forrest Gump is considered to have a low I.Q.(which is evident from such dialogues as ""My name is Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump."")he has a high E.Q.(emotional quotient). It is the loving nature and innocence of his character that really appeals to me. This movie gives us hope as it shows us the goodness of the human spirit. Forrest Gump proves to many of us that that at times ignorance can be bliss. All in all it is one of the best feel good movies ever made as it really tugs at the heart strings."

All three films are superb movies in their own right, ( Shawshank just shading it as my favourite), and should be enjoyed on their own merits rather than on what they prevented others doing.<br/><br/>I may be wrong but I feel a lot of the criticism of the film is due to the academy awards and that if Forrest Gump had won on a different year it would not suffer the criticism it does.<br/><br/>Anyway on with the film. Hanks was brilliant as usual and the support players especially Sinise, and Williamson will live long in the memory. OK towards the end there are too manny references on how Forrest misses Jenny ( e.g naming the boat )but overall I think Robert Zemeckis balances out the emotional with the humorous and it is close to a perfect film.<br/><br/>1994 was truly a great film and the arguments about who should have won will go on and on, just be grateful that 3 splendid films came out together.

That someone can be satisfied from the purity and simplicity of his life is truly amazing and should be a lesson to us all.<br/><br/>It's also a story of the differences between people, and how despite those differences we can still connect. He shares his life story with strangers while waiting for the bus, and he affects all of those characters in different ways, just like this movie affected different viewers in different ways. Some of them disregard him as just the dumb guy waiting for the bus, but some of them listen to him, most notably the older woman at the end who doesn't get on the bus because she truly wants to hear his story.<br/><br/>There are many other ways to perceive this story. You can see it as the story of a man who loves a woman struggling between goodness and immorality, or as an essay on how people change over time, or even how ignorance can breed contentment.<br/><br/>But no matter what you see in this movie, you find that it's a multi-faceted study on life, and you see glimpses of yourself in the characters. It reaches humans on every level - it makes us laugh, cry, contemplate... and our hearts soar whenever something good happens.<br/><br/>Hopefully you too will watch this movie and get one step closer to figuring out exactly who you are."

","Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy.<br/><br/>In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" Although it had been some seven years since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once ""loved that movie."" When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been assuaged.<br/><br/>By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen ""Forrest Gump."" At least once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. ""Forrest Gump,"" when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness follows.<br/><br/>My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl! Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... ""HALLELUJAH!!!"" Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, ""Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should be!""<br/><br/>And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest ""touches"" everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world.<br/><br/>I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" She spurred me to watch it once again. Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do. Peace and love to you, Forrest."
"pvsk","9","1","2","25 September 2001"," It is so difficult being a Forrest Gump
","I recently saw `Forrest Gump' and was amazed. I could not understand, whether it is a family drama or a philosophical movie. As I felt that the movie is much more than a family drama, I am not discussing the story of the movie here. <br/><br/>I am trying to analyze the movie from a philosophical/ psychological angle. Is there a message the movie is trying to convey? Does this movie laugh at people who are supposedly very intelligent, rich but never satisfied or happy? Does intelligence above a certain level really makes people feel unhappy about every thing? Is Emotional Quotient (EQ) more important than Intelligent Quotient (IQ)?<br/><br/>Every body knows that focus in so important for success.  Yet we are so distracted in life that we are unable to concentrate all our energy in a single thing.  Forrest Gump does this so effortlessly. When he runs he runs , when he plays ping pong (Table tennis) he does just that. Is it because of his below average IQ?  Or is it because of the very high level of mental maturity he has achieved?<br/><br/>The way Forrest handles all his successes is unbelievable.  We see people who become head strong for such trivial things, and Forrest wins again and again without even bothering about the level of success he has achieved. There is a particular scene in which Forrest says to his bench mate in the bust stop ` I went to Washington again, met the president again' the statement sounds so naturally innocent. The actor and the director deserve a special congratulation in this particular scene for making it sound so natural and do not look like a egoistic boast.<br/><br/>The director also captures the way Forrest handles defeat. Forrest never gives up being a Shrimp boat captain and he is never bogged down by a failure. This finally makes him a millionaire.<br/><br/> It is quoted in Bhagavad-Gita that `Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat alike, engage yourself in your duty'. The statement though it may look so simple is extremely difficult to implement in real life.  Now researchers have found that Emotional Quotient (EQ) is more important than IQ. Forrest scores so high in EQ, that his IQ becomes irrelevant for all his successes. I really don't know whether the director conveyed this message intentionally. <br/><br/>This movie also has some incredible acting, where you do not realize that Tom Hanks has really acted.  I guess he has become Forrest Gump himself. The scene where he shows some sort of emotional outburst is when he discovers about his child. I am sure even a robot will be moved by the scene where he asks his girl friend whether the child is dump or intelligent and asks her permission to talk to his child. He does not ask permission in words, but his facial expression speaks thousand words.  Every body else in the film has done excellent support acting. <br/><br/>A brilliant movie and a must see."

"cosmic_star","Null","1","2","25 August 2001"," Story of Lovable Forrest in the world full of imperfections and selfishness
","Dear Friends , I read all of these comments on Forrest Gump. I respect all these views . As for my opinion I think I have never seen anything like that. This was a perfect masterpiece. It would be very unjustified if I praise the movie as its virtue needs no mention. I would rather take up the criticisms expressed. First, Tom Hanks played Gump too brilliantly. Many think that playing Psycho or fool is simple. It is not. Forrest is not stupid. He is just not a ''SMART MAN'' as he himself knows. Gump is an innocent Simpleton. None but Hanks could have done the justice to this character. Second , it is not celebration of stupidity. It is depiction of our imperfect world through the eyes and mind of Forrest. Everyone around him is imperfect ,especially Jenny (we will come to her later). Forrest is the master of his own time and fate.<br/><br/>It would be very wrong to find didactic messages in the movie. It is a work of art and should be savored and enjoyed instead of being analyzed. There are some unbelievable episodes and incidents...But why should we murder the beauty only to dissect and analyze ??? Call such parts as Celluloid licenses. This is the movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Forrest's quotes such as , ''Life is a box of chocolates..'' should not be put under scrutiny like quotes from Shakespeare or T.S. Elliot !! He himself says that his mum always tells him things the way he understands them...<br/><br/>Now we come to Jenny. She does not have to be goddess. She is one of many imperfect persons showed in the movie. She does love Forrest but is embarrassed and reluctant to share her life with him. She keeps on telling him that she has a life very different from his. Any person in Jenny's place would have done the same. But she has always loved him from childhood to adulthood. In the end when she meets Forrest with a kid and a most Possibly AIDS ,She assures him that she demands nothing from him and can support her child. She is reformed after making mistakes all through her life and learning from them. Maybe she got AIDS after she made love to Forrest and maybe after she gave Birth to Forrest Jr. ? Anyway , this is perhaps the biggest Celluloid license in the movie and we could ignore it.<br/><br/>I do not have any particular favorite scenes in the movie as I love the whole movie . But still if I have to mention ....I would say that the last one when Forrest talks to Jenny while she rests in peace in her grave was very touching. Interestingly her Epitaph describes her as the Wife and mother of Forrest Gump, Which is very sweet and touching and true. And Forrest again made me cry when he shows Jenny a letter from Forrest Junior but moments later he made me laugh when he says that he is not going to read or open it because Junior wanted him not to ! :-) I will always love this movie and this is the story of our own imperfect world in contrast with Forrest's near perfect and most innocent world....almost an Arcadia of its own kind....."

Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas.

"Howlin Wolf","9","1","2","20 March 2001"," I can see why people might dislike this film, but...
","... I gotta say, I love it!  Whether you agree with me will probably depend on whether the whimsical tone of the film is likely to make you want to smile or puke.  As I said, I'm in the former camp, but I can well understand anybody who disagrees.  This film is certainly a devisive topic amongst my friends and I, faintly dodgy politics and all (more on that later...)<br/><br/>Before I offer my critique of the film, I just wanna touch on two issues that are vaguely related.  Firstly, the IMDB lists ""The Deer Hunter"" as a recommendation to those who like this movie.  What??  Let me assure you, two more movies that are so totally different as these pair would be hard to find.  There is a VERY tenuous possible link with Vietnam, but aside from that we're dealin' with chalk and cheese.  I recommend cinema and/or De Niro buffs check out ""TDH"" for completist sakes, because it's good, but IMHO vastly over-rated (I know people will say the same about ""Forrest Gump""!). Anyhow, the tone of the two films is completely different, so in my estimation a slight error within the IMDB there...<br/><br/>Secondly, I know people complain because there was a crop of other good movies to get a Best Picture nod in '94, and ""Gump"" beat them to it. Most - if not all - of the films nominated that year would have been deserving winners.  It just so happened that the Academy plumped for Gump (sorry about the excruciating rhyme...)  This does not devalue Forrest Gump against the more dramatic pictures any more then it reflects badly on the runners up. It was just a very good period for film, and all us cinema fans should be thankful for that...<br/><br/>Now that I've got that off my chest, back to the film in question.  I feel that Hanks' performance stays just on the right side of cloying sentimentality, always threatening to tip over the edge, but never quite doing so.  This must be testament to Hanks skill as an actor, as with many other actors in the role the character could have become fiercely irritating during the lengthly running time.  Again, I'm well aware of the arguments that say the character was annoying from the START, but I never felt that to be the case.<br/><br/>An able supporting cast serve to back up Hanks, and there is a wonderful turn from Gary Sinise as ""Lt Dan Taylor"".  His character ALMOST threatens to inject some edge into the character's ultra-PC universe, but maybe that reflects the fact that the other characters are so wholesome rather than that he is nasty.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>It's a fun jaunt through some 40 years (I think...) of history, refreshingly not confined entirely to American culture.  John Lennon makes an 'appearance' at one stage (You could argue that he represents 'cross-culture', but I'm claiming him as one of our own, even though I'm not a Scouser but a Manc).  To those who think part of the fun in watching a movie is predicting events, this one won't provide you with much of a challenge.  I recommend sitting back and allowing yourself to be drawn into the movie universe.<br/><br/>As other users have pointed out before me, the film can possibly be seen as having a 'reactionary' viewpoint.  Having the main female character die of AIDS as a consequence of her earlier hedonist actions seems depressingly intolerant if it was intended to convey some sort of message to the audience.  I have no idea if events in the book are the same.  For those of you looking for deep subtextual material, it's certainly a juicy bone of contention, but the film can be enjoyed just as well on a purely simplistic level.  I don't think the political bias is strong enough to ruin the film. As for my view on whether any such connotation was deliberate, let's just say it wouldn't surprise me...<br/><br/>(SPOILER END)<br/><br/>To close, many of my friends voice much the same objections about the film that I have seen on this site.  If the potential for nostalgia combined with goofy fantasy doesn't sound like it will be your thing, then by all means avoid.  If, however, the concoction I have described sounds suited to your tastes, then enjoy; because I guarantee you won't find many better examples of this type of thing around."

","I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century, complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman. That, along with everything I have already mentioned, makes this a brilliant and wonderful film. If you have never thought of this before, try watching the film with this theory in mind. I promise you'll see it in a different way."

","I have to say that I have seen Forrest Gump about seven times and it never fails to amuse, move and amaze me as one of the best films of the last 10 years. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors that I have ever seen and his portrayal of the slightly dim but warm hearted Forrest Gump is just one of the many examples of this. The plot is very cleverly interwoven with very memorable historical events making us relate and love the character Gump even more. To say that this film is over-rated is to be blind to the pure genius that is the whole story. If it is such a bad film then why would it have been nominated for so many awards? Why did Tom Hanks win an oscar for it? Finally, why is it repeated on TV all the time with thousands upon millions of viewers tuning in to watch Forest's trials and tribulations, slowly but surely falling in love with his character and watching with disgust at Jenny as she fails to notice this sweet, kind and caring man infront of her and chooses the guys who will only let her down time and time again. When I see that film, I always cry, and call me sentimental if you want I can't help but relate to this poor boy who just wants the simple life without having all these people entwined with him, many presidents, Elvis, Chinese world ping-pong champions and the first ever black people to be allowed in white schools! Even through all this, anyone who has a heart can not fail to be touched by, even though this guy has everything that anyone could ever want, all he wants is Jenny."

","Forrest Gump is a wonderfully magical and enduring film of nostalgia through the eyes of one man who is so beat up inside that he doesn't mind getting rained on. Almost everyone he has ever met or known ends up with a fortune of bad luck (Elvis, Lennon, his mom, Bubba, the Kennedys, Wallace,,) as he further goes on granting good luck on others by creating or contributing to Elvis's movements, mooning, smiley faces, jogging, Watergate, Lennon's lyrics and the Chinese peace movement. The altering of the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person. There is a message behind this movie that suggests that we only gain personal fulfillment through  trying to improve the lifestyles of the others on this planet. This is a movie meant to be watched over and over."

"abrooke1","10","1","2","3 November 2000"," A remarkable adventure
","I have seen this masterpiece several times, and I can honestly say there is no other film quite like it. The plot is now familiar to all - Tom Hanks plays a man with a lower-than-average IQ whose life becomes intertwined with the major events and people of recent U.S. history.<br/><br/>In the film he: - inspires Elvis how to swivel his hips - see Governor George Wallace attempt to stop high school integration - becomes a phenomenal college football player - fights in the Vietnam war and rescues several soldiers - speaks at a huge anti-war rally - becomes a millionaire philanthropist through shrimp fishing and wise investments - witnesses the Watergate break in - runs across America several times - meets John Lennon - creates several well known sayings - becomes a ping-pong champion and travels to China to compete - meets three U.S. presidents<br/><br/>What's fascinating is that as amazing as these accomplishments sound, they really don't mean very much to Gump. His only need is just to be with his life-long sweetheart Jenny. His pursuit and ultimate winning over of her is really all that matters to him. It is the execution of this simply story against the vast events of history that makes this film absolute magic.<br/><br/>Everything about this film works, and works well. The cinematography, the music, the script, direction, and of course, the acting. The special effects in this film are also remarkable, but they are used fairly sparingly, and act more as a supplement to the story, rather than becoming the story itself, as in many other films. Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorite directors, and this film will probably be remembered as his magnum opus.<br/><br/>10/10"

","It is very easy to be cynical about this movie. Totally implausible? Yep. Over sentimental? Without  doubt.  Overrated? Of course.  But through all these things that you could that would make this sound like an awful movie, there is one thing that you cannot deny.  This movie moved people.  Told from the naive and Simple-minded Gump, it trawls through Vietnam, the US Hippy Age, and numerous events at the Whitehouse, showing that Gump has had a far more interesting life  than he would ever let on.  It is essentially a love story, as he continues in his mission to win over his childhood sweet heart.  It is told completely in flash back until the last few minutes, and as a brilliant Tom Hanks unravels the story for his audience, delivering line after line of unknowing yet amazingly poignant statements, you sort of realise just how good it was to be totally ignorant things.  Maybe this movie was not as great as everyone said it was. In realisation, it did not deserve the heap of Oscars it got.

Having watched it so many times, it began to loose its punch. You realize that it is VERY fictional and that it is not nearly as good as 1994's Best-Picture runner-up Pulp Fiction. But, having watched it recently I was able to enjoy it again, more than I did the first time, because of the great performances by all, and the unforgettable moments.<br/><br/>  Forrest Gump is destined to become a classic due to its great, heart-warming story, and classic lines that will be repeated like those from Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, and other favorites. The main reason though, is that Forrest Gump is a lesson in 1900's American history. The sixties were a crazy-ass time, and I'm glad I didn't have to live in them(I'm only 20). Politicians being assassinated, Vietnam, drugs, and the Cold War all depicted in their actual footage.

Well well well, I thinks these people are just jealous that such a nice-natured, clean and harmless movie won over Pulp Fiction, the epitomy of a cool film wanna-be. <br/><br/>Overrated? C'mon it got much less hype than almost every movie released these days. At least Forrest Gump had content and depth as opposed to Pulp Fiction which didn't even have a point. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an excellent movie. You can tell that a lot of work has gone into it, and everything about it is great, the acting, the script, the directing and cinematography, it's all excellent and above all, it's a great story!<br/><br/>Rent/buy this video if you want to see a proper movie, instead of such B-grade tripe as Pulp Fiction."

","Truth be told, this is not a bad film by a long way. Yet I can't for the life of me understand why, as the time of writing this, Forrest Gump is the 13th best film on IMDb? <br/><br/>The only asset I can see this film having is the advanced effect (For its time that is). As to the acting I agree that Tom Hanks acts the part well, however being realistic, an authentic autistic person would have played the part just as well, if not better. <br/><br/>This may possibly be the most overrated film of all time, and a 7.5/10 would be far more adequate. <br/><br/>-Harry"
"sergeantpinback80","2","3","12","21 January 2014"," It pains me to say this....but this story is really bad.
","Other than the acting of Tom Hanks, the acting of the co-stars, and the set pieces, this movie is just not worth the hype, and I really hate myself for saying that. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, who one day is sitting at a park bench waiting for a bus when he begins telling his life story to a woman sitting next to him. Over the course of a few hours he continues telling his story while different people come and go until his story catches up to the moment where he began sitting at the bus stop. His story involves many different points in his life where he unwittingly becomes involved during several historical events during the 60's and 70's, meets a number celebrities and presidents, influences other people and has a significant impact on society. All while this is going on his one true love Jenny continues to elude him while she lives a traumatic life on the edge from drugs, abuse, and near suicide.<br/><br/>Now here is my problem with this movie...Forrest Gump's life is one big fantasy, a story so outrageous that the movie comes off as more of a comedy than a sappy drama. For one thing the movie is supposed to be about going where the wind takes you, living your life a day at a time, blah blah blah, and yet people seem to forget none of Forrest Gump's life would have happened the way it did had his mother not had sex with the school administrator. If that had not happened he would not have been on that bus, he wouldn't have met Jenny, she wouldn't have inspired him to run, and the rest of his life would have been far different. <br/><br/>Second, it always amazes me how much success Forrest had with everything he did in life. He doesn't just go to college then to Vietnam, he goes to college AND becomes a football star, he goes to Vietnam AND becomes a war hero, he goes into the shrimping business AND becomes a millionaire, he learns to play ping-ping AND becomes an international ping-ping champion. I mean the way things turned out for him he could put his name on the ballot today, and be president of the United States tomorrow. If thats the kind of life you get when the wind blows then I need to go look for a breeze.<br/><br/>Third, all logic in this movie is completely thrown out the window. For instance, during the running across America story, I still laugh at all the people who just quit their daily lives and started running with a complete stranger. Did they just feel it was okay to leave their family and jobs behind? How did they support themselves? How did they eat? Where did they sleep? How did they clean themselves? Where did they get clothing to wear when the seasons changed? <br/><br/>Fourth, in terms of his low I.Q. are we really sure that was even his problem. I mean other than a couple of areas where he tended to stare off into space I never saw any evidence that he was the idiot he was made out to be. Honestly it looked like he was just born with a lack of common sense. I mean he sure as hell doesn't have a problem assembling a rifle together, he takes orders from the military quite well, he can operate a shrimping boat like a champ and playing ping-pong was like riding a bike. For a guy who was supposedly that stupid he seemed to all the things he did far better than the average guy. <br/><br/>Fifth, he tells his life story to several different people and even after he claims to have done all these fantastic things and become an international celebrity....why do none of the people listening to the story RECOGNIZE HIM?!? I'd like to think if I was talking to a guy who was a football star/war hero/business mogul/celebrity at some point I would be going ""hey wait you're that Forrest Gump guy!""<br/><br/>All in all the movie had a great concept but the story wasn't thought out in the best way.<br/><br/>By the way folks, I don't care if you are the fastest runner in the world, YOU CANNOT OUTRUN A NAPALM STRIKE!!!"

IMDb requires film reviews to have a minimum length of 10 lines, so I must say more about the movie. My intelligence was insulted in that the film tries to rewrite history by showing Forrest Gump meeting with American presidents (POTUS). Not just one American president, which would be hard to believe in itself, considering Gump's obnoxious stupidity, but instead the film shows Gump meeting with three American presidents in his lifetime. The rest of the movie is just as unbelievable and ridiculous."

","A simple minded, or perhaps straight up retarded Southerner flukes his way through life. That in itself may have been ok-ish as a premise. But it isn't enough for this film, not only does Forrest fluke his way through life he also witnesses or even engages in major parts of history as well as meeting key people of the era.<br/><br/>Oh, he also instigates some of the biggest trends as well. The smiley face t shirt, the s**t happens slogan.<br/><br/>The most interesting part or theme of the film for me is his undying love for his childhood sweetheart Jenny or ""Jenn-ay"" as our bumbling hero pronounces it. Despite him chasing her throughout the film she beds anything that moves as well getting involved in all the moronic Liberal causes, picks up a drug habit and when she has lost her looks she comes back to Ol' Forrest and finally beds him after she turns down his proposal. <br/><br/>Apparently Forrest isn't very smart but he ""knows what love is"". Well, maybe he does but she is a manipulative bitch. After sleeping with him she runs away yet again. Then a few years later she invites him to her place and tells him that he has a kid! He believes it of course and the reason she tells him is she is dying. <br/><br/>Ain't love grand?<br/><br/>The idiot accepts it and takes custody of the kid after she dies. So he has millions but zero in the sense of smarts. <br/><br/>A film which is meant to be heart warming but I found was cynical in many ways."

Overly folksy and schmaltzy, but works. Not too profound but if you don't think too much, it's quite enjoyable. The weaving into the plot, and the footage, of actual historic events is wonderful to behold and adds a great comedic element to the movie too.<br/><br/>Won the 1995 Best Picture Oscar, though certainly wasn't the best film of that year.

I saw the reviews and the Rotten Tomatoes score made me felt that I was gonna get something mediocre. When I turned it on, the first 10 minutes already got my full attention.<br/><br/>I love Tom Hanks. I really do. I enjoyed Captain Phillips, Da Vinci Code and Catch Me If You Can. I once said that his role as Woody in the Toy Story films would be my favorite role by him. But after Forrest Gump. I didn't hesitate to change my mind.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump was a person I wish I would've met, or at some point, I wish I am. A brave, kind-hearted and honest man, who seems to stop at nothing to fulfill something no matter how impossible the task seems to be. I have given up many times in some point of my life, but after watching Forrest Gump, it told me, never give up, and this movie just shows that you can be anything you want in life if you just tried.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a beautiful, magical tale, better than any Disney film combined. The Lion King can't beat it. Toy Story can't beat it. Titanic was emotional, but if you look through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you'll never see the world the way he sees it. And that is the best part, he isn't like anybody you've ever met.<br/><br/>A true classic then and now."

Forrest ruminates at the end that these two seemingly opposing views may not be irreconcilable after all. His life is proof enough that accidents happen; all you got to do is to follow them to completion, and they would become your destiny. Forrest got a few chances in his life, he followed what his loved ones told him to do, and got through. The feather may represent that randomness that can lead you to your destiny, because it looks as if it is floating idly in the wind, but the wind is not without design. Lt.

After the safe distance of 20 years - and almost as a bet with a friend - I finally got around to seeing it. While I probably didn't hate it as much as I would have in 1994, I still don't understand why it was such a phenomenon in 1994 (were the movies really that bad in the 90s?). I still don't think of it as highly original; it certainly has very strong echoes of ""Being There"" and ""Zelig"" (and it certainly is not a good sign when a movie reminds you of so many other, better movies).

Though, this could be a bad quality as I know that many people like to have 'hidden meanings' in films, and stuff that you need to work out - but this is the polar opposite.

Forrest witnesses many famous events and achieves remarkable stuff. It shows that even if you are not the brightest crayon in the box, you still have a future. Gary Sinise plays remarkably well in the role of Lt. Dan. ""Run, Forrest!, Run!"" is a very famous phrase, and yes, Forrest is a very fast runner.

Forrest despite having the mental capacity of an eight year-old ends up being a student, with a straight D average, at the highly touted Alabama State University and, after miraculously recovering from polio as a child, it's top 10 football team's star running back. Forrest is also the major reason that Alabama State was disaggregated despite the state's very pro segregation Governor, George Wallace, standing at the doors of the university not allowing black students to enter!<br/><br/>Among the many achievements credited to Forrest is him, as a polio stricken youngster, teaching ""The King""-Elvis Presley-how to swings his hips and shake his behind, while preforming on stage, that made him the rock & roll legend, while still alive and after his death, that he was to become. The film gets more and more ridiculous as it goes along with Forrest not only becoming a national war hero-in him receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor as well as a VC bullet in his behind-in the Vietnam war but being involved in the biggest anti-war demonstration against that war, by just happening to be there, at the same time!<br/><br/>Not only is Forrest a war hero he's also a vastly successful businessman, in him cornering shrimp market, a stock market whiz in him buying up hundreds if not thousands of shares in that up and coming ""Fruit Company""-Apple Electronics- for peanuts but is also the man-not Woodward & Burnstein- who broke the story of the Watergate break-in which had President Nixon resign from office in disgrace! While accomplishing all that Forrest in his spare time became the world champion Ping-Pong player defeating China's best at the Summer Olympics!<br/><br/>Despite all his accomplishments Forrest feels that something is missing in his life in him being on the outs, she feels that he's somewhat of a weirdo, with his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, Robin Wright Penn. It's when Jenny gets pregnant with or without, it's never really fully explained in the movie, Forrest's child that she in her being an unwed mom, and addicted to crack cocaine, decides to finally give in and marry the big schlump. It's after that premature happy ending that Jenny is to find out that she's dying of an incurable disease, obviously AIDS, and leaves a totally confused and befuddled Forrest holding, together with little ""Forrest Gump Jr"", the bag. In the end we see Forrest, like at the start of the movie, sitting on a bench waiting for the bus to take little Forrest to school as he munches on a box of chocolates reflecting on his incredible life that can happen not in real life but only in the movies!"

The music in this movie does a great job setting the mood and the tone for the time period it portrays and the major events that take place in the story. The soundtrack has heavily influenced several movies in the years since it was released. Its impact was so large that many movies with similar themes and historical timeframes have almost copied the soundtrack entirely. The film even won the Oscar for ""Best Music, Original Score"" in 1995. With a soundtrack like that, it doesn't even need to be watched  you can enjoy the movie with your ears alone.<br/><br/>Those who do happen to keep their eyes open for the show are never disappointed by the special effects. The storyline of the movie wouldn't be able to survive without the menagerie of CG and makeup that fits every aspect of the story like a glove. The CG managed to place Forrest in several highly unlikely circumstances with ease, and made the audience believe he was actually there. Through the use of this then-innovative technology, Forrest ends up in such places as meeting John Lennon on Captain Kangaroo, conversing with both Kennedy and Nixon, witnessing the first black students allowed on a white college campus, and running from an explosion in Vietnam that narrowly misses him. The makeup transforms Gary Sinise (Lt. Dan Taylor) into an amputee, and brings Sally Fields (Mrs. Gump) through time from young mother to old woman. Even for a movie made 15 years ago, these special effects have managed to survive the test of time and still look believable.<br/><br/>While we are on the subject of special effects, it has to be mentioned that Forrest Gump won the Oscar for ""Best Effects, Visual Effects"", as well. In fact, the movie managed to win several awards. It won a total of six Oscars, and was nominated for seven more. Among the movie's other Oscar wins were: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Tom Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. The movie also managed to grab up an amazing thirty-two additional awards from other awards shows. These awards were well deserved, but not surprising considering the well-known cast and crew, not to mention the brilliant writing and editing. This was not the first award-winning movie for director Robert Zemeckis, who directed Roger Rabbit and Back to the Future, two other films well-known for their brilliant innovation and special effects.<br/><br/>If anyone out there still hasn't been convinced to see this movie, there is one more excellent reason to do so: accessibility. Because Forrest Gump has been so critically acclaimed, and due to the fact that it came out so long ago, a person often doesn't have to spend a dime or even leave their house to see it. It's very easy to catch on TV  in fact, it will be on HBO at 7PM on Friday, February 27th. For those who don't want to wait for it to come to them, it is very easily found in your family's movie collections, sold at almost any store that sells movies, or should be readily available at your local rental location. It's also very cheap. It's been known to hit the five-dollar bin at Wal-Marts across the US, and is seen at almost every garage or yard sale. This isn't a movie that you'll ever see sold out, either. Most movie buffs have already seen it, so it's never too in-demand to be able to find.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a movie that just has to be seen. Between the soundtrack and special effects, everyone can find something to enjoy. Just look at the awards success the movie has had  that alone has to be a clue as to how brilliant it is. If that's not enough, you really can't lose if you take a gamble and watch it on TV. You can rest assured, there's not going to be anything better on."
"ambush_xx","9","1","3","24 January 2009"," My favorite movie.
","Some people call the movie unrealistic or exploitative in using a character with mental disability for entertainment. I agree with it and still say its a damn entertaining movie. I am not American so the historical placement(of Gump) isn't really as important for me as the movie and its message(If they really did intent it) is. Except of course Forrest giving the opening verse of 'imagine' to John Lennon and giving Elvis dance tips.<br/><br/>Now that i have the major issues with the movies out of the way. I'll try to explain why i like the movie. I can say this in one word ""escapism"". Yes, for me this movie is ~3 hours of unadulterated fantasy( although i am not much a fan of the fantasy genre and FG doesn't figure as a fantasy flick.) I have watched this movie several times and each time i love it even more.<br/><br/>This a movie that is based on the script and the acting rather than on strong characters. The character of Forrest is simple enough, although Tom Hanks does bring him to life much convincingly and colorfully. The story for me is about how an obviously slow, simple and unassuming guy influences the life of so many people around with his spirit and his faith in humanity. How Forrest's childlike perspective of the world lets him ask the questions that we all would love to ask but don't dare, out of fear of appearance. Call me a sissy but i enjoy a bit of emotion and the soft stuff. I couldn't help but feel all the raw and pure emotions(unadulterated by biases) that Forrest felt when he goes through all that he goes through; War, peace, love, heartbreak. There's action, drama, romance and comedy. i cant think of any movie that touches on this many genres and pulls it off as well as this one.<br/><br/>Like i said before this movie is based on the story and innocence of Forrest than about the characters. But still the characters like jenny, Lieutenant Dan and Mama are brought to life wonderfully by a great cast. Gary Sinise especially was great and deserved to win an Oscar for his role. One other thing that stands out is the music. Such classic songs such as the ""sweet home Alabama' 'free bird'are featured with great timing. I've never seen any movie that has the right songs for the situations as this one. And the song 'Turn Turn'by The Byrds seems like it was written just for this movie, although it was recorded in 1965. <br/><br/>Although this is my favorite movie i have some gripes with it. I think the ending(or the last half hour) was a bit bland and depressing. I Really didn't appreciate the movie going form flash-back to the present. And I couldn't but help thinking about the movie ""i am Sam"". I was imagining Forrest junior having to go through everything that Dakota Fanning goes through in that movie. I cant figure out how they could have made it any different. But still, its the reason i give it a 9."

The scene when Forrest's mother dies, that will have crying just like the Titanic did. The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is so real you can feel it every time you see them together. It's hard not feel emotional when it comes to this movie because of the amazing work these people did on this movie that it will have you crying every time you see this movie.

"KillerLord","10","1","3","9 October 2008"," An Extremely Heart Touching and Inspiring Tale!
","Forrest Gump is one of those few movies that are so realistic and yet one cannot help but watch with a sense of wonder and amazement each time one sees it. It is the most heart touching movie I have ever seen that has so much to teach you and so much inspiration locked within it. Each time I see this movie, I slip into a different mood and the movie never fails to move me. The movie is about a boy with an average IQ who is taught by his mother only thing - to never let anyone tell him that he is different and cannot do anything in life. And off he goes pursuing his dreams with only a clean and pure heart and immense sincere dedication as his tools. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks is such a wonderful and a versatile actor. He has played so many diversified roles and each of these roles, he has played with so much finesse. It is hard to imagine what the movie could have been if somebody else stepped in Tom Hanks' shoes and tried to play the role of Forrest Gump. My suspicion is that the movie would have been a tragedy had it not been for the beautiful portrayal of Forrest Gump that Tom Hanks has done. The Oscar he won for the movie is well deserved. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump starts off wonderfully and moves at its own pace. We are gradually exposed to the simplicity and purity of its central character. He demonstrates how the qualities of the strength of heart and soul can win the game anytime over terrific brains. The movie has a lesson to teach that all it takes is focus, determination and a clean mind in order to conquer the world. And what is beautiful about the movie is that it does not show something drastic and unbelievable. It can very well be a tale that is happening right now in our own world. <br/><br/>The movie is not all serious. It has a wonderfully portrayed and rightly timed humor content. And no matter how many times you have seen the movie, the dialogs still have their effect on you. Each time one sees the movie he or she will smile when the movie wants you to smile and will make you cry when it wants to make you cry. The most touching aspect of the movie is the very character of Forrest Gump. He is dedicated, sincere and very simple. He has no cynicism in him, no jealousy and not a single trace of any negative emotion. The movie is about his world, a world without jealousy, greed and full of purity. <br/><br/>The music score is wonderful, so is the direction, so is the acting and so is the photography. It is indeed hard for one to find anything wrong with this movie at all. It is simply too neatly done and too beautifully handled. I cannot think of one thing in this movie that could have been done in a better way. It is a beautiful movie and deserves all the praise it has been getting. It is destined to stay in the list of best movies ever made perhaps forever. It is one of those movies that one must watch before their time."
"ZookGuy","7","1","3","29 September 2008"," Not THE Greatest But Still Great
","In the reviews I read for this film I'm surprised no one has mentioned the classic Being There (1979), Peter Sellers 2nd to last film, because there are many similarities between the two, to some extent as completely stealing from the film (they both are devoid of the racism and greed around because them, etc.).<br/><br/>Now with Robert Zemeckis, the man behind the Back to the Future trilogy and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, you expect a great film, and Forrest Gump is. But it does NOT deserve to be in the top 50. For instance, I find very hard to believe that Forrest could be at so many important events at such small period of time. Also if his legs are so strong wouldn't his good balance keep his back from being so crooked (I'm no chiropractor so it could be plausible). I also find it hard to believe about Forrest's and Jenny's relationship, she only sees him when she's in need. <br/><br/>Now lets focus on the positives: special effects are awesome, you can easily believe he is there. Tom Hanks does an excellent performance as Forrest, which makes the special effects even more believable. So if you have three hours to spare Forrest Gump is an excellent choice to watch."
"fearfulofspiders","10","1","3","25 September 2008"," Beautiful and Inspiring...
","Forrest Gump is full of triumph and heroism, that it is rightfully placed with the classics. From overcoming his inability to walk, to succeeding in life while playing with the cards he was dealt. This is truly one beautiful and inspiring film.<br/><br/>The acting, all around, is great. Tom Hanks's performance is one of the top-5 of the decade (1990-1999), and Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dan with such empowerment, sometimes we are conflicted on who to root for in the long-run. Sally Field does a nice job as Forrest's mother, and Mykelti Williamson (had to look his name up on IMDb) is very good as Bubba.<br/><br/>The story is hilarious, endearing, inspiring, and a near-epic at times. The laughs mainly come from Gump's incidents and dialogue, as well as historical moments seen on the television or milestones in each decade the film takes place. The moments in Vietnam are when the film reaches near-epic status, as Zemeckis has us wandering around the jungles listening to Gump's narration, when suddenly his troops come under-fire. The scenes of war are shot tremendously well, especially when Forrest shows his heroic side. As the story progresses, we see him get reality check after reality check, developing his overall character to the point where he still has a mentally-challenged mind, but with experience and understanding many folk cannot come near to.<br/><br/>Alan Silvestri's score is uplifting and very engaging. Quite arguably, this is possibly Silvestri's best ever. I highly recommend this to any one who likes orchestral music -- especially film scores.<br/><br/>The writing by Eric Roth is spot-on; completely deserving of an applause. Zemeckis's direction is grand, and this is the best film he's ever done; far more depth and love than anything else, this film has a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best picture of 1994, and will go down cinematic history as a classic. I highly recommend Forrest Gump to fans of Tom Hanks, people looking for an inspiring and hopeful film, and any one who is just looking for a good time."
"berryj6","10","1","3","23 September 2008"," 'Life is like a box of chocolates,' and Forrest Gump is the Lindt in the box of cinema
","A warning first. This is not a nice, friendly movie about a mentally retarded man, it is not a feel-good movie. It is a deep, multi-layered story about a man struggling to see the USA during some of its most controversial and famous times. Forrest Gump is surrounded by drugs, war, politics, love and labour. It is a strong-willed and ambitious movie to tell a story in a complex way, and it succeeds in a way I believe not even Tom Hanks or Robert Zemekis thought it would. It is a film about ideas, about relationships and humanity, subject which many modern films simply ignore.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump tells the epic story of Forrest Gump, a man who sees the world in an innocent, plain way. He is the glasses for many people who have has their vision blurred by the complexity of life and politics which surround them. Gump is unknowingly pure, and not only changes and influences history, but tells a heart-warming yet strong life story. Forrest Gump is therefore a long film , but the film holds out attention for every frame. Gump is not only brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, who has a very mature and complex take on his character, but has an incredibly engaging plot and dialogue behind him. The script is like a liquid, and rolls consistently off the tongue of each and every character that adds to Gumps epic tale.<br/><br/>A stunningly complex and engaging movie."

","Forrest Gump is a film that has a lot to live up to. Many people consider this one of their favorite films. Plenty of critics put it down as one the better films ever made. As someone picking it up for the first time over ten years after it was made, I was apprehensive of what to expect.<br/><br/>Yet, just like the character, the film Forrest Gump is never pretentious even from the very first minute. We meet Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for a bus to come. Someone sits down next to him, and Forrest begins to tell his life story. Simple, poignant, and ridiculously funny is this tale of a man who accidentally finds his way into every major event of his generation. Forrest changes the world in unimaginable ways, but all he really wants is Jenny, his childhood friend and the girl he's loved his entire life.<br/><br/>Yet this simplicity is where the movie's strength comes in. Everything is really very simple for a man whose IQ is no greater than 75. This simplicity deceives us into taking a whimsical tale for granted, and then surprises us with its incredibly moving final scenes. We don't quite realize how wrapped up in Forrest's world we are until we find ourselves in tears by the end. And when we leave Forrest's world, we miss him very much. We miss his easiness and simple way of living. 8/10 stars! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","This is one of the greatest movies of all time. The humor is great, Tom Hanks is great, the backgrounds are great and everything else is great.<br/><br/>But the best thing about movie is the lesson it gives us. It is a movie about humans and humanity, how we complicate things, how we always see the bad things instead of the good things, how we always care about what other peoples think of us, how our selfishness only make us unhappy and how all this things make us unable to move forward.<br/><br/>The main character is a contrast to humanity. Forrest is seen by everyone as stupid, but his uncomplicated mind makes his life uncomplicated as well. Forrest is like a feather(naive) that blows with the wind and do not let complication hold him back. He just follows some doctrines that his mother thought him, originally taken from the bible probably. This tells us something about religion, we always complicate the bible and seeks something that is impossible to find, or we question the doctrines and the stories. If we just followed the ten commandments without questioning it, everything would be perfect.<br/><br/>The movie also tells the American history between 1960 and 1990, but in a original and deep way. How the Nam-war and the war against communism(or any other war) was a complication created because humans seek a perfection we never can get. We see how the hippies try to seek perfection true drugs, and others also trying to find an answer trough different ways. But the only one that can live a free life is Forrest.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a masterpiece with many important lessons to learn. 10/10 for maybe the best movie ever made."

","I will start off, this film is truly captivating. The character of Forrest Gump is so well thought of. It is a symbol for hope. The performance done by Tom Hanks is one of the best I have seen. First off, it gets a lot of hate around here, but the truth is, only a great actor could pull it off.Tom Hanks did amazing as the mentally challenged man. The way the film starts off, it is sort of a 'fairy tale'. Yes, it seems a bit theatrical at times, but this is the whole tone of the film. the film is trying to teach us more. the film is trying to pull the audience in an emotional way, and let me tell you, it does. We can really feel for every single character. The mom tries to do what every other mom tries to do these days. She is trying to raise her child the best way possible, in all means trying to keep him away from the cruelty of the world. This film represents life in a sort of light and innocent way, mainly because it is told from Forrest's point of view. The other characters, Forrest's friends that interwine in his life, Bubba and Lt. Dave, are all very well-rounded. They represent other symbols. The performance given by Gary Sinise is perfect. he perfectly captures his character's struggles. He is a very confused and 'bad' character in a way, but the way Forrest changes him and gives him hope is truly inspiring. The other character who I also think is sort of dark in a way, is Jenny. Jenny represents a lot of people these days. No, she is not 'evil', but like a lot of people these days, she is lost and doesn't know who she really is or what she really wants to do. her journey throughout the film is also very developed, and the actress playing her, Robin Writh Penn did a great job. Sally Field, of course, is great and wimsy and perfect in her performance.<br/><br/>What is amazing in this film is not only the unforgettable characters and the amazing screenplay, but also the amazing cinematography and sets. The setting designs are so well put together, yes, they look very realistic, they are. It fits well with the tone of the film. The direction is also amazing. It really gives us thought to the characters, as does the pace of the wonderful film editing. The music scores used are simply fantastic, as they also represent the whole feeling of the film.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I found myself overly emotional at all the scenes. Not only because of the well put ending, but because I just remembered the whole journey Forrest Gump had. You simply cannot be in anything but simple 'awe' over the film. You realize how much you care about all these situations and characters. At the end of the day, this film is what every film should be. Give us a little bit of unfamiliar realistic life lessons, give us the truth in a not so disturbing way, but also simply gives us hope and uplift the audience(Forrest Gump's run across American is one of the best single moments in cinema history). This film is simple perfect, and it really surprised me. Perfect film-making."

","just kidding. i love this movie. i mean, it makes me cry every time i see it.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has never been better as a director. Tom Hanks has never been better as an actor. the screenplay by Eric Roth absolutely sparkles with imagination. i tried reading the novel by Winston Groom once and couldn't handle it. i thought it was pretty awful compared to the writing of the film.<br/><br/>a multi-generational film, it is an interesting take on the ""American Dream"" as we have come to know it in the past half century of American history. though 1994's Pulp Fiction is probably the better film of the two, Forrest Gump is clearly more charming and thus an undeniably worthy winner of that year's Oscar for Best Picture.<br/><br/>it's a known fact that the only people who don't like this movie are Osama bin Laden, Captain Hook, Cruella DeVil, and Sauron."
"MacAindrais","10","1","3","12 May 2008"," An Odyssey into Modern America
","Forrest Gump (1994) ****<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is the sappiest of melodramas, but it is also a wonderfully made and wonderfully touching film. Everyone of course knows the plot of the film, so I won't bother discussing that. Robert Zemeckis' talents as a special effects filmmaker are astounding, and the effects in Forrest Gump are no less than incredible. Such as the scenes in which he meets a number of presidents in archival footage, and his address of a peace rally in Washington. The film seems to have either a love it or hate it following. What surprises me most though is the extreme hate and overreading that some people have regarding the film. Some critics have claimed that the film is ""mawkishly conservative,"" and triumphs the idea that ignorance is bliss. The biggest shame is that the film has been politicized - it is not political, it is human. I am inclined to agree with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's interpretation in suggesting that the movie is about how America has never come to terms with its historical past, and is not about neglecting things such as the Vietnam war. It is not about following rules, or suggesting that if you're a hippie you will become a drug addict or anything like that. The movie is simply about the journey that life is. To politicize the film is to present an element to the film which was never there to begin with. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump is simply a story about humanity. I've never understood the ""ignorance is bliss"" comments. The film has nothing to do with that. Like the politicization of the film, so too is this an element brought in by critics which was never part of the film. The picture is about the reaffirmation of life. Forrest Gump is not a smart man, but just because he is not smart does not mean that he cannot succeed in life. This is a problem that i have with many liberal academics, and I say this as a left wing academic myself, wherein uneducated or unintellectual people are regarded as failures and placed on a pedestal far lower than they place themselves upon. One does not need to be intelligent to be enlightened, and enlightenment is not an intrinsic characteristic of intelligence. Forrest Gump is a magical and touching human dramedy. Take it for what it is, and what it is is a much smarter film than people give it credit for. Its a wonderful movie, and its shame that its been politicized because of its historical odysseys."

","What can't be said about this movie? It contains all the ingredients to what life is all about in 2+ hours of film. A simple, loyal, courageous man who, although thought to be slow by others, saw very clearly what is right and what's wrong, while those around him struggled with the concept and scoughed ""Oh, he just doesn't get it because he's slow."" He got it alright; Forrest was a pure person in pure form. Everyone should be so lucky. Saving his fellow man during war time, saving his friend from drowning, never, ever giving up on the one true love of his life, and being an amazing father... he was all this and so much more.<br/><br/>The music and scenery in the film of course, were simply staggering. What a beautiful movie with a beautiful message.<br/><br/>Along with Shawshank redemption, Forrest Gump these are my two favorite movies of all time. No other movie comes close.<br/><br/>-Tracy Milburn"

","You don't need anything but a simple character, a nice story and the ability to make it happen to touch people's deepest feelings. Yet that simple, Forrest Gump is loving, tender, just perfect.<br/><br/>My father always told me about how much beautiful The Sound of Music (1965) was to him, in his early childhood. I guess Forrest Gump is just like that to me, even being a feature not played in my childhood, but in my adolescence, just that period in time we're confused by all emotions blooming.<br/><br/>Every time I feel desperate or needing to revigorate my live, it's time for watching again Forrest Gump."
"Stampsfightclub","9","1","3","8 May 2008"," excellent issue driven comedy drama
","Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) stars as Forrest Gump, a man who sits on a bench and recalls his life story, growing up with many difficulties and challenges.<br/><br/>Hanks gives possibly the best performance of his career as the troubled man with many issues in his life. Definitely an Oscar winning performance with brilliant timing, execution, humour and seriousness all brilliantly established by the cast away star.<br/><br/>The plot is brilliantly character driven with a strong focus upon serious issues and how Gump deals with them such as his intelligence, his independence and relationship with other people. The issues are beautifully dealt with and shown with such a strong emotion, especially towards the end which is a very dramatic moment in the film and one of the saddest moments in film history I believe.<br/><br/>A film is always strong if it gives width and depth to other characters as well and the emotion behind Lt Dan's (Gary Sinise) story is remarkable and a powerful signifier of realism and honour in army life. Gump's best friend in the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) also has a story to tell about his upbringing and the honour and tradition of his family's shrimp business. Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) also has a dramatic and emotional life and has many issues to contend with and her story is one of the most intriguing for me.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent with strong realism and a powerful meaning behind each issue.<br/><br/>The film is well recognized as a comedy drama and through the issues covers drama and with the memorable quotes comes a great combination of the two genres. From ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" to ""stupid is as stupid does"" Zemeckis' film proves successful on all levels.<br/><br/>The direction and settings are brilliant, especially during the running scenes. The whole ideology of ping pong was brilliant as was the film in general and one of the best comedy dramas of the 90's if not of all time."

"Daveeee08","10","1","3","12 April 2008"," Simply unmissable
","Forrest Gump (Hanks) is short on IQ points but long on heart, a pure and simple soul who follows a straight path through the world, ever true to the homely advice of his mother (Field) - the source of guiding Gumpisms such as ""Stupid is as stupid does"" - and to his elusive lifelong love Jenny (Wright). He begins his serendipitous skirmishes with destiny in childhood by unconsciously giving ideas to the as-yet-unknown Elvis Presley, and goes on to become, unintentionally, a football star and war hero.<br/><br/>Considering all its mush and meandering, this is among the best audience pleasers ever. Hanks outdoes himself in the lovable dolt department with unforgettable, utterly disarming work. Just as he recaptured boyishness in Big without resorting to cuteness, here he brilliantly portrays slowness and dumb doggedness without being patronising. Admittedly, the film does have its flaws but despite this, it is simply unmissable and one of my all time favourite films."
"blanbrn","8","1","3","10 April 2008"," One of the best films of all-time. That proves it's meant for everyone to be different and it's okay to live a simple life.
","""Forrest Gump"" certainly has to be one of the most heart touching and emotional films that brought joys to the masses over the years. People misjudge it though as a film about a dumb retarded boy named Forrest, yet I see it as a much different take as it proves it's okay to be different and slow and do things at your own pace and let things come to you and then good things will happen in life. Tom Hanks is great as Forrest Gump as the film spans a life period from Forrest's childhood to his growing up, starting with his humble start in a small Alabama town with his mother(wonderfully done by Sally Field). From the start Forrest was different as his mother taught him to see the world and life as a box of chocolates, not knowing what your ever gonna get. Yet by the hardships and for the way that Forrest was made fun of his determination and will would spark him on a life of unexpected but deserved greatness. From his college attending at the university of Alabama to his football playing to fighting in war, and making new friends to meeting the presidents! Also touching is his heartfelt relationship with life love Jenny(Robin Wright Penn). The direction and camera work and special effects of the way the film is crafted by Robert Zemeckis is brilliant and fabulous it makes the film move well from time period to time period. Most of all this film brings the message to me that destiny is often a piece of crap and life many times just goes and happens at random. Most of all it's okay to be different and it proves no matter how different that just by being simple many things can be accomplished, and that with faith and determination with god anything is possible. ""Forrest Gump"" is such a memorable winner because he did it his way."
"dorotka24","9","1","3","2 April 2008"," Fascinating story from beginning to end
","Forrest Gump is a film that I could watch over and over again and still be moved, entertained, and inspired. It is the story of a simple man that inexplicably becomes embroiled in extraordinary events. It is a tale of remarkable coincidences and great emotional loss.<br/><br/>Hanks is at his cinematic best here, creating a highly believable character that one cannot help but love, despite his flaws. And how about the supporting actors! Gary Sinise is brilliant as the often reluctant friend to Gump. Robin Wright perfectly captures the love interest that is a close yet very different person than Gump. Sally Field is likable and endearing as the mother with boundless love for her only child.<br/><br/>The story is never boring, with events flowing seamlessly. There is a story telling angle here with a narrative overlay is unique and serves to accentuate major plot points. Most characters are recurring parts of Gump's life, and they come and go throughout the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most inspirational part of the film is the character of Gump himself. Although simple, he has an astounding realization of right and wrong, yet remains non-judgemental to those around him. He suffers great emotional loss at several points throughout the film, yet remains strong and carries on because he knows that he still has obligations and that there are others whom might depend upon him in some way.<br/><br/>I have few criticisms about the movie. There were a few times where Hanks slipped out of character a bit and reminded me more of his typical comedic personality, but they were few and far between. I'm striving to think of more, but I just can't come up with any.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump truly is an inspiring, heartwarming story that will undoubteldy stand the test of time. It has a wide appeal, but this is well deserved. Enjoy with my recommendations."

","I really believe that this is a fantastic film!! This is an example when you get wonderful film making and a wonderful cast! This absolutely has to be one of the best films of the last two decades. Forrest Gump had a lot of glory in its own right as Tom Hanks played the character perfectly. There are so many memorable lines in this film, and so many great scenes. This story goes along perfectly as well as its cast. Again this film was made by an awesome director Robert Zemeckis who has made many great films. Hanks really does the job right as Gump who really struggles through live, but his girlfriend was right there to support him. All the best to the actors, and everyone involved in this film as it did so well in its own right.<br/><br/>It really amazes me that for three years this film had totally ruled the box office up until 1997. It was then in 97 when Titantic came out. After Titanic came out it was shattering records within only a few days. Forrest Gump which had made the most money like ever at the box office with over 300 billion dollars!!! Titanic at the end of its time shattered that by hitting over 600 billion dollars!!! As both movies are amazing in their own rights, Forrest Gump looks like nothing when you see how much Titanic raised. Honestly I would watch this film any day, as I really could care less about Titanic. How both these films did so well is awesome because they have great stories to them and they consist of well known actors who fit their roles perfectly. The directors and production crews do a superb job overall. As we all know these movies take so long to make, but it is so worth the time and the money.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a great film and there's no reason why it didn't win awards. Also, its here enlisted in the 250 films list. We can all see why this is such a great film to have in your collection. Say what you want, but I just can't believe that Titanic brought so much more money in. Its hard for me to see why titanic literally 'pulled' in so much more than this great film. There are reasons why any of these films are so great. Thanks. Give me comments."

In the past, a handful of films could do this to me:- one is Wonderful Life, another is The Killing Fields and you may laugh here - Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol !!! Forrest Gump is more than a film experience, it's a lesson in life and humility.

Forrest Gump is a character we would all like to become, someone innocent that cant understand why things happen around him. Why he can walk, why the girl e loves cant love him back or is always running away form him, why his best friend died in war or why the character of gary siniese cant enjoy his life. Until the end of the film he cant even understand if we make up or destiny or its written for us. This is a beautiful movie with many things to tell. The character i liked the most after forrest was jenny, she never knew what she wanted and she was escaping from happiness into a world that only wanted to deprave her living aside the only man that really loved her in a pure and sincere way. This is other important fact of the 60s as it describes the history of the USA in that time seen by the eyes of a man that wanted to make everyone happy and live in his own Innocent world away from wars, racism, drugs and problems the society faced back then. He is just one of the characters of a movie you never forget and teach you so much about life and yourself at the same time.

"gofigure757","7","1","3","8 January 2007"," good movie, but different from the book
","As a fan of the novelist Winston Groom, I looked forward to the theatrical adaption of his great novel, ""Forrest Gump"" (a 20th century ""Huck Finn"".) Much to my surprise, the movie was 180 degrees from the book. The best example of the difference in tone between the movie and book is the now famous ""chocolate"" line. In the movie, Forrest often says; ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get."" The only reference to chocolate in the book (which is written in the first person) is the very first line: ""Let me tell you, being an idiot is no box of chocolates.""<br/><br/>The theatrical Forrest is a dim-wit who keeps falling into dung heaps and comes out smelling like roses. In the book, Forrest is a dim-wit who keeps falling into dung heaps and comes out smelling like a dung heap. But both Forrests keep on plowing ahead; which is the saving grace of the movie. While the book is much darker and satirical than the movie, the movie does capture Forrest's ability to dust himself off and keep going. And it captures the feel of the 50's, 60's and 70's as Forrest stumbles from one adventure to the next, accidentally inserting himself into historical events.<br/><br/>But what really saves the movie is the performances by Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. While I wish some things from the book hadn't been changed (Jenny and Mrs Gump don't die, Forrest acts in a movie with Raquel Welch, Forrest becomes a famous blues harmonica player, etc) the ""movie"" version ends up telling it's own story. It may be a completely different story than the book, but it is a story worth seeing. If you love the book, be prepared to separate the movie completely from the book. If you love the movie and haven't read the book, I highly recommend you do so."

","This is the warmly amusing, thought provoking tale of Forrest Gump, a man who despite low intelligence, manages to lead a fulfilled and productive life...even gaining fame on many fronts.<br/><br/>Forrest himself reveals his story in flashback to a series of assorted passengers waiting at a bus stop bench. As a child growing up in rural Alabama, he suffers from polio and must wear leg braces, in addition to coping with ridicule from other school kids because of his diminished mental capacity. Forrest discovers that he can run like the wind, leading to a football scholarship and college diploma. Then he joins the military and serves in Vietnam, where he saves the life of his commander, Lieutenant Dan, but sees his best friend, Bubba, die in his arms. Later he becomes a ping pong champion, attending competition in Communist China. After being discharged from the army, Forrest sets up a shrimp boat company, Bubba Gump, as he & pal Bubba had planned, becoming a millionaire. Eventually he decides that he 'feels like running', so spends about three years crossing the country! Not a dull life for someone with an IQ of around 75.<br/><br/>Interspersed with Forrest's personal tale are assorted historical people and events from the late 1950's to 1970's. Forrest just happens to find himself a central personage in various movements (KKK, Civil Rights, and war protest), exposes Watergate, and inadvertently invents the Smiley Face. He meets Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon (who bestow his Medal of Honour and such), teaches Elvis to dance, and inspires John Lennon's song Imagine..all the while blissfully unaware. Of course it's all nonsense (great special effects!), but these exaggerated absurdities point out how the Forrests of this world do contribute to society and that unsung heroes may lie behind famous celebrities.<br/><br/>Throughout his life, Forrest loves a girl named Jenny, who befriends him during childhood and defends him against his taunting schoolmates. For years they are childhood playmates 'like peas & carrots', and Forrest imparts a feeling of safe refuge to Jenny, who has her own trials dealing with her father's sexual abuse. Forrest's ongoing love for Jenny is a constantly touching theme, even as she experiences a turbulent young adulthood filled with sex and drugs, becomes a stripper and later hippie, is involved with the Black Panters, and eventually suicidal. Forrest does everything for Jenny and always seeks to protect her, although for years she rejects his love and instead prefers abusive men, a result of her childhood experiences. <br/><br/>The story's end is beautiful but heart wrenching. Forrest & Jenny's lovemaking produces a little son, who remains unknown to his dad throughout his early years. By now Jenny has come to grips with her personal demons, welcomes Forrest's unconditional love, and finally agrees to marriage. Alas, she has also been diagnosed with a terminal illness (possibly AIDS). Forrest & Jenny have a lovely wedding, but shortly thereafter she dies and leaves their son, little Forrest, in the care of his father. The scene where Jenny tells Forrest about his son is surely the film's most moving, as Forrest is flabbergasted with joy that he's the father of this beautiful boy but is also tearfully concerned as to whether he's smart or like his dad. Jenny assures him that little Forrest is a very intelligent child. Only the coldest heart would remain unmoved by this scene, the later one at Jenny's grave, or any of those showing little Forrest with his doting dad.<br/><br/>The character of Lieutenant Dan is masterfully done, as initially Gump's Commanding Officer resents Forrest for having saved his life, forcing his adjustment to living without his legs. Later Lieutanant Dan joins Forrest's shrimp boat operation and the pair become friends. It is probably thanks to Forrest that Dan comes to peace with God, following his Vietnam experiences. Forrest's 'best good friend', Bubba, is also well captured, a rather slow underdog type who's shrimp obsessed.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a brilliant Oscar winning portrayal of the rather slow witted but pure hearted Forrest. Sally Field is also wonderful as his practical and doting mother, who convinces Forrest that he can make whatever he wants of his life and shouldn't feel inferior to anyone. Early in the film, Mrs. Gump ensures her son's enrollment in a regular school by sleeping with the principal!<br/><br/>From an early age, Mrs. Gump informs her son that 'Stupid is as stupid does'...the film's ongoing theme. Forrest is aware of his limited intelligence but deals cheerfully and matter of factly with it, experiencing no resentment over his situation or bitterness toward those who put him down. He is the very model of innocence, the essence of the pure in heart. Unlike the intelligent folk in the movie, Forrest does NOT behave stupidly, but with kindness, generosity, loyalty, and honour, always keeping his promises. It's a film that definitely makes the viewer question...exactly who are the stupid ones in this story? Certainly Jenny, with her unwise lifestyle choices. But frankly, in all the ways that count, NOT Forrest. Only in the scene where Forrest so touchingly questions Jenny about his son's intelligence do we grasp how much Forrest has suffered, wanting his son spared any ridicule for being slow but instead able to lead a 'normal' life with all the best opportunities.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful story, with surely one of the most endearing heroes in cinematic history. Hopefully, it will inspire everyone to treat those having mental limitations with the dignity and respect they deserve. The picture of young Forrest running to escape pursuit by those bicycling bullies is a vivid reminder of the cruel taunts the mentally challenged sometimes suffer even in this supposedly enlightened era. Forrest understands everything truly important in life...family, friendship, love, country, and faith in God. It is a tale of great morality and great simplicity. Especially with regard to loyalty, we all have a lot to learn from Forrest Gump."

","I must confess that the 2 first times I saw this movie (its theatrical release and its 1st television issue), I loved, even adored, this movie. But then, looking back more calmly, I started thinking: what does this movie really have? A mix of historical situations (in chronological order, of course), a lot of songs (especially from the 1960s & 1970s), an incredibly lucky idiot whose strange quote ""life is like a chocolate box"" entered cinematic pop culture and, behind it all, an irresponsible depiction of points of view (typicall from the 1990s). This movie was actually the perfect excuse to play a ton of oldies (remixed and remastered to fit the strange 1990s likes), use innovative technology (especially digital) to place this boy everywhere and revisit recent history.

That a song called Blowin' in the Wind was written by Bob Dylan but the performer in the movie uses the stage name Bobbie Dylan - would this scene have any value, make any sense, if we didn't know that?

"rcj5365","Null","1","3","29 July 2004"," Commerating the 10th Anniversary of an American classic
","Wow,it has been ten years ago........<br/><br/>By the time ""Forrest Gump"" swept most of the major 1994 Academy Awards,it had already become the third-highest grossing film of all time,as well as a genuine pop phenomenon embracing best selling books,gnomic catch phrases,and reams of commentary on the editorial pages of magazines and newspapers throughout the world. It has already broken box office records worldwide and stands behind great cinema classics like ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"",""E.T."",""Titanic"",""The Lion King"",and so many more. Even through its distribution of its market through DVD and video,it has grossed even more domestic wealth and still holds that mark as of today,even after its release more than ten years ago. Clearly,a great event,FORREST GUMP,is a great film and a great piece of cinematic magic within itself. It has the form of an epic that goes within the boundaries of depth and resonance;the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude,and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility. To paraphrase the screenplay,FORREST GUMP,may not be a smart film,but it knows what love is-its dim-witted protagonist,as expertly portrayed by Tom Hanks,has captured the love of millions,which by the way made Tom Hanks,the Jimmy Stewart of our generation. <br/><br/>Despite its limitations,FORREST GUMP has charm to spare,thanks to an enduring central performance by Tom Hanks,as well as a series of irresistibly playful historical tableau's achieved with unprecedented verisimilitude by the computer-savvy artists at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. Although fictional protagonists have been made to interact with historical figures in CITIZEN KANE and ZELIG,FORREST GUMP represents a technological breakthrough. Unfortunably it is also far less thoughtful than these illustrious processors,and at times seems nearly as simple minded as its protagonist. While FORREST GUMP stands out as a break taking cinematic masterpiece,it is a remarkably brilliant one through various scenes as it follows the character through three decades of turmoil which begins with his upbringing in rural Greenbow,Alabama through various events that featuring computerized images of Governor George Wallace,President Kennedy at the White House,and his meeting with President Johnson as Forrest receives the Medal Of Honor for bravery during his turmoil in Vietnam and that continues throughout as he joins a ping-pong team that takes a tour of China and his meeting with President Nixon,and accidentally uncovers the Watergate break-in of the 1970's. However,its vision of the Vietnam War,for example,is constructed not from historical memory,but by means of a deft deployment of clichÃ©s drawn from the most prominent movies that display the Vietnam War in general(examples from such films as Apocalypse Now,The Deer Hunter,Coming Home,Platoon,and Born On The Fourth Of July).<br/><br/>Indeed,director Robert Zemeckis's period recreations depend more on the music of that period than any other visual sense of time and place:once the wall to wall soundtrack of the period kicks in which contains hits from various groups from the 1960's and early 1970's. The characters here are very well supportive with outstanding performances from actresses Sally Field,and Robin Wright-Penn to actor Gary Sinise's portrayal of Lt. Dan,who does a fair impression of Willem Dafoe from two Oliver Stone films;PLATOON(with legs)and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (without as a paraplegic)to a supportive acting from Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend Bubba. Although Winston Groom's original novel contains some astringent satire,the film's version settles for gentle jabs at racism and the military. Unusually vague it is attitude towards the events and its depicts,FORREST GUMP went on the sweep the Oscars for Best Picture,Best Director(Robert Zemeckis),Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay(Eric Roth),and Best Supportive Actor(Gary Sinise),and still went on the become one of the biggest moneymaking films of 1994.<br/><br/>Even after ten years,it is still embraced by several national figures as a celebration of traditional values and a condemnation of the 1960's counterculture. In many ways,the film still represents old-fashioned Hollywood liberalism where racists are wrong,war is hell,assassinations are bad,and it's good to be nice--even if the world is different from various places. Still,the films a lot of heart and a lot of guts and brains to make it possible. Congradulations on your 10th Anniversary-- FORREST GUMP."
"kingtanichi","Null","1","3","14 June 2004"," Not bad, but definitely no masterpiece
","This movie is a great example of right-wing sophistry. It asks us to believe that it's best to just unthinkingly act according to our own moral inclinations (assuming, of course, that they are the product of simple and well-off Christian upbringing), and put blind faith in the existing order, which will of course self-correct if it ever errs. It glorifies the vast accumulation of wealth because you will of course share it around, and treats military service as an inevitability not to be questioned.<br/><br/>Now in all fairness, this is an oversimplification of the film's message. If this had been all there was to the film, it would likely have been a box-office bomb and generated as much negative feedback as it ultimately did positive. But this is the core of the film. The best that can be said for it is that it delivers this conservative message with several liberal flourishes, making it politically intriguing.<br/><br/>For example, the single mother who gets her unqualified son into school by having sex with the principal hardly squares with the kind of persona one would usually attribute to a 50s woman who is horrified by Elvis's pelvic antics. And it is to the film's credit that while it implies stupidity to be useful in all aspects of life, it explicitly states that it is your best friend in the military. The film does vilify a lot of the youth protest movements of the 60s, but it also seems to take a sardonic glee in Edgar Wallace being shot, and it plays for laughs Forrest Gump showing his ass to Lyndon Johnson. And note the photo of Marilyn Monroe in JFK's bathroom.<br/><br/>On paper, this would sound like an explosive movie, but most people seem to take it as just a harmless and fun experience. No doubt this is because of the core element -- Tom Hanks's performance. And honestly, this is excellent. Hanks makes Forrest Gump likable and sincere in a way few, if any, other actors could have. My personal Tom Hanks heaven will always be G.H. Dorr, PhD, from The Ladykillers, but this is deservedly some of his best-known work."
"glgioia","Null","1","3","15 January 2003"," ""Why don't you love me, Jenny?""
","What will make this film endure is its apolitical skew when commenting on major political events. Everyone is parodied, everyone's hypocrisy revealed through Forest's simplicity, including the peaceniks - which is a welcome change to say the least. I truly believe this is one of the better films of the last quarter century. The reliance on special effects unfortunately will weaken this film over time, that's just inevitable. When you watch it now, the insertion of Forest into a number of historical events, which is a huge part of the film, already show an antiquated technology. While this was a new thing and sold the movie when it was released, it's more of a distraction now. There are roughly ten major scenarios or chapters in Forest's life that the film chronicles. Each completely as unrelated as can be imagined, but they are all done so well and woven together so finely, that never once is continuity threatened. The fifteen minutes or so of Viet Nam is as good as that gets. The photography goes heavy on the earth's natural beauty, and seeks to subliminally remind us how meaningless are all of the seemingly crucial events that pop off while we live our lives. Forest's inferior intellect allows him, although sadly unrealistically, to seek and win simple love, gain serendipitous fame and fortune, and ultimately attain nirvana because he is not burdened by intellectual fear or cerebral reasoning. Really makes you stop and think about what is important in this life we are blessed with."
"alainenglish","Null","1","3","24 September 2002"," Beautifully imperfect commentary on America
","Hailed as a classic when it first came out, ""Forrest Gump"" now appears to be looked upon as a travesty, a shallow celebration of America's innocence. Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the American ""innocence"" he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to be.<br/><br/>In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary on the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good hearted young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at great speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny (who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK. Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench awaiting a bus.<br/><br/>This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's graces.<br/><br/>The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places, particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.<br/><br/>Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and Robin Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother (who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a 'normal' school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a sense of self.<br/><br/>But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating it.<br/><br/>Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than ""people who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something"".  Forrest continually comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that invites to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.<br/><br/>This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments. One such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness in her voice ""Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over. Everybody gets a second chance...........""<br/><br/>Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With his much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny ""I'm not a smart man.  But I know what love is"", meeting his five year old son for the first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.<br/><br/>Whilst ""Pulp Fiction"", released at the same time and contrasted with this film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of American life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm sentiment in ""Forrest Gump""."

Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.  He is too dumb not to keep his promises and give away his money. He is too dumb not to save Lt. Dan, twice, once in battle and later, through continued good will and positive attitude, from himself.  He is too dumb to give up on his hopeless love. One is left inspired by this modern morality play, inspired to try to be a little better person, in hopes that in real life goodness might have just a bit of the effects it has in this movie.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with my kids, ages 10 and 13.

See also ""Shawshank Redemption"" for a similar, simple story. <br/><br/>This movie, like all movies, is a fantasy: in this case, a fantasy for lazy, simple (minded) people who fantasize about fame & celebrity (Forrest is on TV and in the newspapers multiple times, meets presidents and inspires celebrities, etc.) and money (""fate"" sees to it that his shrimp business makes him a millionaire and emphasis is put on how even his most mundane musings end up making people millionaires) without actually doing any work or coming up with any ideas to deserve either. <br/><br/>Life happens to Forrest, and these luckless layabouts relate to Forrest. Unfortunately for them, life is not like a box of chocolates where you don't know what you're gonna get, rather, it's based on natural selection where doers earn the good chocolates and people like their hero Forrest usually end up with nothing at all. Forrest Gump is a poor role model and this is an average movie."
"mikegan8","4","1","4","6 September 2012"," serendipitous advice
","Aside from the truths about the human condition and how Forrest was able to overcome his difficulties with his ""realistic"" way of looking at the world, I find the way the author weaves in Forrest into the historical events of the times ingenious. And particularly serendipitous is Forrest's remark on Lieut. Dan's decision to invest their funds in a fruit company --> Apple Computer, which at the time the movie was released was going for around $6 (split adjusted), and is currently around $670 (as well as getting to be the biggest US corp by value). Forrest can afford to cut all the lawns in America for free now!"

","Forrest Gump is one of my all time favorite movies, not only because it's a great movie but it shows plays out many events in history. It has many morals and quotes that pertain to everyday life. For example; ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."" That quote is so true about life in general; you never know what is going to happen next. It's a movie that I never get tired of and can't help but to love, even if some people say that it is overrated.<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like about the movie is the stretch of believing that someone with a very low IQ could accomplish so many things and randomly be a part of all the events in history that took place. I mean, I guess it could happen but it would be very unlikely.<br/><br/>I would compare this movie to any other movie that has to do with people with disabilities, such as Radio, a movie that has to do with a complicated love story and the army such as Dear John."

","I can't believe the vitriol hurled at this movie. I have seen this movie a number of time since it was released, and it never fails to move me and make me laugh.<br/><br/>And by the way I am a liberal, Ivy-league educated guy who went to college in the 60's, protested the war (and still thinks it was one of the biggest mistakes in American history) and has never voted Republican in his life. And I never thought of this film as a secret right-wing propaganda movie until I read the reviews here. In fact, it pretty accurately depicts some of the characters during that time. For example, the abusive, self-important boyfriend of Jenny's during the march on Washington was all too common (and someone who Jenny, as an abused child, would have been drawn to, unfortunately). Some guys who were against (or just avoiding the war) apparently needed to prove their manhood. Hence the SDS-a lot of those guys were real dicks- I know, I was there.<br/><br/>These characters are individuals- not symbols. As for Forrest, he goes to Nam, yes, but he is color blind, unlike everyone else depicted in the movie (black and white) and stands up for a battered woman. Those seem like pretty liberal virtues to me.<br/><br/>His great qualities are his loyalty and non-judgmental and loving nature, which are independent of his IQ. There were plenty of very stupid people of Forrest's generation who behaved very differently toward blacks and women. Jenny's father is a perfect example.<br/><br/>So maybe its an American cultural or generational thing, because I notice a lot of the film's bashers are from Europe. Lighten up. Its a fantasy, a comedy and yes, has a large dose of nostalgia for the music of the sixties and seventies."

","I've always liked the movie Forrest Gump ever since I was a little kid. It's a real classic and Tom Hanks just does a fantastic job as Forrest Gump. In the movie a man named Forrest Gump while waiting for a bus in Savannah Georgia tells his life story of growing up in Greenbow Alabama and playing football for the University of Alabama and then going into the army and fighting in Vietnam and then starting his own successful shrimping business and then fighting for the love of his life Jenny Curren and running across America. My favorite character in the movie was Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise)and I liked it when he asked Forrest if he found Jesus and Forrest said I didn't know I was suppose to be looking for him sir! That was so hilarious that I almost died laughing! Forrest Gump is a true classic movie that'll go on forever and ever! It's my favorite Tom Hanks film along with Cast Away! 10 out of 10!"

","Lost count on how many times I have watched this masterpiece, but sincerely I would love to watch it many more times in the future. The title role played by Tom Hanks has become one of the most loved characters in cinema history . The character who is primarily dumb with an I.Q below 75 and who according to his teachers and other people around cannot achieve anything in life, achieves something that is a dream to even the perfectly normal people . Forrest goes from playing in the college Football team, to working in the U.S Army, from graduating college to playing ping-pong at an international level and from running the entire span of America continuously for 3 years to becoming a millionaire with his shrimp business. That is a lot of achievement and he does all this with the same amount of dumbness and stupidity he is born with. The other characters in the movie, Forest's Mom who stood by him his entire life, His love interest Jenny who in her younger days picks up the drug habit and goes the hippie way, and after she is matured marries Forrest and gives birth to a son but dies in the end. His friend in the army days Bubba, and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan who then becomes his business partner etc. All these characters are well written and have a considerable role to play in the making of Forrest Gump as a person. One cannot miss mentioning the references of world famous personalities such as John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Elvis Presley, John Lennon etc in the movie and their coincidental relation with Forrest.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has portrayed the role of a lifetime and he got awarded for it - Best Actor Oscar. His improvisations for the role such as voice modulation, walking style and just looking plain dumb all went for him. Overall, you cannot be called a Hollywood lover, if you have not watched Forrest Gump :)<br/><br/>Ratings : 9/10"

","This is the kind of movie I love. Forrest Gump is a movie with a great story, a cast of entertaining actors, a powerful score, as well as an interesting take on history. The movie didn't seem to have a single dull moment. From the start to the very end Forrest Gump captured your heart and wouldn't let go. The movie was also very well done. It rightfully earned all 6 of the Oscars that it won. The only weak aspect of film making I noticed was some of the editing. Some of the scenes didn't flow as well as they should have, I don't know if this was the editor's fault or if there just wasn't the right footage to work with. That however is easily over looked due to the quality of the rest of the film making. I would recommend this movie."
"panli6","9","1","4","4 June 2007"," An everyman for today!
","The movie Forrest Gump is a fantastic movie. Both setting and plot were fabulous and it definitely showed ""The World"". Forrest Gump starts telling how stupid he is and then he becomes a marvelous football player, a ping pong player, and shrimp fisherman. He has a different intelligence and that makes him special and so successful in life. The most inspiring thing he does is how he fights for Jenny. When he always follows her and never gives up on her. At the beginning of the film, I thought he was really stupid but I realized that all he says is symbolic. He acts stupid but is actually smarter than most of the other people, that is why you should never judge someone by his/her appearance. He also has the typical Alabama accent, which makes the movie seem even more realistic. Each character was used surrealistically and unrealistically to show the theme everyman.<br/><br/>The actors in this movie are perfectly well cast. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is such a good actor and plays his role brilliant. He should've deserved an Academic award. Sally Field, who plays Forrest's mother, is actually only 4 years older than Tom Hanks, plays her role as a mother really well and symbolizes good motherhood. She can act as if she is 20 years older than him. Jenny (Robin Wright) plays her role as a good friend of Forrest and Hippie also very well. All the main characters do their job really well in this movie. The most supporting character was Jenny (Robin Wright). She was the main reason why Forrest Gump did everything. At the end where she dies, he even mentions it that he's done everything she wanted and that he loved her. She really supported him to achieve something in his life.<br/><br/>I really liked the setting in this movie. Where Forrest Gump starts off as a normal boy to a man in a small fictional town in Alabama, and then travels around and sees ""the whole world"". He is a simple Alabama kid and becomes all of a sudden really famous. It is like his life was chosen by destiny. That he would start off really small and then become very big and famous. He didn't choose to become a football player or a shrimp fisherman; he met Bubba to even find out what shrimps were. Only one thing was something he chose and always wanted to have, to get married with Jenny. His love and everything he would do for her to make her happy. The author did this on purpose. He wanted to show himself as everyman. That everyman can achieve something in their lives, not as much as Forrest Gump like he was there most of the events and became a ping pong player and all that. Obviously he couldn't be there on those events, but this is for the theme, to show everyman.<br/><br/>When Forrest Gump started to run around the whole world, he inspired many people. Only by running he just made them all run with him. He is a great inspiration even though people think he is ""dumb"". He does things that seem to be stupid, but actually are very clever. He is a very hard-working man and achieves everything which everyman wants. That shows basically the theme of this movie: work hard and you will achieve your goals. No wonder that this movie had won several Academy Awards. It is a great movie and I would suggest all the people who don't believe in themselves to watch this movie. It helped me a lot to work for my dreams, my hopes, and everything what I always tried to be.<br/><br/>If I had to rate this movie, I would give 9 out of 10 points because it has an exciting plot and well-chosen characters. Alabama is a great place for the setting of this movie and everywhere Forrest Gump went was also well chosen to show the theme: ""Life is like a box of chocolates!"" It means that you never know what you will get and everyman doesn't know what they get except trying to achieve their goals to find out. This movie has more than only one theme, but talking about all themes would take ages. It has got the theme of war and theme of motherhood and much more. The movie was definitely better than the book since it was more realistic and had better characterization. It is basically a message to us to see what is happening in the world or what happened. It really impressed me and I would watch it again because it is so interesting. It is almost perfect but as we all know, nothing or no one is perfect!"

","I have seen ""Forrest Gump"" (FG), a number of times, since I first saw it theatrically July 1994, when it was first released. I was first captured by it's beautiful music score. Then the story and Tom Hanks's performance as Forrest Gump, also won me over. This film knows how to push the right emotional buttons. There is no conventional story or plot in this film, yet the film works very well. Some people dislike this film, because the main character is of low intelligence and his adventures in life seem hard to believe. There are several reasons to attribute the big success of this film. Partly the screenplay, partly Tom Hank's performance, partly the music score and the film's sweep through 30 years of recent and familiar American history. FG is a very American film. Americans like a story of a simple person achieving great things. I believe many people reacted and related to the character of Forrest Gump in this film. A simple, innocent and humble man achieving great things in his life. Part of the moral of the story, is that brains aren't always necessary to achieve in life, a warm and kind heart can achieve in other ways in life. The story idea is that life is both destiny and luck. I like that philosophy and agree with it. To me, FG is a modern classic, American film."

"alex_83132","10","1","4","19 January 2007"," One of a kind
","What can you expect from a director who only has experience with Fiction movies? I knew Tom Hanks wouldn't say ""yes"" to just any script, it had to be something above all. I was curious, so I went to the theater the day it came out. After three hours in the cinema the film finally came to an end. I was surprised by what I had seen. Normally after a movie you remember the good scenes, the ones that made a really deep impression on you. But this film was different. I could remember all the scenes, even the really short ones. As a film reviewer that is really important, and someone actually have to take notes during the show. I believe ""Forrest Gump""'s screenplay is well written(even though it's truly a story from a novel) and directed that it will make even the most heartless man want to cry, sing, and dance. <br/><br/>The story ""Forrest Gump"" faces many of todays society problems from a different point view. Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) is a retarded boy who grows up in the state of Alabama with his single mother that always had a way of explaining things that made him understand. Forrest was born with soft bones, and was therefore forced to walk with steel tubes, one on each side of his leg, all the way up to his knee. It had big influence on him as a child, and you will recognize it later into his life as well. These are some of the things they face; Racism, drug abuse, war, killing as protest against politicians, love, and of course retarded people.<br/><br/>This is a ""must see!"". I recommend ""Forrest Gump"" to everybody, it's a movie you cant be without. Beautiful point of view, that I've never seen anything like. Well acted, incredibly good directed, and written god like."
"heejoo","10","1","4","7 January 2007"," tremendous acting, beautiful surrealistic story
","This movie is definitely in my top ten list. Every scene makes you want to have a taste of the next one already without even knowing what will happen in that previous one. It's surrealistic because so many great events happen to the main character his life almost turns into a modern fairy tale. It's funny because it's meaningful and honest and true. The story is inspiring and once you've seen it you won't ever forget it because it's simply a masterpiece. When I saw Forrest Gump for the first time I couldn't think of doing anything else. Because normally I get a drink, roll a cigarette or get something to eat when I watch at home, but with this one I was so fascinated it just flew me toward the end on a cloud of movie wonder and top acting. Thank you Robert Zemeckis for directing this work of art. Thank you Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field ... for amazing performances . Thank you Tom Hanks for being Forrest Gump and making millions of people happy and moved because this is one of the best!"
"KUAlum26","8","1","4","31 December 2006"," The Quintessential,20th Century Southern Tall-tale
","Winston Groom's novel was optioned to PAramount in 1986 and spent about seven years gathering dust before Robert Zemekis wanted to option this into a movie. Eric Roth agreed to pen the screenplay adaptation,and with some fortuitous and shrewd casting(fortuitous=freshly Oscar-minted Tom Hanks,shrewd=Gary Sinise,Sally Field,Robin Wright and Mykelti Williamson)mixed in with clever CGI,a little novel that had a cult following and was nearly forgotten became a Runaway Summer Box Office success and a Academy Award winner. <br/><br/>Such is the story of the making of Forrest Gump. I tell this,because the actual story of the film is pretty well understood by now: slow,possibly retarded Southerner Forrest Gump(Hanks,very un-Hanks-like and probably why he drew a second Oscar)is waiting on a bus to visit the love of his life,a troubled woman named Jenny(Robin Wright,nearly unrecognizable from her days as a soap actress or even from Princess Buttercup in The Princess Bride). While waiting,he--in his beguiling and completely unaffected manner--begins to tell strangers who happen by to wait on a bus about his story,and what a story it is! <br/><br/>Born of a unwed mother(Sally Field),he overcomes a birth disorder to become a champion runner, a college football star(at Alabama for legendary coach Paul""Bear""Bryant!),a war hero in Vietnam,a champion Ping Pong player and a successful entrepreneur. Along the way,he is able to touch the lives(and one has to assume,IS touched by)of the people who he works around and with,particularly his CO in 'Nam(Sinise in arguably the most haunting performance of the show),his equally slow bunk mate in the Army(Williamson,unfairly ignored for this performance)and,of course,Jenny. But while Forrest leads a Pangloss/Zelig type life through the turbulent period of time that defined the Baby Boomer generation,he's still looking for the love that Jenny seems so reluctant to give.<br/><br/>To be real honest,the gild on this Lily for me has came off over the years(I absolutely LOVED this film when I saw it in a crowded movie theater on JUly 4th weekend,1994),partly due to the over-abundance of publicity that this film received over the nearly seven months that it was in first-run theatrical release. Also,I wasn't entirely convinced that this movie deserved all the awards mantle ware that it received. But I've seen this movie at least twice in its entirety and probably as many as seven or eight times in bits and pieces,plus I own the VHS tape and may someday want to get the DVD,so I feel like for the most part,this film is still special to me. I think that's because of the summary line:behind the stars,the big-time production,the awards,the frills,the publicity(Bubba Gump cookbooks,T-Shirts,etc.),lies what can be simply put as a Southern Tall tale,meant to enchant and inspire the imagination,set to a period of time(namely,the Western world,circa 1946 to 1981)that is generally regarded as anything but inspirational or enchanting. This film is for anyone who wants to believe in larger-than-life tales set in the real world. An unforgettable film,indeed."
"canpp","5","1","4","28 December 2006"," A very fine morality play on celluloid.
","Robert Zemeckis has done a credible job with this morality play. Tom Hanks portrays a dim-witted, but practical, man who has good luck on his side.<br/><br/>It is a story of a seemingly simple man, who has a great deal of practical sense and his seemingly complicated life.<br/><br/>The film is a character study not only of Hank's character, but, a character study of the people in his orbit. The big influences in Forrest Gump's life are is his mother and his best a friend, a girl who suffered at the hands of an abusive father who lived on the edge and eventually would have fallen off it had it not been for Forrest's gentle spirit and his Vietnam War buddy, Bubba, also a slow-witted, but kindly man who befriends Forrest and the two forge a solid friendship in a short period of time. whereby its influences affect Forrest's life long after Bubba's untimely death in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Forrest deals with love, romantic, maternal and platonic, hate, warÂ…the effects such as Forrest meeting President Kennedy are pretty neat. In dealing with life, Forrest deals with the complications of life in the most practical matter and it serves him and those around him well.<br/><br/>The film's message is rather simple, no matter what life brings to your doorstep, there are only solutions, no problems.<br/><br/>I personally liked the film, but, I do think the film is very over-rated because those who are of politically correct mindset make a large point of pointing out the morality play's message of hope. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being a miracle, I give the film a solid 5."

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon.

Forrest was a kid with problems growing up, and all the kids made fun of him, until they found out how fast he could run. After that he gained some respect playing football, for his high school football team.<br/><br/>That's just where the adventure begins, his long and compelling story, is one filled with drama, action, and a humorous line or moment every here or there. There are hundreds of memorable lines that come form the movie, like ""Stupid is as Stupid does"" or ""Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get."" The movie starts Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field, whom are really great actor, who really have great chemistry together. Though one thing, Gary Sinise had earlier worked with tom Hanks on the set of the movie, Apollo 13. Sally Field is a long time actress, and delivers a great performance as forests mother, in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot of life's lessons wrapped up in one movie, it shows that anyone, know matter how smart or stupid, can be a great person. In the movie Forrest Gump, Forrest is that person. He gets to meet 3 presidents, play for his college football team, Join the army, Fight in Vietnam, get a medal of Honor, make a lot of money, selling shrimp, and really lived a successful life. He Got married to a childhood friend, and even had a son. His life can be admired by anyone, as he actually lived the history back then. This is what makes him successful. Most people could have lived through those times, like most of our parents, but most of our parents just lived through the times. Forest experienced it first hand.<br/><br/>Forrest (Tom Hanks) as a character had many things going for him. For one thing he was a lovable character, whom you cans really connect with. You can see all of his emotions, and all sides of his character throughout the movie. You see him happy when he First meets Jenny (Robin Wright). You seem him get angry when he Sees someone beating jenny, you see him confused in Vietnam, and you see him confused. This is part of what makes Forrest Gump, such a powerful movie The movie has backgrounds to the book Forrest Gump, by Winston Groom. Though the two have the same title, the book and the movie are like two different tales of Forrest Gump. The book has more of his life playing foot ball, and before the army, and the movie just focuses on his life as a whole. Also the book doesn't have much of forests child life as the movie does.<br/><br/>The films director, Robert Zemeckis, does a super job bringing the screen play to life. His interpretation of the screen play is very well, and the camera angles he uses, with the real life scenarios, bring the movie to life. The houses he used, and the sets for all the locations, make it look like they were filmed there. Especially the New York Scenes where forest attends to Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise).<br/><br/>In total, Forrest Gump is a powerful film and really deserves the 6 academy awards it won. Though it says it's a comedy, its more a Drama, with a funny scene here or there. Thus it deserves everything it has"

Forrest gump directed by Robert Zemeckis is a classic.Winner of 6 Oscar awards including best picture,actor and director this movie takes you to a dream.<br/><br/>I have been big fan of Tom Hanks.I was eager of watching this movie previously too but never got the chance.My friends who have seen it before called it classic some called it slow.But yesterday finally i watched it.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump (Hanks), named after a civil war hero, grows up in Greenbow, Alabama, where his mother (Sally Field) runs a boarding house. Although Forrest is a little ""slow"" (his IQ is 75, 5 below the state's definition of ""normal""), his mental impairment doesn't seem to bother him, his mother, or his best (and only) friend, Jenny Curran (played as an adult by Robin Wright). In fact, the naivete that comes through a limited understanding of the world around him gives Forrest a uniquely positive perspective of life.<br/><br/>During the next thirty years, Forrest becomes a star football player, a war hero, a successful businessman, and something of a pop icon. Through it all, however, there is one defining element in his life: his love for Jenny. She is never far from his thoughts, no matter what he's doing or where he is.<br/><br/>Forrest gump is a masterpiece.A noble and beautiful story which touches your heart.We hardly find any movies in Hollywood which being slow and without special effects becomes blockbuster.Forrest Gump is among one of those rare gems.<br/><br/>There are movies and movies but only sometimes you find a movie which stays in your heart and becomes one of your all time favourites.I have to search for words how to describe such a magical movie.<br/><br/>And finally Forrest Gump would have never been a forrest gump without Tom Hanks.Playing the character of Forrest Gump he is incredible.His performance was just out of the world.One of the best performances given by any actor ever.I cant found out words to describe how great his performance was.Just look at his expressions in the scene in end when he says'I miss you Jenny..If there is anything you need i wont be far away'.Totally unforgottable.Even stone hearted people would melt.<br/><br/>I gave this review here cause i wanted all members to know how beautiful and magical forrest gump is.A must watch for everyone ...........A timeless classic"

","This movie is special, and for one reason: Gary Sinise. Mr. Sinise's performance as Lt. Dan is one of the great performances in U. S. cinematic history. His poignant and powerful portrayal of a human being wallowing helplessly in the deepest recesses of despair is uncanny. Lt. Dan is the personification of suffering, of emotional desolation, of a man who is bent on self-destruction but deep down still wants to survive, still harboring a glimmer of hope that things may turn his way, that he may attain salvation and a measure of happiness in a life that has been ravaged by war. Because of Gary Sinise, Forrest Gump is a great movie."

","Forrest Gump is one of those epic films, which .. like Donnie Darko is not most exciting action film with amazingly skillful stunts etc, but its got something special that nobody can take away from it, to stop its being special. Tom Hanks is such an adaptable actor, ranging from a relatively normal everyday role in ""Splash"" to his more intelligent and formal role in ""The Da Vinci Code"" movie release. In FG, he inevitably gives his best in the portrayal of Forrest, an individual whose IQ is no greater than 75 - just over the borderline of appearing mentally challenged. However, despite the fact that he has no real aspirations in life, he does know one important thing, he loves Jenny and he enjoys the simple things in life, mainly because he can understand and cherish them more readily, and they are easily accessible too. He is a wholly lovable character and the audience will remember this film for a long time after first watching it. Watch it now. Mel x"

","Anyone who has a problem with this movie on any level probably just doesn't understand parables. Gump at it's basic is a fable about a man who, although short on ""intelligence"" nonetheless has a degree of common sense often absent in his intellectual superiors. Couple this with his moral compass and the way the story always places him in interesting situations and you have the canvas upon which this morality play unfolds. Gump is simple, gentle and loving - but, interestingly, he is not a wimp. He has courage of his convictions and does not hesitate to use violence to defend those he loves. Amazing this came from Hollywood. Refreshing."

"dee.reid","10","1","4","2 June 2006"," Simplicity at its best
","""Forrest Gump,"" 1994's controversial and acclaimed Best Picture Oscar winner and is itself adapted from the novel by Winston Groom, is the simple story of a simple man and the not-so-simple world he is born into. Tom Hanks is the title character, a Southerner with an IQ of 75, who as a boy is handicapped by a crooked back and forced to wear leg braces. Raised by his mother (Sally Field) to not let the world hold him back, she does the regrettable and sleeps with a school's principal to get him enrolled. His first days are hard-luck, but that changes when he lays eyes on the beautiful Jenny, and the two become close friends, even through high school, when she is now played by Robin Wright Penn. Once graduating high school, Forrest is encouraged to go to college, where he becomes a football star and is drafted into the United States Army upon graduation. Forrest's limited intelligence to the situation renders him blind to the Vietnam conflict, where his service is guaranteed. He's unaware of the growing resentment towards the war, but his heroic actions to save comrades including hardened veteran Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) and best friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) during an ambush by the VC one day encourage a Medal of Honor award. Thus, the world as we know it is seen through the eyes of this simple man who leads an extraordinary journey through some of America's roughest periods: the 1960s through the late '70s. All of this is fickle to him, as his one true love Jenny continues to evade him (even though they see one another sporadically over the years, and their encounters are often very brief) and her life becomes increasing less than pleasant. ""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies for a reason: when all hell was breaking loose during radical times of change, one man saw it as a little more than nothing. His unwitting triumphs over the years - football star, war hero, Medal of Honor recipient, White House honorary guest, millionaire businessman, international Ping Pong champion, and ultimately, father - are extraordinary to everybody else except him, simply because he's too stupid to realize the significance of his actions. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, everything about ""Forrest Gump"" is classic and beautiful. From Hanks's brilliant and nuanced performance, to the Oscar-winning special effects (the insertion of Hanks into archival media footage; the digital erasure of Sinise's legs to make the audience believe he's a real amputee) to the closing credits, it shines and will forever remain shining as a modern American classic piece of cinema. Though Forrest himself may not know it, he's found one of the greatest fans in this writer. He's a true inspiration that nothing is impossible regardless of one's intelligence. His message is that nothing can hold you back except you. It's a dream come true from anyone's perspective.<br/><br/>10/10"

Once the viewer has a full understanding of the historical context of the movie, he/she can appreciate the ingenious plot of this story, told through the eyes of a simplistic yet at the same time complex individual.

","Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. <br/><br/>The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten."
"squid22003","8","1","4","27 February 2006"," ""Run, Forrest, Run""
","The film follows the life of low-IQ Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), as he falls in love with Jenny (Robin Wright), makes two friends while in the army in Lieutenant Dan and Bubba (Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson), attends college, fights in Vietnam, and seemingly by happenstance meets up with Elvis Presley, John F Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Governor George Wallace. Forrest goes on to become a very wealthy and extremely successful businessman. Though the scenery changes, there is one thing that remains the same through the entire movie: Forrest will always fight for his Jenny and try to save her from whatever trouble she is currently in.<br/><br/>In this comedy/drama, Forrest keeps his good sense about him, using his mother's sayings and advice as cornerstones of his ethics. When asked if he is stupid, Forrest will always reply with: ""Momma always says stupid is as stupid does."" Although his IQ is only 75, which we are told is five points below the public school systems' definition of ""normal,"" he makes very intelligent decisions throughout the film. Director Robert Zemeckis gives viewers a glimpse at the most important events of the 1950s through the 1980s through Gump's eyes, where we must take things as he sees them. Gump's simple talent of running quickly takes him to many different places and makes him an icon to many American people.<br/><br/>Zemeckis does an excellent job with the special effects. Although the video clips are not seamless, they do a great job of putting Gump into the history which viewers already know. Forrest is at the door of the schoolhouse when Governor George Wallace tries to stop desegregation, and actually gives a young black woman a book that she has dropped. The viewer can actually see Gump meet and greet three American presidents, one of which he shows a bullet wound to his ""butt-ocks."" Although Gump is too good a man to dabble in drugs and rock and roll, we still visualize what is going on in the counterculture, where Jenny is at home at the rallies and through the disco era. And, because Forrest and Jenny are complete opposites, we get to see every aspect of culture from the 1950s through the 1980s. No matter what viewers are looking for in a movie, ""Forrest Gump"" promises a good show."

","This is without a doubt one of my best films of all time. It's just a masterpiece to behold in my eyes and i'll tell you why: The acting is superb, Tom hanks really is Forrest Gump in this film to every minute detail. Right from the slow fumbling characteristics of Forrest to the superb southern accent which he employs with such energy and humour makes excellent viewing. Robin Wright Penn is also sensational in this film. She just brings tears to my eyes her final scene. She really comes of ' age ' in this film. She portrays every painful experience of Jenny in such depth but equally can highlight on the more peaceful and content side of the troubled girl. Finally Sally Fields is class through and through in this film. She's such a dominant actress on screen and she always delivers. Her line to Forrest when she's on her deathbed is so poignant and heartbreaking. ' I will miss you Forrest '. It just was spellbinding to watch such great actors come together in this film. Absolutely superb.<br/><br/>Finally, the use of historical events and the way they fit around Forest is just superb, i've never seen anything so creative and intuitive. From John Lennon, Elvis, Nixon and Lennon, this really establishes an almost reality that Forrest Gump is a influential part of American society.<br/><br/>My final words are WATCH THIS FILM!!

","Forrest Gump, born in the 1940s, has a limited intelligence, but an unlimited heart. By following his heart he accidentally became successful : he managed to go to college because he could run fast and was dragged into playing football, go to the Vietnam war, meet John F. Kennedy, win Ping Pong championship in China, become rich by fishing shrimps and buying stocks from the Microsoft company. Yet all that time he didn't care about that at all. He only wanted to gain the love from his childhood love, Jenny. Evidently, she appears one day at his door step, desperate for money <br/><br/>Both Forrest Gump"" and Being There"" are ideologically identical films which are dead set at proving one point: all you need in life is luck. It's as simple as that. Both have retarded heroes that manage to become successful in life just by being at the right time at the right place. And both are great movies, although Being There"" is unfortunately not nearly as popular. Forrest Gump"", winner of 6 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes, is an extremely emotional roller-coaster with an tremendously naive and gentle hero that you just can't have the heart to hate. Such sequences, like the one where the 10-year old Forrest started running for the first time in his life, breaking those metal braces for his legs he had to wear because he couldn't walk properly, were so magical they sent shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>--------------- <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis directs the story in a form of a vivid fairytale, not always managing to keep it logical ( would Forrest's mom really let her son go to the Vietnam war? Could Forrest really run from the east coast of the USA to the west coast? ) or consistent ( stiff ending, and come to think of it, Bill Murray would have been much better as Forrest Gump ), but still letting the positive opinion prevail, and even cleverly playing with history, stating how small often inspire the big ( like when Forrest met John Lennon in a talk show and caused him to say the words like Imagine all those people"", No religion too?"". We all knew where that was going ). Many have criticized this film, calling it too pathetic, racist and even politically dubious, but I don't share that opinion. After seeing it I was left amazed, and that's the only thing that matters. Forrest Gump"" is together with Schindler's List"", Groundhog Day"", Dances with Volwes"", Rushmore"" and Saving Private Ryan"" one of the best films of the 90s. And yet I still can't shake that feeling away that Being There"" should get more credit for the success of this film.<br/><br/>Grade: 10/10"

","RUN FORREST RUN!! will always remain the catchphrase for this movie. We all know he ran like a maniac and when he went, he went and he did not stop at all. But the film is not only about the running scenes; it is the world according to Gump and it's a hell of a world out there.<br/><br/>Alabama born, low IQ, Jenny/mama loving and running man, young protagonist Forrest Gump just lives an ordinary life. He doesn't know what is going on; he lives his life to his fullest. But, along the way, he has some natural experiences that impact his life; you can see bullies tormenting him, him meeting Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan, his experiences in Vietnam, saving all his fellow soldiers including Lt. Dan, fulfilling Bubba's dream when he becomes shrimp captain of his boat, when he played ping-pong, when he met President Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, when he got a Medal of Honor, his adventures with Lt. Dan, his mama's advice and of course his love for Jenny. This film will remain a masterpiece, not only for the running scenes, but for the true humanity Forrest has in himself.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives another fine performance (second to Philadelphia) as Forrest, showing us that even retards can have some value in the world and truly deserving his second Oscar. The supporting cast is excellent; Gary Sinise with his breakthrough Oscar-nominated role as Lt. Dan, 2 time Oscar winner Sally Field as his mother, Mykelti Williamson (also another breakthrough performance) as Bubba, and of course Robin Wright Penn as Jenny, Forrest Gump's love who eludes him for many years until the end. This film proves that care will help find one's destiny. And Forrest does exactly that; he cares for everybody; he has no enemies and he eventually achieves his destiny as just being himself. <br/><br/>As the usual fan I am of Tom Hanks, I recommend this movie to everyone and rank it a 10/10! MUST WATCH!"
"gottogorunning","10","1","4","9 August 2005"," Classic!
","Goodness gracious, I discovered that I hadn't commented on this movie yet! Well, it's to be rectified.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump was an absolute favorite of mine for several years, it still ranks among the top ten movies of all time. It is brilliant, a true gem that will undoubtedly become a classic. It already IS a classic, actually. At least in my book.<br/><br/>Though it differs from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name Forrest Gump and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: it's the kind of epic and insane saga one can find in one. The life and adventures of Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time around, the liar tells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human being, a bit on the slow side, I'll admit - but he is honest, he is righteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.<br/><br/>This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, it's politics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets between the events and actually understanding them is the kind of distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His ability to walk away unscathed from any happening is one I sure would like to have.<br/><br/>I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life."
"derekschim","8","1","4","8 August 2005"," A classic for a new generation.
","Looking for Action? Or how about a little romance? Or maybe you like sports films? Maybe you like all of these? Well if you like any of these you are in luck! Forrest Gump, winner of 6 Oscars, including best picture, and best actor (Tom Hanks!), is a great film that can be enjoyed by anyone. Forrest Gump, seen on several American historical occasions (and causing a few of them), is a man of slower wit, but with a glowing heart, where throughout this entire film he relies on, so he can get through a large complex world, and care for his loving friend, Jenny. Along the way earning fame, hope, glory, riches, and deep hearted caring friends, Forrest Gump sets you up for a masterpiece of theater that will live out a long name in the film industry for many years.<br/><br/>Although Gump has been getting a name for being Right-Wing biased, it was not meant to be a political movie, but a movie about following your heart, and living out destiny, and MUST not be disgraced with a vulgar thing like politics."

","The humorous, but yet heartwarming tale of a man named Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks) who tells the story of his life to random people waiting for the bus. Forrest Gump, who has an IQ of 75, lived the life that can only be imagined but yet still finds his greatest joy with his childhood friend Jenny(Robin Wright Penn).<br/><br/>The movie is breathtaking! Tom Hanks gives his greatest performance of all time(better than Philadelphia) and the supporting cast of Robin Wright Penn and Gary Sinise is wonderful. The movie captures various major aspects of life from the 60s to 90s with great visual effects and hilarious comedy. What seems to have been overlooked in the movie that really makes it even better, is the great camera shots. The movie has some of the best camera shots since Lawrence of Arabia. The scene with Forrest looking at where Jenny was sleeping that night with the milk in his hand was just visual bliss! Overall, the instant classic is absolutely great in multiple ways.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

Of course the story is practically impossible! Or may be not!! But the message in the movie is too strong to neglect or to ignore, the amazing actor ""Tom Hanks"", who proved by this movie that he is not just an actor but he's one of the best actors in the history and that's for sure and he proved that too in ""Cast Away"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"", and all his other movies.<br/><br/>A simple message through the movie saying ""Whoever you are, whatever you are and wherever you are; you can do anything""!!

","""Forrest Gump"" should have a higher rating than 10! It is cleverly written and Tom Hanks plays his part really well.. I don't see why some people hate it! Why else did it win 6 Oscars? Yes, 6!! This movie shows that even if you don't have a plan in life, it'll always turn out how it was intended by someone else (i.e God). It also shows that just because someone is stupid - it doesn't mean they don't have feelings.. This is shown when Forrest falls in love with jenny. I totally recommend this movie to anyone; it has romance, comedy, sadness and happy times - all in one! What more could you want? Every single part of this film is enjoyable - one minute its sad and brings a tear to your eye - the next you're rolling on the floor with laughter!"

","First I thought this was an American remake of Run Lola Run, but it turns out to be a completely different movie.<br/><br/>Forrest is an Anthropomorphic Personification of America, he gets involved in everything from war to business, ping pong to peace protests. But he is a little bit slow, so he is an innocent.<br/><br/>Is this how America sees itself, an innocent, making itself through the world? Possibly. Interestingly this movie is incredibly popular in China, maybe for the same reason.<br/><br/>It is an entertaining movie, showing the history of America, not through the eyes of important people, but ordinary people. Forrest is the person you see in the TV footage gaping at important events, getting to go all sort of places without any plan or idea of where he is going.<br/><br/>The music is perhaps a little bit too laboured, with 20 songs for every time period, and some little scenes having multiple songs.<br/><br/>So Run Forrest Run......"

"BobMcDe","10","1","4","1 June 2005"," A combination of humor and compassion that meshes and mesmerizes.
","From start to finish this movie will make you laugh to you cry. Tom Hanks is superb as Forest Gump. He is supported by a cast that pops in and out of the scenes with unforgettable performances. As the movie begins you think of Forrest Gump as simple country boy who is lacking the intelligence to ever be more than a footnote to the human race. As the movie progresses you find Forrest excelling in every endeavor but public speaking and common sense. He seems almost autistic in his endeavors. By the time the movie reaches its end realizing Forrest Gump is not a smart man is not difficult, but his character gives us much insight into why people, although not having a high IQ, can still make important contributions to society... Forrest Gump obviously was never at the many significant events that were the fabric of the movie but by movies end you'll wish he had been... life would definitely have been more interesting. I gave the movie a 10 not because the movie was great, I rated it a 10 because it is great fun for the entire family!"
"the_recruit-1","10","1","4","30 May 2005"," I could cry at this movie
","This movie was very impressing, although it lasts 2h 10 minutes I can say that is very short. It is that kind of movie that you wish that never end. I didn't thought that a movie 10 years old can surprise me so hard. I must say that later after I saw it, I remained with a state of spirit very melancholic. And at the end I almost cried. It have a very good story, a very good acting and hero make impression in any situation though sometimes he put himself in a laughable position. So you can follow the life of the character in a very original way, like he is telling his life story on a bench to a person, and on the measure we are running into the movie the listeners are leaving but another takes his place. And I must say that the soundtrack of this movie is really hot. Must acquire it. I recommend this movie and those who vote that lower marks are big dummies."

","""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get."" Regardless of whether you believe it or not, it is certainly true in Forrest Gump's case. This movie gives us a complicated adventure story, which happened to a so-called stupid person and the simple spirit he had. Sometimes, simplicity is far better than complexity.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, begins by sitting on a bench, telling strangers his stories, which for them are too amazing to be believed. He fights in the war, becomes a table tennis champion and meets the president. Forrest Gump is so down-to-earth. Actually, Sincerity helps him win everyone's heart. Speaking of sincerity, you can totally feel it throughout the movie. But it is dying away to some extent in our real life. The spirit of this movie always inspires me and makes me feel good.<br/><br/>Another impressive part I want to mention is the best performance of all the cast, plus magnificent music with a perfect picture. My favorite part is at the beginning of the movie, when a white feather is floating in the air, with lovely background music, oh, you just can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>If you really want to choose a movie to enjoy, not just see, don't miss Forrest Gump."
"UnbrokenSoul","8","1","4","16 May 2005"," A true epic
","Forrest Gump still ranks among the top fifteen box office hits of all time in America, taking in over $329 million. The movie follows the journey of a slow man who gains glory and fame in a diverse and sometimes turbulent era in history. Forrest often doesn't realize the significant impact he makes on some of the most influential people in America. His true love, Jenny, represents the typical youth during that time, and constantly eludes him. They eventually marry and have a son together, but their family life is cut short when Jenny becomes suddenly ill and dies. Forrest lived a full life, inspiring those around him in many ways. As Forrest said, ""I might not be a smart man, but I know what love is."" The audience connects with his character, experiencing life through Forrest's eyes. The film won six Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director and is rightly considered an epic in American culture."

","First of all if you don't want to read a review from a 12 year old girl don't read it.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump touched my heart dearly when i first watched it after 8 years. It made me understand about what happened back in the 70's- 90's and it amazed me. Mostly i loved Forrest, Lt. Dan,and Buba(although he's was in the movie for a short time). I'll list why i like each of these characters <br/><br/>Forrest: He reminds me of my Mildly Autisic brother and reminds me of the kids i go to Special ED. with. He is a confused man and he narrates the story very well. He makes me laugh and cry with some of his stories of what he dealt in his life.<br/><br/>Lt. Dan: He just grew on me when i first saw him and also his lack of belief in Jesus and i feel it too since i hate going to CCD. Not a very good reason <br/><br/>Buba: When i first saw him on the army bus he made me smile also not a good reason.<br/><br/>Other than that i give this movie 7 out of 10 stars for a great imaginative movie"

","If you are looking for an inspiration in form of a movie, Forrest Gump is the one you have got to watch. It inspires you to work ahead when the odds are stacked against you and one day you will conquer the world. It is useless to check out the verity of the incidents that have been mentioned in the movie, I think movie is about giving a message to oneself about the virtues of being good and everything good will happen to you. Tom Hanks is simply mind blowing in a movie which in essence leaves a tinge of positive energy within you. This movie and Tom Hanks deserve every bit of acclaim they have got through this movie. The story is told in a way which teaches you a lesson of humility, even though so many things happen to him he stays the same soft-spoken, reluctant, Forrest he used to be during his childhood. And this movie is not all about lessons, it is an emotion filled journey of a person who faces adversity and comes out with flying colors out of those adversities and as the caption tells us ""World will never be the same once you see through the eyes of Forrest Gump"". Well i think if a person after seeing this movie, wants to be like Forrest Gump then i guess the purpose of the movie has been served"

","Forrest Gump is about a man with the name of the title who is played by Tom Hanks. Forrest's only problem is the fact that his I.Q. isn't up to par with most of America. But that doesn't stop him from taking part in some of the greatest moments of the USA. He just might not know that he's doing it.<br/><br/>We begin the story with a great musical score. It really sets the mood for what we're about to experience. We then see Forrest sitting on a bench. He begins to talk to the people that sit down next to him. The audience hears the story and begins to realize that, even with a low level of intelligence, this is an extraordinary man who has a lot of important things to say.<br/><br/>He even goes into detail about the love of his life, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn). Forrest explains to the other bench sitters that he never got the chance to really understand his relationship with her until later in his life.<br/><br/>With a character like Forrest Gump, who needs the other ones in the film. But the actors who do play those other roles are so good, that we even get to sympathize for them as well. That's what makes this film so good and that's the reason why it has become so popular. We care for the characters and we can really relate to them. This film is a great example of what life was like for the baby boomer era, but without the low I.Q.<br/><br/>The film ended up winning six Academy Awards, including Picture, Director, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, and Visual Effects. It was nominated for seven other Oscars, including Supporting Actor (Gary Sinise in an incredible role), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Sound Effects Editing, Make-up, Original Score, and Sound."

What makes it so powerful is that Forrest has little comprehension of just how lucky he is. Being as ""slow"" as he is, he has no need for, or probably has never felt complex human emotion. Everything he feels is simple but true, which makes his journey so touching.<br/><br/>Watching this movie will have an effect on you; it'll make you assess your station in life and maybe it'll push you to define yourself and your role in existence.<br/><br/>Definitely see this if you haven't yet.

","What a movie. I remember the first time I saw it with my family and myself and my mum cried, but it was such a great, powerful and deeply moving film. The script, acting, directing, music, effects and every other aspect are outstanding. The key to this film though here is Hanks. I do not believe any other actor in the world could have played the part as well as he did. He really is one of the best actors around these days. People keep on saying that this movie mugged Shawshank Redmption at the Oscars, which is very unfair because although that is also one of my favourite films, this just about overtook it for me. The script by Eric Roth and Hanks's acting here for me do by a small amount outdo Shawshank although many will disagree. In fact I don't know how earth Alan Silvestri's score didn't get an Oscar. It is probably one of the best i've ever heard and The Lion King definitely didn't deserve it i'm afraid. The same applies to Sinise's performance which also deserved an Oscar.

Forrest, the main character, is seemingly such a simple-minded man. He was thought to be stupid by many around him, but through the choices Forrest makes, we see the depth of his commitment to those around him and the unconditional love that he offers to all. Forrest was not a brilliant man, but he was a good man, a generous man, a man who made his world a better place just by being himself.

I saw this movie again when I was older (about 4 months ago) at the age of 14. To this day, me and my friend still quote it. It is amazing on so many different levels.<br/><br/>The love that Forrest has for Jenny, the way Forrest just kind of ignored all those who said he wouldn't amount to anything because of his low I.Q., how he remains so innocent through-out the movie. All these things make this film different from the others. It puts it above all them. This confirm's my belief that Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. To portray someone who has a mental incapacity is a very difficult thing to do, and if I did not know any better, I would think that Hanks is not acting. The way this film is put together is moving, incredible, and unbelievable, all at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie could never be made over or covered, it would destroy it.

"CurtMan@LVCM.com","10","1","4","3 June 2004"," A wonderful triumph on every level
","I haven't any idea where to begin with this wonderful, beloved classic. ""Forrest Gump"" ranks as my favorite film of all time, and for many, many reasons. Everything about this beautiful fable is compelling, engrossing, endearing, and absolutely classic. From its memorable ""feather"" opening scene, we are instantly acquainted with the simple,remarkable story of a simple,lovable man,wisked away into the eyes of Forrest Gump. We learn about individuality (""Don't ever let anyone tell you you're different""), values (""Stupid is as stupid does""),love (""I'm not a smart man... But I love you""), and so many more honest, appreciative qualities to life, all in the tale of a man who has experienced life for everything it is worth, yet lacking the intellectual capacity to conceive the significance of his life. The story takes us from the childhood days of Forrest on his uncertain first ride to school, where he meets the love of his life, Jenny (""I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life. She was like an angel""), to his first ride of recruitment in the Vietnam war, where he befriends his ""best good friend"" Bubba, to finally, taking his own son, Forrest, to the busstop for his first day of school. The story has been covered; now for my evaluative assessment. Everything in this film, from the brilliant, sensible direction, to the incredibly touching Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, in perhaps the best performance in the history of cinema, to the compassionate, understanding score, to the unforgettable screenplay (As I write this review I am constantly tempted to quote a line from the film), to the realistic visual effects (One would believe Forrest Gump had actually existed with fame), to such delightful performances as Lieutenant Dan, played hysterically by Gary Sinise, and etc. etc. etc. I cannot praise this classic, unequaled, monumental film enough; suffice to say, everything here is perfect, this film is excellent on practically every level, and I have not stopped loving ""Forrest Gump"" since the first time I heard the line, ""Life is like a box of chocolates"".

I have seen all three of these films many times but I think that Pulp Fiction should have one but it was propbably a little too original for most viewers. If not Pulp, I would have chosen Shawshank to win. At least for adapted screenplay? The film still is very well done and I think Zemeckis did an amazing job. Tarantino did deserve the Oscar though, but Zemeckis showed each era truthfully from what I have read and heard about. I have also heard that Terry Gilliam turned the film down and that was probably a very good thing. Don't get me wrong, he is a very good director but he would have ruined this movie.

When it was first announced that Forrest Gump was going to be adapted for the screen, I was very excited, as this was one of my favorite stories. I cannot begin to describe the nausea that overcame me as I sat through the slaughter of Winston Groom's literary masterpiece (tall tale of the tallest). I was completely embarrassed in front of my friends (whom I had dragged along to the movie theater with me); I had to urge them to read the book and forget what they had witnessed on the screen. Everything about this movie, from the casting to the ""rewriting"", was just plain wrong.

As it is truly a magical movie. It enhances minds to think that it can take the events of a simple individual to make a difference in life. In the movie, Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) experiences nearly thirty years of history. He had accomplished many things that many people cannot do. He is a hero, and nobody would forget him. Academy award winner Tom Hanks, has out-done himself as a simple trying to find the meaning of love, and helping out mankind. Nobody could have done it better than Tom.

And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extroadinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.<br/><br/>
So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites. I recommend to anyone."
"Silverzero","7","1","4","15 March 2003"," Enjoyable and expansive story that gets overly indulgent in parts but entertains thoroughly.
","Winning umpteen different Oscars in 1994 and constantly parodied, Forrest Gump manages to live up to its `classic' status. Although it does become a bit too manipulative and sometimes surreal in parts, it's also very witty and joyfully nostalgic. <br/><br/>Tom Hanks does the role of crippled hero Forrest Gump (the most parodied character on the planet). He's ideal for the role but despite whoever takes on the role, the character himself is very unconvincing. Gary Sinise is a lot more convincing as a cynical Vietnam soldier. Sally Field (melodramatic as usual) doesn't show us anything new but is good for the part nonetheless. Robin Wright doesn't do much in the film, even though the plot kind of revolves around her. A but more conviction would have been helpful.<br/><br/>
What the film is best for is its wonderful depiction of the rockin' 50's, the swingin 60's and the sleazy 70's. This is accompanied by a soundtrack, which is well suited to the times. However, the film falls way short on its portrayal of the (glitzy?) 80's. The costumes, set designs and attitudes seem very inappropriate and very little thought went into this part of the movie. The other problem is the script. For the most part it is good but it gets too inventive in some scenes and goes way too far. Some surrealism is OK but having one man be involved in every major event in three decades is crossing the line. <br/><br/>Overall, `Forrest Gump' probably didn't deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but if you put all of the evident flaws aside, you have a great movie. I give it 7.5/10."

"EmbracedByJellyfish","Null","1","4","28 August 2002"," it Is unbelievable. unbelievably amazing...
","After reading most of the IMDB comments about Forrest Gump I'd like to regard to some of the counterclaims (people who haven't seen this movie yet can read it too, there's no actual spoilers):<br/><br/>The main problem of the people who disliked this movie is either they're way too sarcastic or just way, but WAAAY too ""literal"". All the comments of these people manifested one of those two. They just don't understand that the plot of Forrest Gump is almost totally figurative! I really don't get you people, Forrest Gump is not only unique, it EXQUISITE, it surpasses everything a good movie can be! If this isn't a 10+/10 movie, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>When other movies poke you STRAIGHT IN THE FACE some reprimands, or moral lessons, or ""confrontations with God"", or personal life journeys, or dark sides of the world such as war, child sexual abuse, drugs etc., you grimace and say ""damn, another unoriginal preaching piece of crap"". But when you get Forrest Gump, the most genius movie ever that servers you all the above mentioned plus much much more in the most original, creative, imaginative, emotions-evoking way, you cavil and scorn it, say it is boring, implausible, ridiculous celebration of stupidity, has insidious offensive messages... Come on!<br/><br/>The superiority of this movie is how it makes a fictitious, fantastic, improbable story almost a believable one. But let's say you don't believe, ok. Then you go and look for messages, and what do you find? Right-wing/American Dream propaganda? Patronizing southern/black/rebel people? Go on, dig some more, miss the real gist. Miss the opportunity to see what's our world like through the eyes of an innate virtuous man lacking grudge, greed and falsity, miss true love, honesty, loyalty, friendship, miss the force to overcome personal catastrophes, miss the different meanings of life, destiny, miss the MOST ORIGINAL CHRONOLOGY of the well-known American history events... and much more. Make fun of the inspiring scenes such as the cross-country running (& many more), the excellent scenes of Forrest's effects on the history, the funny scenes such as the smiley-face, or other exciting ones... if I continue, I'll write here the whole script! Every scene is brilliant, just BRILLIANT! I for one just can't help myself from admiring the one who created this story, this plot. it IS unbelievable. Unbelievably amazing.<br/><br/>I won't detail my feelings and opinions about the movie, it's plot and symbols, it would be too much. I just hope all the people who patronize both the character of Forrest Gump and the spectators who loved the movie, will find also their EQ (Emotional Quotient), and place it somewhere beside their mighty IQ. Seriously, give it another chance from a different point of view. Please try.<br/><br/>P.S: I can accept (just to accept, not to understand, not to agree) the opinions of those who disliked the movie - but the only one I just can't GET is the claim that Tom Hanks got an easy oscar. I don't know whether or not it's easier to act retarded, but I think this role was one of the hardest ever, and Tom Hanks has done it superbly! Even when Hanks isn't talking, his facial impressions are speaking instead (e.g. the can-touch-a-robot scene where he asks about the intelligence of his son).. His performance is just too real to call it acting. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright are magnificent to."

","The first time I watched this movie, it passed straight over my head.  It takes time, to see what this film is all about.  The film is brilliant, because it starts of with a young boy, who is being told that he is not as good as the other children, because he isn't very clever.  His mum tells him he is as good as everyone else, and shouldn't feel inferior.  Forrest Gump uses his other talents and teaches by his mother to try his hardest at everything, and never looses faith and determination in anything that he did. This made him accomplish, so much when others would have thought he wouldn't do nothing with his life.<br/><br/>People may see this film as a sentimental piece of trash, that makes us feel sorry for a idiot.  If you say this then you are not getting out of the movie what you should be doing.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks is the nucleus of this movie, and played a brilliant part as Forrest.  I think Forrest, had a childlike innocence about him, which made him accomplish so much, because he only had the teachings of his mother to guide him in life, and he never saw the dangers, such has the war in Vietnam.<br/><br/>The movie can't help to move you, especially when his mum and girlfriend dies, and when he finds out he's a father.  The movie has a brilliant sound-track, and never has a boring lull, it moves at a brilliant pace, and keeps you wanting more.<br/><br/>I believe this is one of the great movies that has been made, because even though I am the biggest cynic of them all, even I cannot overlook the sheer brilliance, and imagination behind the movie.  This is a truly great movie that shouldn't be missed."

And I mean TONS!<br/><br/>The oh so famous feather scene...<br/><br/>The scene when Forrest is at Jenny's grave...<br/><br/>The scene when Forrest just finished running<br/><br/>Even his name Forrest has a meaning.<br/><br/>The movie itself holds the meaning that the measurment of success is not by intelligence and fame, it is by a simple notion of happiness. Forrest could be a million-air, but he is happy to mow the lawn for free.<br/><br/>There are many people I talk to don't understand this film. The reason is because they can't relate to it."
"baumer","10","1","4","9 July 1999"," 1994 was a great year for movies, this is one of the best
","There are certain films that people should just enjoy.  Forrest Gump is one of them.  It makes you feel good.  It makes you feel happy and it makes you appreciate what excellent film making is all about.  Simply put, this movie is pretty much flawless and it is a movie for the ages.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction was deserving of best picture and so was Shawshank Redemption, but only one of these fine three films could have won that year.  It is like watching the two best hockey teams playing in the Stanley Cup Finals.  It is the seventh game and we are now in triple overtime and the score is tied at 2.  One team will win the cup, and not necessarily because they are better than the other, but because someone has to win.  That was the case in 1994. I loved Pulp, and I loved Shawshank, but I loved Gump too and when it won I cheered out loud.  Good for Robert Zemekis.<br/><br/>What is so great about Forrest Gump is that it makes life a little more pure, a little more innocent.  Forrest never really quite understands what is going on around him and for that reason he lives life in the dark in some ways but in other ways, he sees so much more light than the rest of us. And his antics and the way he lives that life is an inspiration to the rest of us, or at least it should be.  And how can you not like the guy.  Is there a more likable character in the history of cinema?  I doubt it!<br/><br/>Robert Zemekis took me completely by storm when I first saw this film. Back To The Future was a great film and he has always shown that he has a propensity for box office gold, but to make a picture that was not only phenomenally successful at the box office but is this sweet and fun and heart warming, was not what I expected from him.  Then again, he is a Spielberg cronie, so that must mean something.<br/><br/>Zemekis is one of the strengths of this film, but the tour de force is really Hanks.  His adaptation of the character is remarkable.  He is ever so convincing and even though his work in Philedelphia was completely Oscar worthy, this is even a step above that.  I love him here and I will see anything that he is in from here on out.<br/><br/>I love movies.  I love what they do to me.  I love that they can make me feel a plethora of emotions.  Even when I despise a film, I can still look back and say that if anything it made me feel something.  But Forrest Gump is a microcosm of why I like movies.  My world is little better after I watch this movie and for that I am so glad that this film was made.  And for the people that can't enjoy this movie, I certainly hope that in the years to come you can.  Because you just don't know what you're missing."
"Kane-C","10","1","4","28 June 1999"," You gotta love him
","I can't think of any reason why someone would not like this movie. It seems to have just about everything you want: comedy, romance, action, tragedy... The script is simply ingenious, and Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is stunning. The humor is based on Forrest's dumbness and wonderful ""this is how [item] was created""- histories that show great imagination by the writers. One of the best movies I have ever seen."
"Primtime","9","1","4","14 June 1999"," Definitely Oscar-Worthy
","Forrest Gump is pure magic to watch. How anyone could say that this film is lacking in any way or that the hidden messages within render it to the garbage heap baffles me. Just the way that the film moves alone makes it great, you can toss out the story, performances and direction and Forrest Gump would still be miles ahead of the rest.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks gives a great performance in the title role (although Morgan Freeman was probably more deserving in the Shawshank Redemption). Hanks portrays the man with an I.Q. of 75 like few actors could and maintains this throughout the film. Just the way that Forrest stumbles through all of the great U.S. events from the 50's to the 80's and thinks nothing of it is an accomplishment in itself.<br/><br/>Zemekis did well making this film, just like the Back To The Future series. This film surely did not lack vision and all concepts are fresh and real for the time. Who would have ever thought that they could be placed in an interview with John Lennon? Well now thanks to Industrial Light and Magic, anyone can. Regardless what others may say about a weak or nonexistent ending, did the other 1994 favourite have one? Not really. This film is tied up about as well as possible with yet another coincedence.<br/><br/>I haven't a bad thing to say about this film and fully recommend to all.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."
"Forrest-15","10","1","4","5 June 1999"," Best Movie Ever Made
","I think this is the best movie ever made. I know many of you would disagree, but I really enjoyed this movie. There is more to this movie then what you see on the screen. The film shows how Forrest went through many important events, but the only thing he really wanted, Jenny, he couldn't have. This movie also shows that even though Forrest was slow, he had a lot of love in his heart. He wasn't intelligent, but he knew what love was.<br/><br/>What Tom Hanks did in this movie is incredible. He made up a character that so unbelievable but is so realistic. He did an extraordinary acting job, and that is why I think he's the best actor.<br/><br/>I think the best part of the movie is when Forrest stands next to Jenny's grave, and recites that speech. That part was wonderful. Especially when he says ""And our son, Forrest...He's just so smart Jenny. We go fishing together, we run together..."" It was great!"
"ToldYaSo","9","1","4","3 June 1999"," What can I say to those who didn't like it?
","""Forrest Gump"" is exactly the kind of film that has suffered from too much praise. As someone who genuinely loves this film, I am dumbfounded by those who hate it. But time after time, when a film receives high praise from a great number of people, it leaves high expectations for those who haven't seen it. The result is often disappointment.<br/><br/>Some people object to its unrealistic approach. Suggesting that the involvement of Forrest in some of America's pivotal moments in history is not only ridiculous but misleading. Another argument I've heard is the fact that a mentally handicapped individual could never attain the levels of success that Forrest does. They've missed out on a truly charming, endearing fairy tale that can help you look at life from a different approach, a simple one at that. And the dialogue is so inherently quotable, as the message behind it is so straightforward. ""Stupid is as stupid does"".<br/><br/>Forrest is a purely innocent, well-meaning individual, and there can be no fault found in him. It's the rest of the world that is realistic, impure, and flawed. And so, when Forrest hurts, we can't help but hurt for him, when he is successful, we can't help but be happy for him and when his heart breaks, ours breaks also.<br/><br/>I can't tell if it's the music, the cinematography or the acting, but the scene where young Forrest breaks free of his leg braces to escape the bullies on bicycles, gets me every time. Every single time. I've watched this film more times than I care to count, as I feel as though I should be watching something I've never seen before. But this film just makes me feel good, and I'll no doubt watch it again.<br/><br/>Now you see, I can't help but praise this film, and in a way I'm probably ruining it for someone else. My sister blames me for ruining it for her. It's not easy to forget what everyone's said, and the awards it has won. But if you haven't seen it already, just try and see it with fresh eyes, and open your mind to a very charming film."

He sees beauty in its most natural form and only sees with his heart.  He seems to find himself meeting famous people but doesn't even know about it.  Gump just sees them as people.  He doesn't care if they're Elvis Presley or Lyndon B Johnson.  He sees through their fame and sees the people behind the face.  This movie can be summed up by a quote by William Shakespeare: Life is a tale Told by an idiot. And that is exactly what this movie has to offer.  Just remember to bring the tissues..."

","Forrest Gump has probably the most original storyline ever told. Almost everyone I know has seen it and liked it one way or another. It is well known for its great biographical work, but it is better known for its story of the rising and falling period of America. It's like all the Oliver Stone films rolled into one, with a touch of romance and a humor which pokes fun at a time when no-one knew what the hell was going on with their country. I particularly liked the war scenes when it resembled many Vietnam War classics. But to put one genre summarising Forrest Gump, it has to be Romance, for the 40 year relationship between Jenny and Forrest has the most memorable scenes."
"Reviewer","10","1","4","10 March 1999"," The greatest movie ever made - and why it won the Oscars!!!
","A number of users have mentioned that The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) should have won the best picture Oscar over Forrest Gump (FG). This type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why FG actually won the Oscars!!! 1) The title Forrest Gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about FG as it first seems for the average viewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than FG. 2) FG is laughing at us as we laugh at him. We see him as abnormal, but when Forrest tries to understand us he finds out that normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. This is clearly shown with the short clips of political and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. This helps to prove FG case against normal people. 3) The movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time a viewer watches it they get a different version of what Forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature as a whole. Only Forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society. Forrest can't understand why normal people do this, as for me personally I agree with Forrest on this issue. 4) While Forrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but because some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. Yet it was the viewers who were silly as they see things through Forrest's eyes not their own. Equally the viewer misses many of the important aspects of the movies' message because they fail to go into Forrest's world and explore.<br/><br/>Misinterpretation that the viewer makes: 1) The running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking scenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he/she cannot think broadly. This scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever people because they seem to be doing something special. What Forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as every else. But we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) When Forrest is speaking at a rally against Vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without really understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) Jenny only realises that Forrest is the right person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character.<br/><br/>The Movie also shows how normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. Forrest does not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal. For me, this is the most innovative movie I have ever seen as it has duped the world to think it is about Forrest rather than themselves."

It's about a simpleton who knows what love, loyalty, family, and friendship are, and their importance in life. It's about those around him who come to realize that perhaps the simpleton has more of a clue as to what is TRULY important in life than they do.<br/><br/>Hanks' performance is excellent, as is Robin Wright's and Gary Sinise's.

","Critics of Forest Gump like to talk about the Hollywood schmaltz that covers the movie like frosting on a cake. The fact that Gump also came out at the same time as Pulp Fiction and received more attention than Tarantino's gem also tends to feed the fire of Gump opponents, who turn the situation into a Gump vs. Pulp scenario, when in fact, both movies deserve all the credit they can get. Gump is indeed hurt by the mainstream accolades bestowed upon it, but that should not take away from the fact that it was an original script that had some of the best acting you'll find. Few could argue that Hanks was sensational. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright were also fantastic in their roles as Lt. Dan and Jenny.

It's a great film, and Tom Hanks (Toy Story and 'You've got mail') plays Forrest amazingly. No wonder it got Oscars. It's a must see."
"gclapper","Null","1","4","27 September 2000"," 2 points regarding the power of this film
","I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160 reviews of this film that I just read on this site.<br/><br/>1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For accessible examples, read many of the reviews for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly moving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV, you might think that sarcasm is the natural idiom of communication.  But then, when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something (other than self-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.<br/><br/>We have forgotten that sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be able to distance ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But sarcasm cannot assert anything except its derision of someone else's assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is without sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving experience, opening us to a vision of life where there is something to believe in, and not just something to mock.<br/><br/>This is not a question of Gump's (low) intelligence, though our culture often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It is about a desire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of life honestly lived in adherence to values worth striving after.  Hence, all we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile who lives a life of loyalty and love.<br/><br/>2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few jokes, but the whole point of it detonates in the penultimate scene where Forrest talks to Jenny's grave.  He asks ""Is it Lieutenant Dan who is right, or is it Momma?"" (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all fated in a predeterministic way or if we are truly free to make our own destiny.  His answer--""I think its both""--rings true for many people, and hence is a powerful comment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged, and that speaks to me.<br/><br/>The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in strategic places.  God's grace works within the context of our human freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace."

Every once in a while, I'll also see a film the the entire American public has enjoyed and disliked through the years gone by. Among those is FORREST GUMP, which proved Tom Hanks as an acclaimed dramatic actor. The tale of a young man living through the life and times is among the many landmarks existing in cinema today. No one understood that the nostalgic visuals and props (plus the legless Gary Sinise) were actually real and not copied or duplicated, meaning an Oscar winner. It is both funny, serious, and heartbreaking for one entire movie, but it isn't labeled as a ""comedy"" like many have called it. The film greatly shows Hanks maturity after his comical heydays, and it continues on. It also shows the way past generations of time are reborn in this present, but disillusioned era. FORREST GUMP is a bona fide genuine classic that will stick around in future generations to come. I ADMIT IT!"
"jminer","10","1","4","26 July 2000"," Story of a nation
","Despite the title, it's not the story of Forrest Gump, blank slate; it's a story told by Forrest Gump, clear mirror.  And the story he reflects is of America and its journey through the late 20th century, its failings and its growth. It isn't a totally glorious story.  Nor is it the story of wealthy, clever people (and their shrinks) from the cities - that's for the Woody Allens of the world, and their admittedly important and valuable studies of interior worlds.  This is an expansive survey of what makes America what it is.  Zemeckis's answer is the nearest thing to Frank Capra's deeply democratic concept of America as a collection of ordinary, not-too-bright, people who are sometimes misled by their ""leaders"", sometimes beguiled into temptation, who make mistakes but collectively stumble and fumble to a generally benign destination guided by wisdom and good intentions that few of them possess consistently as individuals but which comprise the collective sum of their histories. Tom Hanks must be a genius to play the Everyman, Mr America.  It seemed to be the role Dennis Weaver was destined for after Duel; it's the role Dennis Hopper achieved once in Easy Rider; it's the role Gary Cooper and James Stewart filled in Capra's films; but none of them had to carry quite so much of a film as Hanks does here."

","Goodness gracious, I discovered that I hadn't commented on this movie yet! Well, it's to be rectified.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump was an absolute favorite of mine for several years, it still ranks among the top ten movies of all time. It is brilliant, a true gem that will undoubtedly become a classic. It already IS a classic, actually. At least in my book.<br/><br/>Though it differs from the book - or should I say it has nothing to do with the book by Winston Groom at all except for the name Forrest Gump and ping-pong - it has an almost literary quality to it: it's the kind of epic and insane saga one can find in one. The life and adventures of Forrest Gump are a modern equivalent of Munchausen, but this time around, the liar tells the truth. Forrest Gump is a perfect human being, a bit on the slow side, I'll admit - but he is honest, he is righteous and he never wants to do anyone any harm.<br/><br/>This film is also a meandering look at modern American history, it's politics and society, and the distance that Forrest himself sets between the events and actually understanding them is the kind of distance we all feel sometimes - or want to feel more often. His ability to walk away unscathed from any happening is one I sure would like to have.<br/><br/>I short put, this film is one I will remember for the rest of my life."

It's a fictious character and a fictious plot, but if I haven't known that, I would have said that I believe that the film is based on a true story with a few adaptions and plot point changes. Eventhough Forrest goes through the most unplausible situations one can go through.<br/><br/>I doubt that anyone will observe life the same way after seeing this movie. A lot of them will say that the movie was stupid and overdone, but deep inside they'll remember it forever. The promotional tagline of the movie truly is the point of it and its message. That's what the creators accomplished, and in such an unexpected and unique way that you really start to wonder was the quality of this movie maybe reached by a complete accident. The tagline and the feather prove that it wasn't.<br/><br/>I find `Forrest Gump' original, intelligent, wise, sly, balanced, complex, heartwarming, unbelievably dynamic, witty in one-of-a-kind manner, endlessly touching and enchanting, extraordinary and magical.

"Chuck-149","6","1","4","18 January 2000"," The biggest thief I've ever seen.
","I know my one line summary might not be that clear so I'm going to explain it to you.  In  1994, we had classics like ""The Shawshank redemption"" and ""Pulp fiction"" who were in nomination at the Oscars and were stolen in every category in which they were nominated.  They were all stolen by ""Forrest Gump"".  These two other movies which were completely different in their style from the movies of the same genre as them but who came before them were completely over-looked.  And the worst part is ""Forrest Gump"" is simply the biography of Forest Gump.  Also, it robbed every movie in the best actor category.  Of course it isn't that easy to play someone who is mentally ill but it's easier than playing just some ordinary person and playing it well.<br/><br/>  Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) lives with his mother and comes from North-West Alabama.  However, he has a slight mental deficiency and a leg problem for which he must wear a brace.  When he starts going to school, he is rejected by everyone except the bus-driver and a young girl named Jenny.  One day after school, while Forrest and jenny are hanging together, they are surprised by a bunch of boys from their school who start throwing rocks at Forrest.  He tries to run away but because of his bad leg, he can hardly get away.  This is the classic scene when Jenny yells ""Run Forrest, run."" and as he runs, his brace starts to come off and the boys who were chasing him are unable to catch up to him for he is too fast, even though they have bikes.<br/><br/>  As the years pass, Forrest and Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) go their own way. Forrest gets into the army and goes to Vietnam.  But one night in the camp, all the soldiers are in bed and pass on a Playboy magazine.  When Forrest gets it, he realizes Jenny has her photograph in it.  Further on during the war, he saves the life of his lieutenant named Don Taylor (Gary Sinise) but loses his best friend Bubba.  Also, his lieutenant is left legless because of the accident whereas the only Forrest gets is a bullet in the butt.  When Forrest gets home, he as many things to do.  On of them is to go over to Bubba's parents' house to announce to them he was killed in combat.  Another thing he does is try to find Jenny.<br/><br/>  The movie is a kind of comedy-drama and is pretty good.  But I still don't think nor understand how it won best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks) and best director (Robert Zemeckis) at the Oscars. I mean, if it had really deserved those Oscars, wouldn't it get a higher rank than both ""Pulp fiction"" and ""The Shawshank redemption"" on our top 250 list?  I actually believe that the one who deserved an Oscar more than anyone else in the movie is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Don Taylor.  However, it was almost impossible for him to win that year because we had Martin Landau in nomination for best supporting actor in ""Ed Wood"" and he truly deserved the Oscar he won.  So all in all, this isn't a bad movie, it's just way too over-rated."
"avocadess","2","1","5","16 September 2019"," All these years later I can't wrap my head around why people loved this film
","Yes, there were a few good moments, and a few interesting cuts from old newsreels of the past in U.S. history, but that is not enough to make a good movie.<br/><br/>There is nothing that ruins a movie for me more than miscasting. Clearly most viewers would disagree with me, but I found Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forest Gump entirely unconvincing. ""Acting dumb"" throughout a movie and talking slow does not make for a great portrayal. Juliette Lewis did a GREAT job as a mentally challenged or disabled person in ""The Other Sister."" I thoroughly enjoyed her performance, so don't go thinking I just don't like ""slow"" people. I just really, really disliked Hanks' rendition of the character.<br/><br/>Another character in the film who had a lot less screen time still riled me: Sally Field -- as Forest Gump's mother?! Listen. Sally is young-looking for her age, always has been, and in fact it would be biologically impossible for her to be Hanks' mother since she is only 10 years older than him. Add to that her youthful appearance and I'd believe her in a role as Hanks' younger sister better than as his mother!<br/><br/>Lastly, Robin Wright. The character she played was totally unbelievable to me. Enough said on that.<br/><br/>I DID enjoy the performance of Mykelti Williamson (who played Bubba, the guy who loves shrimp so much), but his accent was way off to this viewer who grew up part of my life near the Louisiana border.<br/><br/>All in all, it's one of the worst movies ever -- and convinced me that the overall movie-viewing public has very different taste in films than me!"

","""Forrest Gump"" was the ""big film"" of 1994, being both a huge commercial success and the winner of six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor for Tom Hanks. It tells the story of a man and his journey through life, and is told using a framework device in which the title character narrates his life-story to a succession of people seated next to him at a bus stop.<br/><br/>Forrest is a young man from Alabama, probably born some time during the 1940s, although the timeline is rather confusing. He suffers from what would today be described as ""learning difficulties"", although his athletic abilities win him a place in college on a football scholarship. The film follows him though his college days and his time in the Army during the Vietnam War, where he is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism in saving the lives of several members of his platoon.<br/><br/>After leaving the Army, Forrest becomes a leading ping-pong player, playing against Chinese teams in ""ping-pong diplomacy"". (The sport is always referred to as ""ping-pong"" in the film, even though its players normally prefer ""table-tennis""). He then goes into the shrimping business and, more by luck than judgement, ends up making a fortune, becoming head of the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company"", named after himself and an Army friend killed in the war. (In a curious example of reality imitating fiction, there now actually is a seafood restaurant chain of that name). On a whim, Forrest decides to go for a run, and ends up running for three and a half years, crossing America from coast to coast several times during that period.<br/><br/>A feature of the film is its hero's meetings with the great and the good; he gets to meet three Presidents (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and other celebrities such as Elvis Presley and John Lennon. These scenes were achieved not by using actors but rather by using special effects to insert images of Tom Hanks into old television and newsreel footage. One of its Oscars was for Best Visual Effects. Such effects seem to be a common feature of Zemeckis' films; others such as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""What Lies Beneath"" are also notable for creative use of CGI.<br/><br/>Contrasting with Forrest's story is that of the great love of his life, his childhood sweetheart Jenny. Whereas he leads an essentially conservative lifestyle, she embraces the counterculture of the sixties, all radical politics, drugs and promiscuous sex. Eventually she marries Forrest while suffering from a mysterious virus (presumed to be HIV, but never named in the film as such), and dies shortly afterwards.<br/><br/>This contrast has led to political controversy and to allegations that the film promotes conservative values. The conservative simpleton prospers, whereas the left-wing intellectual does not. The wages of radicalism are death. Certainly, the film takes the standard liberal line on issues such as racial integration and the Vietnam war, but by 1994 these issues lay two decades in the past. Culturally, its politics are much more conservative. Hanks's dictum that ""the film is non-political and thus non-judgemental"" has never convinced me. There is, for example, a lot of satire at the expense of the perceived hypocrisies of the hippie movement, such as Jenny's boyfriend who is against violence in Vietnam but not in his private life, regularly beating her up.<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" was one of the films in which Hanks, seen in the eighties primarily as a comedy star, managed to reinvent himself as a serious actor in the nineties, and brought him his the second of his two successive ""Best Actor"" Oscars. He is certainly good here, much better than he was in, say, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" or ""A League of Their Own"", two earlier films in which he had tried to take on more serious roles. He plays Forrest as a sort of holy fool, a man whose simplicity allows his inner goodness and decency to shine through. The character became something of a cult hero, and some of his nuggets of cracker-barrel philosophy, such as ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get"" have passed into popular culture. (In fact, most chocolate manufacturers provide a guide to their selections, so you always know exactly what you're gonna get, but we'll let that pass).<br/><br/>The film itself is a reasonably good one, even if its morality as sometimes rather simplistic, using Forrest's holy fool persona as a means of commenting on the politics and culture of late 20th century America. Zemeckis manages the difficult feat of pulling off a delicate balancing act between comedy and tragedy without the resulting mixture ever seeming incongruous. Yet I have never regarded it as the best film of 1994, being merely a good film in a year which saw a number of very good, even great, ones such as ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Madness of King George"", ""La Reine Margot"" and ""Nell"" (which would have been my personal choice for ""Best Picture""). Hanks' performance is good, but not as good as Nigel Hawthorne's in ""King George"". I suspect that the film's immense success may have been due less to its merits than to the way in which its perceived conservatism fitted the public mood in 1994, the year of the so-called Republican Revolution which saw the Republicans take control of both Houses of Congress. 7/10"

The other thing was that Forrest Gump was so low on the top 250 list. I think it should be in the top 20, right up there with Goodfellas, but it's not!! Tom Hanks basically had a star turning role in this film. It's one of his best performances to date and he didn't even make the top 20?

","I've written over two hundred reviews, I never wrote one for this film. I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.<br/><br/>Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role. I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is special. In a weird way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldn't want anybody rushing to see me.<br/><br/>The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is comparable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny ""Cause you're my girl"" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says ""I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now"", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.<br/><br/>I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too.

In fact, Forrest's emotional IQ is much higher than most people's even though he is intellectually retarded. We can all learn from Forrest that big brains don't guarantee happiness. He is stupid, yes, but he is probably the happiest character in this film because of all the complexities of life he is unable to understand.<br/><br/>A perfect example: when Jenny tells FG he doesn't know what love is when they're standing by the bridge.

It takes serious things and turns them into an educational, comical and more dramatic version of history itself. The film uses characters like Bubba and Forests drill seargent to really take this film to new levels. Forest himself represents the naive child looking at the world as an uneducated person without the real wisdom of his age group. To watch this film as a child is probably the best thing that you can do. You feel almost as if you are forest instaed of just pitying him like most people do. I think the point of the film is to show that through the eyes of a child the world, and whatever difficulties it is facing, really can seem magical if you just look at things without the educated colour that we see today. Forrest has an ability to look at things more plainly and more black and white that others do. I think that for this reason this film should be the best film ever. After people have watched the film it has the impact of empathy on it's imeidiate audience so that for ten minutes after the film everyone feels together and unified.

The worst instance was when Forrest Gump tells the audience that his sweetheart Jenny's father loves her a lot, always hugging and kissing her.  In my theater, a raucous, cynical snicker rippled through the audience at that line; we are intended to conclude from that statement that Jenny's father is sexually abusing her, and Zemeckis later confirms this leap to a sick conclusion.  It is a truly sad commentary both on the entertainment industry and on the viewing public at large that the very concept of fatherhood today is so disrespected that for a father to hug and kiss his daughter is taken per se as a sign of sexual abuse.<br/><br/>Jenny's character is so despicable that Gump's love for her is inexplicable. Perhaps it is intended as an example of really ""unconditional"" love, and shows what a sorry thing that kind of love is, much like the wife who clings to an abusive husband no matter what he does to her.  Her character hits rock bottom when, having abandoned Gump like a used-up tissue and taken his child from him without even informing him, Jenny refuses even to apologize to him because she was ""messed up.""  Gump swallows this excuse with stomach-turning ease.<br/><br/>Now I don't want to launch into some Pat-Robertson-like tirade on the decline of American morality.  American morality is better today than in the past in many ways.  Racial hatred has gone from being an accepted norm to being absolutely intolerable.  Rape is blamed on the victim less frequently than in bygone days.  Sexual double standards are being abandoned. Religious tolerance and inter-faith amity are on the upswing.  But in some other ways, American morality is deteriorating, and this one excuse, ""I was messed up,"" is perhaps the best example.  Every kind of barbarism, from Jenny's cruel and heartless manipulation of Gump up to and including cold-blooded murder, is now excused with the phrase ""I was messed up,"" followed by an endless litany of the wrongdoer's misfortunes.  FORREST GUMP wantonly tries to widen this tear in the fabric of the viewers' moral thought.  I'm not buying into it.  Being ""messed up"" may excuse viciousness against the person who messed you up; it should never be allowed to justify hurting innocent people.<br/><br/>The movie's exploitation of the mentally handicapped for cheap laughs is also tasteless and vulgar (and yes, I will shamefacedly admit, I laughed at some of this exploitation).  I may not want a mental deficient like Gump for an airline pilot, but he deserves to be treated with at least basic decency and courtesy, which this movie doesn't; (i.e. where Gump, shaking Richard Nixon's hand, says ""I gotta pee.""  This is funny?).<br/><br/>The mitigating, if not the saving, virtue of FORREST GUMP is the acting. Tom Hanks' rendition of a speech impediment might not fool the parent of a mentally retarded child or a speech pathologist, but it certainly convinced me and the average moviegoer.  Hanks generates the innocence and pleasantness required of the character, and while the voice grated on my nerves a few times, it was bearable.  Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan Taylor is absolutely wonderful, oozing bitterness and cynicism from every pore.<br/><br/>I also give FORREST GUMP some grudging praise for being one of the few movies to use the wonders of modern digital special effects to actually drive the plot, rather than distract from it.  TITANIC and JURASSIC PARK also broke some ground, but for the most part I think that most directors lack the imagination to get the most out of the potential of modern special effects.  Zemeckis integrates the effects into his movies more smoothly than most directors have.<br/><br/>I didn't really hate FORREST GUMP.  It obviously wants to be loved so much that hating it would be like kicking an annoying puppy.  But it's morally obtuse, shallow and vulgar.  The laughs are guilty laughs, and the philosophy is nothing deeper than the credo that God does indeed look after fools.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of ****."

","Forrest Gump will be a forever timeless movie. There is much to love about this film and it fully deserves its place as one of the altime top movies around. I've been reading some imdb reviews and most agree.<br/><br/> Of coarse Hanks was magnificent-when I think of Forrest I don't think of him as even being a movie character, he was so lifelike. I guess thats the mark of a great actor when they can create a character that lives forever in our hearts.<br/><br/> This movie had an innocence about it-an idealism that I loved-I loved watching the changing face of the country as time went by and I thought Robin Wright Penn was also magnificent-Some people have mentioned the movieis not true to life. Isn't it? Every day there's another story about someone who makes it against all odds. I'm not saying the things that happen to forrest happen to all these people-but -in a time when most ""news stories"" are about violence and crime and people who DON'T make it-occasionally one hears the stories of hope-people who aren't given all or ANY the breaks who SOMEHOW-have the strength and perseverence to carve out their own niche. Unfortunately, the reason we don't hear these stories that much is because they aren't given the attention they should get. I had heard once(don't know if this is 100 percent accurate) about a newspaper or magazine that once only reported about good and remarkable occurences-and wound up going out of business! Oh well....<br/><br/> The point is, I think this movie is VERY  important because it has the ability to inspire. And in the times we live in that is always a good thing."
"scarecrow72","1","1","7","27 March 2019"," the most overrated movie of all time
","This has to be the most overrated movie of all time. How it won Best Picture over Shawhank Redemption is a mystery. I was bored with this movie. If it had been presented as a fantasy that everything that happened was only in his mind, it *might* have been worth rating as a 2, but it was still a terrible movie. One of the worst movies ever made."
"trminator-35198","4","1","8","17 January 2019"," Rather overrated
","The film trys to be an emotional comedy and it just doesnt work. The character is not cutesy the story is just sad which gets worse during the attempts at humor the characters are equally sad. This movie is the equivalent of a suicide note with an attempt at comedy relief."
"TMC-4","Null","1","8","27 February 2000"," At Times Fascinating and Informative but Also Considerably Offensive
","Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While these scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people essentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this can also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The storytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a certain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be found here and there.  At one point, there's a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based on the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out of people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur based on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key fashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are discussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more necessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you the wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for instance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story."
"BeatrixKiddomark1","3","1","10","7 July 2011"," Another reason why I don't like Robert Zemeckis
","Despite the 8.7 average rating on IMDb, the many praising reviews it receives and the good opinions of my friends, I wasn't really expecting this film to be anything special. However as it is such a highly regarded film, I thought it was probably worth watching, even if I wasn't going to enjoy it. Why I knew I wasn't going to enjoy it; it won six ocars but other films that were also released that year have since become more well loved (e.g. pulp fiction, the shawshank redemption), I'm not a really big fan of Tom Hanks as an actor (shock horror!) and Robert Zemeckis is definitely my least favourite director, creating films that (in my opinion anyway) have no real aim other than to make some cash. So how did it compare to my pre-judgements? Just as I thought really. There were many problems I found in this movie; to start with the camera angles and the camera movement made the film hard to look at visually, as the people and object moving looked very unnatural. Another problem is that aside from Forrest, all of the characters seem one dimensional as they were all extremely underwritten. Leading on from that, for me, the script is a major problem; the dialogue is incredibly tedious, every line made me sigh with frustration, but that isn't the main problem with the dialogue; I watched the film with friends and every few seconds I heard them laughing at the things Forrest says, however that's something I couldn't get into, I felt that there is something very malicious about laughing at a man with some kind of mental handicap. Though the dialogue isn't the only problem with the script, the whole story is beyond unrealistic. Although it isn't unlikely for someone to drift through life and for things to just happen to them, it is unlikely for the majority of them to be such good and life changing things, especially for a man with a mental disability, from a non-privileged background, at this time period. I also find it a little bit sneaky that they never mention what is wrong with Forrest, it seems to be they did this so they could include some parts of the plot, for example him having sex with Jenny and they her having a child, that I doubt would happen in real life to people in his condition. However, none of this is exactly enraging for me, the only thing that really makes my blood boil, is the Vietnam sequence. Films that have been made about the Vietnam war have been made with the soul purpose to let audiences know, that war is hell and war will destroy you, but Forrest's narration tells us that his experience in Vietnam was fun, which goes against everything films like Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now stand for and aside from a few seconds of footage, nothing shows the horrors of the war, it's unrealistic and highly insulting to the people who fought in the war. Though as I have given it 3/10, there obviously must be a few plus points, there are about three. The effects that put Forrest in with archive footage and very well done and well edited, Gary Sinise is very good in an underwritten part, the fact he didn't win an Oscar is a travesty and there are some huggable children in it. Though that doesn't make up for the obvious flaws in this movie."

","Every liberal ought to see this movie and have their faith restored in America. Forrest Gump starts running after kicking off his braces left from a polio infection and never stops. His task is to overcome his borderline IQ, 75, just below the edge of normalcy and his trek takes him on a course through the Vietnam Era, the war, the unrest and the post - Vietnam malaise.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie for a liberal to reinforce the twin pillars of liberalism: (a) universal guilt shared by all except liberals and (b)moral superiority of liberalism.<br/><br/>On such sublime matters, Forrest Gump however is clueless. He thinks of the Vietnam War as a long walk in the jungle and he's waiting on a check for 'the million dollar wound' that got him out of the combat zone. He visits the White House to receive a medal and inadvertently addresses a peace rally the same day.<br/><br/>He never loses sight of his objective his true love Jenny who has turned away from values of any kind and embraced the drug culture of the Vietnam era. As much as Forrest is guilty of living in wishful thinking so too are the admirers of this movie.<br/><br/>As I see our liberal friends watching this with moist eyes, they're living in the delusion that just somewhere there must be legions of young men like Bubba and Forrest ready to go over yonder as clueless as Forrest.<br/><br/>I gave this film a ""3"" because I did enjoy the liberal world's perception of people on the outside of its snobbish feeling of moral superiority."

","Forrest Gump didn't do it for me.
I'd like to say it's because it wasn't what I expected, but I didn't go in with any particular expectations, other than the endlessly over-quoted ""Life was like a box of chocolates"" and ""Run, Forrest, run!"" I didn't go in with any elements of the plot in my mind; I was completely blind and open-minded.
The film I watched failed to hold my attention. Part of the reason why the top films of all time are so endearing are because the creative team behind them have successfully manipulated the viewer to care deeply about the characters, enough to invest a little bit of themselves into those characters.
Forrest Gump didn't really have that. The movie, for the most part, is about a guy sitting on a park bench telling the story of his life. Which is fine in theory, but until the last 20 minutes or so, it doesn't feel like it's building to anything. It's just a guy telling his story and, although the ending of the film wraps it all up nicely, there's an awfully sizeable chunk of film to set through that doesn't give much of an impression of a purpose, which made it a major headache and tedious watch for me.

","Although this is set in a different era, it draws heavily upon Peter Sellers' masterpiece performance in ""Being There"" (1979). So much is identical to what Sellers' character, ""Chauncey Gardner"" becomes in ""Being There"". Tragically, Sellers died the following year at age 54. Regardless, Forrest Gump is well deserving of the excellent reception it receiv ed; both critically and at the box office. However, to this day, I cannot compare to the superiority of Sellers comedic skills. Most people agree he was the greatest comedic actor of the 20th Century, and that includes me. Having been cast in 2 Stanley Kubrick films: ""Lolita"" (1962) and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) shows how much respect he got from the master of all directors (Kubrick). While making Dr. Strangelove, he plays 4 different roles, including the eponymous Dr. Strangelove. Kubrick was ""rolling on the floor with laughter; egging Peter Sellers on to even higher heights"", as Christiane Kubrick said on the DVD or Bluray discs. So this is why I don't give ""Gump"" a higher rating; the writers and director ripped off ""Being There""; plain and simple."

Elvis Presley's dancing routine which a childhood Gump inadvertently introduces to the King whilst limping in leg braces.<br/><br/>2. Serving in the bloody battlefields of the Vietnam War. Single handedly rescuing half his platoon and introducing fascinating characters including his wounded Platoon Lieutenant Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise).<br/><br/>3. Meeting several U.S. Presidents including JFK as a member of his college football team, and Richard Nixon when being awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
In the process witnessing the Watergate break in whilst staying at the Watergate Hotel at the recommendation of Nixon!<br/><br/>4. His 'love' interest throughout the film Jenny Curran contracting an incurable virus in the early 1980s after a lifestyle of drug addiction? AIDS?<br/><br/>5. A segment including a TV interview with the late John Lennon.<br/><br/>It was funny seeing Gump interwoven into old footage of famous people from the past 40 years or so.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemekis, the man who brought Back To The Future to cinema audiences was behind this film and crowd pleasing elements of that film can be seen in Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks delivers a great performance showing and narrating Forrest Gump's life on a bus stop bench to fascinated passers by.<br/><br/>The running time actually goes quite fast.

","Let me start with the aspects of the film I like. Hanks' performance is utterly believable and touching. He makes Forrest seem utterly believable and sympathetic in spite of the cognitive challenges the man faces. The emotional climax of the story-Forrest visiting a person's grave-is very moving and it gives the appearance of grace to the entire film. Likewise, Forrest the character is a unique take on an American life and at least on the basic level of nostalgia I can get beyond his story. Lt. Dan and Jenny, to a far lesser degree, are also good characters. Apart from that there isn't much to like about this film.<br/><br/>The main problem is the film has a cheap homespun conservatism to it that feels utterly banal and hateful to the social upheavals and yes progress of the 60's-70's. The film goes out of its way-literally at times-to mute liberal messages and its treatment of leftists (dysfunctional all according to the film) is off putting. It is not so much wrong as unbelievably disconnected to the history. Jenny's fate is especially cringe inducing in light of this aspect.<br/><br/>Technically the film hasn't aged well. The special effects to insert Forrest into archival footage doesn't really work anymore. The feather looks really fake at the beginning of the film as well. It is a little baffling that this beat out 4 great films at the Oscars."

","Forrest Gump is one of the most iconic movies in the 20th century. It contains some of the most famous quotes such as, ""Run Forrest, Run!"", ""My mama said life is like a box of chocolates"", and my personal favorite: ""JENNYYYY"". Also, no other movie in history has spurred the creation of a successful, themed food chain. However, these reasons are not what makes, Forrest Gump, the best movie ever created. The bildungsroman movie, Forrest Gump, is the greatest movie ever created in the 20th century because of its ability to transcend nearly all levels of society and how it effectively critiques each of them.
 Forrest Gump explores Southern society in an unique way. Following Forrest's early life, we get a glimpse into what life was like in the South for a mentally challenged young man with a single mother. Forrest's mother is well off and has a large estate. We see that his mother cares for him, despite his handicaps. She, ""convinces"" the principal to allow Forrest to enter a school known for academics. Also, she never fails to remind Forrest that he isn't dumb, but that he is special. Forrest's mother is a caring woman who will do anything to see that her son succeeds in life. This caring relationship contrasts with Jenny's family. Jenny comes from a house with an alcoholic, abusive father. They both live in an old, small, rundown house. She consistently runs away and hides from her father. This displays the vast socio-economic differences in the South. There are families who have ""old money"" and live in large estates with housekeepers and groundskeepers and who speak with ""Southern sophistication"". On the other hand, there are people who are living in poverty and who have extremely dysfunctional families. The insight into Southern culture was so realistic, that viewers did not even think about the inaccuracies the depictions could have portrayed; the performance was spot on. Southern culture has influenced Forrest Gump's character and how he reacts to the military culture in the next stage of his life.
 According to the movie, military culture in the 1970s is a combination of intensity and relaxation. When Forrest steps on to the bus going to boot camp, he is immediately greeted by a screaming bus driver. At boot camp, a drill sergeant hollers explicit words and intimidates the new recruits. He eventually stands inches in front of Forrest and asks him what is his (Forrest) purpose in the army. After Forrest responds, the sergeant yells, ""... That is the most outstanding answer I have heard. You must have a goddamn IQ of 160"". He then marches off barking orders to the rest of the group. Forrest matches his intensity by also yelling at the top of his lungs. This portrays the military as an inhospitable environment only for the strong-willed. It is the stereotypical depiction of boot camp. However, upon arrival at Vietnam, Forrest and his best friend, Bubba, realize that Vietnam was nothing like they had expected. Men were barbecuing meats, smoking cigarettes, and having a grand time. They eventually meet Lieutenant Dan; Lieutenant Dan is a laid back and shirtless officer who shows them around camp. It somewhat startled Forrest and Bubba, as this was not what they had expected. This depiction of soldiers who are relaxing heavily contrasts with the earlier depiction from boot camp. The contrast symbolizes the public belief surrounding Vietnam during the 1970s. In the beginning of the war, society believed that Americans were doing a good job and keeping peace: paralleling Forrest and Bubba's preliminary thoughts on what Vietnam was going to be like. However, soldiers were misusing their time and were being reckless with the supplies paid for by taxpayers. When Forrest exits the war, he is eventually sucked into anti-war protest, in which the viewer is able to experience the counter-war culture.
 The director portrays the hippie/anti-war culture as fervent and almost hypocritical. Forrest meets Jenny at an anti-war rally and he is invited to see what goes on during the planning of these rallies. Jenny's boyfriend is a high ranking ""officer"" in his anti-war organization. Upon arrival, Forrest sees a boardroom with plans, just like those in military offices. Also, the black panthers, an African-American radical group, also joins the anti-war planning. Every single person in the room has a burning passion to end the war, just as the soldiers had a burning passion to get home as well. The protestors were ""anti-war"" and ""anti-violence"", however, they were very aggressive when talking about the war. Also, Jenny's boyfriend hits her, which triggers Forrest to attack him. Forrest and Jenny are subsequently kicked out. The anti-war movement was portrayed in a negative light, despite their intentions. Though they wanted to be the opposite of the military, the counter-war movement to be quite similar to the military. They had a similar hierarchy and same fervent passion. The protestors want to promote peace, but they still showed aggression.. The anti-war protestors are essentially hypocrites.
 Forrest Gump is the greatest movie ever created because of its unique perspective on society in the 1970's. No other movie has captured the human experience as accurately as this movie has. It's perspective spans from the rich to the poor, and from Vietnam war supporters to the counter-war movement. Through the eyes of Forrest, we see into the southern, military, and anti-war cultures. We see how a young man raised in the south with good morals, survives the military, and faces the hypocritical anti-war protestors. Forrest Gump is not only a heartwarming movie about a mentally challenged man who is able to miraculously influence 1970s society, but also, a film masterpiece due to how it critiques the cultures within society, through which Forrest transcends."

","The soundtrack boasts a variety of sounds of the era - perhaps too wide a variety. Often, music can be useful in establishing a mood, but Forrest Gump rockets into the realm of overkill. There are sequences when the choice of song is inspired (the use of ""Running on Empty"" for Forrest's ""long run"" comes to mind), but the soundtrack could have used a little pruning. There are times when it seems as much designed to sell CDs as to cement the setting. Ultimately, however, any such gripes about Forrest Gump are minor."

","Oh boy, Forrest Gump. One of many ""big films"" that permeated the 90s. You know the type; big, historical drama/romance films with epic scale, sets, CGI and all the things that used to make the Academy wet themselves.<br/><br/>Much like so many of these films (Titanic being another example) this is a film that pairs great directing and cinematography...only to completely forget about things like ""script"" and ""characters"". You know, the things that make for great, long-lasting films.<br/><br/>Like I said previously, the directing, cinematography and visuals in general are excellent. In fact, they're the star of the show. The problems come from other sources. The script is both weak and melodramatic, barely allowing for actual character-building between each pop culture reference. Not to mention the fact that it's unbearably sappy and pretentious.<br/><br/>The characters...Jesus. Forrest is not endearing. Or funny. Or engaging. He's just frustratingly dumb, showing little character development over the entire movie. Jenny, meanwhile, is a CENSORED. There some interesting characters in the movie (Lieutenant Dan), but all them are relegated to the sidelines in favor of our unlikable protagonists.<br/><br/>The film mostly makes up for this with its incredible VFX and directing. I'll even admit that the story itself is actually good and there's obviously talent behind this thing. But much like James Cameron with you-know-what, Zemeckis' talents are being wasted on this melodramatic script and terrible characters."

","Forrest Gump has come to be my favorite movie of all time. There is something genuinely hypnotic about the way this movie was shot and directed. Everything from the beautiful sweeping landscapes, the silent, reflective pauses, the nostalgic feel, Alan Silvestri's majestic score to the fantastic casting and acting that make this movie an epic landmark in filmmaking. <br/><br/>There are a lot of unique touches in this movie that I used to take for granted. I love the Rockwellian portrayal of small-town America with rear view silhouettes of Forrest and Jenny sitting by the lake. The scene where birds fly from the cornfield as the camera floats away from young Forrest and Jenny. A legless Lt. Dan swims off into the sunset after thanking Forrest for saving his life. The shot of Forest and Jenny hugging in the center of the pool at the Washington Monument and many others are all small moments that make this film truly magical. <br/><br/>Forest Gump conveys a powerful message that explores ideas about our fallen nature, personal gratitude, and forgiveness. How often do directors make movies anymore that explore themes of religious matters like God, morality, or destiny? The Christ to humanity relationship between Forrest and Jenny is brilliant and subtly portrayed in the film. <br/><br/>Forest Gump is indeed a one of a kind film. Everyone should take time to revisit and watch it again with a fresh slate. Forget about all the hype and watch it for what it is; A timeless masterpiece that many have lost appreciation for."
"katiecaswell","10","0","1","22 May 2018"," Forrest Gump Review
","Forrest Gump (1994), in my opinion, is one of the greatest films of all time. It is full of really great characters, many memorable lines and teaches an important message. Tom Hanks who played Forrest, a loveable, simple, yet not so intelligent man, delivered a great performance as per usual. Forrest shows a new outlook and meaning of life and how we should live in the moment as we follow the many adventures throughout his life. Director, Robert Zemeckis' fun and impressive special effect skills can also be seen throughout the film, but especially when Forrest is interacting with many historical figures such as John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and John Lennon. While Forrest didn't actually encounter these people, CGI was used to insert him into old clips of these historical figures and their mouths were adjusted to look like they were saying something else. It's something that made the movie so much more captivating and realistic. Forrest's simple and innocent personality makes it much more enjoyable as he seems to just stumble into all the major historical events during that time. Overall, the film balances drama, comedy, and romance very well, and I would highly recommend seeing it."

","I really don't think you're looking carefully at Forrest Gump. Every scene plays like the most important part of the movie. He gets smarter and smarter from listening to his mom and Jenny. The feather symbolizes his life since he floats through life accidentally and realized that at Jenny's gravestone when he said ""I don't know if Momma was right or Lt. Dan. I don't know if we all have a destiny or if we're all floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both. Maybe both things are happening at the same time."" It's also a movie of many genres ranging from comedy, drama, political, action, adventure, musical, etc. I loved everything about it because of the concept that one person can accomplish so many things."

","During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.<br/><br/>In ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.<br/><br/>Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.<br/><br/>In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed ""Stagecoach"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" in less than 12 months. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.<br/><br/>While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.<br/><br/>As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.<br/><br/>With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10"

","Despite never having an urge to see this film, I decided to because I wanted to complete the AFI's Top 100 List of Films. It's film that you almost can't ignore; from the media saturation of the ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" analogy to the endless proliferation of Bubba Gump chain restaurants.<br/><br/>The story itself is not really that bad, but the way it plays out is just a pile-up of clichés. From the initial story framing flashback told to a procession of people waiting at the same bus stop as this self-absorbed bumpkin to the endless barrage of pop tunes of the day. The constant music was more excessive than a Scorsese film, a different song every 30 seconds. However, unlike Scorsese, the songs jumped around time periods despite the chronological order of events. One minute it's a song from '69, the next it's from '65. <br/><br/>Then there were the Presidents: They expect us to believe that this man could actually meet three successive presidents. They did a great job with inserting Forrest into the scenes with them, but WHY did they do such a crummy job with the voice-overs? For most, these are iconic voices and for a film with this kind of budget, it's inexcusable that they couldn't do a better job. Let's not even get into what he says and does to these presidents!<br/><br/>The ping-pong marathon and the endless running scenes were really hard to stomach. I get that they were elements of the story but again, they were taken to a ridiculous level. With all that running, I thought he should have been in better shape. Maybe Hanks learned a lesson from this for Cast Away, (a MUCH better film, btw) when he took a break in filming in order to lose all that weight to reflect his time on the island. The Midnight Cowboy routine in the streets of NYC was truly cringe-worthy. And even the stupidest person in the world would not jump off an unmanned boat, or would he? Later, when it crashes into the dock, it was not funny, just pathetic. Then there was his clueless and endless devotion to Jenny. When she wanted to jump to her death, I was cheering for her just so she could get out of this God awful movie. <br/><br/>Believe it or not, I am not a hard-hearted person by any means. I love a movie that can choke me up or even give me a good cry, and sometimes it doesn't take much. But I felt nothing like that here. The only part of this film I liked was the ALWAYS wonderful Sally Field. I might have felt sad in her final scene but her brave face and acceptance of her fate transformed the scene into something victorious. And I'm a recent convert to Tom Hanks who has done some incredible work in other films, but IMO, his Oscars for this and Philadelphia were wasted."

And even though i really enjoyed this movie, i feel its not as perfect as most people think. I obviously don't mean to discredit the lovers that this film has, i just mean to express what i felt about it. <br/><br/>The first act of this movie is very well written, yet for some reason feels really slow.Its a matter of pacing, but i think pacing is relative to what you want from a film. For example the film Drive is a slow burner (extremely) if you went in expecting an action movie, but if you expect a drama film, then its the most fast paced drama ever. Then again, i did see this movie expecting a drama, and that's what i got. Yet for some reason that first act felt abnormally slow. Well crafted, but slow. The second act pics up considerably, and the comedy ramps up quite a bit, making for a more fast paced and enjoyable experience than the first. And it ends just as it should. I have little complaints about this film besides the fact that it constantly slows down. <br/><br/>In the end, the script, direction, performances and overall construction of this movie adds up for a smile inducing, probably tear jerking, and overall highly enjoyable experience that everyone should have. Not perfect, but perfectly enjoyable. For me: 7.5 dudes."

"davispittman","7","0","3","22 April 2017"," Not as great as everyone says but still pretty good
","Forrest Gump is a movie just about everyone knows about and have at least heard of if they haven't seen it. I will start out by saying that Tom Hanks really did do a great job at playing the lead role of Forrest Gump, he definitely deserved that Academy Award win, he is skilled and very committed. I also thought that Robin Wright was good in her role as Jenny, the childhood friend turned love of his life. They actually didn't have a whole lot of interaction together, the times they were on screen together were good and flowed pretty well, but throughout most of the movie it's Forrest going through his life and experiencing a lot of different things without Jenny. As he grows on his journey he always thinks about Jenny and we see her and what she's doing in life, but most of their time together is towards the end, with the exception of some brief time spent together in the middle of the movie. Sally field is also here and she was a great choice for Forrest's mother. Field works very well with Hanks and she has the perfect essence about her to play the southern mother with the advice that everyone quotes ""life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get"". The acting is of course great and the script is pretty good too. The reason I'm giving this film a 7 and not a 9 or even a 10 is because in my opinion there were parts of the film where I felt like it dragged a little, where I was slightly bored, overall I don't consider one of the greatest movies of all time like most do, but I do think it's a good movie. I especially loved the way it ended, very endearing and touching. 7/10 for Forrest Gump."

"Ghobadi","7","0","1","5 March 2017"," Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump
","I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us."
"PartialMovieViewer","10","0","1","19 December 2016"," A Great Movie with Longer Lasting Great Results...Thank You Mr. Sinise
","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Before I begin, I am never a fan of Hollyweird's portrayal of the south, but they do like their broad-brush perceptions of everyone – and I have come to expect it. The movie itself I thoroughly enjoyed, but there is another reason I have to elevate this movie to such a high pedestal. It wasn't the pace, even though the flow of the story was outstanding. There was never a dull moment. And the story itself was definitely a very good 'feel-good' nature...but that is not the reason for the highest of accolades. I walked into the theater skeptical and exited, hoping there would be more. The acting was spot-on. Again...this is not the reason for my highest of marks. From the smallest part to the star, they were all enjoyable. I am not always a Sally Field fan, but as Mother-Gump, I really liked her. She knew quite well what she had to work with and she did her best to give her flawed her son a road map through life. Forrest Gump, being the loving son, never veered from the plan. Stumbling along that path, Gump couldn't help but fall into countless, seemingly inescapable misfortunes. Whether it was timing, serendipity or just plain luck, the Tom Hanks character's always rebounds with better than fortunate results. There are so many interesting twists and turns this flick takes, I cannot put my finger on one outstanding incident. Once again, this is not the reason for my love of the movie. But now comes the reason I enjoyed (or should that be appreciate) this movie so very much. Of all the interesting characters Mr. Hanks bumps into along his character's life-journey (real or fictional), the one I am most thankful for is LT. Dan. As outstanding Gary Sinise was in this roll, what Mr. Sinise did with his fame, is truly amazing. Look at what this actor has done since the movie. He is one person who has dedicated so much of his time to helping veterans and their families. He is an American Hero. He has selflessly helped so many of those who were wounded on real battlefields. Unlike many stars who will read a line or two for veteran-related commercials (which I am thankful for), this man is dedicated. He walks the walk and talks the talk. So for this reason I say this this movie is at the top of the heap. Convoluted reasoning, maybe, but it is my reasoning. I am just being truthful. An outstanding moviewith even better results."

","Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub- normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest modest a remarkable array of historical events and people."

","I'm prepared to take some heat for this one. For my entire adult life, and most of my childhood and young adult life as well. I've been urged to see Forrest Gump. Never really being that into film until I started college, I had managed to consistently refrain from seeing the film. Then, of course, I begin a love affair with motion pictures that led my attempt to see every Best Picture Oscar ever crowned. I obviously could no longer avoid Forrest Gump, but now it was worse. I had never set out to purposely avoid Robert Zemeckis 1994 epic, I simply wasn't interested in it. After my evaluation of 1994 (once my affair with film started), I became upset that Forrest Gump could possibly win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction. As mentioned before, I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and I greatly appreciate what he does cinematically. Pulp Fiction is a classic with so many wonderful devices used; a true tour-de-force of Tarantino's incredible directing chops. I was then dumbfounded to learn that Quentin's masterpiece didn't lose to Robert Redford's Quiz Show, another movie I thought was in a class of its own. I might add that many people would insert Shawshank Redemption in this list of notable snubs I've provided, however, that film did for me all Forrest Gump did and left me unimpressed. Of course, I could only attest to whether or not the best film one if I see the winner, so it was time to see Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a mentally handicapped man living in Alabama, dependent on his mother (Sally Field) and growing up with his only friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Somehow, for various reasons, Forrest is present at every seminal moment of the second half of the 20th century. Forrest is present for so many historical moments, but unable to be present for the one thing he wants most; to share a life with Jenny. Through all the trials and tribulations that accompany Forrest's life, Jenny always manages back into the picture. Jenny is damaged herself, however, after enduring a broken home and molestation as a child, Jenny has a hard time coming into her own life. Forrest Gump tells proves even the most ordinary person can have an extraordinary life.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, I'm by no means a fan of Tom Hanks, but I can recognize his commitment and success in this role. Robin Wright was more of a standout for me as the troubled loner, however. Sally Field played the role of a positivity laced protective mother, that would stop at nothing to provide for her son flawlessly. I also give credit to Zemeckis for shooting a great movie, as it was full of historical imagery and well-suited for the screen. What the film lacks, for me, far outweighs its strengths. I found the almost plot less adventures of one person quite boring, eventually becoming redundant. How many times can you be a part of something so historical by with hardly any resources and by complete happenstance? An audience certainly exists for Forrest Gump; Oscar crowned the feel-good story in 1994, over the best cinematic achievement which they are no strangers too. Needless to say, I'd take my non-linear favorite Pulp Fiction, or the gripping and socially important Quiz Show over another viewing of Forrest Gump any day."

"thepuccacritic","6","0","2","11 June 2014"," Good story, bad storytelling
","This may be a good story.. the rise and rise of a character-from a sportsman to a soldier to a millionaire- who has an IQ lesser than that needed to get admitted in a state school- where he gets bullied and meets his love of life. This character graph has inspired many Bollywood filmmakers (Rajkumar Hirani, Karan Johar in particular) to sketch their characters, and they have milked their stories with enough drama too. I turned upon this film after watching its Bollywood inspirations. But I wasn't looking for any (melo)drama; but subtlety, of course, which, in my opinion, this film lacked. Lacking subtlety is not a problem but hammering with details being blurted out in voice over is, for me. The overdose of voice-over narration concerns me here... it gives too much of unnecessary information which aren't contributing anything to the narrative or the plot or either emotional value, and many of the details are just repeated twice for no particular reason. And this voice-over is not even breaking the fourth wall but is a narration to strangers. He meets these strangers at a bus-stop and they happen to change from time to time, just like the visitors at the home his mom had let for. (Such symbolism, if you call it one, work.) He starts his story quoting his 'mama' (and to count how many times this Mama's boy calls her out could be one irritating game for viewers). This grown up man taking us into the flashback of his childhood never came across to me as a sympathetic one though the film's 'feather light' treatment (also embodied as a symbolism in the film) worked in many tight scenes but at the same time looked desperate in demanding emotion and sympathy from the audience. (Even that white feather hitting the screen with a whoosh at the end came across as- ""Oh look, we hit you so hard with such a heartwarming and light story""). Maybe I'm too cynical but the character, Forrest Gump, looked to me as a dumb throughout. And over-usage of the quote ""An idiot is as idiot does"" made him look more. And I totally get that the point of the film was to look the cynical world from the prism of an unintelligent man that would make it look more simpler and a winning place, but all I'm saying that this could have been said differently, more beautifully and overwhelmingly and obviously, with some subtlety.<br/><br/>Also I'm not asking to take away its classic status. The way the film depicts and incorporates American history, its thriving new culture and counterculture into its storytelling deserves to be acknowledged and that would have surely helped to achieve this status. <br/><br/>The music score is indeed beautiful. But only if the director had realized that it's also about the 'sight' and not only 'sound', he would have deployed a more focused and centered cinematographer to work who would add his bit to the narrative.<br/><br/>What worries me is that how did a film so repetitive and monotonous in its narration and tone with no powerful visual storytelling win Best Screenplay and Editing awards at the Oscars! But again what overwhelms me is the fact that this film which used visual effects as a requirement and not a motif to tell a story won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects!"

","This is the kind of movie they make you watch when your in high school. Like close to the end of the school year and the teachers are looking to kill some time, so whip out the school TV and DVD player press play and disappear for two hours. Forrest Gump reminds me how far American public schools have fallen, surely those hypothetical teachers could have found a better movie to show. Look hard through the school library's pile of DVD's, there has got to be something better than Forrest Gump, wait what was that, Barbarella?

","Tom Hanks plays a young southern boy in this sort of coming of age movie. The story starts as Forrest (tom hanks) goes from being a ""below average intellect"" child with walking disabilities. Right from the start, Forrest overcomes challenges that are seemingly impossible, just to name one. He later makes a friend Jenny who he soon becomes inseparable from. Forrest grows up, becomes a star football player in his college and enlists in the army to go to Vietnam. While in the war he rescues his commanding officer Lt. Dan and receives the Medal of Honor, which was awarded by JFK. Upon coming home, he reunites with his long lost, and now hippie, Jenny. He falls in love with her, only for her to run off with an anti military friend. Forrest, feeling lost, starts a shrimp catching business which becomes the best around. Later he finds out that Jenny was impregnated with his son and they marry. Soon after Jenny dies. The story makes you have many different feelings at times, mostly good, but I believe there are too many times Forrest had overcame these challenges. Sure, people overcome some incredible odds at times but I think there were too many thrown into the plot. The story comes off as far fetched most of the time but it doesn't really ruin the movie. Overall, it's a good movie. Don't get me wrong. The movie just isn't as good as people want it to be."
"ynesh_91","8","0","2","6 October 2012"," Overrated
","Forrest Gump happens to be a film that took off, up and away very easily, and it's not hard to see why. As much as it was a very good effort, you can't help but to feel the whole idea is slightly over hyped.<br/><br/>The best elements of Forrest Gump is 2 things. Firstly, the excellent performances by the actors. Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast were brilliant. Secondly, the many representation of historical facts weaved into the plot. <br/><br/>That being said, it's somewhat understandable, albeit contradictory, why this movie is being rated so highly among viewers. It's nice to watch a movie every once in a while, where everything falls into place perfectly, and no one really wants to question the sheer oddity of it all. Forrest Gump is a good example of that. The good performance by Tom Hanks alone undoubtedly is enough for the many to drench this movie in praise. The problem for me then becomes this. Knowing this movie is definitely at least a good movie, what's stopping it from becoming great? I think it falls short of giving us the ultimate sense of profoundness and awe by the end. It does, though, but not as profound as other movies from that decade, say The Green Mile (making this comparison since many claim Gump to be one of the best movies out there, it's only fitting to compare it to another heavyweight, nothing to do with Tom Hanks being in both). I also feel Gump, at times within the movie, has moments of drop and stagnation within the plot. It doesn't continually escalate with time. Usually in movies it's not a problem, or sometimes necessary, but in Gump, these lapses of stagnation can seem almost endless and perhaps a tad bit overused. I will give this movie credit for the acting and for the way it captures the counter-cultures, lifestyles and many nuances of the up and coming USA. It does a good job pacing us through these many historical elements, and has its moments leaving the audience at awe.<br/><br/>But I remained convinced a silent minority out there share my opinion on how this movie, despite being a very good effort, isn't as awesome as everyone makes it to be. It could be one of the best movies of the decade, but definitely not the best. 7.7 on my scales. A very good effort. Nothing more."

","Dumb luck allows a moron to be present during numerous historical events and to become fabulously rich. This film consists of numerous amusing episodes that don't add up to a satisfactory whole. There is so much emphasis on cleverly incorporating Gump into historic moments that the narrative flow suffers. As such, the skits become tiresome after a while, especially given the excessive length of the movie. Hanks's performance is interesting but overdone, as he shifts from robotic to goofy to emotional, making Gump not so much a character as a caricature. The effects showing Gump interacting with the likes of JFK, LBJ, Nixon, and John Lennon are well done."

The story, like I said was pretty good, but I wanted to see more; more accomplishments in this story. Tom Hanks I thought was an excellent choice for the heroin.

"general-melchett","10","0","2","18 November 2006"," Forrest Gump is an absolutely corking film - deserves all its praise.
","This movie was easily the best of 1994 - though there wasn't much competition, this film managed to make a hell of a lot of cash and win 6 Oscars - an achievement which no comedy film has done since. This is Tom Hanks's greatest hour - it shows that he is versatile, skilled, and cares very much about his roles. Forrest Gump himself was a nice guy - but not in a nice world, and this earned him a lot of ridicule and humiliation on the way. But it is good to see how he deals with this, and to see life through the eyes of a lesser-intelligent person is something that makes this film truly special.<br/><br/>It is hard to say that Jenny really eludes Forrest - she is always coming back for him, and sent him a load of letters when he was in Vietnam. Their friendship is touching and meaningful - but Forrest doesn't realise that she has wasted her life by taking drugs and partying hard, which shows just how naive he really is. But it is this that makes Forrest Gump itself.<br/><br/>The Vietnam War sequence was pretty intense - though it wasn't a contender for the likes of Saving Private Ryan, it managed to capture the fights pretty well, but mainly the heroism of some men who wanted to save other's lives. I felt very sorry for Forrest when Bubba died, and it tells us that every soldier has ambitions and a planned future, but some of those men will never be able to live those futures.<br/><br/>The film's main premise is integrating Forrest into history - this is the best part of the film. Realistic archive footage has had Forrest placed in it, and it soon makes you wonder whether he was a real person. Things like the phrase ""Sh*t happens"" and the running phenomenon that swept America in the 80s - was it Forrest who inspired all of these things? Of course, the answer is no, but the screenwriter has done a spiffing job leaving us to ruminate over these things.<br/><br/>This film does contain some absolutely monumental images - such as Forrest breaking off his leg braces and running free. Every character is different - Lt. Dan was my least favourite. When Forrest was trying to be friendly to him, why did he elude him and make him regret his actions? Why did he shout at Forrest for saving his life? It makes you wonder. This film contains some important messages - one of them being that everyone's got a story to tell.<br/><br/>On the whole - Forrest Gump is an absolutely great film. Before you watch it, treat this film like a box of chocolates - because you don't know what you're gonna get. And that is what Forrest Gump tells us about life. Spiffing. 10/10"

","When the movie opens, you think it is just a regular movie. When Tom Hanks transforms into Forrest when he talks, you know the movie will be one of the best movies you have ever seen. The way the writers and director shape the way Forrest is and his encounters with JFK, John Lennon, Elvis, and LBJ, President Nixon, Watergate, and many other things. He does not know the significance on how good or important it is because he does not know how to comprehend it. That is the genius of the movie. To have a character who does not know his own significance in the since the writers put it is simply brilliant. The relationship between him and Bubba and Lt. Dan stand out and show how true friendship is supposed to be. The three endure hard times at Vietnam as Bubba dies, and Lt. loses his legs and Forrest wounded from battle. The most interesting relationship on the movie has to be between Forrest and Jenny. Forrest and Jenny are child hood friends and the relationship grows when Forrest has deeper feelings for Jenny. The feelings are not returned from Jenny because she thought Forrest deserved better than her. The relationship is one of the main topics in the movie that will hit you. The movie is really on one man's relationships with so many people in over a twenty year span. It also deals with trying to find self and true love. This is Tom Hanks best role he ever played and one of the greatest performances ever in the motion picture history. The characters are memorable and you will never forget them."

","Lieutenant Dan: Have you found God yet, Gump?<br/><br/>Forrest Gump: I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him. <br/><br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>I'm not the religious type. But I couldn't help notice the large amount of New Testament references in FORREST GUMP (which I assume are in the book as well). (BTW, I posted an earlier version of this to a certain progressive website, in case anyone here reads widely.)<br/><br/>Consider: 1) Forrest was born of an earthly mother, with no indication of who his father was.<br/><br/>2) He became a fisherman at some point in the movie. But considering the sea's ability to rehabilitate Lt. Dan, and Forest's ability to attain Lt. Dan's loyalty, I'd consider Forrest to also be a ""fisher of men"".<br/><br/>3) Remember when Forrest ran and ran across the country for 3 YEARS, collecting followers along the way? Not unlike a certain religious figure.<br/><br/>4) And when he was doing all of that running, Forrest performed various ""miracles"". Like inventing the smiley-face logo, and the phrase ""s--t happens"".<br/><br/>5) SPOILER HERE.. By the date on her tombstone, Forrest's wife Jenny was in her early 30s when she died. Since Forrest was about the same age, we can assume he was 30 when he did his ""preaching"". (Strangely, Jennny - akin to Mary the Magdalene - is the one with the initials ""JC"" (for ""Jenny Curran"" according to trusty IMDb). Perhaps Dan Brown didn't quite have it right about the history of women in the early Church.)<br/><br/>Of course, this movie is not at all ""preachy"", as the quote above attests to. Forrest sort of stumbles upon his situations, but he always dutifully (and sometimes cluelessly) steps up when called. The conveyance of that innocence is what really makes the movie."

","The craftsmanship in this movie is not that it has a good message, it's that it tells a good story and the good messages keep coming. These messages are so universal, it would be difficult to find someone who can watch this film without shedding a tear.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a none-too-bright Southerner whose positive attitude, uncomplicated life, and honest application of hard work yield for him a soap-opera-like chain of incredible success. Instead of achieving one historically significant and newsworthy goal, he achieves every major definition of success in Western Culture, except for the one he wants: the love of ""his girl"", Jenny. While he is off winning high honors, getting photographed on both television and magazines, Jenny leads the life of The Prodigal; boozing it up and partying down. It's always empty and disappointing to her.<br/><br/>For all his colossal successes, Forrest himself winds up unsure of himself because he knows he his not smart. The mutual dissatisfactions of incredible success and incredible failure with no one to share it with lead the two back together for a familiar friendship. An interesting resolution to the story fulfills the ""what's missing"" in each of their lives.<br/><br/>Wall-to-wall solid performances. Tightly cut together. Incredible special effects.

","I think that this is without doubt one of the true classics in the world of movies. This is an idealistic story of moral and compassion, it teaches compassion to your loved ones, goodness and honesty. All of this is presented by one boy growing up to be a successful man. Successful not only in the meaning of financial success, but success in life as well. When I think of the movie, I often think of Forrest not as a man, like other characters in movies, but as an idea of life. A pure sense of life created into a fantastic person.<br/><br/>What I like the most about Forrest is that he has an unfailing ability to do things right, on purpose or not, no matter what people might think of him, or what outcome it could have been. Nothing is trivial to him, nothing is too pointless for him to do something about, on the other hand things like image and others opinion about him is not remotely important to him. His in many ways childish behavior, gives him a mystic touch of innocence. This pure way of life, makes us want to be more like him, to be more caring about others, and makes us see what we really should treasure in life. He contains great wisdom from his mother, and his love for Jenny is pure, as well as his friendship with Bubba and all of his friends even after they have all passed on.Tom Hanks delivers an exceptional performance and deserves the Oscar completely, he captures the nature of Forrest Gump amazingly and gives this movie heart and soul. The other actors/actresses also makes outstanding performances, Robin as Jenny touches us deeply with her tragic story and her kindness, which walks hand ind hand with her suffering. Gary Sinise is simply fantastic, I can not imagine Lt. Dan as anyone else, he is simply hilarious and thoughtful at the same time( By the way I have to give the special effects crew credit for their work on his legs ). Basically every actor who appears on the screen does an exceptional job. The director too uses every possible technique to capture the moral and feelings on the screen, and the details keep emerging for each time you see this movie. All in all a true masterpiece providing comedy, drama, a bit of action and most of all a pure sense of happiness and warmth. It makes you think about the big questions of life, and you decide for yourself how to translate the messages and symbols of this movie. For those of you who either did not understand this movie or have not yet seen it , you should go and watch or re-watch it as soon as possible. Enjoy, this is one of my all time favorites. 9/10"

It also portrays the 1960s and 1970s for what they are infamous for, hippies, peace, love, protest and war. Forrest grows up a simple child but grows into a mature and loving person. Hanks was ideal for this role. His childhood friend, ""Jenny"", who he remained for most of his life, he loved, and sadly, she didn't always treat him how she should've. Still to this day, I remember this to be so realistic and I actually thought to myself, ""why did she do this to him?"" Never before (or maybe ever again) has a film like ""Forrest Gump"" made me think to myself and apply to a fictional film such a realistic question. It's almost as if it actually took place.<br/><br/>The bonds that two simple men had while in the military, Blue and Forrest, was incredible. While neither of them were very smart, they both were very kind and they formed a friendship that lasted until they parted. I cried not only at that, but also at the death of Sally Field's character and Jenny. No, I didn't cry once, but several times.<br/><br/>We have a lot to learn from this film.

And probably one of the best ones that Tom Hanks has ever done. The movie did a great job in recreating each time period Forrest is in.

","There was a Quebec poet-singer named Félix Leclerc who sang a song which began with these words: ""Moi, mes souliers ont beaucoup voyagé"". In English, it means: ""Me, my shoes have traveled a lot."" So, just watching the opening scenes from the movie, where the camera zooms on Forrest's shoes, made me understand that Forrest Gump was that kind of guy, too.<br/><br/>In fact, Forrest's journey began right after the end of World War II and it went on throughout all of the baby-boom generation events 'till 1982, where his childhood sweetheart, who became his wife, died of AIDS.<br/><br/>But what Forrest Gump never understood is that any single event of his life would have been a lifelong dream for somebody else. Everyone on Earth would die for a single sight of the President of the United States. Well, Forrest personally met three of them (Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon) and he never realized how lucky he was. And that's a single element of his existence.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump's character is played by Tom Hanks, a role which deserved him the Best Actor Oscar for a second-straight year (he won for ""Philadelphia"" in 1993). But it's very easy to understand. I think that Hanks' performance is one of the most brilliant interpretations of any kind in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Also brilliant are Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn, who play respectively Lt. Dan Taylor (Forrest's superior in Vietnam) and Jenny (the girl of whom Forrest has a crush on). While Forrest is a very lucky guy, Taylor and Jenny are mostly down on their own luck. Taylor lost his legs during the Vietnam war and after the war, he depended on the government for living and became an alcoholic. Jenny had the bad luck of having a cruel and abusive father and she met a lot of men who weren't as tender as her childhood friend Forrest was. She even became addicted to drugs during the hippie movement and she contemplated suicide for a while.<br/><br/>But it's Hanks' performance that really makes this movie a unique one. Not only does Hanks put all of his skills into Forrest's interpretation, helped by young Michael Conner Humphreys,but the script is also a gem. It shows a character whose innocence is still a part of him, like if he still was a child. Forrest's IQ is very low, but his physical shape is great (especially in his legs) and he's led by his heart, which is as big as his own Alabama estate.<br/><br/>Visual effects are magnificent. It's one rare movie that features state-of-the-art special effects in such a drama. Most of the time, this kind of effects are featured in genres such as action, adventure, fantasy or science fiction. I loved to see Gary Sinise without his legs and the feather movement in the opening and the closing scenes. But the most astonishing of all is the interaction between Forrest and famous people, such as presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, and also Elvis Presley and John Lennon.<br/><br/>So, all in all, ""Forrest Gump"" is a unique movie. It's a great historical drama, featuring one of the most recognizable characters ever conceived and it's a very enjoyable showcase of one of the greatest historical periods ever. It means that I perfectly understand why did this movie win the Academy Award for Best Picture. However, this award should have belonged to ""Pulp Fiction""..."

","Forrest Gump (1994): Starring Tom Hanks, Sally Field, Robin Wright Penn, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, Rebecca Williams, Michael Conner Humphrey, Bob Penny, Jon Randall, Harold G. Herthum, Sam Anderson, Director Robert Zemeckis, From The Novel By Winston Groom, Screenplay By Eric Roth.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a classic of 90's cinema. The screenplay by Eric Roth, directly lifted from the novel by Winston Groom is greatly executed, even if it reeks of Hollywood. This film was crying for an Oscar and it shows, but for the most part, it is an emotionally-driven, powerful film that captured the latter 20th century (50's, 60's, 70's, 80's) and its turbulent events brilliantly. It was a huge success for Tom Hanks, who epitomized the innocent but noble spirit of the protagonist in a fine performance he is himself quite proud of as one of his greatest cinematic roles. The rest of the cast bring their characters to vivid life, making us feel for them as human beings. Sally Field is his proud, dignified and strong single mother, who loves him despite his mental retardation and instills self-esteem, morality and good values in him which he honors well into adulthood. The relationship between Forrest and his mother is a strong bond. Robin Wright Penn plays the love of his life, Jenny, who as a childhood friend, protected him from bullies, but whose life is full of darkness and damage. Abused by her father as a child, aiming driftlessly in a world she finds meaningless, she becomes caught up in the Hippie movement of the late 60's, even making the pilmigrage to Woodstock and San Francisco, and later becomes a disco-lover and drug addict during the 70's. She has one bad relationship after another, attempts suicide, and even has Gump's son. But she rejects his love, despite the fact he is the best man in her life. Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, who fought in Vietnam along with Forrest and with Bubba (Mykelti Williamson). Suffering the hell of war, they lose their innocence and experience trauma, but Lt. Dan loses his legs and cannot live a normal and happy life. Even so, he is blessed by the loyal friendship of Forrest. Bubba dies and Forrest inherits part of his lobster fortune, his yacht and increases in wealth. The most memorable moments of this film, as everyone who saw it in the 90's remembers, are the casual, accidental slices of history that Forrest becomes part of, i.e. He shakes the hand of John F. Kennedy prior to his assassination, witnesses the Watergate Hotel intruders who worked for President Richard Nixon, creates the Happy Face logo ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"", goes to Vietnam, etc. The movie has a lot of heart, humor and delves into the tragic side of humanity. Despite all the suffering Gump endures, despite his mental deficiencies, his simplistic, happy-go-lucky, child-like attitude makes him survive when others fall apart. This is a great movie."

During his life he also meets the Elvis Presley, John Lennon, President Kennedy, President Reagan and President Nixon. The funny thing is that not at any time did Gump understand the importance of the events he was witnessing. Jenny, Forrest's good child hood friend, is there from times to times during the whole movie. Forrest and Jenny are for a long period of time divided from each others, because they are living so different lives. Even so, they both eventually fall in love with each other. Gump is a quite simple man, and does not seem to be worried about the fact that everyone obviously is smarter than him, which I do believe he understands. I think the main point in this movie is that happiness doesn't take intelligence or money. It takes love, good values and achievements that are important to you.<br/><br/>Me myself enjoyed this movie very much. It is touching, entertaining and educational at the same time. When I think about it later, the whole story does not seem very likely. What is so amazing, is that I did not think that thought one single time while I was watching the movie. The acting, the dialogue, and the film-technical aspects are so realistic and brilliant, that I completely felt like this was really happening. I also love Hanks character, which is just as brilliant as the rest of the movie. The next time you need motivation for living a spotless, innocent and morally correct life, go watch this movie."

","This movie is endearing and fun to watch, but at the same time, it makes you think. It is fresh and innovative, with just the right touch; never too silly. Tom Hanks shines as Forrest Gump, giving the character dignity that few could. Robin Wright Penn is perfect as his best friend/love interest who is dealing with an abusive past. Sally Field gives her usual solid performance as Forrest's patient and loving mother.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is the kind of movie that really makes you think about how you view the world around you, and, especially how you treat other people. It never goes past sweet and touching into preachy.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it gets a perfect 10 from me!"

","I hated this movie when I first saw it. I felt it was about my life. I had to go out in the lobby during the Vietnam combat scene. Even though I did not go to Nam, I was affected by it. Forrest goes from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I took my son to D.C. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential baby boomer life unfold was painful. Seeing Sally Field's transition from a 70s babe to a maternal type was also disconcerting."

","Forrest Gump is not a very easy film to look at without really needing to move into depth and vision.The film seems not to allow for a capsule summary and personally it doesn't want to be characterized.The truth is like that in many ways because it stands for something that stands the test of time and perhaps thats what makes some of this going not particularly simple.Its difficult not to like this film and more so how we are looked at perhaps as a remnant of time.The early going for the parent was not so easy to understand because there was a lack of humility exhibited by gumps mother but gump was not brought up a certain way that would allow for a typical response and so we have an unusual storyline.Doctors can have that kind of sobering effect on developing youngsters,no one reading this can say otherwise because we all grew up.The bullying and clever positioning of scenes is not always enjoyable but it is a way that we are being poked fun at or begged to have a sense of humor.There would of long been a number of fights had that occurred when I was in those grades and indeed I think that here the picture starts to tell us something about bravery,honor,ingenuity,and good fortune.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump can run like the wind.Clever,witty and it certainly does keep your interest.However its got to stop this is absolutely ridiculous and that when the story begins to go backward.I thought the anti-war protest scene was a great pitch for an everlasting value,it was unfortunate that the female had no more sense than most of those deals back then because what was represented in the heart of this very decent man was true love.Perhaps,perhaps,perhaps it is terribly moving his involvement with jinny.It would of hurt to have gotten all those letters back and so much so that in reality this relationship would not of matured.This is a complicated area because it is suggested that she was the victim of child abuse perhaps though not stated even maybe more so than just abuse.It is further suggested that that was the cause of jinnys proclivities as she wondered about the country side.It is even more involved than that and that she had no home life and only one parent and then not even that.We certainly have the idea here of two youngsters jinny and gump both of which do not share or know what it would be like to have both parents present in there upbringing.The girl is something of a wreck from the start as her idea of stardom in that bar scene was ridiculous.<br/><br/>I personally don't have the time nor the room to really look at what it was that this movie attempted to say.Why would you have a naked broad on stage with a guitar singing how many roads does a man have to walk down before you call him a man,?If all roads don't lead to Rhome I wouldn't know ?This perhaps was a good way to showcase gump more so than other aspect of this film because the broad was in a dump and doing what so many of them do and what is that?I really don't know because it would not of occurred to me nor did it occur to gump that she was his one and only.The tragic idea here has to do with two essential aspects of love,importance and pleasure.The young girl continues to move away from a central point and away from true love.This is the nature of the rebellion in her and eventually she will discover that she has lost something very dear,even very close to her heart.It maybe her love of her parent or maybe her love for forrest gump,however that lost idea is going to fool her into beleiving in something that is not important nor is the pleasure that it provides of a lasting value.I cant provide all that is condoned with its place but it isn't friendly and that is where forrest gump shows the audience what is more important and that is a love of abiding faith so deep as to be though over history.The placement of this picture suggests that there is no place like home,that being greenbaugh,alabama and quite frankly I agree.The suggestion is very appropriate and perhaps well placed.I think Forrest Gump was a bit over simplified as no one could be that stupid or could he.I think the scenes in college are about as enjoyable as college gets and his military service exemplary.He was trained very well and did this nation a service by representing the USA as one of its ping pong ambassadors to china.There is so much that Iam not going to go much father due in principal that unless you cant see it Gump is the right man.He has a gift and it is about to pay off.This really doesn't answer what everyone else is doing or what else may in fact be going on but the unbelievable happens Apple Computer.I think thats a smile and so was his road running.The feather theme by Alan Silvestri is worth mentioning as a beautiful piece of music.Like I said this is not a simple film nor is it exactly what it appears either."

They teach us they very basic of living and our surrounding.<br/><br/>The next thing about Forrest Gump is the character itself. Being silly, he is so independent. He does not care for any other person's view and does what he wants for his satisfaction. He is a true simple and honest person. However, throughout the film Forrest has been somewhat of a lonely character. It is really painful to see that when he got what he always wanted: JENNY, the latter was to die shortly."

","""How do we provide a US history lesson, warts and all, that is both entertaining and sentimental?"" may have been the question the script writers/producers asked themselves and settled on a slightly mentally and physically retarded boy in (of course) bigoted Alabama who just happens to later be present in most of the momentous occasions in US history of the second half of the 20th century. Well he doesn't stay physically retarded for very long, quite the opposite. We get to see to see quite a few American icons (OK, John Lennon was English, but like some of the other notable people we see he got assassinated by a mad gunman.) The film manages to maintain a didactically neutral attitude towards the events and people it shows - the facts alone - but is heavy on sentimentality, which no doubt is good for box office takings. Inane it certainly is, but has excellent set design and cinematography, has good flow, and great songs on the soundtrack. Worth watching. 8/10"

","This oscar-winning film chronicles the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man of lower than average intelligence.  To give away the plot would take away from the magic of the film.  Let's just say Forrest Gump takes place in a variety of historical events and leads an extraordinary life.  And, in spite of all his accomplishments, Gump's childhood sweetheart, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) continues to elude him.<br/><br/>All of the actors shine in 'Gump', especially Robin Wright Penn, as Jenny, and Gary Sinise, as an army lieutenant whose legs are amputated, both give tender and heartfelt performances.  But Hanks steals the show, in what is arguably the best performance of his career.  Hanks is excellent in portraying a man who is unable to understand the hypocritical and unjust nature of society.

","Normally, I detest over use of voice-over narration. I often think to myself that directors use narration only because they can't think of a better way to tell the story through the actions of the characters. Why tell the story when you could show it?<br/><br/>'Forrest Gump,' however, is an exception to that personal belief. The story has to be told through narration because the narrator is in every way the center of the story. Forrest's innocence, his inability to see the evil in human beings, carries the movie because he can never lose that innocence. Forrest is only a step above Raymond from Levinson's 'Rain Man,' and like Raymond, he cannot change the way he is. And because we see everything from Forrest's perspective, we witness the world through a child's eyes and laugh at the irony.<br/><br/>The director, Robert Zemekis, uses that laughter to probe our evolution. Sometimes only through a child's perspective can we look back at how we failed, how we succeeded, and why. In a world that stresses reason and practicality, sometimes it's necessary that we reexamine our humanity by stripping away our cynicism and societal inhibitions, and just take things for what they are. Realistically, we live in a world that would destroy a person like Forrest Gump. But by watching this fairy tale we understand why it shouldn't, and it fills our hearts when it doesn't.<br/><br/>

The fact that Forrest is telling you his story while sitting at a bus stop is an excellent idea. Tom Hanks is the best possible actor to play Forrest Gump, his caring soul and simple outlook on things is truly touching. He lives an incredible life, and he isn't able to realize it, often causing laughter to result. Gary Sinise is perfect for the role of Lt. Dan. He nails, and steals, each scene he's in, and in my opinion, he steals the movie as well. When you see Lt. Dan walk up with his fiance, close to the end, with his new metal legs, it brings me to tears. So does the scene when Lt. Dan has finally accepted what happened, isn't angry anymore, and you see him swimming under the sunset. It's such a touching moment, when you finally see the man Lt. Dan used to be.  Also, when Forrest sees his son for the first time, the shock and love on his face, and the grief he has on his face at Jenny's grave.

","I have an 8 year old sister who is autistic. She is pure innocence.<br/><br/>
MIGHT BE SPOILERS...<br/><br/>So is FORREST GUMP. Yes, he is present at history's most renowned events: the manifestation of young Elvis Presley,  the integration of the University of Alabama, the War in Vietnam and all the controversy surrounding it, Watergate, and the shootings/assasinations of various famous politicians, among the many. But his presence at these events is purely coincidental.<br/><br/>
Forrest Gump is born to a single woman, and although we never really find out WHY he is like he is, it's pretty evident that he was born with some degree of brain damage. He's not retarded, but he is very slow, very naive, and again, very innocent. Perhaps he is an alcohol syndrome baby. His natural father is gone and nobody knows where or why. Maybe he has a degree of autism from immunizations gone bad or something.<br/><br/>Point is, Forrest Gump is NOT STUPID. One person said this film celebrates stupidity and ignorance. I see neither stupidity nor ignorance in this character. What I see I've already listed above.<br/><br/>He loves his mama and looks to her for answers and wisdom. He believes in her. She has always been there for him and with him.  He loves his friend Jenny, who has been sexually molested by her father and is obviously flighty and troubled. Forrest's love for her follows her all over the nation, from a strip club in Tennessee, to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury hippie scene, to the cocaine-laden disco clubs of NYC in the late '70s.<br/><br/>
As if to prove to people that purity is a good thing, even if it's because of brain damage, God showers good fortune on Forrest Gump in the form of a prosperous shrimp company. His friend Lt. Dan, having been crippled during the War, shares the wealth with him. <br/><br/>And finally, even though it's really too late and she had her own reasons, Forrest gets to marry his Jenny.<br/><br/>And at least he has Little Forrest to devote his pure life to.<br/><br/>One of my favorite movies!!!"

","FORREST GUMP is one of the most unforgettable films I have ever seen. Director Robert Zemeckis marked his place in Hollywood with the hugely popular Back to the Future trilogy. Tom Hanks climbed the ladder of success starring in comedy movies like Splash and Turner and Hooch in the 1980's, but hadn't had critical success until 1993 when he starred in Philadelphia with Denzel Washington, which won him his first Oscar for Best Actor. The movie also features outstanding performances from little known actors Gary Sinise (Apollo 13, Ransom, Deception), Mykelti Williamson (Heat, Con Air, Three Kings, Ali) and Robin Wright-Penn, credited as Robin Wright, (Unbeakable).<br/><br/>FORREST GUMP starts off with the title character (Hanks) sitting on a bench waiting for a bus when a young woman comes and sits next to him. Here he starts his story by remembering his first pair of shoes, which in the film are leg braces. Forrest tells us how he met his life-long friend Jenny (Wright-Penn), how he served in the Vietnam war and how he spent years running for absolutely no reason.<br/><br/>Hanks plays Forrest Gump in a way that makes us feel what the character is feeling so most that we develop a sort of relationship with him. Gary Sinise has an excellent performance as Lt. Dan Taylor who hates Gump because he saved him in Vietnam because he believes that he should of died on the battle field but late becomes his friend, and who says that Sinise can only play bad guys? Robin Wright-Penn handles Jenny's drug addiction and the scene were she tries to commit suicide brilliantly. Mykelti Williamson plays the part of Forrest's friend 'Bubba' Blue, whom he meets in the army, excellently considering that this is the movie where he gets the most screen time that his ever had in the movies that I've ever seen him in. Sally Feild (Mrs Doutfire, Homeward Bound, Homeward Bound 2: Lost in San Fansico, Legally Blonde 2:Red White and Blonde) plays the part of Forrest's devoted mother very well. The little boy who in years to come would rise to fame, Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense, Pay it Forward, A.I.), make an appearance as Forrest Gump Jr.. Haley, Mr. Simonet (played by Kevin Spacey in Pay it Forward) would be proud. This was one of the best movie's of 1994, others included Pulp Fiction and Speed.*****"

","I think that TV Guide (wasn't it?) summed the movie up very well, when they said this movie was about the adventures of an ordinary man. The film was kind of an homage to what can just plain happen to anyone. Who could ever be entertained (or forget for that matter) the wily accent Forrest Gump had in this movie? This was released in 1994. That was a very good movie year. This and ""The Mask"" (another favorite of mine) came out. They slowly showed how Gump was expriencing the important elements and occurings of the 20th century. I once went to a restaruant that was completely devoted to Forrest Gump. I think it was called ""Bubba's Grill"" or something like that, and they showed all the things featured in the movie. Like all those drink bottles that Forrest drank that caused him to say ""I got to pee"" to president Kennedy. You could never forget the various ""words of wisdom"" in that movie (""What's vacation?"" ""It's when you go to a place and you don't ever come back"" ""My mother always says, stupid is as stupid does"") Another favorite part was the subplot with Lieut. Dan. With he lost his legs and years later, you see him a better man with metal legs. <br/><br/>This was based on a book. A writing teacher of mine, Mrs. Olmar said FG was the only movie based on a book that was better than the book. She said in the book, Forrest went into space with a monkey and a woman(!). The floating feather effect was nice too. Tom Hanks is another favorite actor of mine, with his roles in movies like FG and ""Toy Story"". Anyway, I'll give it a 9/10. Really nice movie. <br/><br/>Forrest Gump: (talking about president Kennedy) Then they shot him, and a few years later, they shot his brother."

","After a bout of depression I indulged in a moment of quiet self-reflection, and I remembered how Forrest Gump ran across the United States and simply rationalizes the trend he set: ""I just felt like running."" Some things are best done and for reasons we don't know why and I think a simpleton personality like Forrest's is something adults overlook and take for granted.<br/><br/>He represents a symbol of how losing self-consciousness is often the road to happiness and also that living is of just doing and not questioning ""why?"" all the time. Of course, it would be near impossible for the resume of events to occur in the life of one man, but the message reaches to everyone who got into decisions attributed to pure innocence and good heartedness and came out triumphant. Reminder that there's a little of Forrest in all of us- a balancer of the often-serious life society dictates the selfish messages of ""survival of the fittest"". Good messages to anyone who needs a little boost to a bad day."

","I saw Forrest Gump for film study recently which was my first time. It's been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extradinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.<br/><br/>

For example, If Forrest wasen't so stupid those bullies woulden't have chased after him and he wouldn't have learned to run so fast. and then he wouldn't have played football and if it wasen't for him being so fast he would have been killed in the war.

Since the first time I saw this movie in high school, I don't really see how serious this story ever gets (except for some of the really touching scenes, if you wanna call it ""serious"").  To me, this story is extremely entertaining, extremely!  I can't stop laughing from the beginning till about the last 20 minutes (and the part where Forrest's mom died), then I want to cry.<br/><br/>My feeling is that... a lot of people are stretching it too hard to make it a serious, meaningful, deeply insightful movie.  It doesn't have to be (although it can be in some ways).  Forrest Gump can just be a movie of enjoyment.  Take a break, watch this movie; and take it easy while watching it, not every movie has to teach a lesson even when other people told you so.

"movieguy1021","9","0","3","4 January 2003"," Forrest Gump: 9/10
","Winner of six Academy Awards, Forrest Gump is still a very popular film today, despite being out for nine years.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks plays the title character who is sitting on a bench, waiting for the number 9 bus. He's relaying his life story to the people also waiting for a bus. His story goes like this:<br/><br/>As a young boy in a fatherless household, Forrest never got out much. He had to wear leg braces and only found one friend-Jenny. `They's was like peas and carrots.' But, they have to go their separate ways, but always wind up meeting each other again. Forrest goes to the Vietnam War, is a ping-pong champion, and is a fishing boat captain while Jenny becomes a hippie scrounging for cash, etc. The life story is fascinating.<br/><br/>I've always like narration, but sometimes heavy narration can become tedious. In some cases, the overwhelming use of narration reminded me of Fight Club, even though the two films couldn't be more different. During the end of the film, when Forrest gets to where he was going, the narration, obviously, wasn't there (since Forrest wasn't explaining it to anyone). I missed it. I thought that the narration was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the historic events that Forrest got himself into was genuine. Not being alive for those parts, I couldn't really relate to them, but I could relate to Forrest. He had a certain charm to him that made you root for him as soon as he put the feather in Curious George. Jenny was also crafted so you could like her and feel sorry for her during her times of despair.<br/><br/>Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, Mrs. Gump, who just is a book of wisdom. With pithy quotes such as `Stupid is as stupid does' and `Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get', it's no wonder why Forrest is able to get to all of the historical time periods.<br/><br/>Hanks was superb as Gump. His southern drawl seemed authentic and his naÃ¯ve character, he was able to bring out 100%, without me thinking for a moment that this was someone other than Forrest Gump himself. I thought that Robin Wright, who plays Jenny, was also exceptional and brought out all that was needed for her complex character. Field had a small role but also brought out her best and made me believe that she was Mrs. Gump, not Sally Field.<br/><br/>Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, Forrest's lieutenant from Vietnam. He lost both of his legs, but soon meets Forrest again and go on `crazy schmes', so to speak. His loss of legs was made by wrapping a blue thing around his lower legs, which allowed them to be digitally removed.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a touching, moving, gripping, and sometimes funny journey through the eyes of someone with an I.Q. of 75. You'll never be the same when you view the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for strong language, sensuality, war violence, and drug content."

","Forest Gump (1994)<br/><br/>""Forrest Gump"" is the definitive movie for all times. Just as films like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""The Way We Were"" have not lost their freshness over the decades, similarly ""Forrest Gump"" will be appreciated 40 years hence, and even beyond.<br/><br/>It is amazing how the period songs and period events have been kept at the periphery but delicately strung into the main story. One cannot but admire the way the ""stupid"" man, who had an IQ of 75 when he was small, regards the events that are going around him in this crazy world with remarkable equanimity. Life and its forces, in all its turbulence and romance, find expression through many angles by way of many different characters who enter into Forrest's life. How many attitudes towards life are portrayed here? I believe it is a difficult question to answer.<br/><br/>But finally, what comes out of all this jazz is the beauty of life. A strong belief in life and a great hope, such as the great hope that ""The Great Dictator"" gave, ""Forrest Gump"" gives. Each time someone sees the film, the world becomes a little bit better. I believe that this film is a very good contender to be the Movie of the 1990's."

","Forest Gump is more than a movie. It is a documentary on the 1960's and 1970's. It is well directed, well scripted and well acted. The special effects were ground-breaking at the time. The musical soundtrack and movie score also were a perfect match to the various scenes in the movie.  Each song was a perfect match for the visuals on screen. Tom Hanks became Forest Gump. It was not so much that Gump made history or that he followed history as much as he followed his destiny.  His story became history. Reading history books, I have often wished I could be at some historic moment in time. Of course, when you force a situation, you never find history. It's is when you become like Forest Gump, genuine and as a little child, that life becomes memorable. It is this ""be who you are"" attitude that drives ""Forest Gump"". This is not to say that this movie doesn't have its' faults. The Robin Wright character has a tortuous and torturous connection with Forest Gump. Forest never gave up his love for her, although maybe he should have. Again, destiny brings them together. The same could be said for the Gary Sinese character and Forest Gump. Fate brought them together, destiny kept them together. It is the combination of great direction and Tom Hanks that keeps the movie together."
"chris-1191","Null","0","3","25 October 2002"," and that's all I have to say about that
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *****SPOILERS FOLLOWING*****<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is an epic journey of a movie.Narrated throughout by Tom Hanks,who,in what has to be his best acting role ever,plays the gullible yet wholly lovable Forrest Gump. The movie begins with a thirty-something Forrest sitting on a park bench waiting for the number 7 bus.A feather falls at his feet and he picks it up and puts it in an old book he is carrying.This simple visual moment is the basis for the movie,it is a physical metaphor for lifes journey,and for the next 142 minutes we are voyeurs into the trials and tribulations of this simple-minded man from Greenbow Alabama. Our insight into Forrests life begins with him needing a contraption to help him walk when he is all of six or seven.A portly Doctor explains to the boys mother,played by Sally Field,that:Well...his legs are fine Mrs Gump,but his back is as crooked as a politician.And so poor Forrest has to wear steel leg braces that look simply 'chaotic'.The screenplay utilises this device to create a simply brilliant scene where Forrest seems to teach a young Elvis Presley his now infamously risque dance moves while staying in their mansion-like homestay.Forrest narrates this from the park bench to total strangers who are also waiting for a bus.He talks in a manner that suggests he thinks it's no big thing.His indifference causes disbelief in some of the strangers as he continues on with the story of his remarkable life. On the bus to school one day(when he is still very young) he meets a young girl named Jenny,who,in time becomes his one true love and an integral character in the story.'Me and Jenny was like peas and carrots' explains Forrest.'We did everything together'. Forrest gets older and becomes a football star after discovering his talent for running,and discovers that,in their late teenage years,he and Jenny aren't that close anymore.Having had an abusive childhood Jenny has trouble with commitment and stability,but knows what she wants from life.In a poignant and somewhat humourous scene in her secular school dorm she explains:I want to be a singer Forrest,like Joan Biaz.on a stage,just me and my guitar'. Forrests eventful life continues on and we see him involved in a scene where there is racial tension at his school and where,because of his achievements at football,he gets to meet President John F Kennedy.Both of these scenes are unique as Tom Hanks was actually added into the actual footage of these events as they really happened by computer technology.Both are extremely amusing scenes. The Vietnam War erupts and Forrest is conscripted.Just before he goes he finds Jenny singing in a seedy nightclub and rescues her from a group of obnoxious men,for which she is not impressed.She tells him she wants him to leave her alone.'I'm going to Vietnam...Jenny.I'll write you everyday'.And being a man of his word he does,amidst the graphic and relentless turmoil of the war.Gary Sinise puts in a star performance as Lt.Dan,a wily but genuinely nice character. Forrest befriends a negro by the name of Beauford Blue,who is affectionately called Bubba.His obsession is shrimp,and all he does is talk about it.His dream when leaving the army was to start a shrimping business.He asks Forrest if he'd like to be his partner and he obliges.Then one day the platoon is wiped out.Lt.Dan loses his legs and Bubba dies in Forrests arms.Recovering in hospital after being 'shot in the butTOCKS' Forrest learns that none of his letters to Jenny ever reached her-she had been travelling from city to city doing drugs and generally mixing with the wrong people. Forrest then becomes a professional table-tennis player while Lt.Dan,now in a wheelchair wallows in self pity.The two reunite one day in New York when Lt.Dan finds out Forrest was awarded the Congressional medal of honour for bravery after saving his companys lives in Nam.Forrests charmed and simple view on life eventually leads Lt.Dan to change his own outlook and together they begin trawling the ocean for shrimp in a boat called 'Jenny'.They succeed in their venture. Forrests life is not all wine and caviar though(or should that be shrimp?)as his mother passes away from cancer.Jenny returns but she is an emotional mess.Out walking one day they end up at her old home.Crying she throws stones at the now derelict house before collapsing onto the ground.Forrest narrates:'I guess sometimes there just ain't enough rocks'.Their relationship stays rocky,then one morning after making love,Jenny runs away.Forrest is devastated and takes up running-clear across the country! The film drifts back to the present day where Forrest is still waiting for his bus.After a disbeliever walks away laughing an elderly lady tells him she thinks it was a lovely story.Forrest explains he's on his way to see Jenny,the lady then tells him he doesn't need to catch the bus;the place he is looking for is only four blocks away. Forrest is reunited with Jenny who now seems to have her life in order.But there is a surprise ahead,she has a child.Forrests child.Initially shocked Forrest soon accepts this new responsibility as Jenny reveals she is dying,(we are left to assume from A.I.D.S)Inevitabley she dies and Forrest assumes the role of Father to young Forrest(Hayley Joel Osmont.) The movie ends at it began,the feather escaping from the book and gently flirting with the breeze up into an azure Alabama sky.Truly a magnificent movie.10/10."

","""You have to do the best with what god gave you."" Forrest's mother says to him when she is dying and this inspiring sentence is just one of many mssages of this brilliant film. The film is story of Forrest Gump a boy who comes up from a tough childhood and becomes an american football star,war hero (and  is given Congressional Medal of Honor),world ping-pong champion,shrimp-boat captain and tycoon. Forrest is not a man with individually rosy panorama.Born in rustic Alabama,he has a bad crooked back and a low IQ.He does have a few things good.A capable mother,a girlfriend ,a heart of gold and a perfect soul. There is one important factor in his life.his love for the first and the only  truelove: Jenny.He knows the meaning of  love better  than those who think he is stupid.The feeling he has for Jenny is one of the best human sentiments he has known.In a scene in which Forrest has just saved her from a gang of deviants,that she demands him leave her he answers:""I can't help it.I love you"".She says:""You don't know what love is."" and nonetheless he knows more about it than she does.As in another scene Forrest himself says:""I'm not a smart man but I know what love is"". There are  great melodramatic sequences in film that tarry long in memory.When Jenny revisits his father's house and throws rocks at it in fury. The scene that Forrest and Jenny have hidden in farm and she is praying to become a bird and fly away.Or where he hears about his son,mixed with his happiness is dismaying fright that his son is not smart too.<br/><br/>A lot has been said about magnificent special effects of the film but these are obscured by the pure humanity of the story. Nevertheless special effects are still really stunning.Zemeckis impeccably interweaves Hanks into original footage of U.S presidents and events of the era.The miracle of computer graphics.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks always can be counted on to give a strong performance but the role of Forrest works well for him.I was impressed by Hanks portrayal of Forrest.He was so passionate in Forrest Gump and deserved the Oscar for that.His mannerism , intonation and narration were all perfect.He reminds me Behrooz Vosooghi in Sootehdelaan(directed by Ali Hatami).<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis shrewd direction gives this masterful actor the tools he needs and his direction is quite intelligent. Robin Wright as Jenny is fascinating and remarkable here.She is beleivable as the object of Forrest's perpetual affection. Another strong supporting actor is Gary Sinise as captain Dan.He gives a naturalistic and breathtaking performance. The story is also one of the stars and script is flawless.It'll be difficult for you to lose the interest in the film. Music by Alan Silvestri is smooth and haunting. I just can't say enough about this film.Everything was very good. It would take more than one viewing to notice everything. When I was watching the film I was carried away.It had me alternately laughing and crying and in some scenes doing both concurrently.<br/><br/>The adventures that Forrest undergoes become very familiar and make our sympathy with him stronger.My experience watching Forrest Gump provided me with a pleasant mixture of instruction and amusement.It stole my heart in a way that other flims could not reach, So if daily contests are menacing to drag you under and if the toils of life are breaking you down,there is a film out there that can enliven you.Because Forrest Gump is an energizer for those who have jaded hearts and spirits."

","This film has everything that a person could want; action, romance, sentiment, comedy and yet people still slate it, I really don't understand! This is one of my favorite films of all time, and Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of our generation in my opinion and so I find it very difficult to see why people dislike it so much. The storyline itself is great, it's brilliant in its simplicity - basically the story of a young boy's life, and the amazing things he does with it. Each character brings something else to the story that adds to its brilliance and all the actors in it play their parts with the utmost talent, especially Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. As many of my friends know, I often watch this film burning with fury at Wright's character Jenny and the way she treats her supposed best friend Forest, and that is the sign of a good actress; someone who can really make you feel emotion towards the character they are playing. The same principle can be adopted with Tom Hanks; the first time I saw him sitting on that famous bench at the beginning, I felt a lump in throat. You cannot help but like the character, and no-one could have played him as well as Tom Hanks did. This film is a masterpiece, and one of the few truly good films of recent years. It deserved every Oscar that it received and I suggest to all those who don't like it, you must be missing something, as in my view it is impossible to not enjoy this film."

","People, this is a great film.  And, if you want to get picky about it, it's the only big blockbuster to make it onto the IMDB Top 250 in the past ten years, with the exception of ""Terminator 2"".  That just goes to show that it is not ""hype over content"".  Many people were turned off by the idea of a stupid person as the all-encompassing Everyman, but these were the same people who left the movie theater dry-eyed and continued on their very way, looking for advice from Madison Avenue, dumping their oh-so-liberal views on whoever would be genial enough to listen, and oh yes, condescendingly talking down to the local village idiot and then making fun of him behind his back.  Believe me, I have known people in my time described as ""village idiots"", and the personality with which Tom Hanks imbues Gump's character is dead-on accurate.  The film touched me in so many ways that my throat still lumps up every time the feather ascends to the sky with Alan Silvestri's BEAUTIFUL music playing in the background.  Zemeckis should be proud of himself for this one, which I think will go down as his masterpiece (and that's saying something from the man who made ""Back to the Future"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"").  Forrest Gump may have been slow, but he was anything but a simpleton...those who denounce people like him and their naive worldview just envy the fact that their lives are built around a shimmering ideal brighter than all of the sexcapades and trivial pettiness of normality.  Oh yes, and for the person who commented on this film as ""The worst Best Picture Oscar winner of the 90s""...obviously you haven't seen ""Shakespeare in Love""."

","I like Forrest Gump. It's a very emotionally packed movie that is well acted, written, and filmed. I think the film adaptation is better than the book itself and the deep symbolism play an important role in that. The rcreation of five decades in American History is truly a feat to be hailed. And the soundtrack is a very good mix of oldies. One thing that strikes me as impressive in this movie is the attention to details. Such as the filming of Bubba's ansectors and Lt. Dan's history of ansestors dying in wars. Even the most standard of short scenes can take hours to film. These quick flashbacks take up less than 12 seconds of film and weren't even totally necessary to film, but they did anyway. That gives this movie an A for effort in my book."

"bwaynef","Null","0","2","18 April 1999"," Tom Hanks makes it work
","Some of its critics say that ""Forrest Gump"" is little more than a right wing fable whose message is ""Vote Republican.""  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment of ""traditional values,"" a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.<br/><br/>Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with her.<br/><br/>Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that ""Forrest Gump"" is simply a fable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.<br/><br/>I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on ""The Dick Cavett Show"" with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but of all the people who took home Oscars for ""Forrest Gump,"" no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did."

"critic-22","10","0","2","8 March 1999"," If this isn't a 10/10 movie I have not seen one!!!
","Some users view this movie as inferior to The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) which was released the same year. Personally, I see that both Forrest Gump (FG) and TSR as the same standard of excellence. Both movies shows contrasting aspects of hope and how to adjust to injustices in the outside world. What made FG a classic and probably gave it the best picture Oscar was not only the special effects throughout the movie, or the brilliant appropriate use of music fitting the era, but the incredible acting and plot device. When I first saw FG I thought it was a good family comedy with immense amounts of surrealism. However after repeat viewing I realised that FG had one of the most thought provoking scripts ever committed to film. There are so many aspects of the storyline that has never left me ever since I saw the movie almost five years ago. Just like Life is Beautiful there is the external and internal images and story in this picture. The external is a family comedy that will make you laugh as many things seem so outrageous. However internally, FG is a movie about drug addiction, child sexual abuse, a true sacrificial love story with one way traffic, how a person can cope with disability without committing suicide, the nature of God when something terrible happens to you, prostitution and so much more besides. Tell me one other movie that can handle these subjects and still make you laugh throughout while telling you important moral lessons?<br/><br/>Unlike other so called romance movies like Titanic, FG was not based on lust rather an understanding and fidelity of other persons' characters. If Forrest Gump is a bit dumb he makes up for it with his saint like character. What made this movie tragic is the long time span in which Forrest is in love with his girl and would do almost anything for her and yet she disrespects him because he is mentally disabled, he is not 'normal'. Yet the people Jenny hangs around with are spiritually and morally 'abnormal'. If people can't relate to this maybe it is beyond their understanding and comprehension as they have never been in that position.<br/><br/>Forrest may not be able to verbalise the meaning of love, but his actions put 'normal' people to shame and some. Where else in a modern film do you see the hero being rejected by a gril or even genuinely wanting to get married, only in the old classics I suppose!! Forrest always has the hope of a better future, he teaches the audience that you should always have an aim to look forward to and that will help to keep you sane under misfortune, even if it's simply running down the road to owning a business. In addition, the movie shows that no matter what your disability you can still make a contribution to society and other people's lives. If this is not a powerful message I have never seen or heard one. Forrest knows that Jenny is the only girl he has got a chance with to be his wife, which makes the story even sadder as we see Jenny living a life on the edge. Even at the ending we are unsure whether Forrest is really looking after his son, but as long it is Jenny's and she is his,  he does not mind. Maybe this is a blind type of love, but he also loves Jenny like a biblical prodigal sister and he does not realise that he may have AIDS too. However FG gives hope to many millions of people around the world who are disabled and feel socially excluded in society. As the years roll by I still think about this movie which shows aspects of life which are heart wretchingly profound if you look beyond the external window. If this isn't a 10/10 movie I have not seen one."

"Hörnla","10","0","2","2 February 1999"," Stupid is as stupid does. So we do...
","First, I'd like to say that this movie is formidably made. Referring to acting, storyline and the astonishing FX I couldn't do more than repeating things other admirers of FG have already said. It's got all in it: comedy, romance and the fuel a movie needs to work: the ""I wonder how it'll all end!"" that keeps (most of) the audience with this character throughout this quite long film.<br/><br/>I can't agree with the points often critizised about FG. And, honestly, I think that the less subtle the critics are, the more hurt is their U.S. patriotism. First, If you wonder if something is realistic here, you should stop watching movies. One good thing about FG is, that it isn't supposed to be realistic, though it almost convinces you that it is, but it is far too overdone to be so. It is meant to be a fable, like Benigni's ""La vita e bella"".<br/><br/>""Stupid is as stupid does"" is to my mind the key word throughout the movie. Forrest Gump stumbles through world history (though only the United States are shown, but Hollywood usually supposes them to be the world so the movie has to be seen more in general than it's usual critics do) and what he sees makes only sense to a dim-whitted who doesn't let himself get stirred by events: Politicians are shot at(though no one elects better ones), Leutenants seek death in battle, ""running as fast as the wind"" is regarded as sufficient to get a collegue-degree and somebody who wants to change the world ends up in a terrible mess, having somehow missed the point. So we all do stupid often enough, society does and even America does like the rest of the world. Just Forrest doesn't.(Except towards Jenny, but that's a completely different thing, that's love.)He has only an IQ of 75 but he is the only one who behaves in a way we would like to expect from everyone (though we surely don't want them to talk like that). He has nothing to base his actions upon than his common sense and that shows us how far we've come apart from our ideal of rational behaviour.<br/><br/>In the end one word to those who hated the film for Jenny's death of AIDS which they regarded as punishment,decreed by an reactionary movie: to my mind, Jenny's death is not ideology, it's tragedy, though it also conveys the basic idea of the movie. We won't get a better world by revolutions or drugs, we only achieve it if more people would do like Forrest, even when they have a higher IQ."

","First of all, Forrest Gump was an excellent film.  The emotions was real, the action was real, the characters were real, and plausible, some coincidences were extreme, but did nothing to hurt the movie.<br/><br/>People seem to be angered at the fact that the character of Forrest Gump attains so much success, let alone his lack of ""intelligence.""  I believe this is the point that the author tried to make.  Forrest Gump may have had a childish, naive common sense, but he succeeded anyway, and with flying colours.  His innocence kept him from being tempted by greed, thus hurting himself and others. Honestly, if there were more Forrest Gumps  around, the world would be a better place (don't mean to sound sentimental).<br/><br/>All the characters are used well to convey the image of the time.  Forrest's mother, and old-fashioned, good-hearted lady is typical of the time.  Jenny, falling into a drug crazed orgy during the seventies, pays for it by contracting AIDs a plausible fate for her actions.  Lieutenant Dan, a typical war vet, whom sees no reason for life without the ability to be normal shows us how to respect life in it's fullest.  Bubba, the sentiment character who is killed in battle at Forrest's side, leads to further events in the story well.<br/><br/>The theme of success, happiness and awe of the world is well portrayed in the ""running"" scene where Forrest runs across america twofold.<br/><br/>And possibly the most subtle, yet important theme of running away, is used with excellence.  From ""Run Forrest, Run"" to the scene with Forrest carrying Bubba from battle, to the football antics, and finally the ""Run across america"" scenes are genius.   Forrest was always a good runner, running away from his fears, running away from himself and running away from the truth. The one thing he did not run away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little ""storybook"" but it shows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.<br/><br/>This film was excellent, I don't see how anyone could give it anything under 7/10 stars.<br/><br/>I personally give it 9/10."

","Today I watched the original version for the first time, not having seen the German-dubbed version for some time. And I was really amazed how I couldn't hold back my tears. This movie is a masterpiece! I remembered that I had also cried the previous times I had watched that movie. But I wasn't really driven to tears by any movie during the last months and so I thought I might have grown kind of too tough to be really touched. And then I watched Forrest Gump again and at least five times a stream of water broke off in my eyes. Scenes like Jenny's return, Forrest naming his shrimps-boat ""Jenny"", the last conversation with his mother or the final scene by Jenny's grave - oh, and when he meets his son... Oh boy! I even started to cry before I saw these scenes because I already knew what happens and that sole expectation was enough to make me cry. I haven't experienced so MUCH and so TRUE and so INEVITABLE emotion in a movie for a very long time. I would go on enumerating all the scenes where I cried, because I love Forrest's pure love for Jenny so much, I love his relationship with his mother, I love his loyalty against Bubba and I love his friendship with Lieutenant Dan... I just love the movie!<br/><br/>But of course a really good movie as it is, is not only built on water. It's also a very funny movie. You won't laugh half as loud as you will during movies like ""The Naked Gun""(if you like them), but there is no less humour. The appearance of icons like JFK, Elvis and John Lennon and the - more or less honest - intention to chronicle American history from the 1950s to the 1980s belong to this humour. All these events are made ridiculous and dealt with as though they were rather unimportant, but they also make up the movie. Things look less disturbing, when you see them through the eyes of Forrest Gump! He doesn't understand what's going on and doesn't take it seriously. But would you hate him therefore? No. Do you think you'd have to pity him? No.<br/><br/>All the characters are fantastic. Forrest, the moron, who is so wonderfully naive that he would deserve and obtain all the happiness of the world. The proud and unconventional mother, misguided but through and through good-hearted Jenny, dedicatedly silly-stuff-talking Bubba and especially Lieutenant Dan, who is such an interesting and wonderfully created character. Gary Sinise plays him as such a jerk in terms, but always likeable and understandable. All other actors are no less fantastic, but I don't want to extend this to far.

","I loved pretty much everything about this movie. I've seen it so many times, I can recite it word for word. I follow anything Tom Hanks does, simply because he's brilliant and can become whatever he desires, a slow Southerner, an astronaut, a hopeless romantic, a sneaky suburban, a police detective...I love each and every one of his movies regardless how cheesy (ie: Joe vs. the Volcano).

","Tom Hanks is riveting as a naive, slow-witted southerner who, despite the obstacles that life continually throws at him, experiences years of history without ever fully realizing the significance of the changing times around him. His powerful, emotionally in-depth journey takes him through the bitter integration of public school systems, an unexpectedly glorious college football career, a tour of duty through Vietnam, and fame and fortune as an unlikely shrimp boat captain, all the while staying true to his uninformed but gripping will and determination. Takes its time to unfold, but the result is a well-crafted, insightful, and in-depth historical journey played to perfection by Hanks and his talented co-stars. Simply wonderful. ***Â½"

","I adored this movie when it originally came out. Then I saw it too many times and I started to dislike it. Then I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", and I wondered how those movies lost to this one on Oscar night. I started to hate it, even. 7 years went past, and I hadn't watched this movie once. But, Saturday afternoon tv is dull. There was nothing on, except ""Forrest Gump"". So I decided to watch it, after all it had been 7 years. It was very easy to get caught up in the movie. No matter what anyone says now, Tom Hanks is nothing less then perfect as the dim witted Forrest Gump. The facial expressions he takes when he's trying to be sly, when he's proud of himself, when he's sad - its watching a fine actor at his best. Robin Wright it wonderful as the ever elusive Jenny; as is Gary Sinise as the angry but loyal Ltn. Dan. Mykelti Williamson is heartbreakingly memorable as Forrest's best good friend Bubba. It's fun to watch Forrest make his mark on history, yet be uneffected and even naive about his fame and fortune. There's no doubt in my mind anymore as to why I loved this movie, why everyone loved this movie. Sometimes, you have to be prodded into remembering why you loved something. I think I'll pay attention to movies on TV on Saturday afternoons more often; maybe I'll rediscover something else I forgot."

"americanwerewolf","Null","0","2","22 February 2002"," Forrest Gump - an epic of human proportions
","Every review I've ever read of this great flick has always said ""well-meant but flawed.""  That's bull!  How flawed can a movie be when it takes a man through college football, Vietnam, ping pong, shrimping, and running several times across America?  Everybody from Elvis to Abbie Hoffman to Nixon to Kennedy to John Lennon to Dick Cavett to Lyndon Johnson make surprising and pleasant appearances.  While the film may be slightly exaggerated to keep this guy moving, the two hours of film ""Forrest Gump"" uses are spent giving us the best summation of pop culture and textbook history we're probably ever going to see.  And through it all, Forrest continually turns to his best friend Jenny, who sees Forrest as a good friend who doesn't know any better, which is why she tries so hard to maintain her innocence around her IQ-troubled friend.  While Forrest may never fully realize the 30-something years of history he encounters, he does recognize friends and family as the real center of the world, which is played out beautifully in the last scene, which hands the baton to a new generation of kids who may be more socially aware than their parents.  ""Forrest Gump"" is a must-have for anyone who enjoys people and movies."

","This truly is a special film. The fact that some people say it didnt deserve the awards it won just annoys me. some people say this film is too mushy, it's not mushy, it's powerful and moving and carries messages about love and fate. While being a moving, emotion story Forrest Gump also manages to be incredibly funny at times aswell. There aren't many films out there that can make you both laugh and cry, but this is one of the rare few. Zemeckis does a superb job directing as usual and all the parts are wonderfully cast with brilliant performances from the lead rolls. Alan Silvestri's music score works well and suits the film perfectly.<br/><br/>I struggle to find a bad word to say about this film, some would say that it's stupidly unrealistic. Well yes, with all the things Forrest manages to achieve the film does seem a bit unrealistic. But i believe it's supposed to be that way to get across the messages of fate and the fact that one man, no matter how intelligent can make a difference and can lead a good life.<br/><br/>
Forrest Gump is a very enjoyable, well made film that everyone should see at some point. It stands as one of the best films of the 90s and thats why it won awards."
"bsharp1","Null","0","3","26 December 2001"," Forrest Gump not great? I don't think so!
","I have to comment on Mr. Ben Morgan's review of Forrest Gump.  He called the movie a dupe because of its over-hyped publicity and positive reviews, and gave reasons why he felt the film was not great, but instead ""just above mediocre"".  However, his reasons did not prove to me that the film was not great, it just proved that this is not the kind of film that he enjoys. Using his logic, I could say that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was not a great film because I do not enjoy movies with sub-titles.  This of course does not prove that the film is not great, but rather proves that it's just a film that I wouldn't enjoy personally.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is not an exercise in mush and sentimentality, as Mr. Morgan put it, but rather a well-directed, well-acted masterpiece.  It is a coming of age story about a man who succeeds in each phase of life despite obvious disadvantages.  It has a wonderful story, a top-notch soundtrack, and fantastic images of war, post-war, and 1960's through 80's America."
"Monkey-37","10","0","3","25 September 2001"," Lt. Dan - Satan or Christ?
","I rarely comment, but feel compelled.  By reading these comments it is clear how often people miss the point of movies.  Someone above mentioned that Gary Sinise was ""the devil incarnate.""  It would seem that the language of the character and his proclivity to use the Lord's name in vain offended the person.  While I appreciate that this person may dislike the film and obviously does not like profanity, I think that this person is missing the point... and this saddens me.<br/><br/>I would challenge this person to understand first, then form a opinion later.  Withhold judgment, at least until the end of the film.  The person above let the barest surface of the language cloud their entire perspective of the movie.  What a shame.  After all, one doesn't have to like profanity to appreciate the point that artists are trying to make by using it.<br/><br/>In this particular case, this person above, who seems to be very devout, missed the whole point of Lt. Dan.  In my attempt to voice my own interpretation of Lt. Dan, and to counter the very poorly voiced opinion that Lt. Dan is the Devil, I fear that I will introduce some spoilers below, so read with care.<br/><br/>I hate to spell it out so plainly, but since the person above missed the point so completely, I will give my interpretation, however flawed.<br/><br/>During the course of the film, Lt. Dan was on a very profound and religious journey.  The whole point, in my mind, of the character was to explore, it very direct terms, the concepts of faith in the aftermath of tragedy.   His use of the language, while consistent with the character, also show his inner turmoil and conflict with God.  Granted, the language is not for children, but as an adult I can appreciate that Lt. Dan's language was *supposed* to make me realize that he was at odds with God.  By being overly sensitive to the language, this person missed the payoff when Lt. Dan eventually finds God.  I, as a person of faith, found his story, in the subtext of the entire film, to be very interesting and gratifying.<br/><br/>Great movies, like this one, have layers upon layers of themes and messages. It is what distinguishes them from the normal trash.  While you may not like the movie, you should at least do yourself the favor of being open-minded when viewing it.  Otherwise, don't bother spending your money.<br/><br/>For example, the character of Lt. Dan, while a very fully realized character, was also a symbol of many things in the story.  While I will not say that my interpretations are the only possible ones - I believe that Lt. Dan, Jenny and Forest were all mirrors of the same character.  All three characters go on a journey during this film, all fight the same demons in some form, but all three stories come to a different resolution.  As they all ""run"" from their troubles, directly or indirectly, they each take a different path.  But Lt. Dan's path is that of religious redemption.  To call him the ""devil incarnate"" and treat him like a blasphemer is to deny the entire idea of redemption and forgiveness.<br/><br/>Lt. Dan was an obvious symbol of post-Vietnam America.  He suffered physical wounds like we each suffered psychological wounds.  And I can still visualize his final confrontation with God.  I would like to ask the person above whether they even considered that, high atop the cross-timbers of a wooden mast, with his arms outstretched, his beard and hair whipping in the wind, that Lt. Dan looked quite Christ-like.  He called out into the void, and, as Forest observed, God came to him.  After finding God in the storm, Gary is given his peace, tames his demons, and is even eventually given his legs back.  A cured body to match his cured soul.<br/><br/>I wonder if the person above thinks any of this symbolism to be an accident, or a message of the film.  Frankly, I doubt this person even thought twice about it, which is what I find sad.  But if they had, I wonder if they would have had the same negative reaction to the film.<br/><br/>Oh well.

","I had been counting the days until this title was released on DVD. I always tell my friends and other people that a true movie fan cannot choose just one favorite movie, but if I had to make a choice, it would be Forrest Gump. Contrary to other opinions here, I believe this movie is inteligent. It is the epitamy of American life.<br/><br/>As a movie, Forrest Gump has something for everyone--humor, drama, action, and romance. As a story, it tells of a man who, though not the brightest crayon in the box, can take part in any historical event. Tom Hanks is the only person who could make this character work, period. He plays Forrest with an unwitting charm...you just have to care what happens to him. In my opinion, it is the best performance of his career and more than deserving of the Oscar which he received.<br/><br/>Forrest Gump is a simple tale of a simple man who, for some reason (and watching you really don't care why), is present for nearly every important event in America's most recent history. Forrest's momma, played by Sally Field in one of her finest performances, is his guide through most of his early life. She teaches him that just because he's different, that doesn't mean he isn't special.<br/><br/>Forrest's romantic interest is Jenny, a young girl with whom he is very much in love. Fate delivers them onto separate paths, and yet Forrest and Jenny seemed destined to always be together. The point here is, just as in our reality, things happen that change our lives and we grow apart from those about whom we care. Forrest seems to just shrug these changes off and love Jenny unconditionally, the way true love should really be.<br/><br/>Overall, the performances are touching, the music is beautiful, and the story itself is thought-provoking and meaningful. The DVD has a ton of extra features, though most of them are behind-the-scenes peeks. If you don't own Forrest Gump on video or DVD, I highly recommend you pick it up. After all, ""life is like a box of chocolates...you never know what you're gonna get."""

Tom Hanks gives the best performance of his career, surpassing his first Oscar winning performance in Philadelphia.  The entire cast turns in brilliant portrayals of their own, from Robin Wright to Sally Field, with several ""scene stealers"" from the talented Gary Sinise. <br/><br/>
Eric Roth's screenplay (based on the novel) was nothing short of genius and it kept you riveted to the screen as the story unfolded, waiting to see the next chapter in Forrest's unbelievable life.  Even after countless viewings, I am still mesmerized. <br/><br/>Through the wonders of special effects, the life of Forrest Gump is intertwined with a string of historical events resulting in a poignant journey of life through one man's eyes.  Through all that happens to him he never loses sight of the one thing that is missing from his life - his Jenny.  His love for her is the backbone of this movie and is one of the most moving love stories I have seen on the big screen to date. <br/><br/>
All in all, the Best Picture Oscar was more than deserved.  While its competitors were all excellent movies in their own right, Forrest Gump offers a complete movie going experience - romance, action, comedy, history, brilliant direction, a unique screenplay and outstanding performances.

","OK, unlike some of you, I am not going to slam this film out of anger just because it beat out ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on the 1994 awards circuit.  Yes, this film was made with broad eyes and simple minds.  Yes, it partially served as a candy-coated time capsule for those narcissistic baby boomers.  Yes, as usual, the film is loaded with Zemekis' right-wing ideals clumsily disguised as cuddly Hallmark Card sentiments. One thing that may have bothered people is how American this film is.  It is SO American, so much so that I ask you to think of a recent film that is so American that isn't completely set in some military environment. Nonetheless, I loved the epic scope and reach of this film.  It restored my belief that people still want to make ""magical"" films.  The breadth of this film is as close to an old MGM musical as we're going to get these days.<br/><br/>I don't think Tom Hanks was playing over-the-top (that endeavor belongs to Al Pacino), he hit the note just right with his mix of innocence and morality.  Gary Sinise got damn lucky with this film.  Like Richard Gere, Sinise suffers from the John Travolta syndrome; they're all good actors who have a habit of picking bad movies.  But Sinise must have known how juicy this role was, his poker-face reaction to the New Year's party is just incredible.  Robin Wright-Penn also gave a great performance, and you have to give credit where credit is due; The role of Jenny is one of a few female characters in film whose purpose of existence is not defined solely through the male lead (although her story is chronicled on a separate timeline than Forrest's).  The Bubba character was given a good dose of sympathy to prevent him from becoming a Southern country-boy caricature.  And his friendship with Forrest demonstrates an indifferent towards American racism that only a child is capable of (also remember, these two guys are from the South).  I was most impressed with the song medley they concocted for the running sequence.  The scene takes place in the late 70's, and they choose all these classic 70's songs that have themes of movement or travel (""Go Your Own Way,"" ""Running On Empty,"" ""On The Road Again,"" ""Against The Wind""). It is all edited together quite wonderfully.  I'm not a huge Zemekis fan (I think his Spielbergian tendencies are a little obvious at times), but this is a beautiful film."

"dust-7","Null","0","2","7 January 2000"," Classic Film!
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been better.<br/><br/>Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:<br/><br/>Except that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.<br/><br/>The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.<br/><br/>However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it. It's a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in that sense, it's almost two films, instead of one."

He loved that line: ""I got a million dollars wound but so far I have not seen one cent of it!"" After two days of talking like Forrest, Forrest Gump,  my husband looked at me and said: ""now you sound like Katharine Hepburn."" I think that one the reasons that I adore and understand Forrest is because he ""lived"" through my years as a young adult. The script is brilliant! Clever, clever, clever! The movie touches everyone. The older folks, because they lived through it as adults; baby bloomers because they lived through it as young adults; even the kids in my neighborhood will scream: "" run,  Forrest, run."" Every time they see someone running. My favorite quote: Bubba Blue, Mykelti Williamson (Primary Colors) said: ""Anyway, like I was saying', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it."". My favorite scenes: Forrest showing his buttocks to the President. When he sees ""Jeannie"" (Message in the Bottle) in Washington, D.C., they meet at the pool of the ellipse. They were again briefly like peas and carrots! Forrest sees ""Lieutenant Dan"" Gary Senise (Apollo 13), he jumps into the ocean and his boat crashes! The little feather that flies at the beginning and end of movie. The music is great! This is one of the best movies ever made and that is all I have to say about that!"

","I don't know if this is really a huge spoiler, but I don't want to get blacklisted.  Overall a great movie, but would someone please explain to me why they made Forrest run around the earth(or wherever it was he was running to) for no apparent reason near the end?  As unplausible that it was that he would meet Elvis, Kennedy, Lennon, and company, I had no problem with those scenes.  But then Forrest decides to run and then people follow him(I wouldn't follow him, that's for sure) and then he just decides to stop? Brilliant!  I mean, until then it was a 10/10 for me.  However, this is a great film, and I still had to give it an 8/10.  (forgive me if you enjoyed this part of the movie)"
"Ian Mc-3","Null","0","2","20 September 1999"," A movie about what life is REALLY about!
","Forrest Gump holds a special place in my heart. My son is intellectually disabled and I hope his life will be a full as Forrest's (without going to war though....pass on that one!).<br/><br/>The characters are all spot on. What young man hasn't been secretly in love with a ""Jenny"" who spurned his love when it wasn't convenient but needed it when the frivolous part of her life was over. The pop singer Prince once had a line in a song ""Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last!"".<br/><br/>From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the experience.<br/><br/>10/10 for a movie with heart.<br/><br/>PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!"
