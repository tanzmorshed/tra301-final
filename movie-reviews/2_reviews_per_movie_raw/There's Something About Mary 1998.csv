"lambiepie-2","8","93","121","22 April 2003"," Ya gotta have a sense of humor!
","When this film came out with all of the PR and things, I hated it. I hated it without even seeing it. Then, as with many movies, I caught this on Digital Cable TV, by accident. I had NO intention of seeing it, but once I did, I cannot tell you how much I loved it.<br/><br/>This is the Farrley Brothers at their funniest. The idea is simple, a guy (Ben Stiller) who had a crush on a woman (Carmen Diaz) he knew since high school and continued to yearn for her privately, finally getting an opportunity to try to reconnect what never got going. This is something almost everyone can identify with.<br/><br/>What makes this work...is its a dead-on hard hitting comedy.  The Farrley Brothers spared no one: male or female, handicapped or able bodied, black or white, rich or poor, job or not, straight or gay, animal or vegetable, blonde or brunette, educated or not. It is NOT a cinematic masterpiece so don't look for one, it is not a punch line comedy or slapstick comedy, it is sophomore humor done very well because you're going to be laughing at what you think you shouldn't no matter how much you want to say you would never laugh at something like that. <br/><br/>Plus the Farrley Brothers added in ""some things"" that...well... may have just happened to you at some point in your adolecence, and put a comedic/gross quality to it that shocks you into laughing at it. All through the film you might laugh because you're thinking, ""Better them than me"".....even if it was you!<br/><br/>Not for eveyone's taste, even those who think they know comedy, but this is that kinda comedy that is hard to do once you've reached maturity and forgotten what it was like to laugh at simple things. This is as simple as it gets. Don't put too much into it, it is what it is, and to me, it was really funny! Good Show!"
"rachdeveraux","Null","70","95","21 April 2000"," Unconventional satire stays on course while delivering major laughs
","A lot of my friends said they hated this, but after i saw it and loved what I saw, it became apparent that many of these people hadn't seen it, they just KNEW they would hate it from the degradingly mysoginistic slapstick it supposedly represented.  Sorry, wrong movie.  This is a classic satire, replete with balladeer narrator.  The gags flow fast and funny and expertly walk the tightrope between politically incorrect and unkind.  This is surprisingly a movie that is very true to itself and its characters with a lot of plotlines that tie up nicely in unusual ways.  And, it's a feel-good movie too.  Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller are marvelous together in the leads."
"Coxer99","9","50","68","13 June 1999"," There's Something About Mary
","Insanely off the wall comedy from the Farrelly Brothers that delivers from start to finish. Wonderful early sequence with Keith David as Diaz's father busting heavily braced Stiller's chops. Stiller's zipper scene goes down as one of the funniest and most painful things I have ever witnessed on film. Diaz is divine the woman of Stiller's dreams...Dillon is hired to find Diaz...He falls in love with her and gives Stiller a bum story... Lee Evans, a pizza boy, is in love with her too... then Brett Favre comes into the picture.  Every scene has something memorable from Dillon's attempts at reviving a dog to Stiller's ""pre date entertainment."" A classic that doesn't take itself too seriously."
"Number8","9","67","98","11 August 1999"," There's something about Mary, and I agree.
","The plot is nothing new: A guy trying to get the love of the one he admired. We all have seen something like this in the past, and we will see something like this in the future. But in this movie the plot isn't important.<br/><br/>When you watch it you just know how it's gonna end, and so the focus is not on the plot but the actual happenings in the movie, and there's a lot. First, the movie is funny, with its many gags that just keeps on coming (a Farrelly Bros. tradition). They might not be in everyone's taste, but at least they aren't forced or out of place. Second, the people seem real enough to be in the situations they brought themselves into (kudos for the great acting, though it could be better). Third, Cameron Diaz is adorable, beautiful, and a marvel to look at. Plus, she got the job carrying the whole movie and she accomplished that ever so gracefully. You just can't help but fall in love with her too, along with every guy in the film.<br/><br/>This is a very good romantic comedy by the Farrelly Bros.. Just like in ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""King Pin"", the brothers have made a comedy that has just the right amount of everything. Excellent job!!"
"slokes","10","42","60","4 December 2003"," Funniest film since ""Blazing Saddles,"" only sweeter
","Did you ever see those annoying pop-up online ads about looking up old high-school friends? Did you ever stop to think that this movie is probably responsible? Really, there could be no other impetus for people to want to revisit the horrors of young adulthood then this sterling advertisement for reaching back and reclaiming the best of your past.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is a sad-eyed magazine writer named Ted who never got over the girl of his high school dreams, Mary, who vanished from his life after a single date in which getting horizontal meant being carted away in an ambulance. Ted has seedy detective Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) investigate a lead in Miami. Healy finds her and reports back that she's a walrus in a wheelchair. Ted thinks maybe he should check up on her anyway, to see if he can be helpful to her, but Healy explains she's now en route to Japan as a mail-order bride.<br/><br/>Ted: What are they, desperate! She's a whale.<br/><br/>Healy: It's a sumo culture. They pay by the pound.<br/><br/>Actually, Healy is not being entirely truthful. Mary is single, ambulatory, and quite the fox in the form of Cameron Diaz. By the time Ted learns the truth, Healy's already putting on the moves on Mary with the help of a fake identity and a pair of gargantuan dentures. To counter this, without himself being exposed as a `stalker,' Ted has to reintroduce himself under similarly false pretenses. Will Mary go for this old near-flame? And what will happen when she learns the truth?<br/><br/>A winning romantic comedy with gut-busting boundary-breaking bathroom humor and a sly sense of what makes people tick, `There's Something About Mary' is impossibly optimistic and reassuring even as it buries your head in the gutter for cheap laughs. That's probably what redeems it and makes it such a joy to watch over and over again, the fact that this proto-`American Pie' has a real heart. The makers of the film, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, reveal in their DVD commentary that Ted's reaction to Healy's news of Mary's condition is the key to making the film work, and they are right.<br/><br/>Frankly, I could live in a world without `American Pie' and so many other stupid raunch-fests of its ilk, but `Mary' is pure gold all the way through. Not only is the comedy saved by virtue of its brilliance (I never heard a theater laugh so hard all the way through as I did seeing this in a stuffy Greenwich, CT cinema), it's also a very cleverly put-together film, with a lot of plot twists that hold up as well as the humor during repeat viewings. It's interesting to read people's comments and see them say that it would have been a good film if they had held off on the bad-taste stuff. That was kind of what put it on the map in the first place, the `hair gel' scene and Magda's breasts and Ted's zipper problems, but I see what they mean. You almost could make this film into a Hallmark romantic film, with minimal comedy of any kind, and it would still be interesting. I don't think I'd watch it 23 times like I have this version, however. The film never stops upping the ante on the ick-meter, a large part of what makes it brilliant.<br/><br/>Diaz and Stiller blend very well together, with special kudos to Diaz for being so utterly wonderful and charming in the title role. You understand what the title means without ever having it explained. Also terrific are the supporting players, major ones like Matt Dillon and Chris Elliott as well as Harland Williams as the six-minute abs guy and, of course, Puffy the dog. Jonathan Richman and his drummer are especially valuable in their cameo bits that bookend the various acts in the movie, with songs that manage to be as funny and affecting as the show they are built around. And the end credit sequence is the all-time best. I still smile when I hear `Build Me Up Buttercup' on the radio, don't you?"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","19","25","10 July 2011"," A real trend-setter.
","Whenver we refer to modern comedies I think we have to go all the way back to ""There's Something About Mary"" to see where this all started. It set the new standards for comedy and also became a much imitated movie. Movies however very rarely reached the level of this movie ever again, including all of the Farrelly brothers own later work.<br/><br/>It's the sort of raunchy comedy, that makes some completely inappropriate jokes and makes for instance fun of both psychically and mentally handicapped people, among many other things. This is the foremost reason why some people can't really stand this movie but luckily most others are able to see the talent and effort that were put into making this movie and why the movie works out so well.<br/><br/>As strange as it sounds, it's actually a real subtle done comedy. It's not predictable in any way and the build up and execution of it is spot on. It even makes all of the moments, that usually seem like something totally lame and forced, work out as something hilarious.<br/><br/>It also has a great, yet very simple premise, of a bunch of guys all falling for the same girl. It's the sort of story that provides the movie with plenty of silly comical moments, in which the characters lie and constantly are backstabbing each other, all to get the girl in the end.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz forms the perfect centerpiece for this movie and the movie is filled with plenty of comical characters, all played by some capable genre actors. This movie is still from the time when it was cool to like Ben Stiller and yes, he also really is perfect in his role. But basically everyone is perfectly cast in this, which is obviously also a reason why the movie and all of its comedy works out so well.<br/><br/>Comedies like this only seem to come once every 10 years, or so.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"jaysilentbob37","7","45","69","21 December 2005"," One of the funniest movies of the 90's.
","I desperately wish that the Farelly brothers would go back to doing gross-out comedies like they did with Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, Me, Myself, and Irene, and this. This is by far the best of all their movies. There are three kinds of comedy. Comedies that make you smile (Sixteen Candles), comedies that make you laugh (Airplane), and comedies that cause you to nearly asphyxiate yourself from laughing so hard. This is one of those rare third category movies. With the friends I watched it with, the laughs sounded like nuclear bombs going off in my room. It's that funny.<br/><br/>Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) landed a prom date with the most popular and beautiful girl in school, Mary (Cameron Diaz). Unfortunately, the date wasn't meant to be, for Ted has his manhood damaged right in front of Mary, and ends up in the hospital instead of the prom.<br/><br/>Thirteen years later, Ted decides to track Mary down, and have a second chance with his dream girl. He hires sleazy private eye, Pat (Matt Dillon)to find her for him. Pat finds her, and she's grown up beautiful. Pat decides he wants to date her. He stalks her, finds out everything she wants in a man, and poses as just that. Meanwhile, Ted has been led to believe that Mary has become fat white trash in a wheelchair. Pat and Mary start dating.<br/><br/>Well, by the end of the movie, every man who is involved in the story has tried to make a move on Mary. We all know how it ends, but it's one funny ride. One thing about this movie that's commendable is how the mentally retarded character is treated. He is treated in a way that isn't rude, or offensive. Mary sticks up for him, and he's really innocent. The funniest gag in the movie involves a NEW brand of HAIR GEL (compliments of Ted, and tested by Mary). I won't tell you what's really being mistaken for hair gel, but when you find out, you'll laugh so hard, you gag. This movie knows what a comedy of this type should be like. Each gag goes somewhere, and is really big. They're usually extended scenes with punchlines. Me, Myself, and Irene goes for the cheapest laughs you can find, but There's Something About Mary takes it's time, carefully planning each gag, in order to make it gut-bustingly hilarious. That's just what this movie is. 10/10.<br/><br/>It is rated R for Strong Comic Sexual Content, and Language. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 3/10 Swearing: 9/10 Drugs: 2/10"
"Theo Robertson","9","54","89","10 April 2003"," One Of The Funniest Films Ever Made
","I don`t like comedies but I do enjoy much of the Farrelly Brothers stuff and THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is their greatest achievment which is probably down to their casting . Ben Stiller is perfect as Ted while Matt Dillon is absolutely outstanding as sleazy ( And boy do I mean sleazy ) private investigator Pat Healy . My only criticism is of Cameron Diaz who`s slightly bland , but she is attractive and that`s all that matters<br/><br/>
I suppose how funny you`ll find this film is down to your own subjective opinion of what should or shouldn`t be made fun of . I`ll be honest and say that jokes featuring stalking , serial killers , semen , spiking doggie snacks with drugs and learning difficulties are all fair game ,and perhaps I`m being too honest in saying I laughed out loud at these serious subjects being made fun of ?<br/><br/>Sorry if this review has been very short but I find it difficult to write hundreds of words about a film I love"
"DaRick89","8","35","56","15 February 2006"," There's Something About Mary and there's also something about this movie that makes me like it more than most other gross-out comedies
","There's Something About Mary is an apt title, for there is something about this movie that is quite endearing, particularly if you are a gross-out fan. Even if you are not a real fan of gross-outs, as is the case with me, you can still enjoy this film. This is because I find it to be funnier and more enjoyable than most other gross-out comedies (and that includes Team America). As a romantic comedy, it is also enjoyable and that is saying something as romantic comedy is, to me, a bastardised version of real comedy, often with a weak romance and diluted laughs. This is certainly not the case here. Having said that, it is not perfect: The Farrelly Brothers use a retard for cheap laughs once too often, which I did not like, the disabled guy wasn't that funny and the plot is a bit clichÃ©d and predictable, but I expected that. <br/><br/>The story is about a man named Ted, who we see meet a beautiful girl, Mary, during his teenage years. However, their budding romance falls away when Ted gets his dick caught in his zipper. By the way, this scene is absolutely hilarious and so is the aftermath, after the police officer tells him to 'pull it out'; next minute, he is being carted off in an ambulance, never to see Mary again...or so we think for a minute.<br/><br/>Until of course, he finds himself fantasising about Mary years later. He hires a private investigator, Pat Healy, to do some snooping on her. This takes a turn for the worse, as the investigator falls in love with Mary and lies to Ted. Ted finds out about his deceiving ways, thanks to Woogy and goes to see Mary himself.<br/><br/>This movie is hilarious at times, funny at others; occasionally, it falls flat. There are too many hilarious and funny scenes to mention here, so I'll mention the best ones: the 'dick zipper' one, the 'fishing line' one and the one where the retard goes psycho and hits Pat Healy in the face. To be impartial, I will say that I have already mentioned some of the imperfect bits above. <br/><br/>The acting is quite good too. Ben Stiller does a good job as the nervy, fantasising, sensible Ted, while Matt Dillon is good as the 'sleazy investigator'. Cameron Diaz, in the days when she was still hot, is OK, but not much more than your typical love interest. The rest of the cast is nothing more than OK, including W. Earl Brown, the guy who plays the retard (as anyone could play his role).<br/><br/>I'll finish by saying that this is one of the best gross-out/romantic comedies I've ever seen and is definitely worth a Friday night or a DVD rental. There is a good chance that you'll be laughing like I did throughout the movie. To clinch this review, I will say that:<br/><br/>There's Something About Mary!<br/><br/>4/5 stars"
"Meredith-7","7","28","48","19 November 1999"," Goofy, low brow humour- but it has something...
","In the past I have not been a great fan of the Farrelly brothers films, however this film is an exception. The dog scenes were probably the funniest personally, but there were heaps of other scenes that are well worth a mention. Cameron Diaz was fantastic as Mary, the girl everyone is after and Ben Stiller was excellent. Matt Dillon was way too over the top- I know his role somewhat warranted it- but did he have to be so excessive? He seemed so irritating. There is no doubt that the humour in this film is of the lowest possible calibre, but it really works- think Dumb & Dumber, but only quite good. Despite all the comic situations in the film, there is still something undeniably sweet in the centre of the story, I think thats what made it work. Its certainly not top class entertainment, but its highly recommended for when you are in a stupid mood and need a good laugh."
"Chris J.","7","35","62","10 December 1998"," Funny, but surprisingly sweet too.
","The shock comedy aside (zipper and hair gel scenes), purposeful unpolitically correct moments (humor at expense of handicapped, animal cruelty), the most surprising thing about this film is it has heart and is rather sweet.   It's not the completely nasty, cruel comedy you might have been expecting.  There's a nice love story in here too.  It's corny and cliche'd and doesn't feel overly cloying because there are enough shockingly funny moments to offset it.  The acting is good, the pacing brisk, and the jokes, well... you've heard all about the best ones by now."
"Bill-147","1","20","36","30 April 1999"," Crude, tasteless, vulgar, not funny and those are the good points
","Well if you can't seem to get enough of jokes about the handicapped, sexual stalkers and pointless masturbation scenes then Something About Mary is just the movie for you.  However, if you have an inkling of taste leave the sophmoric humor to the sophomores and spend the evening doing something a lot more fun like getting a root canal.  Not only did I find the movie offensive and humorless but this pointless dribble droned on for over two hours.  When I looked at the time on the VCR counter at 1 hour I thought at least it will be over soon.  Please don't think I'm just some prude who is easily offended.  I can appreciate silly and moronic humor with the best of them.  This movie is like a two hour episode of Beavis and Butthead without the class and wit of Beavis and Butthead.  Please avoid this movie at all costs."
"JeffG.","1","26","51","3 October 1999"," Makes ""Porky's"" look like ""The Ice Storm"" by comparison.
","I went to see this movie after hearing about how funny it was. Guess they must have seen a different movie than I did. I didn't laugh even once during this film. Lots of bathroom humor, jokes about the mentally retarded, sex jokes, jokes about the mentally retarded, no likeable characters, bad acting...did I mention jokes about the mentally retarded? The fact that so many people actually considered this piece of trash funny and the sight off all the people in the theater around me laughing was disturbing to say the least. Is this really how far we as a society have degenerated?<br/><br/>This movie was not quite as repulsive as ""Very Bad Things"" or ""Last House On the Left,"" but it came real close."
"kaldridge","1","25","49","28 November 1999"," Grade school level of bathroom humor.
","This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  I actually watched the whole thing just to see if it could possibly have some redeeming quality, but it doesn't.  It is full of endless, stupid, childish, crude, locker-room humor.  It takes me back to when I was a boy of ten years, when toilet humor was a big deal.  I still can't believe that any adult would find this funny, and it scares the hell out of me to think of the ratings it received when it was released.  What does this say about the state of our ""enlightened"" society."
"secondtake","6","14","25","9 January 2010"," One of those comedies where you groan or cringe as much as you laugh. But such laughs!!
","There's Something About Mary (1998)<br/><br/>A goofy, mixed bag of a film, but with a few gut-ripping hilarious scenes that you can't miss. You have to like silly stuff. You have to put up with some padding here and there (I don't recommend the longer version unless you are already love the movie). And you have to turn a blind eye to political correctness (it has none, though not like Borat, which feeds off it, more just incidentally).<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is great in his own way, lovable and dull at the same time, which is the idea. The other supporting male actors are comic regulars, and not my favorites, but they do what this kind of movie needs them to do. Even Bret Favre is as stiff on camera and as beefy as a quarterback is supposed to be.<br/><br/>But there is, naturally, something about Cameron Diaz, that clicks with audiences--her cute, perky charm, most of all. That fact that all these guys like her for her looks is not the most enlightened approach to love, is it? But then, this isn't a high brow movie, or one with scruples in particular. It's a pretty clumsy movie, in many ways, just a series of gags that sometimes are just too funny for words. ""Sometimes"" being more often than a lot of other comedies."
"haggar","1","19","36","8 April 2002"," At least for me, it was like a kick in the groin
","I can imagine (although hardly) that someone would find it funny, but I found too many scenes humiliating for the viewer. Other were plain disgusting and gross.<br/><br/>I don't deny the existence of a plot and some funny moments, but unfortunately the majority of the movie is overpoweringly humiliating. I felt a sense of liberation when this whole movie started to remind me of ""Very bad things"", and not only because of the presence of Diaz. Then all hte humiliation, evil and pain emanating from the varios situations started to make some horrible sense.<br/><br/>Be very careful about deciding to watch this movie, there is a little likelyhood that you will feel beaten down, sad and engrossed, and maybe you will not even stand to see the whole of it."
"4ize","1","16","30","25 March 1999"," lame
","Unfunny, amateurish, juvenile from start to finish. These jokes and gags would have been rejected by the Three Stooges as too lame. The cast is awful. Not a single comedic talent among Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon. It seems the Farrelly brothers are the type of wits who think armpit noises are the height of comedy. No laugh is too cheap for these guys. Is it considered daring and original these days to ridicule the handicapped?"

","This has got to be one of the WORST EVER films made.<br/><br/>I gave up about 20 minutes in after I realized I was the ONLY one who did not at all see humor in the zipper-jam scene.  Instead I, with mouth agape, scanned the audience and found that everyone else was in a conniption fit of laughter. I have actually lost friends over my intense dislike of this ""movie"" and I do not at all miss them.  I also blame most of the gross-out comedies that put gross elements just for the sake of having a film with gross-out on this sick excuse for cinematic debris (I'd be giving it too much high praise if I called it a waste of talent since there is none in this turkey).<br/><br/>PS:  I know how it ends and what's in what i missed.  I feel I left at the right time."
"dorktron","1","29","61","3 August 1999"," Am I missing something?
","I'll make this quick and blunt: There's Something About Mary is a worthless movie.  The comedy is so dumb that it's annoying to view.  I laughed maybe once or twice during the movie.  Look, Ben Stiller has SPOOZE on his EAR! If only seeing something as gross and disturbing as this were entertaining to me.  One out of ten.  Too bad the rating can't go much lower.  This one was supposed to be a comedy, but it failed.  Why couldn't those two director brothers do as well as they did with Dumb and Dumber?  I fear the sequel to Something About Mary and the audience the first one drew in..."
"EThompsonUMD","9","8","13","4 February 2003"," great screwball romantic comedy
","Not having seen ""There's Something About Mary"" since its theatrical release, I sat down to watch the DVD version fearing that, as often happens in the second viewing of romantic/screwball comedies, it would not be as funny as I remembered and that I would be sadly disappointed. Happily, it was, and I wasn't. Although it lacks the satirical bite and philosophical reach of ""Harold and Maude,"" the cult '70s romantic comedy to which ""There's Something About Mary"" traces its roots and pays repeated homage, this Farrelly brothers effort shares the earlier film's genre-bending spirit, shockingly iconoclastic images, and sharply written dialog - not to mention its sidesplitting hilarity.<br/><br/>At least a half dozen scenes in ""There's Something About Mary"" still rank among the funniest I've ever encountered on film and set me off once again into uncontrollable laugh convulsions, even minus the stimulus of a roaring theater audience around me. The list must naturally begin with the prom night ""frank and beans"" in the zipper scene. Even more than the outrageousness of the central physical source of humor, what makes the scene work so spectacularly well is its pacing and the facial reactions of the various characters who enter the bathroom to observe Ted's embarrassed agony. One thing I had forgotten about the scene (or didn't notice the first time around) was how much it owes to the classic Marx Brothers' ""stateroom scene"" in ""A Night at the Opera."" In fact, I was rather surprised while listening to the Farrelly brothers' alternate soundtrack commentary that they did not mention a Marx Brothers influence either specifically on this scene or on their brand of comedy in general.<br/><br/>The film's other humorous high-points (if that's the right word), certainly include the three dog sequences (Puffy in a sedative coma/Puffy on speed/Puffy in a body cast), the hitchhiker sequence and its follow-up interrogation at police headquarters, the infamous hair gel scene, and old flame Woogie's sexual assault on Mary's closet. That these are not the sorts of subjects we feel entirely comfortable having jokes based on is precisely what makes them work so well - when they work for us at all that is. Operating on the edges of moral and social taboo the Farrelly brothers deliberately risk offense and invite charges of bad taste. Not surprisingly, therefore, almost everyone will respond to some attempts at humor in ""There's Something About Mary"" with more discomfort than elation. In addition, some comic bits in the film don't work simply because they were ill conceived or poorly acted, the leaden entry and presence of Brett Favre in the film's final scene being one such instance in my view and the whole ""pizza delivery boy"" character being another.<br/><br/>For the most part, though, things click together in ""There's Something About Mary"" with a magical charm that few American screwball comedies have ever achieved. Much of the credit for that success must be attributed not only to the clever script but to the wonderful casting/acting of Ben Stiller as the lovable schlemiel Ted Stroehmann, Cameron Diaz as the luminous dream girl Mary, and Matt Dillon as the goofy gumshoe and romantic rival Pat Healy. Chris Elliott as the stressed out fetishist/stalker Woogie and Lin Shave as Mary's Maude-like neighbor Magda also add greatly to the film's comic chemistry - as does the film's musical score, which cleverly uses the Mel Brooks device of giving ""background"" musicians an on screen presence and concludes with a full cast encore lip-syncing to ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" as the end credits roll and outtakes flash by. A unique comic gem."
"philomot","1","22","47","6 August 1999"," Remember the Porky movies?
","Yeah, those movies about a group of teens who 'discover' their sexuality. There is a scene where a woman grabs one of the boys by his genitals. When I was eleven, I thought this was very funny, even after watching it many times. Ten years later I saw the same scene and I was bored.<br/><br/>Comedy is not intended to be deep, it is primarily for amusement, and I have no problem with 'physical' comedy. I love Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, and the Zucker/Abrahams team of Airplane and Naked Gun. But TSAM is not a good movie.<br/><br/>Take away the faeces, sweat and semen and you have almost no story, no creativity and no acting. Come on let's face it. Cameron Diaz would be outacted by an ironing board, and you must have been stupid if you didn't see every joke coming from a galaxy far far away.<br/><br/>I know many people enjoyed this movie, but I think it was a bummer. I wonder if those who are laughing now will still be laughing ten years from now?"
"robinpoe","1","11","21","5 July 2005"," There's Something in the Toilet
","Please flush this movie. I would say shoot the screenwriter, but there probably wasn't one. The minimal story seems to be a poorly connected series of gross-out jokes, which could only appeal to an audience with the mental capacity of an 8-year-old male (technically not allowed to see this movie).<br/><br/>Anyone over that age will find this movie mind-numbingly tedious. The acting was either non-existent or over-the-top. None of the characters was believable. Cameron Diaz was there to strut around in skimpy outfits, which explains its eye-candy value among males.

","The first word that comes to mind with this movie is BORING. Truly boring! And pathetically disappointing! I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies over the years, and some very very funny comedies, but this one?? Where do I start? Not one scene made me laugh or even smile...not one! I am glad to see that I am not the only one here who can agree. Like some users have said: This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of the 90's. And I agree with the user who said that this is one of those movies it's ""cool to say you like"".<br/><br/>So, so true! Every now and then, movies come out that become trendy and 'everyone has to see it'. Then, as it receives much hype in press and media, I seriously believe many people are afraid to be 'different', and so they choose to say that they too thought it was good even though they keep their true opinion to themselves.

No, it was just plain UNFUNNY and so bad that I truly question what modern comedy-making has come to.

Although I'm not easily offended (I loved Pink Flamingos), I thought the way they ridiculed the man on crutches was inexcusable, and not at all funny. It made me cringe.

The ""something"" about Mary must be that; she attracts all those outlaws, who keep competing to see who is the worst idiot she has attracted. Cameron is a young doctor who does nothing related to medicine in the movie. I just did not get what is funny about this movie! Ben Stiller, who is normally a good actor, plays this loser.  In the beginning he wears this horrible wig pretending to be young and is not convincing at all. Since I did not watch Dumb and Dumber I am unable to cross reference. But my recommendation is stay away from this movie. It is awful! There is no script or point to this race of the out-laws that cute young doctor attracts. The writers seem of have simply tried to collect all the dumb gags associated with attraction to women and thrown them all together in this hodge podge script.<br/><br/>What is suprising to me is that they found someone to pay for this film to be made."

At least that film broke some new ground; MARY has much of the humor that critics who praised this film hated in films such as PORKY'S.

"mattrochman","1","6","13","14 May 2006"," Devoid of anything (full stop)
","The first time I watched it, I sat through it with my arms crossed waiting for something remotely funny to happen - and it never did! The fact that so many people found this funny goes to show you how thoughtless and pathetic the general public's taste in comedy really is. Most of the comedy was simply dumb: the fish hook in the face, restarting the dogs heart, ... all thoughtless and stupid.<br/><br/>In fact, much of the comedy was so brainless that it sunk to the levels of Australia's Funniest Home Videos (actually, that's not a fair comparison because I've actually got a few genuine laughs from Australia's Funniest Home Videos). Comedy succeeds when it is creative.... and there is nothing particularly creative about a scene where a guy getting his genitals caught in his zipper. The script-writers must have spent days thinking up that one! And on that topic, let me add that the crudeness in this film simply did not work, mostly because it was also uncreative, yet relied upon (by the film-makers) to produce memorable side-splitting scenes. And this film was a spectacular failure in this regard. The jizz hanging off the ear and the genitals in the zipper made it feel as though the film-makers were trying to ""shock"" me into laughing rather than giving me something genuinely funny to laugh at. It didn't work for me. Films like Team America:World Police managed to use crudeness incredibly well because it is original, unexpected, but runs well in the background of an excellent and intelligent satire. It isn't the centerpiece of the film's comedy. However, in There's Something About Mary, I felt that the shocking crudeness took center stage. But since the acting and dialog didn't give me any genuine laughs, what's the difference?<br/><br/>There's something about mary is a simply a cheap and worthless attempt hyping a nothing story with profanity and unfunny 'shock-the-audience-into-laughing' scenes. How it gained popularity and praise is beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>And I'm still waiting to see a Ben Stiller film that I actually like!"

The sight gags are side-splittingly funny and the physical comedy throughout is hilarious, from Matt Dillon playing ball to the legendary dog fight, it's all good. The script is great and allows all the characters to shine, but as always with films like this it's the chemistry between the leads that's the key and Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz come together with such charm and ease that it carries you along.<br/><br/>As with a number of other examples over time,such as ""Rocky"", ""Airplane"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it is clear that the Farrelly brothers had a very clear indication of what they wanted to do with comedy and put a lot of themselves in there and it shows. Their passion for their craft has never been more in evidence.<br/><br/>In an age when so many films get to the top of the box office by hype and advertising. It clawed it's way to the top because people saw it and saw it again and the reason they did that is because it is that good.<br/><br/>True the crude humour won't be to everyone's taste, but if you've got the stomach for some belly laughs and a small amount of smut, then you can't go far wrong here.<br/><br/>Megatron!"

","In the tradition of ""Dumb & Dumber"" comes the equally hilarious and demented ""There's Something About Mary"". Ben Stiller stars as a loser who wonders what might have been after he was unable to go to the prom with his true love Mary (Cameron Diaz). The reason he cannot go is an important part of the movie in itself. Fast-forward a few years and Stiller continues to think of Diaz. Of course he enlists the help of slimy private investigator Matt Dillon to find her, but a problem occurs: Dillon falls in love with Diaz. This creates a problem for Lee Evans who plays a scholar in front of Diaz but is really a simple pizza delivery man. What follows are crazy situations and oh yes, don't forget Stiller's friend Chris Elliott who has a secret of his own. The film is just amazing in its ability to make the audience laugh. Every gag works to perfection and the whole film is a test to get through because you are laughing so hard that you might miss the next gag which is coming up. The jokes come in a constant wave and the whole film is just so comical that few can question the achievement of the film-makers. 4 stars out of 5."

","There's Something About Mary is a romance and comedy film directed by the Farrelly brothers. I would say this is their second best film, next to Me, Myself & Irene. While that movie is their best because it is outrageously hysterical and very clever, this one is their second best because of it's funny and sweet love story, and has one heck of a cast that delivers great acting.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays Ted, who for 13 years has had feelings for this girl, Mary (played by Cameron Diaz). When they were both were in high school, they were going to prom, but an embarrassing accident happens with Ted, and is rushed to the hospital at that time. 13 years later, he still feels she was the perfect girl for him, and hasn't seen her since then. All he knows is she moved to Miami with her family. So then, Ted hires a guy named Pat (played by Matt Dillon) to track down Mary so that Ted can reconnect with her. However, Pat becomes attracted to Mary, lies to Ted saying she is not the same like she used to be, and develops a relationship with Mary. But then, Ted finds out the truth later on, and decides to go to Miami to visit Mary once and for all.<br/><br/>This movie (no pun intended) had something about it. And that is, it was funny, sweet, clever, and pretty watchable all the way through. The cast does a pretty good job. I liked how it was basically a love triangle with Stiller, Dillon, and Diaz. The three of them did a pretty good job doing that, and the other actors did a very fine job as well playing alongside the three main stars.<br/><br/>The story felt very complete, and even though it was nearly 2 hours long, the pacing went great.

","It has been almost proved that comedies are not as important as serious films. When you look at the greatest films ever made and critics' lists of annual best films, you'll be lucky to find one. When you do look at some of the all-time great comedies, you will find flicks like Some Like It Hot, Duck Soup, and Young Frankenstein. There's Something About Mary is one of those comedies stamped as at the level of the oldies. Some may find it funnier than others, but it is the way everything happens and the way the story unfolds that is just right.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller ditches his good looks and starts the movie in a long flashback about when he was a total geek in high school named Ted Strowman who gets a dates to the prom with the most popular and pretty girl in school: Mary. Nobody can deny how beautiful Cameron Diaz looks as Mary. Things take a disastrous turn right away after he gets his sack stuck in his fly. This is perhaps the most memorable scene and the one that rolls out the longest. Mary moves away soon after with Ted blocking the incident out of his mind. Thirteen years later, he randomly starts thinking about her and has a panic attack. That respires his interest in her and his friend (Chris Elliot) recommends Ted hires a private investigator. Ted gets sleazy Pat Healey, played awesomely by Matt Dillon. Matt Dillon is a talented actor who has scored high in both comedies and serious roles. This is his best. Mary now lives in Miami, and after a while of tracking her, Pat also falls in love with her and decides to move down there. When Ted arrives, he learns that he must compete with many men viewing for Mary.<br/><br/>The three leads in this are awesome, but it is probably Matt Dillon that was the fan favourite. The supporting cast is just as good, but it is where they fit in and who they are that drive the narrative to perfection. Some guy named ""Woogie"" fell for Mary first, but she had to get a restraining order against him; Ted fell for Mary when she moved to his town in high school; Pat fell for Mary after tailing her, and there's a slew of other memorable characters perfectly placed. Lee Evans plays a crippled man who is perhaps the smartest one in terms of getting guys away from Mary.<br/><br/>Each subplot is perfect. Learning the true state of Lee Evans' character was when I couldn't help it and my self-containment was gone. I said to myself with a huge smile: ""Oh my God this is perfect. Totally genius."" Now whenever I watch it, I laugh really hard and it makes me feel so good about myself. That's what's up with Mary, the guys want her because she makes them feel great about themselves. The movie as a whole does that to me. (Well, Mary alone does too.)<br/><br/>For a comedy to be truly great, there cant by just fart jokes. There needs to be a serious aspect and actual brains in the way the characters are written and the plot is developed. There's Something About Mary succeeds in that.<br/><br/>4/4"
"johnnyboyz","6","2","3","7 March 2012"," Hysteria aside, this is actually worth the time; a messy and full-of-mayhem piece covering several bases at once as well as certain others I'm not even sure it knows exist.
","There's Something About Mary is a healthy mix of content which doesn't really work with that of rounded, authentic laughs; of situational comedy which is most certainly at times very funny with that of meaner, cruder humour which most certainly is not. The whole thing just about forges together into a film worth one's time, although looses energy when its lead does indeed catch up with a particular girl whom he has always liked, but has nary seen for the best part of ten years. The film is well worth the effort when the humour revolving around a case of two separate instances of deceptive identity is in full flow; other things, such as dramatic reveals and twists feel present more for the absurd pomp and circumstance of it all, do not work as well. Irregardless, the film's odd air of genre hybridisation, as classical Hollywood-era noir appears to crash head on with latter-part 20th Century gross out comedic laughs, is infectious at the best times and only moderately annoying at the worst – it boils down into something worth seeing.<br/><br/>We cover a perilous and injustice-ridden quest involving Ben Stiller's rounded and generally bang-up guy, Ted Stroehmann. At the core of the film are his desperate attempts to first get back to the girl of both his youth and of his dreams in the titular Mary, before then proceed to try and win her heart all over again. Along the way, narcissistic and unpleasant men try to sabotage his chances. Mary is the woman in question, and she's played by Cameron Diaz; a woman we observe cycling in the prologue when it was still the 1980s and the main players were all still at high school. She trundles along to said place of study donning a radiant smile; beautiful hair and bright attire - her scopophilic qualities reiterated by all of those whom gaze upon her, and she blots out the unglamourous looking other women as she peddles along.<br/><br/>One of those eyeing her is Stiller's aforementioned Ted; a guy revealed to be a little different to that of the rest of the ogling kids, even if he begins out on a similar plain. This differentiation occurs when he steps in on a situation in which a boy at the school with special needs is undergoing a bit of a trauma. Helping him out and bringing calm to the situation, it transpires the boy is Mary's brother and upon thanking him for intervening, poor Ted's feelings for her are implemented to the point that the rest of his life will be largely defined her presence (or lack of) in it in some capacity. The fact the film takes Ted from sharing a domain built on voyeurism as well as an unadulterated lust to know Mary more personally before, most likely, move onto the next woman, and then onto the places he eventually ends up helps move the film away from accusations of it being crasser than it actually is.<br/><br/>Things kick off when Ted scores a date to the school-ending prom for his actions involving Mary's sibling, although it all goes spectacularly wrong when he heads over to pick her up and ends in such a disaster that he does not see her again for the duration that allows him to get to the age of being the late-twenty-something-year-old author he is. Desperate, he hires Matt Dillon's private detective Pat Healy to find her and report back. Dillon plays a man with a big gold watch; a little tickle moustache; nudey calenders on the walls of his office and a set of general characteristics that just scream ""avoid"". What Healy does is bend the reality of Mary's looks and situation to allow for him to advance on the unbeknown Mary himself, something made more complicated by the presence of Lee Evans' character: a paraplegic English academic. Acting out of fondness, Ted takes to the road and goes to find her anyway.<br/><br/>From this premise, The American filmmaking duo of The Farrelly brothers spin an often humorous film within which we are surprised by how much we actually come to care for what transpires. The Farrelly's actually do well to demonstrate their credentials as filmmakers and prove their ability to time a joke, thus moving the film away from just a flurry of cheap puns more suited to a secondary school playground, during the set up wherein there is a particular edit so well timed that the laugh is in the cut itself and manages to draw attention away from what was otherwise meant to be an instance in which the reveal of a man's semi-veiled genitalia filling the frame was designed to induce giggles. Most of the film's energy, though, does indeed derive from these early segments when we will Stiller on to get to where Mary is and in Dillon's laughable facade. The film could almost certainly be recommended on a level of laughs, in spite of its often veering sources for these laughs; but it is the bends and curves in the narrative as things develop, twinned with one of the more likable leads from memory driving a film of this ilk, which keep it treading water."

","Our ""culture"" is at present at the nadir of this millennium in terms of art, music, quest for knowledge, philosphy and most other like measures.  To us, we're vapidly thrilled when Erkyl prances about, when some poor sap takes a baseball to the groin and it's caught on video and when the atonal dissonance of Nirvana blasts at us on MTV.  Having said this, it is perfectly understandable why the Gen-X dominated masses rated this putrid, purile movie as highly as they did.<br/><br/>This movie was so bad that ""reprehensible"" does not go far enough as an apt description.  I've only seen one other movie in which I felt similarly moved to just walk out of the theater in silent protest to the terrible moviemaking I was so unfortunate to have witnessed.  Don't believe the slack-jawed uninformed when deciding whether or not to see this film -- avoid it, take a wide berth around it and go see ANYTHING else.<br/><br/>Now, the typical response to those of us who found this movie to be incredibly bad in all respects is that we are ""bible thumpers"" or can't respect the anti-political correctness the movie adheres to.  Sure we can. It's just a fascinatingly bad moive. The specific vulgarities were nauseating, yes (the sperm in the hair perhaps being the topper), but the real objection is in that EVERYONE in the entire movie is a complete and utter reprobate,  from Ben Stiller's imbecilic character to Cameron Diaz's sexy but senseless (she's a doctor?  Give me a break) character.  And those were the two most intelligent characters in the entire movie.  The remaining coterie of scumbags aren't worth mentioning.  And the final scene, where she throws over $10 million/year Brett Favre for our ""hero""?

Cameron Diaz was superb in her role as Mary and the actor who played her brother was an excellent addition to the movie because he played his part as a disabled man really well. I'm not a real huge Matt Dillon fan and his role in this movie didn't do much to change my mind. He was very despicable as the sleazy private investigator who has the task of tracking the high school crush down; however, what he doesn't tell Ted when he does find her makes this film more interesting. <br/><br/>Who would think that this film has twists that would blow the audience away; it does and not just one, it has two.

Now grown up he tries to track her down by hiring a Private Detective played by Matt Dillon who also falls madly in love with Mary along with a couple of more guys and Ted has to wonder will he ever be with Mary or not?<br/><br/>
Overall from start to finish this film was hilarious. The opening with Ben Stiller wearing braces and getting his privates caught in his zipper of the trousers cracked me up and Keith David(who plays Cameron Diaz's stepdad in this film) with his reaction to it was hilarious. Another was about the dog who took a sleeping pill and the Private Detective had to try and bring him back to life again. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz was very well played as I love both actors having grown up watching these two evolve(I think this film introduced me to Ben Stiller,while The Mask was the film that introduced me to her as that was her film debut with Jim Carrey in 1994).<br/><br/>Now I know what your saying is it as funny as Dumb & Dumber.....not quite but it does come in a close second to that film.<br/><br/>

It hasn't really aged at all and still competes with (and beats) any comedy of today.<br/><br/>Along with a great soundtrack, the movie has perhaps the best end credits ever seen in a movie (Hall Pass sequence is up there, better than the Hall Pass movie itself perhaps).

Well worth a watch or one of those films you can put on and laugh at again after an interval thumbs up from me. This will be one of the films Cameron Diaz will be most remembered for.

"AudioFileZ","9","1","1","13 August 2015"," A Comedy I Absolutely Love
","This movie needs another review like California needs a drier climate. Seriously, I can't help myself because this might just be my favorite comedy of all time.<br/><br/>This is the perfect storm of political incorrectness matching the talents of Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott,Cameron Diaz, and The Farrelly Brothers hitting everyone's sweet-spot all at once. Then there's the devices of Jonathan Richman's surreal interjection and the musical soundtrack itself. What a great atmosphere to spring a hilarious story from! Plus, for all the ""take no prisoner's"" satire there's an actual heart too. <br/><br/>The movie moves quite well as it paints loser Ted growing up, finding his love, tripping everything up (as expected, yet hilariously not as expected), and never forgetting aboutMary. The journey he takes is absolute gold. So many funny things making repeated viewing not just mandatory, but even better.<br/><br/>Now, I think I must admit this kind of comedy isn't so wonderfully entertaining to everyone. In fact, it's kind of a cult group who, many years later, still count this as a comedic watershed moment. But, if you like it in the first 15-minutes then it just gets better and you know who you are. I wish this kind of magic could be more of regular thing. I mean The Farrelly's were really on to something here. I've enjoyed many of their other movies such as Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself, and Irene (this one almost as much). But, as of 2014 the latest version of D&DTo (liked it well enough, not great though) makes it clear there's been a big void in the years since. I'll just watch this again to help fill it in! It's that good in my humble opinion."
"Stompgal_87","8","1","1","10 August 2013"," A funny and gross rom-com where Diaz, Stiller and Dillon well and truly shine
","I first heard of this film when I was in my first year at secondary school, even though I was too young to watch it at that time, upon seeing a promotional poster for this film and it was also the first time I'd ever heard of Cameron Diaz, who is one of my all-time favourite actresses. I finally saw this film when I was 15 when my mum bought the video shortly before Diaz's 30th birthday and I bought the DVD myself a couple of months after.<br/><br/>While this film has a lot of funny moments, there are a couple of scenes I didn't like such as the ""frank and beans"" in the zipper scene in the 1985 flashback and another scene that had excessive swearing. I did, however, like the infamous 'hair gel' scene that was parodied in the music video to 'Say You'll Be Mine' video by Steps (one of my favourite pop groups) where Claire Richards was Cameron Diaz/Mary and Lee Latchford Evans was Ben Stiller/Ted. The majority of the flashback was watchable with the exception of the ""frank and beans"" scene I've already mentioned and the scenes involving the mishaps of Puffy the Border terrier being drugged up by Pat were hilarious if sad and hysterical but the first instance of this ended on a cute note when Pat had him ""wrapped up like a baby"" much to Magda's delight. Although Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are the standouts, I also liked the support from Lee Evans as Tucker, Lin Shaye as Magda and W Earl Brown as Mary's brother Warren.<br/><br/>Overall this is a funny film that has its fair share of memorable moments, romance and gross-out humour. 8/10."
"antonio_motag","8","1","1","7 August 2013"," How haven't I heard about this movie?
","To be honest, I always try to avoid movies with Ben Stiller. I can't explain it. Maybe because I really hated a movie with him or something similar.I watched this movie yesterday and it really surprised me.It has the same plot and setting as most of the comedies with him but with great jokes and scenes. Not the usually low comedy you see everyday. Cameron Diaz was also a part of this perfect puzzle. Her beauty and talent keeps fascinating me in a way that rare actors do. Even being predictable, this movie never fails to make you laugh. I have found really difficult to find movies like this. I truly recommend it to anyone. Proof that good movies don't need special effects and violence to be enjoyed."
"Electrified_Voltage","6","1","1","19 July 2011"," A second viewing was definitely better for me than the first, but I still don't exactly get its reputation
","This Farrelly brothers comedy was a huge success, and I clearly remember knowing about it and seeing that famous cover image of Cameron Diaz in the role of Mary back in 1998, but I was too young for R-rated movies at the time. I finally saw ""There's Something About Mary"" for the first time early last year, and knowing how popular it was, I had pretty high expectations, but was REALLY let down! I thought it was easily the most overrated comedy I had ever seen, and didn't get why it had gotten so much praise! After that, I had no intention of watching it again. I just wrote a bad review of it and then moved on. However, I recently decided to give it another try, though I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the first time. I think it turned out to be above average for me this time, which was more than I expected.<br/><br/>In 1985, Ted is a high school student and has a crush on a popular girl named Mary. He gets a date to go to the prom with her, but unfortunately, after a terrible zipper accident at Mary's house, the date is cut short! Ted has to go to the hospital before he gets to go to the prom with his new girlfriend. Thirteen years later, he hasn't seen Mary since that ambulance took him away, but still can't get her off his mind. He is still in love with her, so he hires a private investigator named Pat Healy to find her and get information about her for him. Pat discovers that Mary is now an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami. She lives with her significantly older roommate, Magda, and a Border Terrier dog named Puffer. It turns out that Ted is in luck, as Mary is still single as well, but Pat finds himself falling in love with her. He lies to Ted about her so he can win her heart without any trouble, and it turns out Ted really shouldn't have hired this guy!<br/><br/>Even during my second viewing, I was only finding occasional mildly amusing parts around the beginning. I didn't find Mary's mentally handicapped brother, Warren, being assaulted after being tricked into saying, ""Have you seen my wiener?"" very funny, and still didn't the second time, which was not surprising. I also still just didn't find Warren to be a very funny character. The first BIG laugh I found the second time was Mary's stepfather pulling Ted's leg at the door, and I remember finding that funny the first time as well. It's also funny when Ted is seen urinating through the window, but this leads to the genital/zipper accident, which I found more painful to watch than anything I had ever seen in a comedy before! I'm not sure exactly why, since I had previously seen male genital injuries in comedy, but maybe it's because the one here was longer than any I had seen before, and I found that it got increasingly uncomfortable up to the ""We've got a bleeder"" quote! The second time, I knew it was coming, so it wasn't nearly as bad, but it was still another part I didn't find very funny. After that, I found some good laughs occasionally during my second viewing, but was still finding the film boring for the most part and no more than average, even though I was definitely laughing more than I did the first time. Like the first time, I still thought the sex soliciting scene was pretty lame. Eventually, however, I found that the plot somehow got more entertaining the second time I watched this 1998 romantic comedy. I even found the semen hair gel segment pretty funny, and I don't recall finding it funny at all the first time! <br/><br/>After two viewings of this hit romantic comedy from the controversial Farrelly brothers, I still can't say I understand all the high praise, but after seeing it a second time, I can't call it a bad movie anymore, nor can I even call it a mediocre movie, even if I still think it comes close to that. Even though Ted getting his genitals caught in his zipper still didn't amuse me too much the second time, and I still found the close-up of it unsettling (good thing that shot is VERY brief), I don't quite despise that part as much as I used to. It is now another comedy I can refer to as a mixed blessing. Since ""There's Something About Mary"" is from Peter and Bobby Farrelly, you're absolutely right if you assume that it's very raunchy, often juvenile, and irreverent, and as popular as it is, it could easily disgust many viewers. I don't think the movie is NEARLY as funny as maybe most others who have seen it do, but won't just advise everyone to just skip it, either."

","I didn't know what to expect going in to see this flick - I saw it the first day it came out with my brother and all we knew were the actors and the Farrelly's other flicks. It was good. Matt Dillon was the standout - he's still one of the best young actors who doesn't get recognized as much as he should. The gel scene and the dog on fire scene were great, but some stuff like the fish hook scene and the singers were just stupid. The whole deal with her retarded brother was just offensively bad - the only thing that was funny was Dillon's failed pick-up line ""I work with retards"" which showed how scummy his character was rather than poke cheap laughs at the disabled. Stiller was good, Diaz was tolerable. The Chris Elliott boil thing was just gross. Kingpin was better, even Dumb and Dumber had its moments. It's funny but don't expect to be laughing the whole way through without wincing at the lousy parts. I think it did so well because of the whole love story plot which brought the gals into the theater with the boys for some gross-out humor. 7 out of 10."

I fail to see how you can't ""get"" the jokes, and whilst it may not be the most intellectually stimulating film ever made, it does what it sets out to do - gets the audience laughing.  No pretense, no deep sub-plots (indeed, the romance element at the end is as twee and predictable as ever), it's a comedy.  And a fine one at that.  If you're ever depressed, see it.  You'll wind up smiling."
"Jeremy-4","6","9","25","18 March 1999"," That's A Sore Point
","I shall assume that most people know the basic plot of this romantic comedy about a man trying to track down his High School sweetheart and cut directly to the chase. This is not nearly as good a film as the critics would have you believe. The styles that make up this film (gross out comedy and romantic fluff) really do not work together. The result is a film that, like some of the characters, is schizophrenic. However, there are many good points to be going on with.<br/><br/>In many places the film is very, very, funny. The infamous `trapped in trouser-fly' scene is cleverly put together, and the whole 1985 prologue is extremely well thought-out. Keith David walks away with the acting honours for the whole movie as Mary's black step-father, who also gets the best line: `Don't make me open a can of Whoop-ass now!'. Bad taste proliferates here like fungus in a petri dish. A dog is poisoned, resuscitated with an electric cord, set on fire and fed Speed, there is some terrifying nudity, and the hair-gel sequence has already passed into American movie folklore. Do not watch this film if you are easily offended. The performances are not bad in general, but there is something lacking. Ben Stiller gets surprisingly little to do, and Lee Evans' American accent is very bad for such a talented comedian. On the other hand, Diaz is surprisingly good, making the best of a badly written character.<br/><br/>The Farellys seem to think that they can handle the gentler sections, but the opposite is unfortunately the case. They are incapable of the softer scenes between Stiller and Diaz, and constantly inject humour into all the wrong places. On the whole the film is quirky, with popular folk singer Jonathan Richman narrating through song and getting shot at the end. If you don't expect too much from this then you will enjoy yourself, particularly if you see it with friends as I did. But when the trailers are more exciting than the film itself, you can't help thinking twice about whether you should have seen Armageddon instead."

","Despite a disastrous prom date, Ted is still pining for his high school sweetheart Mary 13 years later.  Hearing she is in Miami she hires a private detective to find out more about her to help him get the courage to go and meet her again.  However the detective starts to fall for Mary and uses his information to get close to her.  On discovering this Ted sets out by road to meet Mary himself  assuming he can get there in one piece.<br/><br/>I usually like to write a little about the plotting of any film I review and weight it on it's relative merits but can I do that here? The plot is unimportant compared to the importance of OTT and tasteless jokes and routines that the script allows. So in terms of plot - who cares who ends up with Mary or any detail like that, this is all about the comedy. It is pretty funny but it depends on your taste. Suffice to say that fans of Noel Coward, Oscar Wilde or Woody Allen might find this a little below them. This is not the film to check out if you're looking for wit or intelligent humour. Instead this is where you want to go for the most basic of crude jokes and silly physical comedy.<br/><br/>However I don't mean to sound snobbish like this sort of thing is just tasteless and rubbish. Instead it is very funny at some key stages. I defy you not to laugh at some of the more outrageous or exaggerated physical routines - the dog or the prom date are two of the best. More than that the film has added lots of touches which just add to the material even if they aren't logical, for example the wandering band or the final scene with the old man on the balcony are two good examples of weird little add-ons that just are funny because they are not within the reality of the film. Of course, taste has left the building and many people may find it too basic or not like laughing as one of the characters on crutches tries to pick something up off the floor or laughing at Mary's mentally slow brother.<br/><br/>The cast do well.  Stiller plays well in his usual sort of role (see Meet the Parents etc) and Dillon hams it up to great effect in a role outside of his normal type of stuff.  Diaz is pretty good and it's nice o see her make fun of herself.  Evans is very funny as Norman and his physical comedy skills are put to good effect in some scenes where `you know you SHOULDN'T laugh'  but you do.<br/><br/>Overall this is trashy low-brow comedy.  It is in poor taste for the majority of the film and the targets are often easy.  However I defy you not to laugh during the film  it may never be viewed as art but dammit, it's funny for the majority of the time."

","Years after a disastrous date with the high school beauty queen, a nerd hires a private detective to find her. The film has some amusing moments (Stiller wrestling a little dog, the famous hair gel scene), but the pacing is too lethargic for a comedy and it goes on much too long. The humor is sophomoric, which is fine if the gags are funny but for the most part they are not. Diaz displays a fine flair for comedy. This role served as a blueprint for Stiller's career while the film did so for the Farrelly Brothers (who'll never be confused for the Coen Brothers). Dillon seems to be having fun. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the audience."
"Tucker_Keon","10","3","6","23 September 2008"," There's something about the '90s, huh?
","I was about 13 or 14 when my family and I checked this flick out at the theater (I have hip folks, what can I say!). Zippers, hair-gel, Ben Stiller, and that crazy bro. Mary had - it's the late '90s, so put on your zoot suit, and pull a comb through your coal-black hair! Much of ""Something About Mary's"" humor is about ""sticky"" situations, and I mean this literally and figuratively. . . It's crude (what other movie ends with the dialogue, ""I was only bonin' you to get to Mary?""), you bet - but it also has a charming good-naturedness about it that later, more cynical exercises in gross-out comedy (i.e. the ""American Pie"" trilogy) would lack. In fact, remember that guy from high school who was always trying way too hard to be the class clown? ""American Pie,"" and especially its sequels, are like that guy. His freshness wore out quickly, and he eventually became a self-conscious parody of himself. The plot of ""Mary"" essentially revolves around a group of love-hungry boobs who desperately want to hook up with Mary. Stiller was her high-school prom-date; Chris Elliot was her college boyfriend, etc. Each guy tries to sabotage the other guys, and Mary is stuck in the middle of their kooky antics. Simple? Yes - but ""Mary's"" not supposed to be a weighty Oscar juggernaut steeped in critic-baiting societal metaphors - it's supposed to be fun. And trust me, it totally succeeds, here. So, why should you check out ""There's Something About Mary"" now, instead of the more recent ""Pie"" movies, and such? ""Mary"" goes down like a bubbly can of sparkling Cherry Coke (or Surge, if you remember that! Damn, that was good stuff!), complete with a nostalgic buzz. Think blue skies, and an optimistic, pre-Bush America. ""Pie,"" and recent movies like it, go down like hard swallows from a plastic bottle of some over-syruppy, hyper-commericalized energy drink. Think smart-allecky smirks, and greasy foreheads. Which would you prefer? So, check ""Mary"" out - She was hot then, and she's still hot today."

","Ted (Ben Stiller) has been in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) since High School, and thirteen years later, he is realising his life is going nowhere because of it. He decides to track her down, using the help of a top-notch private investigator named Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), and try to rebuild the relationship they once had. But when the investigator also falls in love with Mary, it isn't easy for Ted to find his lost love, and madness follows, all about Mary.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller had a very impressive chemistry together, and I always think of this as one of Diaz's best roles. She was a very good Mary, and she made the character very likable with her charming smile. I found there to actually be something about her, but maybe it was just the way they portrayed her. Ben Stiller was mediocre, but does provide some very funny moments and contributes immensely to the film. The way he voiced it over was also a good touch. I thought Matt Dillon as the private detective was a great choice and he was an good villain, though a little too creepy. All the other actors were excellent in their parts, (especially the seven-minute abs guy, who was hilarious).<br/><br/>The only problem with this movie, and it is a small one, was how 9/10 of the sequences in the film aren't 'laugh out loud funny'. I found a lot of the film to to be entertaining, and/or sweet, but not a lot of it made me actually laugh my guts out. Another thing I found annoying, how they said the F word in nearly every sentence. I felt they overused it, in some parts of the movie was necessary to curse, but the majority of the time it seemed fake and tacky when the characters swore. I mean, it would have been just as funny without that much swearing.<br/><br/>A little raunchy, but very entertaining."

All in all this a hilliarou comedy! One to have in your collection!

"AleaClint","6","2","4","2 October 2008"," Just Wild About Mary
","This is the Farrelly brothers' masterwork following their other great comedies, ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"". At this film's heart it's just a sweet love story, leavened with scenes of low humor. The Farrellys navigate successfully the fine line between being laugh-out-loud funny and just plain gross superbly. They are abetted by a superb cast. Ben Stiller's nebbishy character get's tiresome in a lot of his films but he is somewhat endearing here. Cameron Diaz is effervescent here as the object of everybody's affection. Matt Dillon has never been better as the sleazy private detective(where's he been lately?). This film may have been a case of the Farrellys being too successful because their subsequent efforts have fallen short of the mark(though I'm one of the few champions of ""Me, Myself, and Irene"". It's not as bad as some would say). On a final note if anybody's interested in who the minstrel is who provides running commentary throughout the film his name is Jonathan Richman. Richman and his band the Modern Lovers made a classic self-titled rock album in 1972. Richman was something of an eccentric. After the cult success of their initial album, Richman eschewed rock music and went on to make children's records. If anybody's interested though, the Modern Lovers' first album is well worth checking out."

","This was a film that I very first see as a teenager around two years after its release when it was first televised....back then I found it 'quite funny and a film that had its own style' though now after watching it the second time around in 2018 I can truly appreciate what a well written and distinct comedy it is and though it fits that 'goofy comedy' genre, there is no film quite like it, it makes me wish the 'Farrelly Brothers' still had the spark to produce good films (especially comparing to 'Stuck On You' and my recent first watch of 'Dumb and Dumber 2' which was underwhelming).
Firstly I'v noticed a few reviews on here with concerns over the film containing 'toilet humour' and 'insensitivity', this indeed is true, there are many moments of both crudeness and narcissism. 
In terms of the crude humour, these are simply light hearted quick laugh scenarios built around a well written comedy that otherwise uses good understanding and comedy around in depth concepts such as 'want', 'loneliness', 'motives', 'greed', 'kindness', 'true love', 'lust' 'social indifference' and the 'relatability between the cultural stereotypes involved despite them being different'. The characters written into the story strongly portray these aspects well and the way the story is structured shows hallmarks of good writing with a story that progresses with the 'game of chess' power struggle between the hapless characters as new info comes to light for them and they take steps to obtain their goal.
In terms of the insensitivity, though the film portrays unsavoury characters that are for example 'misogynistic' or 'insulting of disabled people' , it clearly in no way 'condones or glorifies it', in fact it does quite the opposite, it observes narcissistic attitudes in a comical way using the medium of these desperate characters ultimately coming unstuck; the film also contains strong 'empathic characters' who 'stick up for the little guy' and have more noble motives to their gains of which the film ultimately 'roots for' and centres around, as well as the other plainly 'quirky characters' who are simply 'up against it' and are somewhere in the middle.
As mentioned before, the film very much has its 'own feel and style' which in this new age of mostly 'accepted and often blindly defended uniform mediocrity' when it comes to the feel and style around art, shows a good example of a film to take notes from for a production that shows good individualality, character and distinct feeling to it, which are often traits which make films memorable cult classics such as what this has become."

","There's Something About Mary (1998): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot: Hilarious comedy about attraction. Mary is the obsession of several scheming males but only one poises sincerity. Cameron Diaz plays Mary, the dream girl of Ben Stiller. He was set to take her to the prom until an accident involving his zipper prevented it. After thirteen years he seeks her whereabouts through a sleazy investigator who does find her but deceives Stiller with wrong information when he decides to pursue her. This leads to a road trip of embarrassing mishaps. Vulgar yet sincere storytelling by Bobby and Peter Farrelly who previously made the excellent Kingpin as well as the hilarious Dumb and Dumber. Both directors not only pull off great comic writing but also the ultimate date movie since it can easily appeal to both genders. Stiller is a great foil as the lovesick hero but it is his sincerity that is the heart of the movie. Cameron Diaz glows as the free spirited Mary even during a tasteless hair gel scene. Matt Dillon is hilarious as the investigator deceiving his way into Mary's life. Lee Evans plays the handicapped Tucker detecting competition. Chris Elliot plays Dom, Stiller's best friend who has a fetish for womens' footwear, and a problem with hives. It regards our intentions in relationships resulting in pure comic fun. Score: 10 / 10"
"Tweekums","7","0","0","3 December 2014"," A crude but amusing romantic comedy
","Sixteen year old Ted can't believe his luck when the beautiful Mary invited him to the school prom but things go disastrously when he gets caught in his zipper and ends up in an ambulance rather than going to the prom! Sixteen years later he is still obsessed with Mary even though he hasn't seen her since that dreadful night. His friend Dom says he knows private investigator who can find her; Ted hires the man, Healy, and he soon reports that she is now living in Miami, has four kids by three fathers and looks like a whale only one of these details is true; she is in Miami but she is still beautiful and childless so beautiful in fact that sleazy Healy sets about wooing her. Having eaves-dropped her conversations he presents himself as the perfect man for her. There are problems for Healy though, a friend of Mary sees that he is a fraud and Ted decides that he'd like to see Mary again whatever she looks like.<br/><br/>This is probably not the rom-com to buy your mother for Christmas unless she enjoys jokes about blokes getting their genitals caught is their zips, a woman accidentally using semen as hair gel or dogs being drugged and nearly dying. If that sort of crudeness offends then it is best to avoid this but if not there should be enough laughs to be had. The story itself is standard rom-com fare; boy loves girl but she is in love with the wrong guy it is just that the laughs along the way are often in poor taste but some of those poor taste moments are the films funniest; although dog-lovers may disagree. Ben Stiller does a decent enough job as nice-guy Ted, even if he looked ridiculous when playing him aged sixteen. Cameron Diaz shines as the eponymous Mary but it is Matt Dillon who steals the show as Healy making the sleazy character almost likable due to the shear outrageousness of his actions. Overall if you are looking for some lowbrow humour you could do a lot worse than watch this."
"yashvardhan","10","0","0","18 May 2014"," Love story with a twist!
","Coming off with hits like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"", audience must have expected funny but juvenile and uncomfortable scenes from Farrelly brothers .But what they did not expect was a mature and sweet love story. Sure this is a romantic movie. But this is not another clichéd love story. No, this is a romantic movie with twist. It contains elements of a black comedy as well as a mindless gross-out teen sex comedy (of which I am a big fan) Though the main plot is not new, how it is executed is. The best part of the movie is its unpredictability. You actually wonder whether the boy will get the girl or not? The movie shocks you not only with its brilliant twists-and-turns but also with its grossness. This movie is quite re-watchable even if it loses shock value after you have seen it many times. Those who are fan of the first three ""American Pie"" movies will quite appreciate its humor. Though the gags may not be as disgusting or sexual like the 1999 American Pie, they are still funny and memorable. Some of them are so funny that your stomach will hurt from laughter even if you know what is going to happen. Even if you don't like its humor, you will still like the movie for its memorable character, brilliant pacing, nice music and believable acting, which is done by everyone in cast. Be warned this movie is not for everyone due to its vulgarity and political incorrectness."

","""There's Something About Mary"" is a comedy and romance movie which has to do with a man who gets a chance to meet his dream girl from high school and in his date comes the disaster. We also watch in this movie how was this disaster and how he wants to comeback stronger and surest.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline. I also liked the direction of Bobby Farrelly's and Peter Farrelly's. I believe that the interpretation of Cameron Diaz who plays as Mary was simply great and Ben Stiller's who plays as Ted was equally great. Another good interpretation made by Matt Dillon who plays as Healy.<br/><br/>Lastly I have to tell you that ""There's Something About Mary"" is a really nice movie which I believe you will love, it combines romance and love with comedy and laugh."

However, the detective also fancy her, so they two starts trying to get her.<br/><br/>I like Cameron Diaz. She is very cute and being a tomboy in this movie.

","I have watched this movie at least five times because I laugh so much each time I watch it. The plot was written well and the storyline seems reasonable. Having the characters with Brett Farve as himself works in this movie though this can be hard to pull off.<br/><br/>The cast shines beginning with Cameron Diaz who exudes attractiveness and charm. Thus we can easily understand all her ""suitors"" and why they are infatuated with her. Ben Stiller's self effacing and not confident character works well with Diaz' character.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast especially Matt Dillon, provide solid support for Stiller and Diaz. Most of the scenes are crazy funny. For example, we learn that when Magda's dog meets Mary's date for the first time they know he is a bad guy if the dog reacts negatively to him. So to get the dog in a crazy mood Matt Dillon (Pat Healy) and Lee Evans (Tucker) toss some dog treats laced with speed through the window and Magda and her dog ingest the speed. When Mary brings Ted over to her home for the first time, Magda is vacuuming like crazy and even lifts the couch with one hand. You can here the dog growling from the bathroom. Mary goes to talk to Magda and find out what's wrong and she asks Ted to get the dog. Ted gets nervous and asks about the breed and she says the breed and that the dog is like Benji. So Ted opens the door and sweetly tells the dog to come to him and the dog leaps onto him in full attack mode. That scene of physical humor ends with the dog leaping out of the window. My daughter and I laughed big belly laughs all during that scene.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me why I love watching movies. When you find one like this one you really get to appreciate all the artistic and creative efforts that came together to make such an entertaining comedy."

","There's something about Mary. But there's something missing about Mary, too. Many reviews were promising unending laughs while viewing this film. They were promising a new surprise every few minutes, hilarious and provocating fun from the Farrellys. Everybody was speaking about the cojones-munching dog, the zip scene or a particular kind of gel, and I expected other gags like these to be contained in the film. Unfortunately, all the scenes people were speaking about were all the scenes that were worth seeing... (okay, I'd enjoy a marathon of Bergman movies if they were acted by Cameron Diaz, but it doesn't matter...) After all, the so called ""innovative"" humour of the film, the gags everybody would be indigned to see were not so innovative. Kevin Smith movies are more laughable than this ""Mary"" on that part...

The aspect of the movie that I found most amusing was when Matt Dillon was talking to Mary outside the driving range and was describing how he looked after this 'gifted' child called Mongo.  Another aspect that I found funny, that I'm sure that many people will have overlooked for the more obvious comical values of the film was the people that sung the songs in between each scene.

The plot is the framework of your basic romcom, although with a lot more references to the things which go on in privacy, if you catch my drift :-) Basically, every male in the film wants Cameron Diaz's Mary (and who can blame them?). Who does she end up with? Well its pretty obvious, but I won't spoil it for you. Something about Mary is a great lighthearted film- something to see if you've just watched 'Saving Private Ryan'.

","THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY stars Cameron Diaz as the alluring title character who briefly dates, and forever haunts, an awkward and somewhat withdrawn high school student (Ben Stiller) who grows up to think that he might just be man enough to settle an unresolved enterprise of the heart. He hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to track down the grown-up Mary and, yup, you guessed it, the investigator develops a ""private eye"" for the intriguing Mary and poses as an architect after he spies on her and overhears her describing her ideal man.<br/><br/>Adolescent bathroom humor is elevated almost to the level of high art by the screwball antics of this film.  There's a gross-out zipper gag; there's a bit about a fish-hooked lip; and, for toppers, there's an incident involving the strangest ""hand-made"" hair-gel you ever saw.  But, craftily woven through the racey, risque humor is a tender, romantic story, and a cleverly teeter-tottering, high-wire balancing act that makes us question where sentimental affectation ends and stalking begins.  The comedy isn't always low brow; the film-makers sometimes betray an underlying sophisticated streak, as with their use of a recurring modern, Greek chorus (Jonathan Richman and Tommy Larkins) that becomes a running gag throughout the film. This meandering interplay, of borderline humor that includes intense physical comedy and politically incorrect jokes about handicaps and mental retardation versus the more refined touches that actually take characters' feelings into account, adds to the rising tension of the film and makes MARY a superior speciman of the Farrelly Brothers' brand of humor -- perhaps, the zenith of the DUMB AND BUMBER school (if such a seemingly-oxymoronic name for a genre can be allowed)."

"Scorpio6-2","6","0","0","12 September 1998"," Good... but a little disappointing
","This movie is probably the surprise hit of the summer, which I'm sure is due in part to it's advertising campaign.  Don't get me wrong, it was a funny movie, but I have to say I walked out of the theater a little disappointed. The reason?  The television commercials for 'Mary' were way too revealing, in other words I had seen almost all of the funny parts on tv before even seeing the film (the zipper, the dog, the hair gel, to name a few).  It was like knowing the outcome of a mystery story before even reading the book. While the ads did get me to spend some bucks to see the film (the ultimate goal of the ads), I sat there thinking ""ok, I've already seen this part, show me something new"".  Unfortunately, there were very few of those ""new"" parts.  Cameron Diaz is definitely the high point of the film.  She is a very good comedic actress.  Of course it doesn't hurt that she is also very beautiful too.  I look for her to really become one of the better actresses around in the coming years.  Matt Dillon was also surprisingly good as a sleazy private eye.  A low point was the totally unfunny Chris Elliot.  I'm not sure if it was the character he played, or himself, but anytime he was on the screen it detracted from the story.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I would rate this film about a 6 out of 10."

"pgmcrk","Null","0","0","9 September 1998"," The basic laugh...
","Whoa! This movie is the most recent release from the Farrelly brothers, (Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin!), and it is just as bizarre as their previous releases.  The movie is short on plot and long on bizarre, unbelievable gags.  They don't pull any punches and go for laughs in places that most would consider taboo.  It's refreshing and surprising but I'm sure it does make a number of people angry too.  There is the ""clean the pipes"" incident , the fish hook incident which was shown in the movie previews before the actual release, and Matt Dillon's go around with HUGE teeth.  All together, this is really a stupid movie.  A stupid-funny movie.  Don't go expecting ANYTHING or you will be disappointed.  If you go to see this movie with no expectations you may just come out pleasantly surprised.  The most noteworthy thing to talk about in this movie, (other than the already well talked about scenes I mentioned earlier), is the performance of W. Earl Brown as Mary's handicapped brother, Warren.  This character is really the catalyst for this whole film, as he is ""protected"" by Ben Stiller's character in the film and then Cameron Diaz's character asks him to the prom.  His part is small but quite funny, assuming you don't mind the handicapped humor which they throw in with all the other cheap humor going on around him.  Beware of the bathroom scenes in this movie, they are pretty vivid and graphic...and, of course, basically--very basically- -funny."

The high school guys look funny, Warren wanting a piggy back ride is funny, and the zipper scene will go down as one of the funniest scenes in movie history.  This is an instant comedy classic, but will probably be considered as gross and stupid by the over 40 bunch.  I'm sure as heck not in that group!

Sure it was about stalkers but poltical correctness is not a good thing, and that is what this movie is against.  I know people who were offended by it big time, but still laughed at it.

To those who hate low-brow humor and gross-out gags, why don't you get them? I say you should lighten up and enjoy yourselves.  Let loose.

In fact, the only movie I can think of that made me laugh harder was Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which is saying quite a bit considering how many comedies I see).<br/><br/>The film is about a rather, to put it bluntly, obsessed guy played by Ben Stiller who thinks about little besides his high school sweetheart (Cameron Diaz) years later. He hires a private investigator (Matt Dillon) to check up on her. The P.I. falls for her and tries to keep Stiller's character, Ted, from going to see her.<br/><br/>A couple of warnings in advance about this film. If you find sexual humor of any sort to be offensive, do not see this movie. Also, don't see it on a full stomach because you might lose your last meal from laughing so hard and because of some of the more gruesome sites (Cameron's neighbor... *shudders*)The only complaint I had with the entire movie was the ending, which seemed a like something of a cop out. This is the only reason why it missed a four star rating.<br/><br/>* * * - great movie, go see it"

","The best compliment that I can give is that every member of my family loved this movie.  My mother, who normally gasps at fart jokes, couldn't stop laughing.  My older brother quotes the ""Brett Fav-rah"" line.  My sister wasn't difficult, considering she thinks ""Dumb and Dumber"" is high-class comedy.  My dad, who didn't crack a smile when Ace Ventura sang operettas from his derriere, rolled out of his chair at the sight gags.

"Michael_Pilkington","Null","0","0","15 March 1999"," Stupid, gross comedy with heart
","There's something about this movie that made me laugh.  Maybe it's the clumsiness of a geek named Ted (Ben Stiller) who has a crush on Mary (Cameron Diaz).  Or maybe it's the mean spirited jokes on gays and disabled (Mary's brother happens to be mentally retarded).  The first twenty minutes starts off really funny and then it gets to the point of the story.  Ted fails to take Mary to the prom because of a ""predicament"" that he put himself in.  Thirteen years later, Ted still has feelings for Mary and decides to hire a double crossing detective named Pat (Matt Dillon) to find her.  Pat finds Mary and falls in love with her.  When Ted doesn't hear back from Pat, he finds Mary himself and tries to rekindle their relationship. The Farrely brothers finally do a movie that's really funny; it's better than ""Dumb and Dumber.""  My evaluation:  *** out of ****."

","This is by far the funniest and daring movie I have seen.  With parts like the Zipper and the hairgel you just don't see and I am surprised they got away with it, but that only adds to the general feel of the movie, it's a Comedy Bus slammed into a love story train, it's sweet and Hilarious and you just sometimes just don't know what to think, we had trouble even finding a copy at the store to rent, and you watch it and you will see why."
"SKG-2","5","0","0","15 March 1999"," Some belly laughs do not a comedy make
","Maybe as I grow older, I may be less tolerant of really tasteless humor, but I don't think so.  After all, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, which also starred Ben Stiller, also has tasteless humor, but it also had a consistent tone and no gaps of unfunny scenes in it.  There are admittedly some huge laughs here (like everyone else, I laughed at the zipper and hair gel scenes, and the dog humor is as hilariously twisted as anything since Monty Python), but there are also some boring stretches.  Eventually, you get tired of Mary being so naive about everyone's intentions, and how she only seems to attract idiots.  Cameron Diaz is an appealing actress, but she's stuck here with a part that doesn't require much besides being the object of affection. Most of the men don't come off much better; Stiller, who showed range in ZERO EFFECT, goes back to his nerdish character, and he overplays it to the point of being tiresome.  The saving grace here is Matt Dillon, who's quite funny as a sleazy investigator, complete with mustache.  One of the nice things is how he's been able to show a surprising aptitude towards comedy this decade with this, SINGLES, and BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, among others.  For the most part, however, you can give this one a miss."

","There's definitely something about this film. When I saw this film, I was thinking of The Wedding Singer because both movies were set relatively the same time and both lead actresses happened to be blonde. I thought Ben Stiller played an excellent character in Ted as he tried locate the girl he had a crush on in high school. Cameron Diaz was superb in her role as Mary and the actor who played her brother was an excellent addition to the movie because he played his part as a disabled man really well. I'm not a real huge Matt Dillon fan and his role in this movie didn't do much to change my mind. He was very despicable as the sleazy private investigator who has the task of tracking the high school crush down; however, what he doesn't tell Ted when he does find her makes this film more interesting. Who would think that this film has twists that would blow the audience away; it does and not just one, it has two. These twists are really something of a shock, especially to me who was not expecting it to occur the way it did. Overall, this film was enjoyable I wouldn't mind seeing it a second time."

Even when the larger part of the jokes is slow and predictable, it is impossible that all of them are bad.

Cameron Diaz may not be doing so much at first, but there's reason to find her likeable as a young woman who becomes attracted by guys who want to dig her. This has to be the best performance for Diaz so far, yet a no-show at the Oscars. A name to watch for in future Hollywood releases. This is also a truly unique style of modern-day comedy. It's real cool to have the story told through some brief singing numbers, making this much more special. Unintentionally funny bits are sweet and nifty. In a nutshell, it's fun-filled all the way through, but the ""R"" rating is what bothered me the most. You might have heard rumors about Fox putting the movie out on video as a watered down ""PG"" release. That should have been a smart idea, and while the crudeness can be laughable on occasion, it takes some of the advantage away in willing to be a truly heartfelt satire.

","I hate romantic comedies. However There's Something About Mary is so much more than that, which makes it the greatest romantic comedy ever. It has all the right ingredients: absolutely hilarious characters, great writing, wonderful performances from all, and an adorable, wacky love story.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is just precious as a former geek still obsessed with his high school dream girl, Mary. He is so cute, clueless, and just irresistible. Cameron Diaz is extremely likeable too as the levelheaded Mary, probably the only sane character in the whole film.  She and Stiller are so cute that even I, despiser of romantic comedies, cried at parts because the story was just so sweet.<br/><br/>Besides the two stars, Chris Elliott, Lee Evans, and Matt Dillon are absolutely hilarious as her three stalkers, especially Elliott, and W. Earl Brown is riotous as Mary's brother Warren. The two funniest performances in the film though would have to go to Harland Williams whose five minutes on screen as an insane hitchhiker will leave you in stitches for days, and of course the brilliant dog whose name I can't remember.<br/><br/>There are just so many scenes that bring tears of laughter just thinking about them. This movie is crude, but that's not all it is.  It's a film that really touches you and will bring a smile to your face every single time.<br/><br/>10/10 - I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!"

","Ben Stiller carries on the loser shtick, this time coming off slightly below his Flirting with Disaster high point but perhaps a nudge better than the more recent Meet the Parents. In this one he's got less of a leading man type role, letting some of the other players (Matt Dillon, Lee Evans) get the odd word in edgeways, which is nice, and also giving Cameron Diaz' Mary a fair bit of screen time. This central group of characters are pitch perfect, from the tight and hilarious script down to every face and gesture they make, and with a clever but not overcomplicated plot and plenty of top-notch gags there's plenty of fun to be had. It's a lot more reliant on wit and plot, and less on puerile toilet humour, than much of the Farrelly's output (and that of their recent successors/acolytes), which makes it a much more rounded and enjoyable comedy. Great fun."

Plus I am not exactly a fan of the Farelly brothers (in fact I pretty much hated their earlier movies, ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin""), nor of Cameron Diaz (even though I have since found her quite impressive in ""Being John Malkovich""), and the ""hair gel scene"", which featured heavily in the trailers and even the print adverts, seemed to make this movie one to avoid.<br/><br/>So when I saw the movie, completely by accident, I was really pleasantly surprised.  Probably the reason why I enjoyed it so much is that, underneath the barrage of silly jokes, it tells a surprisingly accurate (at least from the male point of view), if over - the - top, romance.  I am ashamed to admit it, but the desperate quest of the male characters to get close to Mary, the dream girl who digs men in braces, seemed almost too close for comfort.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  men should watch this for fun.

The dialogues are perfect, there is nothing out-of-place and every phrase fits the plot perfectly. The actors play is great, Cameron Diaz did deserve MTV's Actress of the year and Matt Dillon Best villain. Another thing that makes this film outstanding is that it is sentimental (e.g.  Ted's neverending love to Mary throughout the film)  and vulgar at the same time, and this is already something Farelli didn't do before.

I also heard that this movie was somewhat offensive to some people which I later found out why, but this movie is funny, REAL FUNNY! and is just about the age in comedy where a person mistakes hairgel for a bodily fluid.  The Farrelly brothers had made very funny movies in the past such as Dumb and Dumber but this movie really put them on top and started a new genre commonly known as gross out comedy.

""Friends"" is a good example, come to think of it, of the sort of humor that offends no one: it makes you giggle a little, that's all.

","Generally speaking, gross-out comedy doesn't have much appeal to me, so I didn't expect to like ""There's Something About Mary.""  Having seen it, though, I have to say that there really is something about ""There's Something About Mary.""  There were a few scenes that I think went a bit too far in the gross-out department (no need, really, for the close-up in the penis-stuck-in-the-zipper scene, or for the fish-hook through the lip; I also thought the masturbation/semen-as-hair-gel thing was superfluous and not all that funny).  However, there was a lot more to this movie than gross-out jokes.  I thought much of the dialogue was actually quite smart, and the wacky humor was deliciously unpredictable -- for instance, the episode where Pat, the sleazy detective played by Matt Dillon, gives Ted (Ben Stiller) the false report on Mary in order to get Ted to lose interest in getting together with her; the hitchhiker with the ""six-minute abs"" pitch; Pat telling Mary he loves ""working with retards""; the cell-phone conversation Pat intends for Mary to overhear.  The scenes with Puffy the dog were hilarious too, and I usually CRINGE at any suggestion of cruelty to animals!  I rather liked the plot twists, especially the one involving Mary's friend Tucker (brilliantly played by the British comedian Lee Evans). And guess what, I thought there was something very sweet about the romance in ""Mary.""  Ben Stiller creates a believable and (despite his many faults) ultimately sympathetic character.  And as Mary, Cameron Diaz projects an irresistible mix of naivete, good-heartedness, and spirit.  So what if it's not very plausible that she would be a successful surgeon?  This is an eccentric comedy, not a serious drama.  (To me, Cameron Diaz as a surgeon is much more plausible than Julia Roberts as a hooker.)   The film actually makes you care about these people -- in addition to making you laugh."

Cameron Diaz really sparkles as the much sought-after Mary and Ben Stiller gives an amazing performance as the shy Ted.  Matt Dillon plays the lying eaves-dropping investigator with all stops out! As a result, it turns out to be one of the best comedies of the year. A couple of scenes are very risque, but manage to keep just within the bounds of censorship.  It's about a love-sick guy who seeks out a girl he knew 13 years before.  She's moved to Florida so he has to engage a private investigator to seek out and stalk her.  It so happens that the stalker falls for Mary, too.  Two of the funniest scenes involve a family dog.  In one scene the dog which has been over-dosed with a soporific drug has to be hurriedly resuscitated (a really farcical scene) and later, poor Ted is savagely attacked by the dog as it goes for his throat and other extremities.  These are only two of the extremely funny situations which keep the laughter bursting forth.  Ted is one of those unfortunate guys who always seem to be in trouble through no fault of their own,  Whether the girl of his dreams chooses him in the end from amongst her various admirers cannot be divulged here.  It can only be said that finally sincerity wins the day."

","This film contains two of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in my life (they both involve the dog) and the ending is clever and sweet, but as for the rest. . . I don't get what all the hosannas are about. The film's actually pretty plodding and slow-moving and there are long, loooong stretches where there are no laughs at all. As for the two most infamous scenes - i.e. the bathroom scene and the bit with the hair gel - they're not really done that well: the joke is too obvious and the timing is terrible. I think, in general, the Farrelly brothers lack the kind of light touch that is necessary for comedy (yes, even gross-out comedy), and their movies (including Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin) tend to consist of long set-ups for jokes that are sometimes funny but most often not. And even when they're funny, you can't quite forget how long the set up was, and wonder why the pacing couldn't be better and more assured.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't want to rip on this movie too much - it's got a good spirit, the entire cast is appealing (if rather unexceptional) and there's even a nice little message underneath it all. As light entertainment you could do a lot worse, but you may be left wondering what all the big fuss was about. Lower your expectations just a bit and you should enjoy it just fine."

","Thats the way the world is unfortunately. There are two types of people those who love movies like this beacuse they are very funny and those who don't because they have a manner which means they have to look for problems wherever they look (Read politicians, minority groups). There really is no need to go and see a movie like this if you want to come out and complain. You've seen their previous movies, don't buy a ticket. The deal with the Farrellys is that they understand that if something is funny then it should be laughed at. Someone falls over, laugh. Don't go and help him up. Mary has the ability to make the viewer laugh. More than once and more frequently than not. In my opinion that makes a comedy a good comedy. I truly believe that you stick any old actors into brilliant material and situations as are in mary then you will laugh. That being said though the ensemble really do pull together and play off each other to startling effect and even the Farrelly regulars have some great moments. Lee Evans in particular has broken America and looks to have a bright future ahead of him in film. Stiller is Stellar and Diaz a bombshell once more. Even Matt Dillon proves 'I can do comedy'."

Now, when he gets to her house, he gets his, um, member stuck in his zipper (for all you men who see it, you'll wonder how he did it, I know I did), after that, the date is ruined when he gets it out, and is a bleeder, so he needs to go to the hospital, needless to say, the date is over.

It is the tale of a young student, who falls in love with a pretty girl, but who's chance of wooing her is dashed by a cruel (but very funny) prom night disaster.<br/><br/>For the next 13 years, he leads a lonely and empty existence, his life (to all intents and purposes) ruined by the tragic loss of his one true love. And then one day, a chance remark by a friend makes him decide to do something about this...<br/><br/>What happens next is a study of the demons that haunt those obsessed by something that seems unobtainable, and the pressures that face those who are the objects of such obsession.<br/><br/>The film is also very funny. Some of the comic situations are undeniably basic (some would say juvenile), but they are done so well that I found myself howling with laughter, when more usually I would have turned my nose up (usually I'm not overly fond of adolescent humour).<br/><br/>The message that I took away from the film was about perspective. As individuals, we can often lose our perspectives, and this can lead to unbearable emotional suffering. But, if you can act with honour and with dignity, you will eventually be rewarded, one way or another.<br/><br/>Some people may be offended by this film , and some may not like it.

","In spite of being filled with a collection of considerably surprising gross-out gags and things of that nature, There's Something About Mary still has a tendency of being spotty at best (there is about as many misses here as there are hits).  One problem that this movie has concerns the exceeding hammering of various jokes.  For example, there's a gag that centers around the ""beans and franks"" getting caught into something.  The problem that lies with this gag is that the ""beans and franks"" are eventually shown and it in my mind would have been funnier if you were allowed to imagine what the ""beans and franks"" could look like in that sort of predicament (it spoiled the joke frankly).  Not to mention that the writing occasionally gets lazy and certain muffed jokes are apparent.  One bungled gag in particular involves feces being found right near a door.  The thing about this is, there wasn't exactly anything to set this gag up (it was just thrown in for its own merit) as it perhaps gave a notion towards the fact that the movie tries too hard from time-to-time.  It's as if the fact that There's Something About Mary has a tendency of presenting gross-out gags is being stamped as hard as it can.  Along with that, the movie seemingly has a mentality in which persistent profanity (i.e. a word that begins with the letter F) can be used as a way to get laughs.  But at the same time, persistent profanity is perhaps one example of the laziness in terms of writing.  In the aftermath, There's Something About Mary is perhaps one of those films in which a majority of the successful jokes are practically beat to death in advertising."

I mean, it's not as if the ending is a surprise, but up until the last, you just kind of wonder if it's really going to end like that, and you really hope it does.  Personally, for about three minutes, I thought Ted and Mary were going to just end up being friends, and I didn't want that. The movie keeps you hoping.  Neither I nor my friends could help smiling really, really, big when Ted takes a big breath and starts toward Mary to embrace her at the end.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is one of my favorite actors after I saw this movie, redeeming himself from the mistake of accepting ""Mystery Men"", an utterly pathetic movie which I saw before I rented ""Mary"".<br/><br/>Some say the acting was bad, but I don't see where they were coming from. The characters were perfectly believable, and those critics must have needed to just say SOMETHING bad because they know Diaz is amazing and can't admit it.

","That was really redundant, I know, and I apologize.  But still, it's true. There's something about ""There's Something About Mary.""  Something that really makes me laugh.  The Farrelly Brothers have done it again with this one.  It's unarguably sick, disgusting, and hilarious, and yet, there's a sweet side to it as well.  Not much of one, mind you.  This is still your typical sophomoric gross-out comedy, but it has brains this time around. The script is witty, intelligent, and very well paced, and the technical side of the movie is good without taking anything away from the comedy.  It has this weird appeal to it that can make you love it and hate it at the same time.<br/><br/>It also has Cameron Diaz.  There's something about her too.  For starters, she's gorgeous.  On top of that, she can act.  Now, please don't misunderstand me here, because her acting in ""Mary"" can appear stupid and poorly-timed almost all of the time, but I think that was intentional.  What it really proves is that, even though she acts like a complete idiot sometimes, there's still just something about her.<br/><br/>Let's not forget Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller, who add the conflict and the (forgive me for this one) suspense.  Both play their parts with equal helpings of vim and vigor, and yet, they both act like complete idiots.<br/><br/>But all of this is relatively unimportant in the long run.  What really matters is that this is one sick, hilarious movie.  This is bodily function humor, locker room talk at its bawdy best.  I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind looking at things a bit differently, and who isn't offended easily, of course.<br/><br/>*** out of ****."

The alarm bells were sounding, but still I bought a ticket expecting a silly but mirthful afternoon in the local Odeon... What you get is 5 distinct set-piece gags that are deadeningly sign-posted 10 minutes before they detonate, and rely for their humour on you having spent isolated months in a Tibetan Media Retreat for the Terminally Over-Appealed-To. God, this film was bad. Don't these directors understand that comedy has to be rooted in reality to be funny? No. Instead of clever plotting and characterisation you get scenes that might as well bear the gurning subtitles ""This bit is incredibly funny! Tell your friends! ITS FUNNY ISN'T IT!"". A wearing 120 minutes. I thought I'd lost all feeling in my legs by the time it limped to the denouement. Needless to say the kiss at the end was an all time cinema low.

","This movie is a high-spirited farce. It's very funny to see these 3 pathetic suitors chase after this one woman. They are all so desperate it becomes endearing and very amusing. The hair gel scene is also funny in the context of this lovesick man (played by Ben Stiller) trying to make a good impression on Mary. This movie reminds me of the song ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love?""  It's about those fools who wear their hearts on their sleeves in the name of love. All three of these guys will go to any lengths to please the woman of their dreams and that's why I found this movie so humorous. The tone of the movie mocks these love-starved guys while simultaneously persuading the audience to feel sympathy for them. The script's tongue-in-cheek approach to its own characters makes TSOM a winning comedy.

","Do you want to see a movie where you can laugh, where the main character is clumsy but generous and idealist, where nearly the whole bunch of characters are only caricatures and where every vulgarity forbidden in other films is allowed here? Then watch this movie... Personally I watched it because I wanted to have some good laughs and I had what I wanted, nut nothing more. I adored the previous Farrelly bros' movie (Dumb & Dumber) where everything was crazy and farcical. The defect of this one is that there are two characters that are too human (played by the divine Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller): so the exhilarating scenes that include Stiller (and where you laugh almost to tears) seem uprooted from the other more serious scenes where the directors have to develop the story, just because they have two human character,too. So the rhythm of the movie seems to limp (just like many characters) and it goes too long, for a movie of this kind. The invention of the two boys that play and sing (like a greek chorus all through the movie) is very good. A few last words about the advertised ""politically uncorrect"" in this movie: I found the scenes including disableds not too disturbing. In fact I believe it's right to treat them like the rest of the people because they are human beings just like the others, but take care not to exaggerate, or it could transform in racism."

The script, acting, and directing are really top notch, especially the script. The brothers Farley have matured and produced a genuinely hilarious movie that I will admit I've seen 4 times and would see again, preferably in a theater. Outside of one or two superfluous scenes, nothing is wasted in the film. And the use of Jonathan Richmond as the ""Cat Balloo"" style singing narrator (okay, he ain't no Nat King Cole or Stubby Kaye) is inspired.

Some of these are the same people who have panned other movies, such as Big Daddy, for the same reasons that they claim to like this picture.  This sends a very inconsistent message.<br/><br/>There's Something About Mary is filled with obnoxious and officious humor.  In fact, it's bathroom humor all the way.  Many of the key scenes literally take place in a bathroom!  It is very hard to laugh at the way disabled people, dating gentleman, and animals are treated in this film.  Not that I demand that every movie I see be politically correct. I enjoy a good laugh as much as anybody else.  It's just that much of the supposed humor of this movie did not make me laugh.  On the contrary, I was often grossed out and sometimes downright offended. I felt the same way as when I had just been made fun of on the play- ground in elementary and junior high school.  Unless you appreciate being made the butt of another person's joke, I don't see how you--the viewer--can enjoy this movie, ultimately.<br/><br/>On top of this, there is no overarching message of positive reinforcement in this movie.  This movie hits you in the gut with sick humor and then just leaves you there.  The gags that are supposedly so funny are the merciless point of this movie.  It might appeal to a bully, but anyone with half a brain to see through this sick mess will feel their intelligence insulted.   But that's the point.  The movie plays its biggest, most obnoxious joke upon the viewer.<br/><br/>As for Cameron Diaz, if this is the best she can give us, her star isn't anything special.  If the point is that this is just an escapist movie not to be taken seriously, then there are other movies, such as Big Daddy or Wayne's World, that convey that message and pull off the same type gags with more grace.  Those movies are amusing and worth the money paid to see them.  This one isn't."

Years later, not accepting what happened and still impassioned by the youth, he hires a suspicious detective (Matt Dillon) so that he can trace the girl. But the detective ends up falling in love with her,giving start to a series of confusions,that also involves a colleague of Mary's work and other fans!the scenes are unforgettable: the dog attacking Ben Stiller, the scene of the gel, in which at Mary confuses a certain corporal flowed with gel and...well, I won't say!the pleasure of discovering that surprise is yours, so watch the film today!!!"

The material in this film might be funny to some people with extremely odd senses of humor, but I certainly didn't.

","After seeing this movie, and wondering for months upon months HOW people thought it was so funny, I finally got the answer. Geoffrey Rush, in the masterpiece Shakespeare In Love, explains that, for the inferior, banal common man, there needs to be ""a bit with a dog"". Aha! I thought to myself. There it is! The bit with the dog was the answer. And then I realized that there was more to it. Much like TV laugh- tracks, this type of movie is a conditioned type of humor. Everyone has seen the same trailers, over and over and over again. So, at the theater, they know when to laugh. There are enough of these conditioned scenes to run the laughter over into the scenes that have not been seen. By the middle of the movie, everyone is laughing. Since most people like to be part of a group, they figure they should be laughing as well. From conditioned trailers to the end, it seems that it is a very funny movie. I realize that this is not a conscious endeavor by the viewers : if it was, it wouldn't work. So if you found it funny, I understand that you will not believe me. But aren't you happy now that you can feel like you're part of this group, this little bit of community fun? I'm sure you do. It's your movie now, so you know whenever you want to laugh, you can rent it and be qued to laugh. Very convenient. Just for my sake : please don't laugh too many more times at the dog.

I have been to a ton of movies on my life, and many comedies.  I have never heard an audience have such a reaction to a film.  The movie was so hysterically funny, people were screaming, rolling in their seats, especially for the first 20 mins of the film (which features the infamous ""frank and beans"" shot).

"GregRG","9","0","0","27 April 1999"," It's rude, it's crude, it's raunchy. Could anyone ask for more?
","There's Something About Mary is the Farrelly brother's third effort. There first two movies, Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin, were among the most sophmoric, tasteless, movies I have ever seen.  There were also two of the funniest.  What made those movies so delightful was the absolute effort that was made to get us to laugh.  As Mel Brooks has said about his movies, they ""rise below vulgarity.""<br/><br/>As funny as those two movies are, the Farrelly brothers have clearly stepped it up a notch with this film, which is most likely not the funniest film of all time, but definitely merits consideration.  The film begins in the wonderful state of Rhode Island, and after a very inside joke about ""Borrington,"" shows the first meeting between Ted (Ben Stiller) and Mary (Cameron Diaz).  From the first meeting, that involves Mary's mentally challenged brother, we get the sense that sensitivity isn't a high value in this movie, and that laughter is.<br/><br/>Describing the rest of the plot is mostly pointless, although it does contain several delightful twists.  The movie does not rely on its plot, but relies on a combination of high slapstick comedy and the ability to exploit the worst, darkest part of human nature, especially as contrasted to the unbelievably sweet and wholesome Mary.<br/><br/>These two elements as well as one incredibly funny misunderstanding (about serial killing of all things), have made this movie a true delight, and a purely fun ride into raunchy fantasy.  Not that you don't need a thick skin to view this film.  It pokes fun at a variety of sources, most disturbingly at people with mental retardation.  However, it is clear the film revels much more in the stupidity of those people who tend to exploit people with mental retardation.<br/><br/>The film also contains the wonderful and humorous presence of one of the great rock n' roll musicians of all time, Jonathan Richman, who is all ham in this one.  When all is said and done, no one is smarter, no one is a better person for seeing this film.  It makes no great statements, it offers no insight into humanity.  It is what it is:  The funniest, most rip roaring laugh your a** off good time you will have at the movies, and if that isn't worth $8, then save the money and buy a better sense of humor."

The Farrelly Brothers I know are notorious for their lack of subtlety, but I was expecting something funnier considering the reputation it has. The script is full of dialogue that is rather juvenile and tasteless and the gags are puerile and fall flat more than they score. I know people will say this is what makes the film funny, I respect that, it's just not my kind of humour, that's all. The premise is simple, I have no problem with that. When the story is this thin and this predictable, I am not so kind. The film feels unevenly paced too, then again it probably has a lot to do with the lack of laughs from my experience, and the characters I don't care about.<br/><br/>Overall, I wanted to like it, but it didn't work for me.

"bowmanblue","8","1","2","20 September 2019"," Still outrageously funny
","There are few films as well done as 'There's Something About Mary.' Of course that doesn't mean that it's for everyone, as there are some scenes there that some may find 'offensive,' but, apart from those few who are easily shocked by scenes of 'adult humour,' it should be appreciated by most.<br/><br/>The 'romantic comedy' format of film-making is as old as the hills: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back again. Now, without wishing to 'spoil' the story too much, 'There's Something About Mary' hardly breaks that rule, but it's all about the way it's told.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned the humour. It's NOT for all the family. There are plenty of jokes that could be considered (a) bad taste (b) adult in nature or (c) both. However, don't go thinking that this is going to be some sort of raunchy adult comedy with bawdy characters constantly engaging in slapstick comedy and who you won't care about. Somehow, this film actually gives us some rather touching moments which go a little deeper than your average 'boy meets girl' film.<br/><br/>It's probably something about the cast. Sometimes everything (or I should probably say everyONE) just falls into place. It's hardly an 'ensemble' film, but there are a few different characters to keep track of and therefore some different story arcs to follow. Most of the marketing of the movie was focused on (then!) Box Office goldmine Cameron Diaz and you could be mistaken for thinking that she was practically starring in the film all on her own. However, it's worth mentioning that Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are both excellent in their roles. They provide some great conflict and male insecurities which contrast Diaz's sweetness.<br/><br/>The other two characters that are worth a mention are Chris Elliot and Lee Evans. Elliot isn't given as much screen time as the rest, but whenever he's in front of camera he's worth every moment. If the film has a weak spot - in my opinion - it's Lee Evans. I don't know why, but I've never been a fan of his manic stand-up and I find his performance about as enjoyable as his 'gags.'<br/><br/>Perhaps the best thing about the film is that - even after over twenty years - it's still as funny as it was when it first came out. It doesn't seem to have aged at all and, whether you're just looking for a 'boy meets girl' film, or something a little more outrageous and adult in nature, this one should tick all the boxes you're looking for. And, if your only knowledge of the film is that off picture of Cameron Diaz with the funny hair-do, then the scene that you'll be waiting for is very much worth the wait."

"Desertman84","10","1","2","6 December 2014"," An Unforgettable Comedy Made In The 90's
","There's Something About Mary is a comedic film that features Cameron Diaz in a star-making title role together with Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller.It is a film by the Farrelly brothers that combines romantic comedy and gross humor.<br/><br/>The film starts when an awkward and shy 16-year-old high-school student named Ted Stroehmann lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen.Unfortunately,it was cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident. After he suffers from the ordeal of pain and embarrassment, Ted end up in the hospital after the incident and loses touch with Mary.Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love.He hires a private investigator to find her and tries to win her once more now that it would be more challenging considering that he finds her a successful orthopedic surgeon residing in Miami. <br/><br/>This was definitely an unforgettable film.One main reason is the fact that we here see a great looking,sexy and charming Cameron Diaz who is on her way to stardom before she changed into becoming the premiere actresses for bitches in movies such as The Counselor,Vanilla Sky and Charlie's Angels.Probably,it was also a time wherein she still signs autographs from fans.Anyway,she definitely portrayed the charm and appeal of Mary extremely well.<br/><br/>As for the story,it was also able to handle romantic comedy and gross out humor together magnificently.While it maybe offensive and raunchy in many scenes,it also was able to become insightful when it comes to romance.Viewers will definitely feel the love that a romantic comedy rarely provides.Ben Stiller was definitely in top form during the production of the film.<br/><br/>And most of all,give credit to the Farrelly brothers for arguably making their best film ever.In it,the movie makes fun of manners,political correctness,moral values and being polite but nevertheless they only made the viewer aware that we are capable of great sense of humor only known to us - human beings.<br/><br/>The three reasons stated above makes it deserving of all the accolades and commercial success that it received during it theatrical release."
"The-Sarkologist","4","1","2","6 December 2013"," Started to cross the boundaries of decency
","I guess the first thing that I must say about this movie is that it is disgusting. I will warn off all of you who do not like explicit sexual jokes. This movie is not pornographic, nor are their any ""sex"" scenes, in the narrow meaning of the word, but there is some sexually explicit scenes. Secondly, I probably only laughed about five times in this movie - it was not all that funny. Even though, I cannot say that I hated the movie because the plot was decent and the characters were reasonable. There were two disgusting scenes I did not like, but I have come to a point where I do not judge a movie purely on two scenes (unlike my sister).<br/><br/>This is a romantic comedy about a boy named Ted and a girl named Mary. Mary is such an attractive woman that everybody wants to go out with her, but nobody is willing to reveal the truth about themselves to her - that is nobody but Ted. Ted meets her when he steps in to protect her brother Warren who is intellectually disabled. After walking her home, Mary asks him to the prom, but on prom night he has an accident (the first disgusting scene - they did not have to show you) and is incapacitated for two weeks. During this time, Mary's father is transferred to Miami and they are separated for thirteen years.<br/><br/>After this time, Ted is still thinking of Mary and his friend Dom tells him of a detective that could find her. Ted decides to get this guys help, but he is not that helpful, falling in love with Mary and going to Florida to court her while telling a load of lies to Ted. After finding out the truth, Ted travels to Florida to try and court Mary himself. In the end, Mary has five guys all trying to court her and all trying to undermine the others chances of attracting Mary to them (actually, six guys).<br/><br/>I guess this movie is moving comedy forward where it is telling dirtier jokes as the older ones become old and used and more things become acceptable. Unfortunately I do not find the dirty jokes all that funny, and then being caught in an uncompromising position is pretty old in itself. I guess the movie sets itself up though, saying early on that homosexuals hang out at highway rest stops and then having the main character trip over a whole hoard of them when he stops to go to the toilet.<br/><br/>I also like the romantic aspects of this movie - being a bit of a romantic myself (at least at the time of writing the original commentary). I do admire Ted for his nobility at the end, but it also portrays the adage that if you love somebody, set them free - and if they love you they will return. The deceitful parts of the movie are interesting, where people use their knowledge of Mary to gain her affections.<br/><br/>Beyond that I guess that there is little that I can say. The movie was okay, but the disgusting parts of it do drag it down a lot in my opinion."
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","2","4 July 2013"," We all had a 'Mary' in our life ...
","They're beautiful, they embrace life with an extraordinary optimism and wherever they come, it's like sunshine blossoming all over the place. The world is full of girls like Mary, pretty to both eyes and hearts, whose beauty never nourished a snobbish attitude that we'd have forgiven anyway. Cameron Diaz is the titular Mary, and Mary is not just a name, but a concept.<br/><br/>We all had a Mary, a 'prettiest girl' in school, one that melted the hearts of studs and athletes as much as geeks and losers; all boys devoted their admiration for Mary like embracing an inaccessible dream. I was in love with a 'Mary' during almost ten years. Needless to say that it wasn't reciprocal, but I never cared, if she smiled at me, she'd had made my day, if she talked, I would spend one minute thinking of the best response, and if we had a date , well, only my dreams involved me as the 'lucky one'.""There's Something About Mary"" is a cinematic tribute to this eternal lovely figure that either enchanted or indirectly ruined our memories.<br/><br/>And Cameron Diaz, with her blonde hair, communicative smile and eternally positive attitude, embodied the most fascinating traits of these dream-like creatures. Her performance is perfect because she is genuinely sweet, tender and funny beyond her sexiness. She's such a good person, she even asks Ted (Ben Stiller) to be her cavalier for the prom. Granted movies have their shares of geeky escapism, but Cameron Diaz makes believable that such a girl would not feel indifferent to an awkward braces-wearing schmuck like Stiller. It's believable because these girls are so often labeled as inaccessible by average guys that no one dares to seduce them, which makes them inexperienced enough to fall for the one who tries, inviting the other adulators to come off their holes.<br/><br/>Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, ""Mary"" is about a confrontation between men who have all in common, their obsessive fascination for 'Mary'. Since, it's not a game with a win-win situation, it's up to the most sincere, the most clever or the most malicious to win her heart. And this simple premise leads to one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, a laugh riot from beginning to end. For the trivia, the film made the last Gene Siskel's Top 10 before his death in 1999, it was in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of 1998, and holds a honorable 27th spot in the American Film Institute Top 100 comedies as the most recent film to make it in the list.<br/><br/>And there's a reason why the film meets with such popular acclaim: it IS funny to a level of slapstick that could have only been possible in a spoof movie, which ""Mary"" is not, but it's beyond labels and no gag is taken for granted, they're all pushed to their extreme limits. And for its risk-taking approach to humor, the film succeeds. Take the unfortunate 'zipper' accident that ruins what could have been Ted's life highlight (and turned out to be the whole opposite), showing the reactions of all the community was already hilarious, but the film doesn't hesitate to give us an 'explicit' idea about the state of Ted's genitals. We never know what we see exactly, but we know it might hurt like hell.<br/><br/>After the incident, Mary moves to Florida and Ted loses touch with her, for several years and determined to find out her new whereabouts, in order to exorcise his unfulfilled obsessions, he hires Matt Dillon as a private-eye. Even more brilliant than his casting, the idea of putting this villainous old-fashioned mustache in Dillon is a stroke of genius, because only a naive guy like Ted could have trusted him. But that's what makes Stiller one of the most defining losers of the 90's, what his subsequent series of misadventures never contradict. I won't spoil all the gags, but some have already penetrated Pop-Culture forever they deserve more than a mention.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm speaking of the infamous hair gel. Before his date with Mary, Ted's friend, played by Chris Elliot, advises him to pleasure himself, because ""the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load - now that is a medical fact"". Kudos to the writers for such a line full of wisdom because it is true! The whole 'blowing' process is a nice gag, the mysterious disappearance of the seminal liquid, is intriguing and funny, but the final punch line is enough to give the film its ticket in the ¨Pantheon of great comedies"", much more for Mary's reaction which, as silly as it is, keeps her in character, yes, she's still the well-meaning and innocent Mary.<br/><br/>And that's the film's secret beyond its crude and raunchy humor, forgive me the cliché; it has a heart, incarnated by Mary. She's the Pandora box or Helen of Troy, inspiring her little fan-club the most deceitful ways to win her. Stiller, Dillon and Elliot are perfect, the other cast features a disabled close friend who's not totally blameless, a roommate named Magda who seemed to have spent her whole life in a UV oven, and naturally, there's no comedy without a scene-stealing animal, the dog in ""Mary"" reduces the one from ""Mask"" to the level of ""Benji"". There's also a weird guitarist playing the 'Greek chorus' figure, and whose final shot will be a double satisfaction for viewers, the second being the nice twist on the happy-ending, perhaps the only forgivable bit of unoriginality.<br/><br/>But it's still funny, warm, touching in fact, there's something about ""Mary"" that touches your heart, because it's still about two people learning to love each other without lying or stalking. It's all about honest love. What was wrong with these guys? They idolized Mary, and maintained their passion on a love-at-first-sight level, while it takes more to win a girl's heart, especially a girl like Mary ..."

","There are these three guys out after Mary (Cameron Diaz), or maybe four or five or six, depending on how you count. The most important are, first, Ben Stiller, the shy nobody who has had a crush on her since high school in Providence, Rhode Island. Years later he learns Mary lives in Florida, and Stiller hires a sly and self-promoting private investigator (Matt Dillon) to track her down and bring back a report. Then there is a faux Englishman (Lee Evans) trying to insinuate himself into Mary's life space by posing as a victim of polio or something. Even more devious in his obsession is Stiller's friend Woogie, crippled by a nervous rash. A football player is tossed in at the end, and an older guy who has been cultivating Mary's neighbor in order to get a crack at Mary.<br/><br/>It's understandable. When Dillon brings back his intelligence on Diaz, he tells Stiller that she weighs several hundred pounds, is confined to a wheelchair, has had four illegitimate children, and lives in a housing project. But the fact is Cameron Diaz is radiant. She's tall, slender, a little goofy, morally upright, and a doctor to boot.<br/><br/>The movie is anything but politically correct or delicate in any way. The writers have dived head first into the energetic gags, which follow one another almost instantly and range from silly (the masturbation scene) to merely reckless. (Dillon learns that Mary finds pearly white teeth sexy so he has his teeth modified, giving him a toothpaste-ad grin and a slight lisp.) I don't know how much I want to get into this because, inasmuch as the movie is a series of jokes, any description of unfolding events or character will give some of the jokes away. Well, let me say at least that I laughed most at the scene in which Matt Dillon has tranquilized Diaz's little dog so that it doesn't reject him on their first meeting. The problem is that the dog ODs and goes into cardiac arrest. With Diaz out of the room momentarily, Dillon is forced to perform CPR on the dog. When that doesn't work he yanks some electrical cords out of a lamp and tries to revive the animal with electric shock. The dog begins to sputter with sparks and his fur catches fire. I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Comedies about ""romance"" generally call for a sobering statement at the end, in which all is explained and the moral spelled out for the viewer. The Farrelly brothers have included such a scene but it's mercifully brief. ""They were only after you because you made them feel good about themselves."" You'll hardly notice the pain.<br/><br/>You know how some comedies are toned down, subtle, and require attention to be fully appreciated? This is the opposite."

A lot of humour we hadn't seen before (and maybe some we wish we hadn't).<br/><br/>""There's Something About Mary"" tells the fictional story of a girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), who becomes an obsession for many guys. The film revolves around Ted (Ben Stiller), who went to school with Mary and as an older man decides to try to track her down. He hires PI Pat Healy (Matt Dillon, in one of his best efforts)to track her down. Healy finds her, but falls for her and consequently makes up a story to try to deter Ted from pursuing her. Ted still decides to however, and that's when things get weird.<br/><br/>Some great scenes, particularly the interrogation scene and the ""zipper"" incident. Great cast, some gold, but a fair bit of boundary pushing stuff as well not ideal for family viewing."

","Wow, what a good comedy; ""Something about Mary"" is going to make you laugh either you want it or not. The jokes are so outrageous that or you're going to chuckle, to laugh, or to crack up as i did almost the whole time.<br/><br/>The story is about Ted, a nerdy guy who is in love with the nicest and prettiest girl of the school: Mary. When he luckily gets to go to the prom with Mary, and he's going to pick her up at her house, one of the most hilarious sequence of the movie starts, you'll laugh so hard that you're going to have to see it one more time to catch all the phrases and dialog.<br/><br/>But, the sequence ends, and now we are in the present, with Ted still in love with Mary; so he hires by a friend's advise Pat Healy, to spy on her, though he denies that he's a stalker, and then almost every man that gets to know Mary falls for her.<br/><br/>But that's not the best this movie has to offer. This is a basic, simple plot to have a lot of explosive funny sequences, and there are a very good amount of good ones.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>1-The zipper sequence. 2-The dog resurrection sequence. 3-The masturbation scene (wait till you hear the background music and that scene) 4-The gel part. 5-The fight Ted vs. Dog. 6-The reunion of all the creeps who are in love with Mary. 7-And a final murder of a singer.<br/><br/>Those are the highligths, but you are certainly going to find a lot more in here.<br/><br/>My only personal objection is the 40 f... words; I mean, they could have take out all the f words, and the movie would have been as funny as it is, but is good anyway. 9 out of 10."
"alicecbr","9","1","2","27 October 2006"," HIlarious comedy from Dillon and STiller
","I still don't get the thing about Dillon's big teeth. Were they artificial, or was he just poking them out? Whatever, they made him even more dorky than the character he plays in this hilarious, cruel comedy about getting penises stuck in zippers and throwing yippy inbred dogs out windows.<br/><br/>Knowing that Matt and Cameron Diaz were significant others during this time made the show even more enjoyable. Obviously, they could both turn off the goony character Matt plays, as the private dick, hired to find the girl that Ben lost many years ago in his own private Hell.<br/><br/>This is a great movie for nerdy teen-agers going through the Hell of adolescence and thinking they'll never get the girl or get the guy. In this case, both persevere and become successes in their chosen profession, thereby having the finances to do what ever the script has them doing without the bother of having to show up 8 to 5.<br/><br/>The beautiful Florida scenery is also enjoyable, as is the daffy next door neighbor, the owner of said daffy dog. It became a class when it came out, and it's still hilarious. You can't be depressed watching this trip through la-la land. Unless you think that a bunch of cops pouncing on some homsexuals is funny....which obviously the Republicans will get a great laugh out of. Sorta like waterboarding Muslims.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, think of how we've progressed (?????) and enjoy the movie."
"eternalsea","7","1","2","14 April 2006"," Average comedy
","Gross out comedy is fast becoming one of Hollywoods biggest industrys. The American Pie films, South Park bigger Longer and Uncut and numerous Adam Sandler movies are among the biggest grossers and in 1998 There's Something about Mary became one of the genres biggest hits. The film opened to generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, as years went by the films popularity grew and since then by many has been regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. I don't share that opinion. The story is simple, a guy gets asked to the prom by a girl(called Mary) he fancys only for a rather unfortunate incident to occur which prevents him from saying goodbye to her as she moves to Miami shortly afterword. Years later and now a man he realises he is still in love with Mary and hires a sleazy private investigator to find her. However he to falls in love with her and soon becomes clear There's Something about Mary..... The film doesn't contain many subtle jokes, but as the genre suggests it shouldn't specilize in them so it would be unfair to complain about that. However the abundance of Toilet humour and sex related jokes does become waring after about an hour and half of the gags fall right on their face, in saying that there are some inspired moments but to few to warrent the praise the film has received. The performances have a certain charm but Stiller and Diaz in the leads aren't really convincing enough, you could argue Dillions Sleazy detective is the only person who raises an above average laugh count but there's no arguing about the fact he carries the movie at times. The film does have entertainment value and some ideas are good, but are rarely carried of to full potential. In the end There may be something special about Mary, but there's nothing special about this movie."

","My wife and I 'accidentally' saw a sneak preview of this movie at the theater. We went to see something else (I can't even recall what it was now) and it was sold out. They told us they were having a sneak screening of a movie that would be coming out the next week so we thought we'd try it out. I can not even begin to tell you how pleasantly surprised we were! We had never laughed so hard and haven't since at any movie. This is one of those flicks you can watch again and again and again. The only sad part of this movie being so great is that now EVERY SINGLE comedy I see gets compared to 'Theres Something About Mary' - and NONE of them stand up!"
"Chromium_5","4","1","2","5 September 2005"," Boring and stupid
","This movie is horrible. People lie and say they like it because of its supposed ""shock"" value, but the truth is, gross-out humor is nothing new, and it has been done MUCH better than this (just watch any episode of ""South Park""). The only funny scene is the one in the police station, but by then I was too tired and bored to laugh. A couple other scenes have good comic potential, such as the dog on speed, but they are wasted and fall flat.<br/><br/>Even with the horrible script, which has no tangible plot and can't figure out who the main character is and doesn't bother to develop characters at all, it COULD have been funny with the right actors (this is what saved ""Dumb and Dumber""). Unfortunately, everyone here is bland and listless. I guess I'll make an exception for Lee Evans, who really is a talented comedian and does his best with an unfunny character. But Stiller and Dillon don't even seem to be trying that hard. Diaz doesn't even have personality; she's nothing more than a plot device. Except there is no plot. So I don't know what she is. Just a device, I guess.<br/><br/>I can't believe I spent money to rent this. Fortunately I also had the good sense to rent ""The Big Lebowski"" along with it, so my evening wasn't completely ruined. Still, I could have saved myself two hours of pain and boredom."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","13 February 2005"," A little raunchy, but overall a very funny movie.
","The backdrop for this story is high school, pretty and ditzy Mary (Cameron Diaz) has a date with insecure and clutzy Ted (Ben Stiller). One of Ted's friends instructs him, to avoid possible embarrassment sexually, he should masturbate before the date. Which he does, but in his own way botches that up, something gets caught in the zipper, and Mary finds a new and improved ""hair gel"", all of which creates some slapstick humor for those not bothered by bodily functions.<br/><br/>The main of the story is some years later, when Ted finds out that Mary is still single and living in Miami. he hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) as a private eye to check things out and, being of questionable character falls for Mary himself, and gives Ted a false report. However, Ted eventually gets things right and the battle for Mary's affections begins.<br/><br/>Even though she was very well received for her role with Jim Carrey in Mask, for me this was the performance that got Cameron Diaz on my radar screen as an unusually talented actress. She has done other good roles, like the almost unrecognizable character she plays in ""Being John Malkovich"", and I really liked her in a much earlier role, in ""Feeling Minnesota"", but has not done much of substance recently."

","When trying to judge a film and it's actors on their merit and the impression they made on people, anyone in their right mind know that EVERYONE is not going to give a film two thumbs up! What is funny to one is not necessarily humorous to others. Being of different mind and body is the makeup of a human and it should not be expected for everyone to laugh at the same things. It's beyond me how anybody could give a complete negative review on this film. There was several reviews that were completely negative with not one good thing to say. When this happens, it's not the film to blame but rather it's the person that tried to rate it. They just haven't got a clue! Or, their a disgruntled actor that didn't get a part in this film. This film, ""There's Something About Mary"" is without a doubt the most humorous and funniest film I've ever seen. (in 50 years viewing exp). Plus the fact that I will always love and never forget Ms.Diaz as Mary. And that my friend is what it's all about."

","Spoiler!!! Toilet junior high humor.  I like this sort of humor, but such humor is either hit or miss.  The grandma on speed was funny, along with the cops part.  Other stuff was gross, or like the dog scene stupid.  I heard so much hype and found the movie not able to live up all the praise.  I hated the band, I was wondering if the bad singer getting shot was ment to be funny or relief? I will let you the reader decide.  Rent it, if there is nothing else left in the video store.

He was probably my favorite character in this film and Chris Elliot coming in second as the itching man. Ben Stiller looked so funny in that goofy outfit for the prom and those braces.

"kintopf432","5","1","2","29 September 2003"," Shocking the first time, boring the next
","It's hard to deny that there's something charming about this pop grossout comedy.  Like so many sick-joke aggregations before it, its heart seems genuinely to be in the right place, and all the actors turn in amiable, sympathetic performances.  <br/><br/>But ideally a comedy should get funnier upon repeat viewings, and you really can't say that at all here.  The laughs it creates come entirely from the shock of seeing them for the first time.  Oh my God, look at that semen on his ear!  Oh my God, look at those eruptions on Chris Elliott's face!  Oh my God, look at Magda's breasts!  Creating these kinds of shock effects, and doing it without alienating the audience's sympathies, is not a small achievement--just ask John Waters or the Monty Python troupe how hard it is. But it is not, perhaps, a great one either, and when I saw it again last night, I thought, oh, there's the semen on his ear.  There's the eruptions on Chris Elliott's face.  Sigh.  Yawn.  Et cetera.<br/><br/>The difference between `There's Something About Mary' and a John Waters or Python film might be that Waters and the Pythons have always used shock to make a point about something, to comment in irreverent or even offensive ways on some aspect of modern culture (usually critically).  The Farrellys don't set their sights quite so high, and that's fine, but it results in a picture that doesn't give the audience anything to want to relive.  It's a parade of grostesquerie with a heart, yes, but really without substance or real style.  Even the technical stuff doesn't stand up--I kept thinking how much funnier the dog-battle scene would have been if Barry Sonnenfeld, or somebody more proficient with a camera, had shot it.  <br/><br/>What reason, exactly, would anyone have for watching this movie more than once?    It feels remarkably empty, and has already dated badly after just five years.  (I don't doubt that in twenty years people will watch this movie again and not be able to remember what they used to enjoy about it.) You might as well be listening to somebody describe its events as watching it, because in the end it's a movie in which the ideas are shocking, but everything else is quite ordinary.  5.5 out of 10."

","This film was a disappointment. Having seen Diaz in other films and loving her, this film failed to move the earth for me.

That I find disconcerting, I find him hard to take to. The only redeeming feature for him in this film is the scene with the dog, not going to spoil it for you, but I laughed so much it hurt!<br/><br/>A really funny film, that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't, watch it and leave your reservations at the door."

","This is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Everything about this film is great!  The story is surprisingly both sweet and hilarious at the same time.  The story is absolutely fantastic and incredibly well written, the story flows very smoothly from scene to scene and makes every character important to the overall story.  What makes this such a great story are all the great characters in the film, all played by fantastic actors.  It isn't often that you have a truly great comedy film with such a great cast.<br/><br/>The star is obviously Cameron Diaz, playing one of my personal favorite roles to date.  She's such a beautiful actress and such a good actress.  Ben Stiller, what can I say?  Nothing less than a STUD!!!  I absolutely love his character, he plays such a genuinely likable guy.  Ben's little movements and reactions completely make the movie for me.  Lee Evans really shows off his acting talent in this film as well, just amazing, that's all I have to say.  Matt Dillon, Jeffery Tambor, Lin Shaye, Chris Elliot, Keith David and everyone else also play their roles flawlessly.  I also feel that I have to mention W. Earl Brown, who plays the part of ""Warren"".  This guy is a truly fantastic actor!  It's too bad that comedies are exempt from receiving Oscars (well, not always), this guy plays a phenomenal supporting character. There are also some great cameos and minor roles, played by Richard Tyson, Rob Moran, Harland Williams, Sarah Silverman, Richard Jenkins and Brett Favre.<br/><br/>Those Farrelly Brothers are nothing less than comedic geniuses!!!  This is just another great comedy to add to their impressive list of comedy films. Keep up the good work guys!<br/><br/>The comedy in this film is pretty much what you'd expect from a Farrelly Brothers film, but this one REALLY pushes the envelope.  There is a lot of very ""dirty"" or ""questionable"" humor in this film...but it's just plain hilarious.  I would strongly urge you to see some of their earlier work first, and if you like any of those films, then give this one a shot.  This is most definitely not a comedy for everyone, but I sure found it funny as all hell.<br/><br/>I truly hope that you can respect this film for what it is and I hope, even more so, that you laugh just half as much as I did watching this film.

The Farrely Brothers seem to be in a league of their own in the American comedy market.

","A couple of scenes from There's Something About Mary have already become legend. The scrotum-in-the-zipper scene and, of course, the flying style-gel scene have guaranteed places in the Gross-Me-Out Hall of Fame. The Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby, have provided us with the funniest mainstream comedy since AUSTIN POWERS. <br/><br/>The minds behind the successful Dumb and Dumber and the overlooked Kingpin have concocted an outrageous batch of gags and assembled a game cast to embody them. Ben Stiller is Rhode Island Ted, a nerdy, mouth-full-of-metal highschooler who has a crush on the impossibly tall, blonde and beautiful Mary (Cameron Diaz). Much to his surprise, she becomes his date to the prom. Well, almost. A nasty close encounter with the aforementioned zipper dashes his hopes of romance on the dance floor. Thirteen years later, Ted, with the braces (and zipper) now removed, is still thinking of Mary. You see, there is definitely something special about Mary. He has her located in Miami by hiring a sleaze ball private investigator (Matt Dillon), and the obsession continues. <br/><br/>Stiller is endearing as smitten Ted and Diaz is absolutely charming as Mary. No doubt, there's something about Cameron. You can easily see why she is driving everyone crazy. A terrific supporting cast including Dillon, Lee Evans, Chris Elliot and Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, add laughs. Quite astonishing is Lin Shaye as Mary's ever-present neighbor, Magda, whose bleached-blonde bouffant is way beyond white and whose dangerously tanned skin reminds me of a top-quality Naugahyde sofa. Look for Magda's dog Puffy too. He deserves a doggie Oscar all his own. Love Puffy's stunt double, which looks like an overgrown, stiff-legged Beanie Baby, has seen better days. The Farrelly brothers are now at work on Stuck on You about Siamese twins. Watch out for double the fun and double the flying body fluids."

I've seen a lot of BAD comedies; I dare say that a majority of movies that strive for that genre marginally produce laughter from me. There's nothing worse than a contrived comedy scene that fails to make you laugh.<br/><br/>But, considering all of this movie's contrived scenes, I can't imagine for a second that anyone would think this comedy to be over the top or gratuitous in any way. The bawdy and prurient scenes certainly push the envelope of what we're used to in any movie, but they're all logical conclusions to the comedy sequences in which they belong. And boy, they made me laugh to the point of embarrassment since I'm so not used to laughing so hard.<br/><br/>I also have a problem with the word ""offensive,"" because just about anything put into a context in which it doesn't belong can be deemed ""offensive."" Even a Cross. Or an American flag.<br/><br/>Now, I thought Dumb and Dumber was horrible and contrived. Kingpin was great, but was less of a comedy than it was a cult-ish romp of fun. But there's something about Something About Mary... the Farelly brothers have perfected what they've strived for in their past films.<br/><br/>So, if you don't get it, you're either a) a victim of the dumbed down, politically correct, sterile intellect that is constantly being pushed by the mainstream media, or b) just no damn fun to be around.

","While not always averse to crude humor, although I usually would rather see it on a limited scale (Blazing Saddles is an exception), excesses and stupidity mean gross-out humor.  And they also make a movie silly and sophomoric.  And this idiotic movie about sophomoric-type people is not funny most of the time. <br/><br/>For the romance, we have Mary (Cameron Diaz, attractive, not beautiful, in my book) pursued by numerous love interests, and finally won over by a loser/schmuck.  And was he ever.  My girlfriend asked me whether women, too, should be entitled to some appealing good looks and other things, you know, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, whoever.  But I guess it was part of the humor, loser humor.  Cameron Diaz in this movie is pretty with a girl-next-door look, but not sexy, like she can appear in photos and other movies.  Her acting job, however, was better than that of any of the main men.  Aside from the dumb scenes, the movie drags at times, particularly at the finish, when I wanted the movie just to get it over with and end, end, end.<br/><br/>Why did TV Guide name the gel scene one of the top 50 of all time?  It is one of the (narrower number) most idiotic of all time, and yet it still would have acquitted itself a little better if it were shorter and not pompously drawn out.  But it should be emphasized that almost all the crude scenes lacked the subtlety of When Harry Met Sally and The Truth About Cats and Dogs, and of Mel Brooks, who knows how to make crude humor funny.  And the stuff in There's Something About Mary does not have the humor of slapstick, which I love.  It is, look at me, how idiotically silly, rather than klutzy, I am.  Little intelligence or wit went in.  This movie is vastly overrated, and only for people with bad taste and infantile dispositions."

When the movie ended I realized I hadn't laughed a single time, and since this is labeled as a comedy, this is bad, right? Before you start wondering if I am the kind of person who only gets laughs out of Woody Allen, let me tell you that I did laugh with, say, Beavis and Butthead Do America, so gross comedy is not a problem with me. The problem isn't the movie's very low-brow, or its highly-touted political incorrectness (which after all is pretty harmless), the problem is the jokes' timing. Even if you hadn't been told the jokes already, you could see them coming from a mile away, and then they are stretched out beyond breaking point. The best thing about this movie is Cameron Diaz, who proves to be an able and charismatic comedian, and not simply a ""bombshell.""

"stryker-5","Null","1","2","10 December 1999"," ""That Was Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!""
","The Farrelly brothers produced and directed this outstanding comedy film, and are fast assuming cult status as generators of high-quality 'nerd humour' pieces.  <br/><br/>    Ted is a dorky high school student who falls in love with the beautiful and vivacious Mary, a girl who has recently moved to this Rhode Island neighbourhood.  Ted is smitten by Mary (played with immense charm by Cameron Diaz) simply because she knows his name.  No 'babe' has ever bothered to remember who Ted is until now.  His fumbling ways mark him down as a loser from the outset.  He is completely tongue-tied when asking Berenice to the senior prom, and even worse misfortune befalls him when he attempts to escort Mary.  A catalogue of amusing disasters at Mary's home culminates in a cringe-making accident.  The comic invention of this scene is marvellous. Just watch for the wedding photo on Mary's mantelpiece.<br/><br/>    So far, the film has been a traditional American high school comedy, but now the story leaps forward thirteen years.  Mary has qualified in medicine at Princeton and is now in private practice somewhere in Florida.  Ted (Ben Stiller) has not shaken off the aura of a loser, but at least the sad hairstyle has been abandoned.  He is now a regular, likeable guy - and still carrying a torch for Mary.<br/><br/>    His friend Dom (Chris Elliott) advises Ted to go after his dream.  He persuades Ted to hire a private investigator in order to trace Mary.  Enter Matt Dillon as the irresistibly cruddy sleazeball private eye, Pat Healey. The film may be moving along nicely at this point, but Dillon provides booster rockets.   The reviving of the dog is a gem of a scene.<br/><br/>    It is interesting to see English stand-up comic Lee Evans taking on a dramatic role (Tucker).  Later, when he is Norm the pizza boy, his American accent occasionally slips, but as one would expect of him, he does the comedy mime stuff exceptionally well.<br/><br/>    There are some very funny stand-alone set pieces in the film, such as the gay bust and the squad room antics.  Perhaps one shouldn't look too hard for schematic treatments in a light-hearted caper such as ""Mary"", but there are some discernible themes in place here.  One recurrent device is dissembling, with the characters constantly surprising the viewer by revealing their 'true' identities, and similarly, much of the plot information on which we rely turns out to be bogus.  It is as if the male characters know that they are unworthy of Mary's love, and have to bolster their prospects by erecting impressive facades.  The only guy who remains true to himself is the one who wins her heart.<br/><br/>    Another repeating joke is the geeky music.  A song duo accompanies the action with corny ditties which sound like they have been composed by thirteen-year-olds.  This is much funnier in practice than it sounds in black and white - and it has the added benefit of reinforcing the film's central premise - that Ted is an unlucky dipstick who can never hope for anything good in life.<br/><br/>    The switching of the action back and forth between warm Florida and wintry Rhode Island is a useful plot mechanism because it suggests movement in the story, and it points up the contrast between the cold, Maryless north and the bright, hopeful south, where Mary is.<br/><br/>    Physical and mental disability do not normally form the subject matter of popular comedy.  The Farrelly brothers and their writers (correctly, in my view) have approached this film from the angle that nothing is taboo, and (if handled well) disability can be funny.  They DO handle it well, and it IS funny.<br/><br/>    ""Mary"" is an appealing, good-natured film which owes much to Cameron Diaz for its charm and lightness of touch.  The cast clearly enjoy working together, and the final credits include an unusual treatment of ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"" which encapsulates the sense of exuberant good fun in which this excellent film is steeped."
"Rainfox","Null","1","2","21 October 1999"," Infantile something about nothing
","* (1 star of 5)<br/><br/>There`s Something About Mary Directed by Bobby and Peter Farelli, 1999<br/><br/>Infantile something about nothing<br/><br/>I did not watch this movie amidst all the hype that it enjoyed when it was released (and grossing in excess of $100 million in US box office). Maybe that is why. Then again, maybe not. <br/><br/>This movie is one big, loud, silly, vulgar, pathetic and - excuse me - 'dumb-ass' movie. The latter in the sense that it contains scenes so stupid and so degrading that I was actually watching most of it with my mouth open in total amazement as to the length the Farelly brothers went in creating what I term 'shock-laughs'. <br/><br/>There is male sperm being mistaken for hair gel. There is the male genitals getting stuck in a zipper (and was that the most original they could come up with? I mean, Porky`s The Movie, did a better twist on the `male penis' - giggle giggle - getting stuck `somewhere' and that was over 20 years ago!), there is animal cruelty, there is handicapped people being made fun of, and there is a pair of old breasts courtesy of an elderly woman made out to ridicule.  <br/><br/>All of this can be fun, do not get me wrong. If done in an original and fresh form. Only this is so vivid and so out-there that it most of the time seems oddly restrained in all of its brash nature and truly un-appropriate throughout.<br/><br/>And what`s with that fake dog? My local toy store has better stuffed teddy bears. Scenes like that of the much used clichè : 'girl´s killer dog attacking the boy who is there to pick her up for a date', well they have been seen a million times before. So the least they could do was make something of it. But oh no. It really is annoying to the point you would question the effort they - the film makers - lacked in trying just vaguely to make this somewhat believable for the sake of a good laugh. Instead we get Ben Stiller wrestling a toy dog.<br/><br/>Knowing the directors (they also made the crude and over-the-top Jim Carrey laugh, Dumb & Dumber, yet here Carrey added a touch of poignancy to the stupid laughs), There`s Something About Mary will not shock as many people as is intended. It strives so hard to be as unpolitically correct as possible and is merely concieved as being a bunch of implausible laughs blown totally out of proportion. <br/><br/>It is beyond screwball. It is screwball fast forwarded.<br/><br/>
It may work (and obviously did at the box office) for teenagers but since it has no subtlety whatsoever I kept expecting aliens to land og Mary to turn into an axe-murderer.<br/><br/>I remember seeing the trailer for this movie. All the above mentioned scenes were in it. Also a scene where Mary`s brother gets a fish hook stuck in Ben Stillers mouth. And that is about it. There you have it. The laughs. I have talked to many people who were dissapointed in the movie because the trailer already showed all the laughs. In a nutshell people; the film makers again play it as loud as possible whenever possible. Even when editing the trailer. <br/><br/>This movie has not got one, honest laugh. Ok, correction. There is one good belly-shaker. A mix up. The main character played by Ben Stiller gets mistaken for somebody else and held in custody by the local (southern) police force (subsequently Stiller gets fondled by a big brute in jail and so forth). Ever seen such a scene in any movie before in your life? Yeah, exactly."

","Many years ago, I read a comment by a past great comic (I can't remember who it was) who said that modern examples of toilet humor just meant that the writers couldn't come up with real comedy. That might apply as well to writers of raunchy, distasteful and demeaning material. One hesitates to call it humor or comedy. I am aware, though, that there is a market for such material, so there are those writers (and producers, actors and others) who would want to cash in on it.<br/><br/>Thus we have this 1998 film, ""There's Something About Mary."" The cast leads in this film all have shaky records of success with comedies. That goes for Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, especially. Matt Dillon's career is most promising with drama. Most of these comedies have not been box office hits. And for most such films, the efforts for comedy are primarily situational, along with the crude and crass dialog. There is minimal clever or witty dialog. It does seem that the writers for this film checked their minds at the theater doors.<br/><br/>Other reviewers noted the newness of the comedy approach in this 1998 film. And, while it was a big box office hit (probably because of the interest in the new comedy method), the brand didn't stick as a huge success. For that, there have been more failures (losses) than successes (profits). Most movie fans, it seems, still prefer intelligent, genuine comedy and clever scripts over the obscene and crude. The two stars are for a couple of funny instances in this otherwise dreary attempt at humor."

That is a minor problem which is soon forgotten with the craziness.

From the opening scene to the end it hit me as a masterpiece and I think it still stands as one of the greatest comedies ever made. About half of the crowd members in that first showing walked out in disgust and one even asked me how I could laugh at such things but I went back and watched it four more times and it seemed, weeks after its release, people finally got what was so special about the movie. This is one of the few comedies that keeps my eyes watered up from laughing so hard. The hilarious prom sequence, the drugged up dog, the wacky group of characters and the hilarious jail sequence. There are so many hilarious moments in this film that I think it deserves it's statue as a classic. Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Lee Evans and Chris Elliott are all wonderful in the film and all of them have the perfect comedy timing to really make all of their characters blend together well. I also think Keith David, as Mary's stepfather, doesn't get the credit he deserves because the hysterical prom sequence gets a lot of laughs due to his humor. The gross out nature of the film is something that was original and of crouse ripped off in future years.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","4","26 March 2000"," One of the best films of the year
","The Farrelly brothers' There's Something About Mary is a crude yet surprisingly sweet comedy that involves a 13-year crush, a casted up dog, and a zipper problem (Beans above the frank is quite the original gag).  The film turns out to be a top notch comedy that puts the characters into ridiculous yet hilarious situations that makes them even more like-able. These characters include the Pathetic detective (Matt Dillon), the 2-sided personality (Lee Evans), the real one who's in love (Ben Stiller) and the apple of their eyes Mary (Played nice by Cameron Diaz).  Packed into 2 hours of gross-out comedy, this film is the funniest film of the year, and of many others.  A++"
"Atreyu_II","3","1","5","8 February 2008"," I hate this movie
","Unlike so many people, who claim that this movie is very funny or a great comedy (and so on...), I can't possibly understand all the success around this film. In fact, I practically never laughed when I saw this movie. If I laughed, it was only one or two times with something minor (like a minor comment from some character or something).<br/><br/>This movie is just way too overrated. When I saw it, it was for two main reasons: because of Cameron Diaz (I used to like her more back then than nowadays) and also because I thought this would be a clever, worthy and funny comedy.<br/><br/>Instead, I had a big shock. This movie is absolutely hideous, full of cheap and ""toilet"" humor and profanity. Besides, its jokes are cruel, dirty, disturbing, shocking and sickening. Its humor is really disgusting, trashy and insulting. I expected at least a reasonable romantic comedy, not a nasty movie.<br/><br/>Almost everything about this movie angered me. But some ""jokes"" in particular angered me even more than everything else. These ""jokes"" were the following ones: whenever Mary's retard brother attacks the innocent Ted; Ted's painful and disturbing zipper accident; when Mary's dog attacks Ted on a certain part (needless to say which part); when Ted is taken by the police and those cruel policemen grab on Ted's face and slam it brutally on a table; when Ted leaves at the end heartbroken; the scene with sperm on Mary's hair; and finally, the final scene when an old man shoots a singer.<br/><br/>Poor Ted! He only suffers during the whole movie. He's fooled, humiliated, abused, he's the victim!<br/><br/>If *this* movie is considered funny, then I'm concerned about what people find funny nowadays. Seriously, a movie like this isn't something I find entertaining, worthy, amusing or funny. This movie left me in very bad mood and, to make things even worst, it is too long considering the garbage it is - almost 2 hours! I was only wishing that it would come to an end. I refuse to ever watch this movie again and that's for sure. <br/><br/>For those who never saw this movie, let me give an advice: skip it and try instead an intelligent comedy with really funny humor (not dirty humor) such as ""Liar Liar"", ""Mousehunt"" and ""Johnny English"", for example."
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","5","17 October 2005"," Released in the same year as the Lewinsky thing, how could anyone not think about ""hair gel""?
","You may not be prepared for some of the scenes in ""There's Something About Mary"" (not the least of which is the zipper scene), but you're sure to like them nonetheless. The plot of course has loser Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) trying to find high school sweetheart Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz). However, EVERYONE wants to find Mary, and a number of whacked-out incidents ensue. Most famous is the ""hair gel"" scene, but that's just one of many. With great support from Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Lee Evans, and others, this is one gross-out fest that you can't afford to miss. Those Farrelly brothers are truly something else."
"dbdumonteil","4","1","5","3 June 2003"," Yes, she only causes torments!
","One of the most successful movies launched in 1998 and as far as I'm concerned, I find it hard for me to explain the reason of this enormous success because this movie is devoid of interest. I'd like to speak well of this comedy but I can't succeed in. However, the main idea of the movie was interesting. This is the story of a young man (Ben Stiller who wish to pick up the trail of a girl he loved, Mary (Cameron Diaz) when he was in high school. For this, he hires a detective (Matt Dillon) but it's not easy: not only falls Dillon in love with her but the competition is very hard because Mary's got other admirers, notably a so-called architect (Lee Evans) and even an elderly man!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers obviously felt like introducing a crude and even disgusting humor which is everything except funny. When you think about ""Toto le héros"" a fantastic movie made by Jaco Van Dormael who succeeded in introducing a quiet and ironic humor even in dramatic sequences, you can't help feeling dismay towards ""there's something about Mary"".  Not only, its humor lacks of sharpness and subtlety but it's also completely irrelevant and it doesn't lend itself to certain sequences in the movie. This major flaw spoils it and it's a pity because it enjoys a good performance, especially Matt Dillon and Lee Evans. At last, a predictable and convenient happy-end comes to crown it all.<br/><br/>For me, ""there's something about Mary"" is a movie to forget"

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. the jokes are not funny at all. in fact they are downright vulgar. they have some scenes of an older lady taking her
shirt off and showing her torso. they also make fun of a retarded kid.<br/><br/>I dont understand the appeal of cameron diaz. yes she has a pretty face, but she was not at all funny in this movie.<br/><br/>I can get more laughs out of an episode of three's company."
"hhfarm-1","1","1","6","12 February 2007"," Something really stinks about this movie
","Someone lent this to me and I watched it before I researched it. Big mistake.<br/><br/>The Farrellys are the worst of the worst. Their ""comedies"" are dumbed down in the tradition of Blake Edwards, Mel Brooks (but without any of Brooks' redeeming flashes of brilliance) or the Marx Brothers. It's every bit as bad as the 3 Stooges or Jim Carrey. So, yes, if you like that kind of thing you'll love ""....Mary"".<br/><br/>Watching this was like watching some old-time comedy that my grandmother cackled through ""Oh, he tripped and his head went into the cow's you-know-what.""; continuity is wasted on an audience as stupid as we are; each small joke is repeated and magnified so many times that even folks not watching the movie will get it; the lines are crass, stupid and ill-timed; the soundtrack miserable; the acting pathetic - which is OK for Diaz and Stiller but Dillon can do much better.<br/><br/>The plot is that Stiller's character has a prom date with Diaz's character. He gets his dick caught in his zipper; her parents, some cops, the rescue squad, a neighbor, .... et al see it and laugh. Then we see some close-ups of flesh caught in a zipper, just so we really get it. The Farrellys are the loud jocks who love practical jokes like nudging you at the urinal and telling you that they spit on your sandwich.<br/><br/>Years later Stiller hires Dillon's character (a private detective) to find Mary. He does, but then tries to keep her for himself. This is handled with gross and clumsy lines - she's a fat pig on welfare with multiple kids. This could have evolved into a good story but it would be too subtle so they introduce more and more suitors until a small crowd - all professing love - have it out in the dÃ©nouement.<br/><br/>Diaz is all about her winning smile and great body. Yes, yes, she's a babe. But she has two facial expression (glee & more glee) and really does nothing else. There are many actresses with equivalent looks and talent to match who take difficult roles. Diaz just wanders and giggles her way through.<br/><br/>I thought ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Kingpin"" were abysmal. This was worse."
"johnkal","1","1","6","15 August 2005"," one of the worst ever
","What happened here? Multiple friends (many who've been friends for over 30 years) raved and raved about this movie until they convinced me to go see it with them. (The two people I went with were seeing the movie for the fourth or fifth time.) Excruciating. Stultifying. I sat there the entire movie thinking, when do the funny things happen? (Answer: they didn't.) Since seeing the movie, I've come to an interesting observation, and I wonder if anyone else has experienced anything similar. It's clear in my case that all who loved this movie are straight people, and all who hated it/were bored by it are gays. So, someone do a study here -- what is about gay sensibility that can't find humor that is obviously present for straights?"
"zombiemockingbird","1","1","7","26 December 2019"," Seriously Bad
","I tried to watch this once years ago because everyone said it was a great, funny movie. I don't remember how far I got before shutting it off in disgust, I tried again recently to watch it, thinking maybe I was having a bad day the first time. Nope. I only got to the stuck zipper/bathroom scene before quitting this time. Who on earth finds it funny to make fun of people who are mentally disabled? Or people not as attractive as others? Or people who are really stupid. And who thinks its funny to humiliate someone in public? This movie is an embarrassment; and in a world where people are offended by everything, I can't imagine how anyone finds this piece of garbage funny."

","From beginning to end ""There's Something About Mary"" provides non-stop laughs, lovable characters, and an easy to follow plot but yet has hysterical twists and turns. Solid comedy!"
"DJ_Shilo","10","0","1","2 May 2020"," Franks and Beans
","I laughed my head off, and this is the funniest comedy I have ever seen. ""There's Something About Mary"" at its core is an exercise in being politically incorrect and skates a fine line on bad taste but with a direction as opposed to being outrageous for no reason. Cameron Diaz is a peach as the loveable Mary, but it's the rest of the idiots trying to get to her that drive the plot. Okay, all but one idiot. He's just a love-struck dummy.<br/><br/>It's about Ted Stroehman (Ben Stiller), who is bedazzled by a loveable girl, Mary (Cameron Diaz), in high school. After an unfortunate accident happens and he can't take Mary to the prom, years go by, and he still yearns for her. Wondering if he can reignite the spark they briefly had, he hires a private investigator, Pat Healey (Matt Dillion), to track her down. Ted quickly realizes that everyone who sets their sights on the dazzling Mary falls head over heels for her. With a slew of idiots after her, Ted tries to rekindle his romance with Mary and win her heart.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz lights up the screen in what I believe will be her signature role as she brings the heart and charm to the movie. Mary is a beauty with a sunny smile, and she lights up the dreams of geeky Ted in high school when he rescues her retarded brother, Warren (W. Earl Brown) from being attacked by a jerk off that Ted's idiot friends set up and she asks him to go to the prom. Mary is not the typical blondie dummy who always chooses the jacked-up jock with an arrogant attitude, and that's what makes her smart and loveable. Ted goes to pick her up, and it leads to the film's wildest scene involving a zipper. Aside from a close-up, I won't spoil it, but the scene with have you howling with laughter, and it leads to a funny moment with Warren nicknaming him ""Franks and Beans"" and yelling ""He was masturbating"" to the whole neighbourhood. I couldn't handle myself laughing, and if you don't think funny, this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>Thirteen years go by, and Ted is still in love with Mary, so he hires the biggest sleazeball ever seen, and he is Pat Healey, who has the looks that would make any woman want to run and the smile that says it all. When we first see him in his office, he looks like a weasel with his pants unbuttoned when he goes to stand up from his chair. Pat finds Mary living a peachy life in Miami, and she is still a gorgeous babe who is single, and Pat decides he wants her, so he tells Ted that she is 250 pounds, has four kids and has been shipped to Japan as a mail-order bride. Healey begins eavesdropping on Mary's conversations so he will know to say the right things because he is an idiot otherwise, and this is where most of the movie gets its humour. When Healy meets her a golf range, he pretends to be the man of her dreams until he discovers that another idiot is after Mary posing as an architect that uses crutches.<br/><br/>Ted gets wind that Healy set him up, and he wants Mary, so he heads down to Miami to rekindle their romance and push Healey to the side. The only problem is, she doesn't know he hired Healey to spy on her. The comic genius behind the writing is what makes the characters a class act for stupidity, and they are so dumb, but you can't help but laugh at their failed attempts to woo Mary. One screw the other over, and then someone else screws that one over. One of the funnier moments is when Mary ends up getting falsely told that Healey is a murderer by someone, and oh boy, does he ever get his ass kicked for that one. You can't help but laugh at it all. When you see all these characters chasing after Mary and the lengths they go to are unbelievable funny.<br/><br/>Ted also has another friend named Dom (Chris Elliott) who gives Ted advice that leads to the film's most comical gag. I won't spoil it, but it involves Mary's hair. Lin Shaye plays Mary's suntanned friend who looks toasted. Into the third act, the film gets by on gags, one involving speed because of two idiots. I wasn't expecting much of an ending, but I was surprised. They attempt a twist with one of the characters, which was also a surprise, and I figured the laughs were done but no. When everyone is in Mary's apartment, and she sees all the dummies that were after her, Pat attempts to woo her with his goofy smile, and she looks at him and says,"" Are you crazy? You're a murderer."" And the look on Matt Dillion's face made me howl when he looks at the character that set him up with ass-kicking intent.<br/><br/>After all the comedies that have failed to generate genuine laughs, this movie is a winner with a crazy but sweet ending that will leave you smiling. It's more than just the humour to the film, even if it's about a bunch of morons trying to manipulate a woman they all want, but you can look at these characters and see the stupid but harmless nature of them, and that's what makes them funny and likeable. The film may be a bit crazy, but it has its heart in the right place and is a must-see this summer. This movie is going to be one of my favourite films for many years to come."

","The story: Ben Stiller had a HUGE highschool crush on the gorgeous Cameron Diaz. 15 years later he still secretly loves her and decides to go look for her. Will love blossom again?<br/><br/>There aren't many comedies which make me laugh so hard (at certain moments), that it starts to hurt. This movie ""There...Mary"" even makes me laugh simply thinking about it. It has so many iconic scenes that are to die for, but what is striking is that this movie is NOT a non stop silly comedy. It's a slowburning comedy, which lasts over 2 hours. Such a long length is unheard of for a comedy, but it never becomes boring, despite this length. On the contrary the many scenes that are not full blown jokes do contribute to learning to know the characters. I wouldnt call it character devellopment, but this movie is a fun story about LOOSERS, who are being portrayed in ALL their weaknesses and shameful anxieties. Sometimes gross, sometimes absolutely silly, sometimes endearing, but ALWAYS HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>Really, really good acting and a terrific story. Many comedies NEVER get credited for good acting or for great dialogue, but this movie has both. I love it. I love it. I love it."

","When I initially saw this film twenty years ago, it was my first look at Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, probably Matt Dillon too. Frozen in time, I don't think Diaz ever looked better. The story then proceeded to throw in some scandalous moments, like the zipper incident and the 'hair gel' scene. I recall getting embarrassed in the theater, not so much for myself but for the actors involved. This is one of your lowest common denominator pictures that will appeal to prepubescent young males and perhaps a slightly deranged adult or two. Adding even more to Stiller's embarrassment was that lame wrestling bit with Puffy; not even a pretense that the thing was a stuffed animal. There's only one legitimate recommendation coming out of the movie, and that was Mary's (Diaz) advice to watch ""Harold and Maude"". Check that one out for some real laughs."

OK, I'm a Marx Brothers fan and you could probably accuse them of all sorts of implausibilities, but they still produced classic comedy. This was tepid stuff at best."

"cleary-joshua","6","0","1","3 July 2013"," I feel no sudden urge now to watch any other Farrelly brothers films...
","I confess that before I watched this, I had not seen any Farrelly brothers films. Not Dumb and Dumber, not Shallow Hal. Nothing. And now that I have witnessed ""There's Something about Mary"", I feel no sudden urge to watch any of their other films. I found it frequently disgusting in its source of humour and a bit too over-the-top. Now, you may accuse me of being a film snob, but I didn't dislike it because I only like black and white or foreign films. I don't. I disliked it because its sense of humour was very different to mine, and I have a very broad sense of humour. This would only be a hilarious movie if you find a continual onslaught of rude and disgusting jokes funny. If, after two whole hours, you still find a perverted man with ever- increasing hives funny, this is definitely the film for you. Unfortunately, I don't.<br/><br/>And that's another point. This movie, 119 minutes in length, is far too long for the genre of comedy that it's in. There are only so many gross-out jokes you can make, and after about 90 minutes, it all feels a bit monotonous. So, among all of these negative comments, what saves this film from being completely terrible and unfunny? The answer to that is Ben Stiller. Since this film, he has gone on to star in gems like ""Dodgeball"" and especially ""Meet the Parents"". In ""There's Something about Mary"" we see the foundations to the socially-awkward character which he perfected over the years. He makes a fantastic love-struck teenager, and later on, a great awkward adult. He delivers a lot of his lines in a hilarious way, and he makes most of his scenes completely watchable, unlike many other characters that just make you a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>There were definitely some jokes that I did like. The entrance of the shrink at the end of the session is really funny, as is the murder of the ever-present guitar player, whose death is very welcome by the end. The overlying sentiment of the film also has some part in its saving, and we do see the true love that exists between Mary and Ted, despite all of the characters around them vying for her love.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an unintelligent and often unwatchable farce, but it does have occasional fine moments, which save it from being completely terrible."

","Crude and irreverent, I couldn't believe that this film was fifteen years old, and I hadn't seen it. Well, I have now. The film is a romantic comedy setting up elaborate gag after elaborate gag. I had of course heard of some of them over the years. Maybe they would have been funnier if I had seen the movie fresh. As it is, I found it amusing, but not big-time funny. Matt Dillon's sleazy character really didn't ring true to me. I doubt it was supposed to, but I found it distracting. Like the fake dog in the scenes where it was being ""injured"". Amusing, though. What can you say about Cameron Diaz? So pretty, such ingenuous sincerity. If you haven't seen this film, (anybody?) it's worth checking out, just don't expect it to be the best movie ever."
"StevePulaski","7","0","1","29 March 2011"," Something about this seems off
","The Farrelly Brothers always try to include at least one gross out scene in their movies. In There's Something About Mary the scene is when Ben Stiller is masturbating before his big date with Cameron Diaz. When Stiller finishes, he goes to the door only to find out the sperm is on his ear. Diaz mistakes it for hair gel, puts it in her hair, and that leads to one of many comical situations in There's Something About Mary.<br/><br/>While not all of the film is hilarious, many scenes to squeeze out a bad or a good laugh. Ben Stiller plays Ted Stroehmann who was a geeky braceface in High School who had a date with Mary (Diaz) for Senoir Prom. Because of an embarrassing accident Ted was unable to accompany Mary to that prom and has never seen her since.<br/><br/>Thirteen years later, Ted hires Pat (Dillon), a sleazeball private detective who falls head of heels when he finds Mary who now lives in Miami. Pat lies to Ted about Mary's life so he can have her all to herself. Ted believes something is up, and it becomes a game for Mary's love.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is one of my favorite female leads because she is one of the very actors/actresses that can go crazy without getting carried away. Unlike Jim Carrey who is so over the top and ridiculous he is unwatchable, but Diaz has smarts and clever wit behind her gags which makes her a joy to watch on screen.<br/><br/>There's Something About Mary is way more clever than Dumb and Dumber, but it still has things that bother me. Mainly the ridiculous and obnoxious scenes of Ben Stiller fighting with Mary's roommate's dog Puffy that goes on and on. Obviously the dog fighting is not real, but I've always felt squeamish, uncomfortable, and just upset by anytime of animal harm in films.<br/><br/>The scene is around three minutes in length, and it's unnecessary. I don't see the humor of a grown humor wrestling with a dog on a floor bending, squeezing, choking, strangling, and harming a defenseless dog. Major downfall in the quality just because of an unnecessary scene.<br/><br/>Besides the mean-spirited clip, There's Something About Mary not only charms in humor but it's characters are strong. Stiller and Dillon are a great on screen pair even though Dillon makes you hate his character the whole time he is on screen. Not to mention Chris Elliot is great as well. The true highlight is Cameron Diaz, but the whole cast is just perfect in their own right.<br/><br/>There's Something About Mary is a few points shy of being ""the perfect comedy"" film.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliot, Lee Evans, and Lin Shaye. Directed by: Bobby and Peter Farrelly."

From the high school years and proceeding forward, the laughs don't stop coming as the movie goes on with each character (Healy, The hitchhiker, Tucker, Woogy, as well as the supporting cast) bringing a new incident that cracks you up. This is a one of a kind romantic comedy that truly stands out. There's no exaggeration or the cast / script writers trying too hard in any of the sequences. The movie just sails through with the viewer wanting more after each scene. Lets not forget the entertaining soundtrack and music which makes the impact of each scene felt in the viewer. Cameron Diaz fits the role of Mary perfectly. Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon are also at their very best. There's Something About Mary is truly a treat to watch."
"csimpkins53","Null","0","1","4 March 2011"," ""Greek chorus""-Jonathan Richman
","My only complaint about the movie is the use of the ""Greek chorus"" composed of Jonathan Richman and a drummer (sorry, I don't know the name of the drummer). First of all Jonathan Richman can't sing worth sh** and secondly the Greek chorus is nothing but an annoying intrusion into the story. I watch this movie every now and then and I always mute the volume and fast forward through the scenes in which the Greek chorus appears. My absolute favorite scene in the movie is towards the end when Richman gets shot and falls into the water! I always say: YES!!!, good riddance! Too bad this didn't happen in the FIRST scene! Otherwise I think this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Some people complain about the ""lowbrow"" humor, but actually, that's why it's so funny! Cameron Diaz certainly adds the appropriate eye candy!"
"gavin6942","7","0","3","22 January 2011"," I Dislike Raunchiness and Diaz, But Still Like This Film
","""There's Something About Mary"" is definitely one of the funniest films of the last twenty years. I am not a fan of Cameron Diaz, and I do not care for the trend of raunchiness in films (such as the ""American Pie"" movies) but this one has enough wit and charm that I can look past that.<br/><br/>Also, the cast is pretty incredible to have all in one movie: besides Cameron Diaz, you have Matt Dillon, Ben Stiller, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Jeffrey Tambor, Keith David, Sarah Silverman, Jonathan Richman, Richard Jenkins, and Harland Williams. Holy cow! <br/><br/>There is no substitute for watching a film unedited, but if it is playing on FX, you may want to catch it there. The editing is hilarious: they keep the drug scene and the semen, but edit the heck out of the cursing, including dubbing in the phrase ""frogging ashbowl""."

","I felt kind of guilty when I was watching this film, and I'm sure many people before me have also. I mean how can they not? The Farrley Brothers have insulted pretty much everyone in this film, and I knew that this was wrong, but I couldn't help myself. From gender to race, gays to bi's, rich to poor, old to young, handicapped to retarded. No one is spared. No one is safe from being utterly offended. However in despite of the amazingly crude humour against the people of society, ""There's Something About Mary"" is inescapably, and undeniably, an incredibly funny film that can not passed from anyone belonging to any of the listed categories of people.<br/><br/>It's a classic in comedy that definitely deserves the reputation of being one of the most outrageous pieces of image moving entertainment ever. While it tells a very obvious story, the hard hitting comedy never fails to amuse audiences. Ted (Ben Stiller) scores a prom date with the most beautiful girl in school, Mary, played by the luscious Cameron Diaz. But due to a painfully unfortunate event and a very public rush to the hospital, the date had to be postponed, after which the lovable Mary moved away, out of Ted's life. Thirteen years later, Ted is still fixed on Mary's memory and hires a private investigator to look her up. But when the sleazy P.I ends up falling in love with Mary also, an endless love fest of pathetic men competing for Mary's heart takes place, and it's not pretty.<br/><br/>The plot twists in this movie are just as funny and entertaining as the insulting cultural referencing. However it's not as good as Cameron Diaz's wonderful performance. I've always been a sucker for the adorably humorous and stunningly beautiful Cameron Diaz. I'll admit that the only reason I considered watching this movie in the first place was for her irresistible charm. In fact, I'm pretty sure, that without Ms Diaz to play the role of Mary, this movie wouldn't have even worked. It goes to show you just how dependent this movie really is. You take away Cameron, and you take away the movie.<br/><br/>But I'm not going to be one-sighted. There are many more things to be loved in this movie besides Ms Diaz. Like for example the ridiculously funny and disturbing bathroom scene, you know which one I'm talking about, the unfortunate event that took place just before prom night thirteen years ago. While it may have put some people off, that was one of the most painfully hilarious moments in film ever, and that's not just my opinion. I remember reading an article about the top ten bathroom scenes, and as I recall, that was definitely one of the top 3, along side the scene in ""Psycho"" by Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>""There's Something about Mary"" is not for everyone, which is understandable, but it's also very sad, because this is one of the funniest movies ever made. Too miss it, would be to miss out on one the most enjoyable experiences in comedy film. Cameron Diaz is at her most charming, and the Farrley Brother's are at their most funniest. Don't miss this film, because I assure you that one day, you'll regret it."

"brandon_lee420","7","0","1","26 April 2010"," A great cast!
","Before I had even watched the film, I predicted that it would be one of those sh*tty films, like American Pie, and my prediction blurred my mind and so I never got to watch it.... until now. The idea of Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, and Matt Dillon starring together in a comedy film had to be good, and to make it even better, let the Farrelly Brothers direct it. The two brothers have directed sh*t and crap but it is good to know that that their goal isn't always to direct feces and if you want proof, watch There's Something About Mary. The rest can go in the toilet, with the exception of ""Dumb & Dumber"". I probably wouldn't ever like them as directors no MATTER what they make. Before I go any further let me warn you that this film isn't funny all the way through but it does have some scenes, five or six, that will make you laugh out loud. The story is pretty simple but likable and it has a sense of nostalgia stuck to it. It is about a guy who still thirteen years later is in love with the girl who he WAS supposed to go to the prom with but he never did make it since it was a complete disaster. (Minor Spoiler) Apparently, he had an accident in his girlfriends bathroom that consisted of his balls being stuck in his zipper which was pulled all the way up. The problem could have easily been fixed if the ambulance, fire truck, and EVERYONE hadn't been there to witness the once-in-a-lifetime event(Spoiler End). One of his ""beans"" was shown to the audience and it looked really gross but mostly, PAINFUL. The song ""There's something about Mary"" used in this film is stuck in my head for it's memorable lyrics and the deep voice by the guy who sang it, Jonathan Richman. The beat that goes along with it is catchy and enjoyable. Ben stiller who plays the unlucky Ted has, in this film, comedy written all over him. He plays his role well and the shift from a high school student to a grown up man is really obvious and greatly done. The make up artists have really done a good job of making an ugly Ted into a ""handsome"" one. Matt Dillon is, what I found in this film, very annoying and hateable and that is a good thing. I think that the director wanted him to be exactly that and Matt Dillon has hit that right on the mark but, of course, that doesn't change the way I fell about him in this movie. His character Pat Healy is very sneaky and manipulative but ""weird"" is the word to describe him. (Minor Spoiler) Which sick man will change his ugly teeth to more uglier ones just to impress the girl he wants to be(Spoiler End). Cameron Diaz on the other hand is more about looks than professionalism. I found her character Mary to be very smart, can't say that in real life though, and attractive, and that is why both of them are after her. Pat Healy describes her as: ""Husband... negative. Children and a Labrador... negative. Tight little package... affirmative."" To put it straight I wasn't too happy with Diaz.<br/><br/>Thirteen years ago, Ted (Ben Stiller) was last seen hanging out with a bunch of unattractive guys until he met Mary (Cameron Diaz). Their prom night was gone terribly wrong and his disaster resulted him landing in the hospital. Now, he still can't stop thinking about Mary. He hires a private investigator who goes by the name Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to tail Mary and her retarded brother, Warren. As soon as Pat sets his eyes on Mary, he wants her. He lies to Ted about her being fat and stuck in a wheelchair so he can capture her. He uses his gadgets to eavesdrop on Mary to find out her likes and interests but mostly the man of her dreams. Everything is going great until Ted finds out he is being lied to by a friend, Dom (Chris Elliot), who knows more about Mary than he is letting on. The race begins on who will steal Mary's heart.<br/><br/>My favorite bits were: the beginning in the bathroom and when Mary uses Ted's gel on hair, but is it actually gel? The worst bit was everything that contained Pat Healy and his annoying personality. The ending is probably one of the silliest endings in a long time. Of course, I won't spoil it for you but the ending nearly ruined the film, nearly..... The film involves homosexuals, psychopaths, balls, a*s, and a whole load of silliness. Be prepared to check your mood as soon as you start watching this. It is highly recommended for comedy fans because it does not disappoint and the plot for this film will keep viewers entertained. If not, forget that you ever read this review. There's something about Mary........ 7.2/10<br/><br/>""His friends would say stop whining, they've had enough of that. / His friends would say stop pining, there's other girls to look at. / They've tried to set him up with Tiffany and Indigo, / But there's something about Mary that they don't know. / Mary, there's just something about Mary."" Jonathan Richman"
"lewiskendell","8","0","1","21 March 2010"," A comedy worth watching repeatedly.
","It's the rare comedy that's even funnier the second time you watch it, than it was the first. Something about Mary fits that definition perfectly. It's one of the most memorable Ben Stiller comedies, for a lot of reasons. <br/><br/>The story itself isn't something that we haven't seen been before, but it's told exceptionally well and flows quickly from hilarious situation to hilarious situation. Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz have great on-screen chemistry, even though a lot of their time is spent with their equally funny co-stars. And it's nice to be reminded of how gorgeous she was in her younger days.  <br/><br/>Be prepared to wince and cover your eyes a few times, because some of the funniest moments in the movie are also the hardest to watch. Overly tanned boobs, painful crotch accidents, and masturbation jokes, are all par for the course. Something about Mary is raunchy, hysterical, and worth watching again and again."

After Healy discovers where Mary is at, he takes a special interest in her for himself.<br/><br/>Ted is determined to find Mary, the lost love of his life. He never gives up on winning her over. Years later, Ted discovers that Mary is in Miami, only to find out from Healy that she is not the same girl that he knew in high school. Ted is convinced by Dom to travel to Miami and see for his self. Healy is already two steps ahead of Ted trying to trick Mary into liking him. Mary's good friend, Tucker, is suspicious of Healy and decides to complicate things between the two. As Ted and Dom arrive in Miami, they spot Mary and Healy kissing in front of a building. Warren, Mary's brother, sees Ted hiding behind a tree. After Healy leaves, Dom calls out Mary's name for her to look in their direction. Once Ted and Mary notice one another, they pick up where they left off 13 years ago. Healy and Tucker try to corrupt their relationship, only to find out that there is a huge love circle with Mary in the middle.<br/><br/>As the love circle unfolds, Ted, Dom, Healy, Tucker, and Brett all have the same thing in common, Mary! Healy thinks Mary should make a choice on who she wants, but Ted feels she should be with Brett because she was misinformed by Tucker about him in the past. Ted leaves feeling sad and lonely, only to discover that Mary truly wants him in the end.<br/><br/>The motif here was everyone did whatever it took to get closer to Mary. They all took turns being deceitful with Mary, just to persuade her to be with them. This movie mainly used high-key lighting. High-key lighting is more suitable for comic movies like this one.<br/><br/>In the end, Ted was able to get Mary with his true and genuine kindness. Mary was attracted to Ted in high school. There love was meant to be. Ted never realized that he did not have to do much to convince Mary that they were right for one another."
"ramire09","6","0","1","15 March 2010"," Funny and Entertaining
","There's Something About Mary is a crazy romantic comedy film. It is pretty predictable but it is still fun to watch. The comedy in this film is definitely not your normal comedy. There is a lot of language and sexual innuendo in this film but it isn't really completely inappropriate. Even with all the craziness in this film there is still a nice story that is being told. This film is about being who you are and living with no regrets. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with Ted (Ben Stiller) who is kind of a geeky, teenage boy. He likes this girl named Mary (Cameron Diaz) who is a beautiful, popular girl. Ted sticks up for a boy who is being picked on and this boy happens to be Mary's brother. After this the two of them are supposed to go to prom together. When Ted shows up to take Mary to the prom he is using the restroom and has an unfortunate zipper accident which sends him to the hospital. After this Mary and her family move away and Ted does not see her again.<br/><br/>The movie then jumps ahead 14 years and Ted is in therapy discussing the issue. He talks about what happened and how he regrets never getting to see Mary again. He then decides to hire Healy (Matt Dillion) to go to Miami which is where Mary is now and ""spy"" on her. Healy does this and realizes that he wants Mary for himself so he reports back to Ted that she is still in Miami and he makes her sound unattractive so that Ted will change his mind about calling her. This works for a while but then Ted realizes what Healy did and he goes down to Miami to talk to Mary. This is not without a little convincing himself though. He is not sure that he is comfortable enough to do this. Eventually he works up enough nerve to go and talk to her. The two of them hit it off and begin dating until Mary finds out, through an anonymous letter, that Ted had sent Healy to spy on her. This is where Ted begins to realize that he needs to just get over himself and tell her how he feels. As he is walking out of her house, after they argue about the situation, he tells her the only reason that he did this was because he needed to find out once and for all what would have happened. <br/><br/>After this Mary is forced to make a decision as to who she wants to be with. She can be with Ted or she can be with Healy, who basically stalks her. Obviously she chooses Ted; it would be silly if the movie ended any other way.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I think this film does really well. That would be characterization. As I stated earlier this movie is crazy but at the center of it there is a really good story. The characters are really important to that story. I think the producers did a really good job casting the actors that they did. All of the actors portray the characters the way they were meant to be portrayed I think. <br/><br/>Overall I feel this movie was good. It is not my kind of movie but I still enjoyed the story and the characters. It is always nice to see a character work through some issues or regrets they may have and be happy in the end."

There's something about Mary is very pleasant film to watch. This film is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. In this film, Mary is the object of desire for all men because she is very beautiful and charming girl. In other words, any men would love to be with her. This film's story is about a man name Ted Strobmen and a woman name Mary. Ted has been in love with Mary since they were in high school. Ted convened Marry to go to the prom night. He seemed to be very excited about his first date with a beautiful girl, Mary when he went to picked up Mary at her house to go to prom. Unfortunately, a terrible incident took place that changed everything for him. It was very shocking and embarrassing accident. Instead of going to the prom he ended up going in hospital and never saw Mary again since she moved out to Miami, Florida. He truly fell in love with Mary. His friend Dom suggested him to hire a private investigator named Pat Healy. Pat Healy found Mary in Miami, Florida. However, instead of helping Ted, Pat Healy fell in love with her. He lied to Ted about Mary including her physical appearance. This was the moment I personally thought There's something about Mary. Finally, Ted went Miami, Florida and they met each other after 13 years. At the end, good wins over evils as Ted and Mary get back together. I personally like emotional, romantic and comedy movies and this film have really nice themes such as good versus evil, faithfulness versus disloyalty, and a true love. These themes are very similar to the film The Caribbean Pirates: Dead man's chest. These themes are very suitable for both films by supporting the plot and characters. The dialogs were supporting characters' with nice camera techniques in pretty much all scenes. <br/><br/>The editor has done excellent job on focusing circumstances and characters. The camera also called attention to emotions in few scenes. A close-up shot was used in zipper scene on actor's embarrassing face.

The movie ""There's something about Mary"" speaks a little about how we all feel while seeing that good looking blonde walking through the door that just says there's something about that girl. Let us face it, we have all been there and this movie puts it in the open by introducing Mary played Cameron Diaz in this stalking realm of comedy and laughter while breaking hearts of everyone around her.<br/><br/>Leaving a trail of love potion 69 Ted played by Ben Stiller shows us the real action and mindset of each individual guy in the world. Mary is extremely hot and old school driving him wild. In the directive approach using Mary as a sex symbol and then splicing her attitude with a female that enjoys the dirtiness of hot wings and good old fashion football Mary is the perfect match for trouble. Being stalked for most her life starting in high school Mary leaves haunting love bug Dom (Woogie) played by Chris Elliot bitten and stricken for his last breathe to see Mary as his own.<br/><br/>The movie really brings us closer to thoughts and ideas making the plot and theme really clear to what the main objective is and how the movie plans to display it artistically. Using dramatic impulses in the back of our conscience asking ourselves what is so special about Mary. The director's main focus is on the idea of making us all want to fall in love with Mary. They use the ideas that her character is to perfect for words by making her a guys best friend or girl next door that we all want to meet. The plot from the beginning takes us only a short amount of time to decipher because it is apparent that either Ben Stiller's character is in love with Mary or he is a major dork with hopes far beyond his wildest dreams.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed this movie because it involved plenty of action with the some of the best actors in Hollywood. Later during the film Healy played by Matt Dillon makes his debut as a wonderful private eye that can't keep his eyes to himself. Not only does he add to Teds problems trying to hunt down the love of his life, he is the problem in Ted's life. Adding to the plot as the villain unseen Matt Dillon's character prepares us to take a nose dive out of a typical love story in to a beautiful disaster arena of lying and scheming. He is not the trust worthy character he usually plays, nor is Tucker played by Lee Evans, Mary's best crippled friend who apparently builds pizza sky scrapers for a living. In comparison another one of Ben Stiller's movies ""Along came Polly"" symbolizes the same background of ""There's something about Mary"". The theme of finding another loved one in present time and how to make love work when recreating the past. The movie was awesome and the pick for characters could not have been better judged for such an adventurous motion picture."

","There's Something About Mary Film Review The plot of this movie begins with Ted( Ben Stiller) and Mary (Cameron Diaz) are back in High School in Rhode Island. Ted helps Warren( W. Earl Brown) when a bully tries to beat him up and that causes Mary to invite Ted to the prom and after a unfortunate event he doesn't get to go to the prom. So for the rest of his life he pines over Mary. I think that the movie is a standard Ben Stiller comedy that although funny, does not look any different from other Farlley brother movies. The theme of the movie has been played many times before and reminds me of other movies with the same kind of theme. The movie Just Friends with Ryan Reynolds has the same theme of loving someone in High school and waiting until years later to display your love for them to end up with more suitors to compete with later in life. In Just Friends they showed a real relationship to make it more believable. Personally think that the High School scenes should have showed a montage of Ted and Mary to put a real relationship that would cause him to feel like he had lost his chance with Mary. As you watch the movie you can kind of tell Mary is not the kind of person that would have ignored Ted after the prom incident and leaves you wondering why it takes so long for Ted and Mary to talk. I did like how they tied in Dom ( Chris Elliot ) in as Woogie later in the film.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film were too long and unnecessary, one being the opening scene with the guys singing and playing instrument was a part they could take out of the movie. Those two guys were kind of annoying and when they get shot at the end it was kind of a relief. The scene when Ted was preparing for his date was a little too lengthy and could have been shortened with the same outcome.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this movie to friends and family because it is a feel good funny film. I think the film was funny and ends up being one of Ben Stiller's funniest and most memorable movies to date. With a good supporting cast and an excellent storyline.

","There is something about Mary indeed! For a girl to have not one, not two, not even three stalkers, but four people who are so obsessed with her they will do anything to get near her. Although there is always a reason behind why people do things you tend to wonder, how far are they going to go? If you look at Mary (Cameron Diaz) you see all the things a person would dream of. She is beautiful, smart, funny, caring, she's into sports and best of all she is 100% completely single. Now, Ted (Ben Stiller) who was in love with her since high school, realizes thirteen years later that he is still in love with her and needs to find her. He hires the not so great private investigator Healy (Matt Dillon) who, of course, falls in love with the perfect Mary too. But, it doesn't stop there. After delivering a pizza one night to Mary's home, Tucker (Lee Evans), decides to take another approach to get to Mary and that is to pretend he is cripple to win her and her kindness over. It goes on from here with Dom a.k.a. Woogy (Chris Elliot), Mary's psycho ex-boyfriend.<br/><br/>This movie has the typical plot, man is in love, man finds girl, man wins girl, and movie is over. And yes, that sounds boring and much similar to every other film, but it's not. In this one, everyone knows who is going to get the girl in the end, but no one cares. It is more about the humorous things that Ben Stiller does, in the beginning for example the 'zipper accident', or what the psychotic things ex-boyfriend Chris Elliot does with Mary's shoes. The list goes on. <br/><br/>As far as comedy, if you thought directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly's movie Dumb and Dumber was funny, this movie will have you rolling. The movies stress on the fact that there are several men in love with Mary using motifs. Over and over again you see the hilarious acts of desperate men seeking her undivided attention. I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it a thousand times over and still find it amusing."
"moviesleuth2","8","0","1","16 January 2010"," Gleefully rude, politically incorrect, laugh till it hurts comedy. Any questions?
","This movie is hysterical. That's the bottom line. If you want to laugh, and don't mind severe stomach pain as a result, pop this in the DVD player and enjoy. Admittedly, it's pretty lowbrow, but when so many ""comedies"" fail to generate any more than a few chuckles, it's amazing to see a movie that will actually make you laugh (and laugh hard) all the way through.<br/><br/>After their prom night was ended too soon after an unholy disaster, Ted Strohmann (Ben Stiller) and Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) never saw each other again. Now, thirteen years later, Ted is still pining over the woman he loved, and at the advice of a friend, hires a sleazy private investigator to look her up. Once there, he falls for her too. It's a battle of wits, wills, and bodily fluids to determine who gets the girl.<br/><br/>Comedy is difficult to pull off. There is so much that has to be perfect to get an honest laugh: timing, reactions, the appropriate build-up, and of course the delivery. The people making this movie certainly have what it takes. This is the best sort of comedy; it's not the lines that provoke laughs (although there are a few good one-liners), it's what happens and how it happens.<br/><br/>The talent pool in this movie is terrific. Cameron Diaz is dazzling as the object of every guy's affection. Mary might as well be called Mary Sunshine. She's nice to a fault, and one of those people who can change the tone of a room just by being there. Yet Diaz never lets Mary become two-dimensional. She knows what she wants, but just attracts degenerates, creeps and losers. And it's no feat to understand why every guy would go crazy around her; Diaz is also drop-dead gorgeous.<br/><br/>Her co-stars may be losers, but they're funny losers. Ben Stiller is a master of reaction shots, and that serves him well here. Ted is a mixture of guilt and panic, and that sets up some of the film's funniest sequences well. Matt Dillon broke into film playing teenage bad boys, but Dillon proves that he's got considerable comic talent. Lee Evans is pretty funny as Mary's friend who has a secret of his own. W. Earl Brown didn't get any accolades for his spot-on portrayal of Mary's ""retarded"" brother, Warren, but he's outstanding. He's funny without being insulting or a walking plot device. Also of note is Keith David, who is hysterical in the one of the film's beginning scenes.<br/><br/>The Farrelly Brothers are known for their low-brow, crude comedy, and that's what they give us here. This is a raunchy, occasionally dark, comedy that appeals to the lowest level of humor. And it works. There are quite a few hysterical sequences, and the inbetween parts develop a cute, if preposterous, romance. It also takes chances (a minstrel duo narrating the story? Who've thought?). A little on the long side, but it's funny all the way through. Not for kids or the tightly-wound, but it's got the one thing that every comedy needs: it's funny."

Well, I would never hire Matt Dillon to track down my high school crush for one reason. I don't like Matt Dillon. He's like the villain in every movie. He isn't particularly a villain in this movie, but he's not a good guy. According to Mary"" He's weird, he's got a stupid smile, and he farts a lot too"". I could see Matt Dillon doing a lot of those things. I prefer Ben Stiller as Ted Strobmen. Ted is the main character and throughout the film a lot of bad things happen to him. He gets arrested, beaten by a dog, gets his penis stuck in his zipper, and many other things. There's something about Mary that you may not know... it's awesome. I have seen many great comedies, but There's something about Mary is definitely one of them. The Farrelly Brothers know how to make great comedies, and they really succeed with this movie. There's something about Mary is crude, dirty, and at times gross. Like when Mary gets come in her hair. It's crude, dirty, and at times gross, and I like it.<br/><br/>The Plot: A nerd named Ted Strobmen fell in love with a beautiful girl named Mary when he was in high school. His prom night did not go well. Still to this day Ted is in love with Mary and always thinks about her. so his friend Dom convinces him to hire this P.I. named Pat Healy, who tracks her down to Florida and is soon aroused by Mary. So he lies to Ted and moves down to Florida and is now dating her. When Ted finds out, he goes down there and everything goes wrong when he gets down there."

"jbartelone","4","0","4","17 January 2008"," The Something About This Movie? Below Average and Predictable
","I remember when this movie was released that it was considered to be a comedy cult classic. To many it still is. But my observations of the film show that the story lines and character developments leave ""something"" to be desired. The movie traces Ben Stiller's life beginning in high school as he plans to ask the popular girl of his dreams to the prom. Stiller's character is awkward and geeky. While getting ready for the prom, he gets his genitals caught in his zipper, and facing this ultimate embarrassment he is determined to seek her out to make amends for this humiliation.<br/><br/>He hires a sleazy private detective to help find Mary. He is madly obsessed with her, as is the detective along with all of their screwball friends. There are varies sophomoric antics and toilet humor jokes that may be funny if you want a typical teen screwball comedy. However, all of the actors are much too old for this sort of mindless drivel. There are a couple of haha jokes but nothing worthwhile or memorable. Why this film is so popular I do not understand. The moronic humor exists for sheer slapstick value. The 5th graders who bully the poor helpless outcast by putting a ""kick me here"" sign on his butt would be the type of people who would give this movie high reviews. That in a nutshell represents the humor of this film.<br/><br/>Because of the cruel edge to this film, feelings and relationships never develop. Stiller's relationship with Mary is bad margarine instead of quality butter. The writing is so juvenile and demeaning to relationships that by the end, nobody cares. Substance-wise, there is really ""Nothing About Mary"" to signify this movie as a quality film. Only see it if you like slapstick. Otherwise, ""Mary"" is a film to avoid."

","This is a fun film, but really...can't we make a movie without using the ""F"" word so many times? In ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", Dustin Hoffman's character proved that things can be just as funny without curse words. For instance, when he's being fired from his boss, instead of saying the ""F"" word, he looks at his boss and says, ""Shame on you."" Now that's creatively funny! This film, otherwise, was very fun to watch. Having Brett Favre in the film was a bit much, but it was basically worth a movie-watcher's time. Ben Stiller, as usual, was a hit, but Matt Dillon proves to us once again that he can play any role. Good job, Matt. One thing I would have left out was the shot of one of Ben's testicles hanging out. Even though it was not a real shot of one, some people would not know this or appreciate it. That was in poor taste in my opinion."

The pizza guy with a limp it was sort of like a usual suspects kind of twist, only in a funny way. The hair jell part was really funny. I cracked up, I really felt the embarrassment.

","THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY that has every man in the film falling for her (sometimes literally) in a comedy that moves along with gay abandon and no shortage of slapstick silliness. Mary is played with breezy style by CAMERON DIAZ (a throwback perhaps to Carole Lombard's wackiness in this sort of thing), and, of course, BEN STILLER gets to play the lovesick fool who ruins his first prom date with her by getting stung by his zipper.<br/><br/>There are too many sight gags here to enumerate, but the funniest have to do with Mary's dog and the other is the famous scene where hair-gel takes on a new meaning.<br/><br/>MATT DILLON is the sleazy friend who agrees to find the missing Mary after many years have separated Stiller and Diaz, only to find that he's instantly in love with her too. Naturally, he tells Stiller that she's turned into a blimp in a wheelchair--and you can predict that when Stiller finds out the truth there will be hell to pay.<br/><br/>Hilarious moments dominate the breezy comedy from the Farrelly Brothers, full of visual and verbal gags that are non-stop until the last moment.

","One of The Farreley Brothers greatest films that is also known as probably one of the most famous gross out comedies of all time and the blast off of The Farreley Brother's career, this is one of the stupid yet sweet films everyone loves to watch along the lines of ""Me, Myself and Irene"". The story is simple: Ted Stromen (Ben Stiller) is a High School geek who has a crush on the prettiest girl in school Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz) although she has a mentally challenged brother named Warren (W Earl Brown) who sometimes gets Ted into some embarrassing situations. Ted decides to ask Mary to the Prom and on Prom night, a disaster happens that keeps Ted and Mary from dancing all through the night. Flash forward 13 years and Ted is a wreck after the date never happened. So Ted hires a sleazy private Dick Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to spy on Mary, to see how she is doing. But, after getting one glimpse of Mary, he lies to Ted and moves to get closer to Mary. This is one of those tasteless comedies that no one would have thought would work but it did and became an instant cult classic and boosted The Farrelley Brothers up to the status as the kings of comedy gross out movies. Some side characters are Tucker (Lee Evans), a friend of Mary's and Dom (Chris Elliot) an ex boyfriend of Mary's. The cast and directors work very well together and create a movie that is sure to go down in history.<br/><br/>3 out of 4 stars"

","Having been a big fan of Ben Stiller, it may surprise you that I only saw 'There's Something About Mary' only today. I don't know what it is, I think it was the Farrelly Brothers, who I'm not a huge fan of, that prevented me from seeing this sooner. I really liked this tale of somewhat-obsessive love. Ben Stiller basically plays the same character he plays in all of his comedies, eg the hyper-neurotic type (one wonders if that's the kind of guy he is in real life) and Cameron Diaz plays Mary, his love-of-his-live-but-only-if-she-knew-it. Diaz's role is not too complicated, the somewhat ditzy-yet-smart blonde that I've seen her do before. The one character that really caught me off guard was Matt Damon playing Healy. Although I think Matt Dillon is a mighty fine actor, I just don't think broad comedy suits him. As for the movie itself, it's goofy fun. Not going to change the world, it's in the ""offensive-but-don't-take-it-seriously"" mold, and quite breezy and easy to sit through. I laughed quite a bit."

Then when Mary was living in Florida, Ben hires Pat Healy(Matt Dillon) the sleazy detective, not only to find her but to have her for himself. I think switching binoculars wasn't that important when Mary was unhooking her bra. But seeing that overly tanned lady top was a riot. All these characters, all the laughs, this movie got it all.

There is something about Cameron, and she was made for this part.<br/><br/>After a humiliating and basically unforgettable Prom night, when he was sixteen, Greg (Stiller) never fully recovers from the humiliation he suffered thirteen years earlier. He decides, that even though it's been several years, he'd like to look up the girl he essentially blew all of his chances with, so long ago.<br/><br/>He hires a private detective to look into finding her, since Greg lives in Rhode Island, and Mary (Diaz) lives in Miami, FL. After finding her, and following her around, he falls in love with her too, and tells Greg that she is not worth his time and tries to get him to forget about her.<br/><br/>Even though, Greg is discouraged he decides to look into finding her anyway. Along the way to Florida, he runs into some trouble with the law (which I won't give away, but the police scene is probably the funniest in the entire movie. For those who have seen the movie, I'm referring to the part with the two officers, who think he's done something other than what he thinks he's being charged for.), ans finally makes it to Florida.<br/><br/>While he's there, Pat (Dillan), the P.I., learns of Greg's coming, and the two try to get one another out of Mary's life. <br/><br/>With other mishaps, and funny situations that go on in the film, it's one of the most well-written scripts, and funniest films to watch ever.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who likes a good comedy, however there is some pretty graphic dialogue from time to time, so I wouldn't suggest the film to anyone under seventeen. But, it is funny and I've seen it countless times. <br/><br/>And now, an excerpt from the film: <br/><br/>""Greg, this wasn't your first time, was it?"" ""No."" ""How many we talking' here?"" ""My whole life? I dunno. Twenty-five, maybe fifty. I dunno, who keeps track? Look I know that this is like the Bible belt down here, but where I'm from this is not that big a deal."""

When Ted (Ben Stiller) had that little incident on the night of the prom, I got a little uncomfortable. I don't want to say why. Also, when he found Mary in Florida, I felt happy for him. This was because it had been 13 years since the last time they saw each other. There was only one person I couldn't stand, and that was Healy (Matt Dillon).

","I used to think this wasn't all funny, but that was just because I couldn't remember any of it, besides the obvious scenes, and seeing it again, I can now see why people love it so much, from directing brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber). The film starts with a flashback in high school, where awkward Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) is going to senior prom with the beautiful Mary Jensen (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz). They never got to the prom together because Ted had a very unusual accident of catching his nuts caught in his trouser zipper (ouch!), and 13 years later, Ted still can't stop thinking of the girl he lost the chance to be with. He hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to track her down, but soon enough he is infatuated with her as well, and he gives Ted false information to keep him away from his new love interest. Ted soon finds out about Pat's lies, and manages to walk back into Mary's life and try to rekindle a relationship. Little known to Mary, her English friend Tucker (Lee Evans) is in fact a faker as well, his real name is Norman 'Norm' Phipps with a hillbilly accent and no need for crutches, and the same love the other two have. Oh, correction, that should be three, Dom Woganowski (Scary Movie 2's Chris Elliott) reveals his love for soon as well, and also he was the infamous ex-boyfriend ""Woogie"". In the end, Mary finds out all four of them feel something for her, and she must ultimately decide which one she likes most, and this is where (predictably) another ex-boyfriend walks in and reveals his love, it looks like she's gonna get back with him, but there is happy ending and audience satisfaction Mary picks Ted. Also starring Lin Shaye as Magda, Jeffrey Tambor as Sully, Markie Post as Sheila Jensen, Keith David as Charlie Jensen, Scream's W. Earl Brown as Warren Jensen and Dumb and Dumber's Harland Williams as Hitchhiker. The memorable and most hilarious moments for me are Dillon trying to revive the dog from being knocked out, Stiller's dog wrestle, Evans' traditional physical comedy (on crutches and with those accents), and the most well known image, Diaz mistaking Stiller's spunk for hair gel, and having the huge quiff in her hair (yikes!). It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Cameron Diaz was number 65 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 9 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films.

","""There's Something About Mary"" was the movie that broke the Farrelly Brothers, when they went from doing merely stupid gross-out movies (not that there's anything wrong with that) to intelligent, well-written gross-out movies. It was also a huge blockbuster that helped cement the careers of its two leads. It stars Ben Stiller as the everyman who's in love with Cameron Diaz as Mary, the perfect woman.<br/><br/>Mary represents that girl that every guy wishes he was with. The title song sung by Jonathan Richman (playing a part that recalls Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole from ""Cat Ballou"") says that ""there's something about Mary that they don't know"", implying that there's something about this girl that one guy sees but nobody else does; of course we realize by the end that that's not true, that EVERYBODY knows, whether they realize what it is about her that they are so in love with or not. Cameron Diaz plays the part perfectly. She's this perfect fox with a great personality and sunny disposition that it's easy to see any guy falling in love with.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is Ted, who had an opportunity to be with Mary in high school, but screwed it up by getting his genitals stuck in his zipper in her bathroom on prom night. It's a mistake that he curses for the rest of his life, so he hires Pat Healy (played to snake-oil perfection by Matt Dillon; he was really at his best here) to go to Florida where she lives and spy on her. But Healy falls in love with her too. We find that this is an endlessly repeating theme; guys just fall in love with Mary. So Healy cons Mary into thinking he's the perfect man, while telling Ted that she's a cow who's not even worth looking up. But there's more competition waiting in the wings, including an old boyfriend named Brett.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon is at his best here. Ben Stiller is funny too, showing a real talent playing an average guy who keeps having bad luck dumped on him; it's similar to the type of part he would play later in ""Meet the Parents"". When Ted finds out that Healy was lying, he goes down to Florida to seek out Mary. But on the way he's arrested for soliciting gay sex at a rest stop, and subsequently charged with the murder committed by the hitchhiker he picked up (played by Harland Williams from ""Half-Baked""), who carries the body in a large canvas bag into Ted's car, and has dreams of striking it rich by releasing a video called ""7-Minute Abs"", meant to take business away from the ""8-Minute Abs"" people. Bad break piles on top of bad break, and you can't help but feel sorry for the guy, even as you're laughing at the outlandish and terrible things that are happening to him.<br/><br/>This movie is a riot from start to finish. The whole cast is superb, including the smaller supporting roles (including Markie Post and Keith David as Mary's parents, Lin Shaye as Magda (she also played a supremely disgusting woman in ""Kingpin""), Khandi Alexander from ""Newsradio"" and Sarah Silverman from ""Mr. Show"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" as Mary's friends, Chris Elliot as Ted's buddy Dom/Mary's old boyfriend Woogie, Lee Evans as Tucker/Norm, another con artist out to get Mary, and Willie Garson as one of Ted's old high school friends). And the dog is hilarious too; he actually gets two of the most memorable scenes in the movie. In the end, despite all the competition, despite the appearance (orchestrated by Ted himself, because he just wants Mary to be happy) of Brett Favre, and despite the fact that he was basically stalking her, it's Ted who gets Mary. So every man wants the perfect woman, but it's the everyman himself who gets her. It's a great ending to a great movie, almost sappy but funny enough to get away with it, much like the rest of the movie."

","SPOILERS Like so many comedy brothers, the Farrelly brothers have a record of comedy history. With funny films like ""Shallow Hal"" and ""Me, Myself and Irene"" they've proved themselves year after year. Often though their most famous film is ""There's Something About Mary"". Not particularly funny, but with the occasional moment, this film is over publicised and constantly over-hyped.<br/><br/>Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) is a useless school kid with a crush on Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz). After a nightmarish date, things seem lost. Many years later though and with the help of creepy Private Eye Pat Healy (Matt Dillon), Ted is going to once more find her and realise that ultimately 'There's Something About Mary'.<br/><br/>Led by a surprisingly strong performance by Cameron Diaz, this film will always be remembered for one or two key scenes. Constantly spoofed, it remains a figure-stone of American comedy. The sad thing however is that in the modern world it just isn't that funny.<br/><br/>No film, irrelevant of what it is, should be best remembered for it's end credits. Sadly, with a superb remake of ""Build Me Up, Buttercup"", this film is at it's finest once the story has concluded.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that 'There's Something About Mary' doesn't have it's moments. There are signs when it shows potential of hilarity, but it never fully satisfies what it should achieve.<br/><br/>All in all, 'There's Something About Mary' is a disappointing film. It SHOULD be an amazing film, but it never fully clicks into place. Still, there's no denying that there are moments it makes us laugh. For all it's praise though, it's not the jewel that we expect it to be."

The thing is, the jokes were coming one after the other so there was no point in trying to sit still in the seat. I imagine, without the waves of laughter that you experience in the theater, the jokes might fall flat watching this movie at home. This society is so careful to be politically correct, that we all seem to be walking on eggshells. Here comes this goofy, bull in a china shop of a movie trampling on everything in its way to get a laugh. There's something about everybody in this movie, especially Cameron Diaz, that makes it more than just funny."

However, I was most offended and disturbed at the humour towards mentally-challenged people. The part that bothered me most was at the beginning of the movie where two guys at the high school get Warren (Mary's mentally-challenged brother) to go up to an attractive girl who was with her boyfriend and ask ""Have you seen my wiener?"" That prompted the boyfriend to beat up Warren. I remember a joke like this being played on a special needs student when I was in school.

","This would have been a great film if it had tried harder at being grown up, and would have cut all of the sophomoric ""gross out"" scenes. The Farrelly's always amaze me that they can pull off stupid comedy and generally give there movies a heart also, something that is missing from most comedies in the past 30 years. But it is a schizophrenic simpatico. It appears as if they are highly gifted comedic writers that are demon possessed, the latter causing them to delve into ridiculous situations that I did not laugh at even when I was 8. In scenes like the infamous ""hair gel"" bit, they drop the flow of the script to assemble what appears to be a studio contrived ""set piece"", scientifically developed to garner praise from teenage boys. Though this may work, I believe if they applied all their energy to improving the good thing they already have going, their movies would be taken more seriously and they would have a much more lasting (and lucrative) shelf life, not to mention broadening their market. I just don't get the way a lot of people think now days. Could someone please tell me why the Farrelly's thought giving Chris Elliot (a hilarious comedian no one has figured out how to use yet) whiteheads, blisters and itching hives would play as funny? What is wrong with you morons? And yet, the bulk of the film is very good.<br/><br/>I edited a version of this off the TV and removed about 5 minutes of stupidity and it didn't hurt the film at all.

Even though it sometimes seems to go that way (using sperm as hair gel or getting with your penis stuck in your zipper), this movie wasn't too bad after all.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough they added a love story that was quite enjoyable.

","USA 1998 Directors: Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly Cast: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, Chris Elliott, Lin Shaye, Lee Evans, W. Earl Brown<br/><br/>In these awfully politically correct times, its sometimes refreshing to sit through an exercise in bad taste, an area Something About Mary excels in. Fortunately, it is also funny with a sporadic spattering of true 'laugh out loud' moments.<br/><br/>The story is all about Ben (Stiller), consumed with regret about the fact that he well and truly messed up his only chance with high school sweetheart Mary (Diaz) during an ill-fated prom night thirteen years earlier, decides to do something about it - locate Mary through the deviously sly private investigator Patt Healy (Dillion). Unfortunately for Ben, Patt has ulterior motives...<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is his usual self in a role not too dissimilar from any of his other roles. Cameron Diaz is also good, and creates adequate screen chemistry with her many devotees (!). But ultimately, the 'star' (probably a misnomer) of this film is Matt Dillon, a fact largely due to the script as opposed to the acting performance he gives, which is more than sufficient for a film of this type. To be honest however, we aren't given characters we truly care about, but rather fodder to the endless string of gags, which often works against the film.<br/><br/>The laughs come thick and fast, however at times it feels as if the Farrely brothers go somewhat overboard in an attempt to induce fits of laughter with many scenes having a very contrived feel to them. Likely their previous work, the humor is not of the subtle and witty type, and the feather the Farrelly brothers attempt to tickle the audience with is of industrial strength. Though despite the crassness, it is overall quite a sweet film, which will leave most audiences warm and fuzzy as opposed to repelled.<br/><br/>After such tripe as Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber, The Farrelly brothers have delivered a comedy not only lewd and vulgar but also funny. This isn't fine art, but it never aspires to be. Worth watching just as long as you aren't expecting anything remotely intellectual. Not the best comedy out there, but harmless fun nevertheless."

The best moment of the film though was Magda's topless scene. It was such a huge turn-on that I still can't get over it.

","Why is it that bad taste and offensive material is acceptable if there are some morals thrown in? People rarely question this, as it's especially true in movies made by the Farrelly brothers, known for their bad taste in such movies as Dumb and Dumber. If people laugh, they forget that what they're laughing at is offensive. And while there is a little bit of clean humor in There's Something About Mary, it's few and far between as jokes involving at least three bodily functions are shown, mentally retarded people are ridiculed (but not as much as you may think), and fake dogs are injured (but not killed). It's another day in the life of a Farrelly brother.<br/><br/>Ted (Ben Stiller), as a somewhat nerdy high schooler in the 80s, is going to the prom with popular girl Mary (Cameron Diaz), but an unfortunate accident has Ted going to the hospital. Thirteen years later, Ted still hasn't gotten over Mary, so he hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out about her. Pat discovers that there's ""something about Mary"" and falls in love with her. Ted now has to go to Florida to stop Pat, but gets into a lot of zany mishaps along the way.<br/><br/>Mary works, but in moderation. It seems like the only time it goes for the full comedic effect and works is during the truly inspired scenes. The bathroom scene in the beginning is great-that, and the first ""dog/speed"" scene are the only two that had me cracking up for the whole scene. The rest of the movie had a laugh or two, but not really that much. The ""hair gel"" part seemed to over-the-top to be even remotely believable. There's some good characters, like Magda (Lin Shaye) and Dom (Chris Elliot) that have their moments, but none of them even stand out. Diaz does what she does, playing a level-headed, all-around nice person, and Stiller playing his slightly-nebbish person perfectly, but it's either that or some weird over-the-top guy (like Zoolander or Dodgeball).<br/><br/>The romantic parts of the movie worked for what they were meant to do, which was further the humor. I suppose I bought the relationship between Stiller and Diaz, although Dillon's over-the-top character was more realistic in his fascination with Mary. But, since Dillon wasn't in either of the aforementioned scenes, he didn't evoke many laughs. Mary's 2 hour runtime went by pretty quickly, and I suppose when you have a runtime like that, being entertaining is more important than being funny, and that's obviously the case with Mary, although it's not its intention.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language."

The timing is right on, and there's a real plot.

Otherwise, if the protagonist is the weirdo, it's farce, and for some reason comedy works and farce doesn't. There's Something About Mary gets that balance right, but the weirdness doesn't consume the film so that the plot no longer matters. We can still identify with the characters.

After seeking therapy and help from his friend (Chris Elliot), Ted seeks Mary (Cameron Diaz), a girl he once knew in High School, who he ""almost"" took to the prom. Through the help of a sleazy Private Investigator (Matt Dillion), he finds out that Mary now lives in Miami, and tries to see her, but little does he know that he isn't the only one obsessed with her. And pretty soon, we all start to realize, maybe there is something about Mary.<br/><br/>Don't let my complements confuse you. This film has 'Farrelly Brothers' written all over it.

When the film was finished, I was surprised how much I liked it. I don't usually go for comedies, and normally I would not have liked this type of film. But there is something in the characters that is likeable, and if you look beyond all the disgusting humor, you will find a nice little love story.

","Though I wouldn't put ""There's Something About Mary"" on the AFI list of best comedies of all time, it does have some genuinely funny moments.  Basically, the film is uneven and dull in spots, but if often works.  And when it delivers, it delivers with a bang.  I still wish I could find the zipper scene as incredibly funny as everyone else, but being a guy the gag is just too painful to be funny.  The gag is directed very well by the Farrellys, with some funny moments where unexpected strangers barge in on Stiller during the unfortunate accident, but the overall scene had me groaning more than laughing.  It's funny how if you showed a guy getting his hand sawed off with a chainsaw, I probably wouldn't cringe, but I cannot watch a guy getting his genitals stuck in his zipper.  So for all you women reading this, yes it's that painful!  However, the hair gel scene is classic.  Ben Stiller is great in the lead, but Matt Dillon made me laugh the most as his sleazy character, and his performance is really underrated.  There's one scene where Mary giggles with her friends after she says, ""I have a vibrator.""  Matt laughs along, sitting one table away.  Then the girls get silent and looks towards Matt, and he goes completely silent.  His reaction during that moment always cracks me up.  And of course, the scenes with the dog are really funny as well.  Cameron Diaz is perfectly cast as the beautiful, yet sweet and friendly, Mary.  Lee Evans as Mary's architect friend also gives an underrated performance.  If you watch the movie, you'll see why.  Chris Elliott is a hit-or-miss comic actor.  I've seen much more obnoxious comics than him, yet his schtick doesn't always pan out.  I certainly could've done without him in this movie, and the joke about the ""love blisters"" was just plain disgusting.  The Farrellys are great at what they do, but comedy's a subjective process and though I may feel they go overboard with certain gags, other people may have different opinions.

","I chose There's Something About Mary to be the first movie that I am going to review here on IMDb.  To me, it is a near perfect comedy that ranks up there with such all time greats as Some Like It Hot and Airplane.  What really makes this movie work though is the first rate acting by the cast. Cameron Diaz actuall received the New York Film Critics Award for Best Actress and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Just catch the moment at the end when she catchers her good friend and neighbor Magda eating a banana split.  Diaz does a great double take when it dawns on her that Magda has just slept with an old sailor. (Earlier in the movie, Magda tells her that after sex, she always has to have a banana split.)<br/><br/>Magda, played by Lynn Shaye is fantastic.  Magda is supposed to be a dried oversexed leathery skinned 50-something who is way too much in love with her dog, Puffy.  She even tells Mary (Diaz, duh!) that if Puffy likes a prospective suitor, then he's ""a keeper.""  Shay here herself was at least 25 years younger than her character, but she plays her so well that most people were surprised to see that it was the make up and good acting.<br/><br/>
Of course there's Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon leading the charge of Mary's suitors.  Stiller is quite game for all that he goes through in this movie and pulls it off.  Dillon, who for years was one of the most handsome guys in film, turns himself into a seedy looking...and acting private dick (and you can use that word in both its meanings here).<br/><br/>The movies' most famous scene is the hair gel scene.  However, when I saw it for the second time in the theatre in '97, the scene that was even funier was when Puffy went Psycho on Stiller.<br/><br/>Indeed, this is a true comedy classic that is hard to top. So hard, that the Fareelley Brothers subsequent movies have been abysmal outings.  Here, the low brow humor comes naturally out of the situation recalling the old line that it isn't in bad taste if you laugh at it."

Much of this has to do with the story and casting.  Pat Healy is one of the most despicable movie villians, and you can feel for Ted every step of the way.  Also, it was genius to cast Cameron Diaz as the titular character.<br/><br/>But, this movie is hilarious, and not for the scenes it's been associated with.  Harland Williams has one of the funniest scenes in the movie, and Chris Elliot is wonderful, as always.  There are some plot twists near the end that are hard to swallow, but it's the film's irresistible charm that makes this a winner."

","There's something about this movie that makes it pretty fun to watch. Maybe it simply is Mary (Cameron Diaz).<br/><br/>I liked this movie at some points, but at other points, I didn't. It was inconsistent with its humor. Sometimes it was very clever and sometimes it was downright raunchy. I really didn't see the need for all the f-bombs or the pointless and gross ""zipper"" camera angle. I think the Farrely brothers took a PG-13 movie and made it R.<br/><br/>There were strong points to the movie as well. It was well-acted for the most part. Diaz fit into her role well, and made a realistic character out of Mary. Matt Dillon and Ben Stiller were admirable as well, Chris Elliott was a little weak I thought. Then again, he wasn't dealt a good character to work with.<br/><br/>The best humor was the ""misunderstanding"" type, more subtle. Like when the stepdad tells Stiller ""She went to the prom 20 minutes ago with her boyfriend Woogie"" or the whole murder interrogation scene. Very funny. But then, the Farrely brothers come back with some of their stupid humor.<br/><br/>Overall, I think what this movie needed was a better, more down-to-earth director. I'll give it a 6.75 out of 10."

","In the summer of 1998 this was the surprise hit that came out of nowhere. The Farrelly brothers had another hit, the other being ""Dumb and Dumber"", and while this one is funny ""Dumb and Dumber"" is better.  Sure this made more money and stuff, but it isn't funny all the way through as Dumb is. This one focuses on a guy who wants to find the girl he almost had a date with in high school, but do to a very funny accident it wasn't meant to be. He has to compete though with numerous other guys who also really want Mary including the private investigator he hired to find her.  This movie has a lot of funny scenes, but the ending wasn't all that funny to me.  There were other times in this one that weren't that great as well, but it still plays very well.  All the actors are good, especially Stiller and Dillon.  Cameron Diaz, the title character though is rather bland with her funniest moment being what she wipes through her hair.  She is only marginally better in this than is Rene Zellwegger is in ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" as the title gal in that one.

"LivingDog","5","0","1","19 January 2003"," There's Nothing About Mary
","I found this movie to be incredibly boring. In short it has very few funny moments. Here are the three: the zipper scene, the dog-on-fire scene, and the ""speed for the dog"" scene. However, the ""speed"" scene has a great setup (Evans and Dillon set the dog up to meet Stiller), but in it's punchline it goes flat. Don't see this movie if you want to laugh.<br/><br/>There is a scene in Mary's office with Tucker (Lee Evans) on crutches. But I kept feeling that the director was saying: ""look at this, isn't it outrageous?!"" It felt forced. Mary (Diaz) tries to help and there was one more quantifiable laugh. The man (played adeptly by Lee Evans)leaves and outside is a good chuckle, indicating his slapstick skill.<br/><br/>This humor is not offensive. It is you who are pseudo-sensitive if you think it is. E.g. the character ""Carla"" in ""Cheers"" was the most insulting image of an Italian-American woman I have ever see. However, she did not represent all Italians, all Italian women, or women in general. She was one character and her antics were about her character. No Italian-Americans were upset about ""Carla"" - we all had a great laugh. In this same sense, the humor about the crutches is not at all about people with handicaps - it is about ""Tucker"" and that's all it is. So get over yourselves, get a life, and learn to ""Eat, drink, and be merry."" (Luke 12:19)<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is a charm to watch, but that's it. I wanted to laugh and all I did was wound up waiting to think of something better to do.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon is excellent at being a ""mook."" (I guess that means big dork.)<br/><br/>Lee Evans puts in a solid and utterly convincing performance.<br/><br/>However, the story is simply not funny and not romantic. I feel nothing between Ted (Stiller) and Mary (Diaz). Towards the end I kept thinking, ""Come on, END! (so I could go do something fun.)""<br/><br/>In short, there's NOTHING about ""There's Something about Mary."" 5/10<br/><br/><ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul><br/><br/>PS: This movie could be renamed: ""There's Something About Cameron.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Z</li></ul>"

","I don't understand all the hype about this film. Okay, so it's irreverant. That doesn't always mean funny.<br/><br/> The film starts out in the mid-eighties, when geeky high-schooler Ted Stroehmann (played by Ben Stiller) finds the girl of his dreams -- Mary (Cameron Diaz). After being nice to Mary's mentally deformed brother, Ted is asked by Mary to go to the prom with her. But due to some ""unfortunate incidents,"" Ted is unable to take her, and we warp to 1997/8.<br/><br/>
 Ted keeps thinking about Mary, so his friend (Chris Elliot) gets a Private Investigator (Matt Dillon) to track down Mary.<br/><br/> Pretty soon, everyone is heading head-over-heels regarding Mary, and a predictable ending sums up the film.<br/><br/> Okay, here's the review: the film started out great. I enjoyed all the jokes in the beginning, and was not bothered by the politically incorrect jokes that most people who hated this film were offended by.<br/><br/> But, once we warp to '97, the jokes start to fall flat -- and plain disgusting -- and I wondered why audiences and critics around the globe loved this film. Another big turn-off for me was the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene. We didn't need visuals, Farrelly brothers.<br/><br/> I did chuckle throughout the film, but I expected ""Mary"" to be the best comedy of the year. What a let-down.<br/><br/> I was the rare person who enjoyed ""Dumb and Dumber."" It rides along the line of crude and normal, and never passes the line. ""Mary,"" however, crosses the line shamelessly, and never gets back on track. It just keeps slipping farther and farther into immature, eighth grade, gross-out humor. The fact the Peter and Bobby Farrelly have to subject audiences to such disgusting visuals and gags is disappointing, and I think they should be ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/> I like Ben Stiller, but this film was just too raunchy and unfunny to enjoy his performance. I could tell he tried to make it funny, but it just failed. I saw on AMC that he didn't want to do the ""cleaning the tubes"" scene because he was afraid it would ruin his career. I don't blame him.<br/><br/>""Mary"" overall has some laughs, but not enough, and despite being crude or not, it still is not an outrageously funny film, and not the best of 1998.<br/><br/>

"Jimmy-Dee","Null","0","1","14 January 2002"," Too many flaws for it to be a 'good' movie
","Ok yes, this movie was extremely funny.  Although it was formulaic for most parts, and sometims it was just gross out comedy, it was a far better showing than all previous Farrelly outings (especially Dumb and Dumber).<br/><br/>However and here are *SPOILERS* (so dont read on if you want to see this movie) there were parts of this movie which, due to the overwhelming need to continually suspend disbelief (as well as parts that just showed the straight out ignorance and idiocy of people)that made it unenjoyable to the more discerning viewer.<br/><br/>1.  The singer/drummer combination.  The singer, although Im sure it was his voice, did such a bad job with his lip synching that watching him sing became an extremely tiresome and painful experience.  And also, yes I realise its the intention to show the 'drummer' (if thats what you can call him), as a bland sidekick but remove both of them completely and just have the music, and the film wouldve been better<br/><br/>2.  The entire notion that if a guy is willing to raise a bet from $20 to $100 on something he says is going to happen with him and another girl, and it will be easily proven or disproven, then generally its because he's sure its going to happen.  I mean, who would honestly bet $100 that he IS going to the prom with someone if in fact he wasnt.  Now as it turned out he didnt end up going.........but save for a freak accident he wouldve.  And Im quite sure his friends at the time were betting against him simlpy because they thought he was full of sh**.....not because they couldve envisaged what actually happened to Ted happening.<br/><br/>3. The instances where things are happening to Ted and its obvious its not his fault......but the ignorance and stupidity of the people around him just accentuate the problems happening.<br/><br/>* When Warren jumps on Ted's back.  Not only is it obvious Warren is far to fat and heavy for ANYONE to carry, Mary says 'Giddy up Warren....fun huh?' when its obvious Ted's back is about to snap from underneath him.<br/><br/>*When Ted gets blamed for Warren's psycho fit after the incident with the baseball.  The 'father' is telling Ted to 'Get down from there!' when its Warren that has Ted locked up in a wrestling move above his head<br/><br/>*When Ted is being told to 'TAKE IT EASY' by the cop, when in fact (and this is obvious) the other cop is bashing Ted's head into the table.<br/><br/>3.  The old situations where one party thinks theyre talking about one thing, but the other party think theyre talking about another results in the miscommunication occurring such as that between Ted and the cops during their discussion about the hitchhiker.....has been done to death and isnt funny anymore<br/><br/>4.  The whole notion that someone could not only ejaculate on their ear and make it hang there (especially when Ted is leaning forward the entire time) but be completely unaware its there when he goes to greet Mary at the door.<br/><br/>5.  The whole Tucker/Norm switcheroo just wasnt believable.  I mean why wouldnt Norm remain as 'Tucker' all the time?  And plus Norm obviously is not a smart enough guy to be able to pull off being an architect for such a long time.<br/><br/>6.  The guy who played Woogy.  He's probably the worst actor in existence today.  I personally HATE IT in movies when a character cycles through the different slang terms for masturbating in an attempt to generate humour. The gratuitous nature of it in this film (and also in American Beauty) is so blatant that you get very frustrated with it.  Also, Woogy's last scene with Mary isnt funny one bit.  Woogy didnt need to have the hives on his head, and he couldve been a much more convincing stalker if he lost that stupid child accent he adopted (most blatant in the line 'I was worried about you')<br/><br/>7.  Other little bits.  The gratuitous swearing in the scene where Ted walks into Pat Healy's house and punches him in the jaw.  And pretty much any scene with that dog.  The worst being it's fight with Ted.<br/><br/>So maybe Ive gone into too much here but I for one like a little bit more realism to my movies and for me this outing was just another Farrelly film to put on the top shelf."
