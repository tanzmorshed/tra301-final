"joshhylto","8","30","39","17 April 2019"," I'm confused with all the hate of the film.
","I've never written a review before but after seen how many people are saying this film I thought I better.
I actually think the film was great the main premise of the film which I feel most people have completely missed is a bond between two guys that is as strong as a brotherhood hood. The alpha one who has the confidence to take over the world and the quiter one both who would die for each other in an instance. And maybe it was just me but I really did feel the emotions that they feel throughout the film. It seems like a lot of people hate the film so maybe I'm missing something but i think its a great film. The film is not totally accurate but films don't need to be and I film is long which is the reason I suspect it gets so much hate."

 Roll up, roll up! See the cinematic spectacle of 2001! See the horrible 
 deaths of 2500 or so people commemorated by a film about two guys who 
 fly fast planes really fast. See them go ZOOOOOOOOM, see them go 
 WHIIIIZZZZ! See them reprise the 'flypast and debriefing' scenes from 
 Top Gun. Watch the beautiful love story unfold. See the true love two 
 people have for one another tested and broken when Kate Beckinsale 
 comes between them.
 
 See a fine young actor reduced to playing Token Black Guy. Watch as he 
 fights to prove he's more than a Token Black Guy, even though he's 
 given so little to do that he ends up as nothing more than a Token 
 Black Guy (even though, unlike the two guys in the planes, Token Black 
 Guy actually existed).
 
 Watch the awful bombing of a military target. Watch the heroic bombing 
 of a city. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable 
 character Dr. Strangelove.
 
 Watch the whole reality of war, and the lives and deaths therein 
 trivialised to make a Big Dumb Action Movie that thinks it's some kind 
 of ghastly tribute to the American dead of December the 7th.
 
 Or better still... don't!
 
 On the other hand, if you want an unrealistic film with ponderously 
 paced romance, fighter planes zooming all over the place and nice 
 explosions, check this out. It's a lot of fun. Just don't take it 
 seriously - you'll only encourage them!"

","In 1941 it cost the Empire of Japan 147 thousand dollars to stage the three hour attack on Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>In 2001 Michael Bay spent $132 MILLION dollars to film the event, and ran four minutes longer. <br/><br/>Even taking into account 60 years of inflation, the Japanese did a better job with a smaller budget...<br/><br/>Due to the ten line minimum submission this may be too short - but sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>20th Century Fox already did the Pearl Harbor attack in Tora Tora Tora - and did an excellent job. Michael Bay should have left well enough alone."
"muertos","1","250","401","29 January 2005"," An utter waste of money, talent and history.
","Pearl Harbor is a movie so spectacularly awful that it would be funny if it wasn't so infuriating. There hasn't been a big-budget re-enactment of the Pearl Harbor attack since Tora! Tora! Tora! in 1970, and, due to the utter failure of this movie on every level, it's unlikely it will be attempted again for a long, long time.<br/><br/>The writing is ludicrous. It's a series of situations and set pieces strung together without a single regard given to character development or even plausibility. The acting is beneath contempt. Ben Affleck should never have been let anywhere near this film, and in the ""love"" scenes between himself and Kate Beckinsdale, it appears patently obvious that the actors completely detest each other. The attack scene is filmed and edited like a Saturday morning cartoon. And...excuse me...in real life Pearl Harbor was a DEFEAT. There was none of the stupid garbage with slick fighter jocks dogfighting Japanese Zeros. This film makes it look like a victory! And, excuse me...FDR could not stand up by himself. The scene in the cabinet room where he rises from his chair was simply laughable.<br/><br/>This film is beyond bad. It is insulting. It's a 6-year-old's coloring book passed off as history. Aside from that, it's probably the limpest, shoddiest big-budget ""epic"" produced in the last 10 years. The day it opened in theaters was truly a day of infamy."
"kiwihazelnut","3","290","471","9 September 2004"," Historically Inaccurate
","Ignoring the claims that this movie was so wonderful because Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are ""so-o-o-o-o hot,"" and that the ""music was so-o-o-o good,"" I want to talk about all the historical inaccuracies about this movie. People get the impression that by watching the movie, they will understand not one, but two historical WWII events: Pearl Harbor and Doolittle's Raid. <br/><br/>However, this is just not so. While extra care was given for the attack scene (I think WWII veterans would have crucified the producers if this had not been so), the other smaller details give the watcher a false sense of history. For one thing, no Red Cross Army nurses died (as they portray Betty dying). Also, no US soldier would go to Britain to join the Royal Air Force. The US Army Air Force had a unit (the Flying Tigers) in Britain helping out the RAF, but no US soldier would actually leave his unit to join another country's military (regardless of allies). It would mean a total US military discharge AND rejecting US citizenship. Ben Affleck's character could not have done that, especially when he was not a British citizen. <br/><br/>Also, Ben and Josh Hartnett's characters were fighter pilots. NOT Bomber pilots. The two are very separate things. Ben and Josh could never switch from being fighter pilots to bombers for Doolittle's Raid. The Army Air Force had pilots for all kinds of missions, and fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots, and bombers stayed bombers. Continuing with Doolittle's raid, it did NOT turn the tide for the Americans. It was not a military victory, and little in Tokyo was affected. It only served as propaganda to help the US citizens on the homefront (also, Doolittle's Raid was long after Pearl Harbor and not a revenge mission). Watch this movie if you're into sappy love stories, but NOT if you want to learn about Pearl Harbor (and/or the Doolittle Raid). Few historical facts can be gleaned from this movie."
"andyf52","1","189","302","7 June 2004"," Abominable, abysmal, atrocious, ... and that's just the 'A's
","Spoilers<br/><br/>To borrow and paraphrase from that great orator and writer, Winston Churchill, 'Never in the annals of human endeavor have so many witnessed the butchering of history by so few.'<br/><br/>I remember a story on a national morning TV news program that was a major promotion for the debut of this huge waste of celluloid. This interview/promotion took place aboard the aircraft carrier that's on permanent display in New York harbor. The major male stars, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, along with Producer Jerry Bruckheimer were interviewed by one of the hosts of this TV morning news show. In this interview, all three claimed that they enjoyed talking to veterans and listening to their stories. Well, I don't think they were paying much attention to those vets.<br/><br/>Or at least they decided to ignore reality when it interfered with their script!<br/><br/>Some historical facts that got in the way of Bruckheimer's blockbuster: It doesn't matter how simple WWII aircraft are compared to today's jets. Ask any pilot and he/she can tell you that you just don't go from flying American P-40 fighters one day, go to England and jump into the cockpit of a British Spitfire fighter and start shooting down HIGHLY EXPERIENCED, COMBAT VETERAN German PILOTS the next! (I don't care that even a blind pig can find the occasional acorn!) Each aircraft's handling qualities, e.g., speed, max altitude, rate of climb, rate of dive, turning, etc., are different. In other words, a pilot has to be TRAINED on that aircraft! To ask us to believe that Affleck's character, who hadn't seen REAL aerial combat prior to England, can shoot down experienced German fighter pilots the VERY FIRST TIME HE STRAPS ON A 'SPIT' is not only LAUGHABLE, it's insulting to the REAL pilots who fought and died in the 'Battle of Britain.'<br/><br/>The famous 'Doolittle Raid' took place on April 18, 1942 - a scant 4-1/2 months after the Pearl Harbor attack. Yet, we're supposed to believe that not only can Affleck's character IMMEDIATELY master unfamiliar aircraft (forgetting that a B-25 is a MULTI-ENGINE BOMBER no less for the moment!), apparently so can Josh Hartnett's character. It took EXPERIENCED B-25 bomber crews about that long to train for this extremely hazardous raid on Japan (January 1942 to April 18, 1942). No way in the world could P-40 fighter pilots be chosen to fly B-25 bombers in the 'Doolittle Raid!'<br/><br/>What I don't understand is that since Bruckheimer was obviously not interested in historical accuracy, in addition to Affleck's character's superhuman abilities of shooting down EXPERIENCED Germans pilots over England and BATTLE TESTED Japanese pilots over Pearl Harbor, rescuing sailors trapped in half-sunk ships, giving blood, and eventually taking the war to the Japanese in the 'Doolittle Raid,' why didn't Bruckheimer just have Affleck's character pump-out and raise the Arizona and single-handedly save her crew from their watery grave. Thank goodness there are some things even Bruckheimer can't swallow!<br/><br/>The special effects and battle scenes were great! Yeah, I know. Bruckheimer wasn't shooting a documentary. BUT, if you want an entertaining, more historically accurate dramatic portrayal of the events of, and leading up to, December 7th, 1941, stick with Tora! Tora! Tora! That movie is based upon the work of a historian considered by many to be the top of his field, Gordon Prange. Although Dr. Prange wrote many books on this topic, I believe his book, ""At Dawn We Slept"" was the basis of Tora! Tora! Tora! As a MEDAL OF HONOR winner, General Doolittle, and the heroic pilots he led on that raid deserved better than the way they were portrayed in Bruckheimer's schlock film. Despite the romance scenes, and when it was filmed, ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" is a much more accurate depiction of the famous ""Doolittle Raid."" At least it's more believable! <br/><br/>Affleck, Hartnett, and Bruckheimer may have listened to WWII veterans, but they did not hear. They did not learn. Nor did they appreciate the immeasurable costs paid by those members of this country's 'greatest generation.'<br/><br/>The only things I recognized as historically accurate about this film were: 1) the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor by Japan on December 7th, 1941; 2) the US Army did fly P-40s; 3) British pilots did do combat with Germans in the skies over England during the 'Battle of Britain;' 4) some British pilots did crash into the Channel; 5) Cuba Gooding's character, a black mess cook, DID shoot down Japanese planes even though he received no gunnery training; and 6) Doolittle did lead a force of 16 US Army B-25 bombers from the carrier USS Hornet against Japan. I can't speak to any accuracies about the nurses, or their quick thinking, e.g., writing with lipstick on the foreheads of the wounded.<br/><br/>The only way I'd own a copy of this film is if someone accidentally gave it to me as a gift."

","Oh dear, what a waste of time and money and more importantly, three hours of my life. Titanic with bombs, only take away James Cameron and any sign of talent, story, pacing and throw in historical inaccurancies, clichés and a story that will make you want to throw up from all the cheesy moments.<br/><br/>The film is really divided into three parts. The first part, the love story, the two best friends and of course the girl. Then one hour later, develop a love triangle, wow, Hollywood has never seen anything like that before! (sarcasm intended) Also add several less important characters and bit parts that you hope will die in the bombing sequence that you know is coming, unfortunately, only one of them does.<br/><br/>Finally, the second hour, the bombing sequence begins. It's good to begin with, its good fun, the only part of the movie thats bearable. The special effects are great along with good fight sequences. Unfortunately, they even managed to spoil that with a ridiculous scene in which the two main characters fly around and save Pearl Harbor by shooting down two pilots.<br/><br/>Now you think that with the bombing sequence over, the end of the film is near, you're just about to get your coat and run out of the movies, when all of a sudden, you're subjected to one of the most pointless hours I have ever seen in a movie, in which the survivors, and only the survivors for some reason, fly over to Japan to get revenge. Oh dear. At this point, the movie has completely lost the plot, the acting is horrendous, the editing and direction terrible, and I have lost interest in all the characters. The story has been completely suffocated with the ridiculous sub-plots.<br/><br/>Avoid this film at all costs. Three hours of pointless clichés, cheesy scenes, unlikeable characters, historical inaccuracies and the worst direction I have ever seen. This film could have been so more, or less."

","Pearl Harbor is without a doubt the worst world war 2 film of the past decade!

The love story is out of place and pathetic.<br/><br/>At the end of the film is a 5 minute rant about why America is supposedly great; it actually says ""after pearl harbour all America knew was victory"", obviously the writers had never heard of Vietnam.<br/><br/>The only good aspect was the special effects, but they could never make up for this absolutely dire film.<br/><br/>My only regret (apart from wasting 2 and a half hours of my life watching the film) is that I can't award zero out of 10!"
"David-240","3","366","634","10 July 2001"," Someone get me a pair of scissors!
","What a great film this could have been!  The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the sinking of the ""Titanic"" as one of the most harrowing ""disaster"" sequences filmed in recent years.  But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.<br/><br/>Okay - I could almost accept the hokey old love triangle romantic plot - certainly the stars are great to look at - but the dialogue really sucked: ""I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you"". Please!  And all those hero shots from the ground, and the slow motion love bits, and the soppy music, and the eternal sunsets...<br/><br/>But what this film really needed was an editor!  The climax of the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor - an American defeat.  But it seems the film-makers decided that the American audience wouldn't be satisfied with this - and so the movie grinds on and on for another hour or so dramatising a revenge attack on Japan.  And we're supposed to believe that this attack was fought by the very same guys who were on the ground in Hawaii.  I mean we all know that America won the war in the end, so did we really need this long epilogue?<br/><br/>Personally I'd cut out all the Roosevelt and the Japanese high command scenes and concentrate on the experiences of the people on the ground at Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese stuff was all completely unbelievable anyway. The sad loss would be the superb performance of Jon Voight as Roosevelt - but maybe they could make another film about him.  I'd also end the film after the attack at Pearl Harbor, as the survivors pick up the pieces.  So why not have a shorter Director's Cut - a novel concept - that makes this film the great film it could have been.  If you like I'll lend the scissors!"
"Tweetie_Sweet_Pea","1","108","179","2 September 2001"," An insult to the event
","When previews for this movie began to appear in theatres, I was excited. I mean REALLY excited. Finally, here was a movie that would show what the attack on Pearl Harbor was like, portray the event as it really happened, pay homage to all the men, American and Japanese alike, who died there.<br/><br/>
Then I started reading the reviews. ""Overdone"" was a word I came across a lot. And there were the comments from the other girls at school: ""Oh it's soooooooooooooooooooo sad! It's just the most beautiful love story and oh my GAWD does Josh Harnett ever look hot!"" At this point I started to worry. I even vowed that I would not see the movie. Oh Lord, how I wish I'd stuck to that vow.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie should not have been called ""Pearl Harbor."" It has next to nothing to DO with the battle of Pearl Harbor. Would anyone like to know how much time that battle takes up in this three hour monster? About twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Secondly, it shouldn't have been marketed the way it was. The trailers for this movie made it appear that it would be about the battle and the people who fought in it. Nope! God forbid there be anything useful and historically accurate like that. No, what we have here folks is a soap opera. It's kind of like ""From Here to Eternity"" (great movie) only horrible. Here is our basic plot: Best friends in the air force. One goes off to Europe to fly with the RAF and is supposedly killed, only the audience knows he's not really dead because he got top billing. ""Dead"" guys buddy has affair with ""dead"" guy's girlfriend. She gets pregnant. ""Dead"" guy shows up to announce that he's not really dead. They fight. Oh, and then the Japanese pull a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, but who cares?! Obviously not the writers, director, producer, or anyone who could have stopped this blasted thing from being released.<br/><br/>There's so much more I could say, but I do have a word limit here. The one good thing, in my opinion, is the way the Japanese are portrayed here. Not demonized as one thinks they'd be, but shown for what they were: human beings.<br/><br/>In closing, I want to say that I have done my homework on Pearl Harbor. I've read the books, I've seen TV specials, and I've interviewed a survivor from the Oklahoma. I can say with all honesty that this movie is a complete insult to the event and all the men who died there, and if this is all that the American public cares to know about something that was so important to our history, we are in deep trouble."
"Danielramos16","3","167","292","28 April 2008"," Epic Failure!!!
","OK the action sequences are fantastic, the music is wonderful & gripping, the Pearl Harbor attack was intense, it was at many points very emotional and made you a bit teary eyed because you feel for all the brave men & women who died on that faithful day in December 1941. Now lets get down to why this is movie failed miserably: <br/><br/>1.) First off the movie is way too damn long, I mean Jesus I would have to spend have a day to watch it so the makers failed to edit many scenes that didn't need to be in the film.<br/><br/>2.) Historical inaccuracies are everywhere. Little and small. I read a list of all the inaccuracies in this movie, I couldn't possibly write all of them down in this review that's how bad this film is. If you'd like to know what these inaccuracies are checkout Wikipedia and search Pearl Harbor (film). Trust me the list of historical inaccuracies are long.<br/><br/>3.) Waste of talent: Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film.<br/><br/>4.) This is what really upset me. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, I thought it would be about the events leading up to that faithful day. in fact it's about a cheesy love triangle, A LOVE TRIANGLE! this entire movie is centered around three stupid & shallow characters surronded by characters just as annoying as they are. The Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come till the middle of the movie. there isn't much attention given to the events that lead to the attack, just these cliché characters. Pearl Harbor just seemed to get in the way. Goddam this is like a cheesy Soap Opera or a World War II version of Titanic. I mean how much more Cliché can we get?<br/><br/>5.) The Pearl Harbor Attack was a n intense action packed sequence, but even that was incredibly flawed. First off Why is there a Pee-wee baseball game being played so early in the mourning? second when Hartnett & Affleck get up in the air it seems like they shoot down about 20 planes, in reality the Japanese air losses where bare minimum. third there is too much emphasis on CGI effects. fourth this really made me laugh when a group of about 5 men went up into a tower and shot down an enemy fighter with rifles and automatic rifles ..... right... Damn they must have had good accuracy.<br/><br/>6.) Kenneth M. Taylor is a legendary hero of Pearl Harbor. He was one of two pilots who got into fighter planes and began engaging & shooting down Japanese planes. The other pilot was his friend George Welch, Basically Affleck & Hartnett were depicting them. Taylor called this film ""A Piece of trash, over-sensationalized & distorted"". This was a man who was there and did these heroic feats so you can't discard his opinion. This is proof that this film is a disgrace to our veterans.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a huge disappointment & let down. If you are gonna do a movie based about Pearl Harbor then do it right! seriously! thousand of good men died that day so tragically in one of the most defining moments of American History and you wanna make a movie centered around fake characters and a cheesy love story. Michael Bay whether you realize this or not I think you disgraced a lot of WWII veterans. This film had so much potential and ultimately failed to deliver something spectacular that could have had a major impact in film. My recommendation, watch Tora!Tora!Tora! a far more faithful retelling of the Pearl Harbor attack. Pearl Harbor had a budget, but at least Tora!Tora!Tora! has heart."
"jmzkeenan","1","188","335","29 July 2008"," Sappy love story, inaccurate history -- In short, *avoid*
","I heard about this film while it was in production. I heard about how they were going to go out of their way to get all the right aircraft to film so things would look right. I heard how they wanted everything to look as authentic as possible. I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid (??? - an early warning sign). I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor, for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970, allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous big-budget movie about Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora.<br/><br/>So I thought ""Given all this, how bad can it be?"".<br/><br/>The answer, unfortunately, is AWFUL. This may not be Hollywood at its worst, but it's pretty close.<br/><br/>I don't know the origin of the phrase ""Titanic with bombs"" for describing this film, but it's pretty apt. One difference is that Bay and Bruckheimer together don't add up to James Cameron. Both films feature trite, sappy, predictable love stories (with every chestnut in the Hollywood Cliché guide clearly in evidence) layered over a real-life, tragic event. However, although I don't particularly like Titanic, I have some respect for Cameron's success in reproducing the appearance of the RMS Titanic and the events of the Titanic sinking on screen. I am prepared to watch Titanic (while fast-forwarding over the love story bits) just to see the history parts.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor fails this test. The portion of the film featuring the attack on Pearl Harbor comes off like a video game -- Lots of sound and fury, but no realism whatsoever. The problem here is that this is not only a real event, but an event of pivotal importance in the history of the United States. Worse yet, the event is still within living memory. How will we feel in 2061, when a director decides to make a movie about September 11, 2001, and casually re-arranges the events of that day to make the resulting film ""more entertaining/more commercial/more appealing to mass audiences""? Do you feel sick even contemplating that possibility? That's how I suspect that veterans of the actual attack on Pearl Harbor feel about this movie. The late Brigadier General Kenneth Taylor, one of the pilots who did in real life what Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray on screen described the film as ""a piece of trash...over-sensationalized and distorted.""<br/><br/>Watch Tora Tora Tora instead. It's not perfect, but it's a pretty accurate telling of what really happened at Pearl Harbor. (Tellingly, Tora, Tora, Tora used veterans like General Taylor as advisers to make sure that they got most of the details right). A newer film with improved special effects is not necessarily a better film."
"Screen_Blitz","7","19","28","8 December 2015"," Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining, yet deeply flawed
","For the past two decades now, Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions, and with this heavy special effects, garners wide success at the box office. Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.<br/><br/>The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America, and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day, this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay, audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40-minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning, as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath, audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale, including a line ""I love you so much it hurts"", a line that is highly laughable and far too corny, especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible, but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story, the film ends up running 183 minutes. <br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). Overall, this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws, it still works and is entertaining to watch."

","I seriously do not understand the utter hate toward this film by critics when writing their reviews. ""Historically inaccurate"" or ""Just another love story"" or ""boring!""... If you want to see a film that is totally historically accurate, watch a documentary for heavens sake. This movie goes way out of proportion to what really happened that day in Pearl Harbor, but it is a MOVIE! Get over it. It's not supposed to be real. <br/><br/>The film as a whole is brilliantly written; it's not too soppy with the romance and not too over the top with pure action. People are saying that it's just too much shoot 'em up and too many explosions. Well, I got news for you... They're at war! Bombs will go off and guns will be fired from all places possible. If you want to see a movie that's not so explosive, watch Twilight. <br/><br/>To me personally, character development is very important in a movie and I believe Pearl Harbor succeeded with this. I grew attached to individuals and felt vulnerable as a member of the audience at the best of times. Absolutely superb watch, and I'd highly recommend it! If you're offended by a film not being entirely accurate, steer clear and stick to your documentaries. <br/><br/>9/10! Excellent!"

","John Hartnett and Ben Affleck star as dashing (as opposed to merely ""runny"") pilots in love with the same woman, a for the time surprisingly anorexic model type played by Kate Beckinsale. This love triangle gets so convoluted and unbelievable throughout the film that one almost expects Hartnett and Affleck to end up together, or possibly even a sexy soft-core three-way (Beckinsale: ""Oh... I just can't decide between the two of you, so I'll have you BOTH!"").<br/><br/>Equally hilarious is the complete lack of historical accuracy, from the Germans bombing DOWNTOWN London (and where would this be, pray tell?), to the fact that Hawaii is populated by nothing but rich Caucasians, dressing their kids as angels and chasing them down hills in slow motion. Also of course absolutely nobody smokes, despite the fact that this is the frickin' '40s. Not to mention the physically impossible flying scenes during Bays action scenes, apparently an intended homage to Star Wars - or so they would be if Bay's direction didn't immediately disintegrate into a rampageous helter-skelter mess of atrocious takes, clumsy acting, irritatingly gut-wrenching hand-held camera wiggling, and music-video editing.<br/><br/>The movie's politically correct portrayal of the Japanese should also not be missed, planning their attack with toy boats in a little pool while lamenting the unfortunate fact that they have to attack the United States. ""A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war"", Yamamoto says, ""but they have given us no choice. Due to some economical reason or other, possibly to do with trade routes or something, we must attack the U.S., even though we really don't want to.

","Contains Spoiler!! A matter of weeks before he is due to leave for England having volunteered to fight with the RAF, Capt Rafe McCawley meets and falls for Evelyn Johnson.  He leaves very much in love with her but, when he is supposedly killed in action, his best friend (Danny) has to tell Evelyn that he is dead.  As they turn to one another for support and healing they gradually fall in love.  When Rafe is found alive he returns to America and finds his best friend in love with his girlfriend.  This complex love triangle is made even more complex when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbour and draw America into World War II.<br/><br/>You can see why they made this film - a major emotional centrepiece, around which a Hollywood love story between beautiful people occurs; sounds like another Titanic right? I do not understand why that film became so very popular and showered with awards, but I do understand why Pearl Harbour did so badly critically (but it sadly still did make several hundred million dollars - something the gloaters tend to forget!).  The good thing about the film is the action - it seems to be the only thing that Michael Bay can really do well. You can see where the money was spent and it is pretty exciting.  The only reservation I had about it was that Bay cannot help but deliver the action like Bad Boys rather than Saving Private Ryan - in other words the sheer horror of the attack is lost in a sea of glossy special effects, slick camera movements and big bangs, it looks great but it is difficult to really be shocked or moved in the way that the events really should have.  Sure, the shots of bodies and the hospitals sort of bring it home but you can't help but feel the majority of the action is rather soulless.  Of course, very like Bay, he doesn't know when to end and after the attack he follows the action to America's retaliation - where Rafe `shows 'em what for' - here the action is silly and just far too simplistic for the subject involved.<br/><br/>I think it was the other `qualities' the film has that made it such a hated film.  The romance that is supposed to engage us with the three main characters is horribly banal and only serves to make the film's first half feel significantly longer than it really is.  The romance fails for two big reasons.  First of all, there are zero characters; they are plodding cardboard creations with all-American qualities and strong jaw lines. They were never real people to me and I swear this film could have ended with each of them being torn to bloody shreds by Japanese bulldogs and I would have struggled to care less - even the almost constant use of Hans Zimmers' score can't make this emotionally involving.  Secondly the script is a woefully inept piece of rubbish that makes the Telebubbies feel like the pinnacle of modern writing.  At best the lines just seem clunky and unnatural; at worst they are heavy with cliché and just smack of lazy writing - when I'd heard Afflect shout `get me in a plane NOW' for the third time or Hartnett announce `world war 2 has started' (oh - so it didn't in 1939?) I was already starting to feel my ears bleed.  Basically if it is not all clichéd tough talk then it is corny romance dialogue - neither work and only serve to further destroy the foundations of an already weak film.<br/><br/>The acting fits perfectly with the standard of characterisation and dialogue and is roundly average despite having a pretty impressive list of names in the cast.  Affleck is not a leading man and nothing he has done since Good Will Hunting has convinced me that he can carry a film: like it or not, DiCaprio was part of Titanic's success - Affleck is part of Pearl Harbour's failing.  He is nothing more than a rugged face, square jawed hero type American boy - the only silver lining to the film is that at least a good script wasn't wasted on his flat and uninvolving delivery.  Hartnett is no better but least is pretty to look at; it's just a shame that that is all he is.  Beckinsale is a nonentity who is given nothing to do and therefore does almost nothing.  Why (or how) these two men fell for her was never made clear.  Gooding Jr is so poorly used that I wondered why the film even bothered to keep him in it. He is poorly fitting to the period (talking in modern ethnic clichés - a further sign of lazy writing) and he exists to give us a vague focus on the ships and also be the first black soldier to get a medal (`but not the last' the film reassuringly confirms).  As poorly used as they are, at least it is interesting to see faces like Jennifer Garner, Dan Aykroyd, Adam Baldwin, Sizemore, Voight, Tagawa, Everett, Diehl, Coates and Fichtner.  The only shame is that most of them have little to do and that some of them just seem really out of place (Aykroyd and Tagawa in particular).<br/><br/>Overall, compared to the mix of spiteful or unfairly adoring reviews that are around, this might seem a balanced one but understand that I really do consider this a waste of film and time.  Bay does the action with style but sadly missing the soul that the situation required.  The romance is awful and is a major problem since this was supposed to be our foundation and the script shows a complete inability to develop characters or put anything other than clichéd dialogue into their mouths."

","I wasn't too concerned about historical accuracies of films which are based on true events, as long as they were kept to a minimum, but this movie changed my mind. Michael Bay completely changed the events of Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>There was just too much historical inaccuracy and fictional characters in the movie. The movie makes no mention of real life heroes George Welch and Kenneth Taylor, the pilots who actually flew over Pearl Harbor. They're instead replaced by two fictional characters.<br/><br/>The love triangle is the main focus of the movie, which is completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Kenneth Taylor, who died in November 2006, called this film ""a piece of trash . . . over-sensationalized and distorted"".<br/><br/>The USS Arizona did not jump a few feet into the air when it exploded. There is actual footage of the ship exploding, yet Bay made it more dramatic looking. Another obvious mistake is the A6M Zero, which are all painted green, resembling an army type (navy types were all grey when they attacked Pearl).<br/><br/>The Doolitte Raid was surprisingly included in the movie. Although the event is a response to the Pearl Harbor attack, I feel it is merely to give the American audience some relief that at least they get to see some payback. I wonder if Doolittle ever said he would do a 'kamikaze' if his B-25 was hit.<br/><br/>Of all the actors/actresses who starred in this movie, only Cuba Gooding Jr. delivered an outstanding performance as Doris Miller did shooting down two Japanese planes with only a machine gun. However, the actor was merely playing a supporting role and his actions in the movie was far different from what he did in reality.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut version does not change my opinion of this movie. Until a historically accurate & entertaining remake of Pearl Harbor has finally been formulated, I will remain frustrated and angered at Michael Bay's awful directing."
"avianblue","2","160","335","11 May 2006"," This film should contain a health warning!
","There are very few films I've come across which actually make you want to beat yourself senseless with a heavy object. But this is surely one of them. Quite possibly one of the worst films ever made and I can't believe I managed to watch it through to the end! Twice. Once in the cinema and once on TV!<br/><br/>First off let me say that I can understand the need to make a compromise between historical accuracy and the telling of a 'good story'. That assumes of course that you have a good story to tell, rather than this banal boiling-pot of the oldest clichés in the book.<br/><br/>The heights of implausibility which this film manages to attain are just jaw-dropping. Saving Private Ryan managed to interweave an implausible story with historical events while maintaining a semblance of believability. Pearl Harbor just had me swearing obscenities at the screen in frustration! <br/><br/>I can forgive the use of late-model Spitfires in the 'Battle of Britain' sequences. What is less forgivable is the portrayal of the Battle of Britain at all given that it took place in 1940 and not 1941 as depicted here! And it is never quite explained how Ben Afleck manages to get himself released from his duties with the RAF and return to Hawaii - I guess he decided he'd had enough and so handed back his plane and uniform! Isn't that desertion in most people's book? <br/><br/>Some of the special effects during the attack on Pearl Harbor are, admittedly, not bad - despite the appearance of what appear to be quite modern warships in some shots! But the makers seem to think that the more special effects they can get into a single frame of film then the more realistic/impressive it will be! Unfortunately it just ends up looking like an intro-sequence for a Medal of Honor type game. Less is definitely more sometimes! <br/><br/>Talking about effects - what was that all about with the sequences in the hospital during the battle? Did they get a dud batch of film stock that had been exposed to sunlight or something? It's all very well trying to be smart with film effects but sometimes you can end up looking like complete amateurs - which I'm afraid they do here.<br/><br/>As for our intrepid heroes suddenly becoming experienced B-25 pilots - oh pur-lease!! At this point I had my head in my hands and was sobbing uncontrollably. The boys even manage to get involved in hand-to-hand combat, wiping out an entire Japanese platoon in the process. Presumably this was to show that our heroes were capable of going toe-to-toe with the enemy as well as just dropping bombs on them? <br/><br/>Who on earth was this film aimed at? I'm sure the majority of filmgoers are not complete imbeciles but this is exactly who the target audience seems to be. It could be viewed simply as a romantic adventure yarn (although the romantic element is dire) but it seems to want to portray itself as much more than that, which is it's biggest weakness. <br/><br/>If you want to be a heavy-weight historical drama then you just cannot mix in the sort of love-triangle claptrap and implausible plot lines that are in this.<br/><br/>Dreadful. Watch it and cringe."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","31","56","17 May 2006"," Risible soap opera (spoilers)
","Never before have I rooted for the Japanese in a Second World War flick. Never before have I so loathed the Allied forces.<br/><br/>If Pearl Harbor is anything to go by then the American Navy was wholly populated by loud, obnoxious morons who spent their days courting empty-headed bimbos while drinking and whooping like some thief had come along in the night, scooped out their brains and trampled them under foot. The characters here are morons. Conversely, the Japanese come across as smart, resourceful and composed. They feel no need to hoot and holler, and they don't seem to be secretly ogling male bum cakes like the American characters do. They're entirely more likable. Oh, but what about the British? Well, they enjoy fellating beefy, horse-faced Americans  a British pilot tells Affleck that if the States has more men like him then their enemies should soil themselves. Like I say, the Allied forces in this film are wretched.<br/><br/>But I do have to say that even the glorious Japanese forces have their bad moments. In a politically correct effort to 'humanise' them there's one bit where a Japanese officer melodramatically says that a truly brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war. And there's another bit where a Japanese pilot leans out of his plane and apparently warns some children of the impending carnage. It's an incredibly sappy moment. Although I'll change my opinion of said pilot if he was actually taunting the children and saying something like, ""I'm going to kill your daddy."" <br/><br/>Another piece of political correctness is the portrayal of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). In one scene he even holds his white commanding officer while telling him how gosh darn great he his. But perhaps more insulting is the way he indulges in hooting and hollering as he shoots the Japanese down  every American character in this film behaves like they're in the audience for some ghastly sitcom. I mean, it's one thing to have a fictional character act idiotically, but it's something else to belittle the efforts of a real person. And really, the character is totally superfluous. Everyone else in the film has some sort of connection to Affleck, Hartnett or Beckinsale, but Gooding exists separately. His inclusion is really just a sad concession to political correctness. His character exists only to prove to stupid right-wing Americans that there were actually black sailors who fought bravely. You know, just in case you're a Grade A moron and thought all the black sailors were hiding below decks eating fried chicken.<br/><br/>But far more offensive than the political correctness is the 'romance'. Really, the film is about as romantic as drunken masturbation. There's just not one iota of genuine feeling in the whole movie. And of course the whole thing is completely unbelievable. Oh, some horse-face falls in love, goes to England, is presumed dead, then his girlfriend shacks up with his best friend before horse-face returns, then horse-face's ex-girlfriend finds out she's pregnant with his best friend's child on the day of his resurrection, and then the best friend dies in battle and horse-face and ex-girlfriend shack up again and bring the child up together. Yeah, that sounds plausible.<br/><br/>But although the sequence of events is ridiculous, the scenes themselves are far worse. One of the worst is the courtship between Affleck and Beckinsale. She's a nurse, he's a pilot, and she passes him to fly because she thinks he has a cute arse and because he begs her not to take his wings. Then he turns into Inspector Clouseau and smacks his head on things and fires a champagne cork into his face. Somehow this is meant to endear us to him. The only thing I can say in response is that it's a shame it wasn't a gun equine-features accidentally shot himself with.<br/><br/>However, I wanted to turn the gun on myself when Affleck goes to England and we have to hear Beckinsale writing her letters. ""Every night I look at the sunset and try and draw the last ounce of heat from its long day and send it from my heart to yours."" Somewhere Fabio is nodding his head in approval. But there must be about a million sunsets in this film  Bay has never met a visual cliché he didn't like.<br/><br/>And Beckinsale writes her letters while sitting on a beach in a bikini (with a flower behind her ear) as waves crash on the rocks beyond. How old is Michael Bay exactly? It's like its been directed by a 13-year old girl. And just how white are Beckinsale's teeth? They kept on distracting me. Teeth shouldn't be that white. They shouldn't look like someone's painted gloss on them. But I also hated the way that every establishing shot was some sort of swooping crane shot. Is Bay really that short on ideas? Wellyeah, of course he is.<br/><br/>But what really makes me laugh is the way that Bay has compared this tripe to a David Lean film. Lean made romantic films that didn't make you want to wretch, romantic films that were written and directed with taste and style, romantic films that were literate and intelligent. Bay's film is none of these things. It's an infantile disasterpiece. It's a film where simpletons have teary intercourse in a parachute hanger; a film where two whooping morons almost single-handedly make the Japanese air force retreat; a film where FDR heroically rises to his feet to show what the American heart is capable of; a film where a dying man says he's cold and then symbolically hands his children over to his best pal; and a film where a bimbo with shockingly white teeth says, ""Now I'm going to give Danny my whole heartbut I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you."" No film has done so much to dishonour the Allied forces."

Good job, guys; now let's watch you make fun of disabled people.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's just my little rant. Now back to the movie...<br/><br/>It was sh!t. The romance was stupid, the acting subpar, and the writing was like jamming a screwdriver into your brain through your ears. The only decent thing about it was the special effects, but since many other movies have just as good if not better effects, that's probably not a good reason to see it.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this film at all."
"troodon","1","35","66","8 August 2003"," Except for 20 minutes, utter garbage.
","Possibly spoilers (though not much to spoil).<br/><br/>Essentially this movie is trying to be both ""Titanic"" (romance with a historcial event as background) and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (strarly realistic miltary drama) at the same time.  Basic summation of plot: Guy 1 falls in love with this woman.  Guy 1 disappears and is presumed dead, so Guy 2 (Guy 1's friend) falls in the love with the woman too.  Guy 1 later shows up again, creating an awkward moment.  Pearl Harbor happens.  The characters involve themselves.  Dolittle's raid happens.  Guy 1 or Guy 2 dies, leaving the other one to take care of the woman who is pregnant with Guy 1 or Guy 2's child.<br/><br/>If you wondering why I only spend one sentence on the event that's the title of the movie, good.  I am wondering why the title event takes up only 20 minutes out of the 3 hours of this movie.<br/><br/>That 20 minutes, seeing the actual Pearl Harbor attack, is the only redeeming feature of this movie.  Special effects and cinemtography realistically and graphically portray the actual attack.  See those 20 minutes.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie...<br/><br/>The romance is poorly written, and completely untinteresting.  And SLOW. Ben Affleck gives his most wooden perforamnce ever, and for him that's really saying something.<br/><br/>As for the historic events leading up to the attack, the historical figures are a tad too prescient, knowing way more than they possibly should (as if they read ahead in the script).<br/><br/>A really silly moment is when you see the Japanese attack plans... carved into granite.  Not kidding, they actually are, and what looks more like a momument in a park than a military headquarters.<br/><br/>After the attack, you hear one of the stupidest lines in the entire movie: ""I think World War II just started!""  Ridiculous, in that nobody would ever say that in 1941.  There is no World War I yet (it was still just called ""The Great War"") and the term World War II wasn't coined until after 1945 when it ended.  It really breaks the illusion of being at the even that the last 20 minutes did such a good job at.<br/><br/>You see the charachters get involved in a rediculous unrealistic way (though actions were based on actual historcial events, though they're GREATLY exxagerated here).  The movie isn't satisfied with ending at the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, and moved right on to the Doolittle raid (after more boring attention to the romantic plot).  Which leads to a predictable end after the raid (one of the 2 dies) in case you still care at this point.<br/><br/>Very slow moving, poorly written, boring movie.  Except for the excellent 20 minutes of the attack, see that part then return this.  Don't recommend you buy it."

","How can you turn such a powerful moment in American history into a trite love triangle?!! I've been privileged to know and read about so many amazing stories that occurred to sailors, soldiers (on both sides) and civilians alike that defy description. Another film that any decent writer would have a field day with. There is so much grist for the mill you wouldn't be able to include it all. <br/><br/>While the earlier movie version of Pearl Harbor, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" is done in a documentary style it stays true to the myriad real-life characters and is so well acted by a rich cast of veteran actors. Mr.'s Bay and Wallace could take a lesson from earlier movies like ""Tora,Tora, Tora and the classic ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"". The latter does have a corny love-story at it's heart but is also a terrific drama and action adventure too that is respectful of the amazing couraqge of those heroes involved. <br/><br/>And as far as that central love triangle of ""30 Seconds..."", we do have to remember the time period it was done in. What might seem dated now was quite meaningful then to the thousands of men that went off to war and the women who were left behind to keep the nation's economy going and support the country and the troops. The love story as depicted in ""Pearl Harbor"" has none of the vital intensity of the earlier film and the love triangle is just unnecessary.<br/><br/>Interesting is the fact that despite the main sell of the film which was it's amazing special-effects; this even suffers in comparison to one key scene in """"30 Seconds..."". Compare the scenes in both movies where the first pilot successfully takes off under the required distance needed to safely get off the eventual aircraft carrier. The 1942 version looks real while in the Michael Bay film we see the pilots cheering as the plane passes over the line and doesn't even leave the ground in the shot!<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding gives the best performance of the film portraying real-life hero, Doris Miller. The inclusion of Miller as a supporting character was the best idea that the screenwriter had and Gooding as usual, turns in an excellent performance. Other good performances in the film are; Tom Sizemore reprising his excellent Private Ryan performance as a tough soldier and Jon Voight's game effort as Pres. Roosevelt. <br/><br/>Shameful in the film is the treatment and portrayal of the Japanese who are treated as caricatures. The wonderful Mako is wasted in his portrayal Admiral Yamamoto. His famous ""..waking a sleeping giant."" line is done as a throw-away. Yamamoto was such an extra-ordinary person that even the American pilot who shot him down and killed him during the war later came to revere him for his intelligence, honor and vision. There is even the element of the mystical about Yamamoto. He was reported to have had a premonition about his death and on the day he made his ill-fated plane trip, he purposely put on the dress uniform one would wear for a funeral.<br/><br/>Ben Afleck and Kate Beckinsale are weak as the main characters. Josh Hartnett, a good actor, just seems whiny. In the face of all that's going on-- you feel like, who cares about these three! What a shame, a waste of money. One more film where special effects are relied upon to carry the film. Just imagine if 1/10 of the effort that was put into the special effects was put into the story itself. It would have been a more worthy memorial to our fallen and living heroes of Pearl Harbor. as ""Saving Private Ryan"" was to the fallen and living heroes of D-Day."

","What is a Disney/Bruckheimer/Bay action flick? It is heavy on special effects; includes a dopey love story; lacks historical accuracy and/or scientific reality; and has awful acting (mostly by Ben Affleck), writing, and character development. ""Armageddon"" is the most obvious example; ""Pearl Harbor"" is another.<br/><br/>The first hour-plus of ""Pearl Harbor"" is the dopey love triangle. Rafe McCawley (Affleck) goes to ""downtown London"" (no one says downtown -- it's known as Central London) to serve in the RAF as a fighter pilot. I don't know how, in one night, he was able to train to the point where he can not only fly a completely different aircraft, but shoot down a German bomber. Believing he is killed in action, his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) comforts--and hooks with--his girlfriend Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). The two men fight on the night of December 6th, and of course by the time the bombing starts they're best friends again.<br/><br/>The attack on Pearl Harbor: The action sequences were well directed and choreographed, but they too were loaded with historical mistakes for the sake of dramatic license. One thing done right was Dory Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), the cook who shot down an enemy plane and was later awarded the Navy Cross. But I doubt the real Dory Miller jumped and hollered when he did it.<br/><br/>Then they include a scene or two with the Japanese fleet, which I guess is an attempt to give us both sides of the story, or to give the audience an enemy to hate. But Admiral Yamamoto was portrayed wrongly: he wasn't gung-ho about attacking Pearl Harbor, he lamented the decision.<br/><br/>The movie could have ended with Roosevelt's (Jon Voight) address to Congress -- and even *that* had mistakes in it -- but it dragged on for another hour with Dolittle's Raid over Tokyo. James Doolittle is played poorly by anti-war mouthpiece Alec Baldwin, who acts like a cheerleader rather than a military leader. And all of the sudden, Walker and McKawley are bomber pilots?<br/><br/>Now, contrast this with 1970's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" which is practically a history lesson disguised as a feature film; or even 1953's ""From Here To Eternity,"" a smartly written and well acted love story set in November of 1941. ""Pearl Harbor"" tries to be both, but it fails miserably."

","Est-Ce fabuleux!<br/><br/>""Ma, you know who else lived through World War II besides grandpa? I did"", I screamed at her from outside the house, while still getting down from the cab that I took from the cinema. What a great movie it was. The images of the gusty air-force combats and the invasions are still in my head, the sounds of the thunderous cannons still roar in my ears, and the gentlemanliness of the army men, with their uniforms and planes, still leave me grasping for more, as did the jam-packed theater. <br/><br/>Why did it have to get over? Why couldn't it last just a tiny bit longer? The sky high aerobatics, the machine guns, the fighter jets, the discipline, the pretty army women, the well ironed suits, the line of command, and the bigger than life climax, I adored it all. The chemistry between the leads is something to look forward too. The unconventional romantic relationship and the intimate scenes between the lovers spice up the movie and give a new twist to the plot.<br/><br/>If you want to feel the thrill and the emotion of being at war and love at the same time, of being away from home, of being behind enemy lines, and of leading your country to victory, go and watch Michael Bay's extraordinary take on the events leading up to and involving thereof one of the most disastrous catastrophes of the era.<br/><br/>Michael Bay never misses a chance to leave his viewers awestruck with his action packed works, with strands of deadly love. And he did it again with Pearl Harbor.  The movie, though titled Pearl Harbor, is much more than that just the bombings. The war is twofold: between countries and between hearts. Army Air Corps, Affleck and Hartnett, thick as thieves, become the target of a deadly love triangle, with the potential of encompassing their friendship, falling in love with the ever-pretty Evelyn, which results in a love-hate relationship being fired up between the two captains. But Bay has something new to offer rather than the clichéd. Their friendship is tested when they are sent off to war together, resulting in their hatred for each other ultimately turning, or rather returning, into a brotherly bond. The climax is sort of depressing, but that is overcome by the patriotism of winning the war.<br/><br/>The motion picture is certainly not for the faint hearted. It is a mixed bag of emotions, and it is one that has many holes in it. The movie takes its audience through a variety of different emotions, starting at a high with love and patriotism, progressing to hatred and anger, and then ending into sorrow and dismal. The movie throughout, holds its viewers onto their seats and unleashes a surprise, a twist, every few frames, bounding them to think on what may follow next."

","I saw Pearl Harbor because I heard that there was a 90 minute battle sequence when the Japanese attack the infamous Navy port. What I didn't realize was that there was another 90 minutes of complete BS surrounding that one fight scene. Yes, some moments were spectacular visually, but the rest of the movie was not only bad, but offensively bad. In fact, the way that the entire thing is portrayed is a love story and not even a good love story at that. Right away we know that Affleck gets together with Beckinsdale and then his partner betrays him and has sex with her. So, she's pregnant and their friendship is on the line and they have to decide who'll marry her etc. Oh yeah, and the Japanese attack at some point. <br/><br/>Pearl Harbor was a horrific tragedy, but this movie paints it as just another cool fight scene. Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted as this one-dimensional bit part which he overacts anyway. Also, at the end of the movie, when Hartnett gets shot, he's basically being crucified (look at the bits of wood he's attached too). Just another offensive, pretentious factor in this completely ridiculous excuse for a film. And when Hartnett got shot, I actually cheered. A movie is very special when it get's you to root for the Nazis.<br/><br/>It's offensive and terrible, don't see it. It's three hours of historical inaccuracy, BS metaphors, sappy messages and terrible acting. Go watch Tora! Tora! Tora! instead."

"forrestwrs","1","14","23","12 September 2010"," Appalling.
","Appalling.<br/><br/>Four minutes into the movie, Michael Bay starts with the cheesy lines and overblown melodrama. What is with this guy and his cheesy overblown melodramatic romances? He's making George Lucas look like Shakespeare and James Cameron look like Michael Curtiz. This movie is an abomination. Michael Bay is romanticizing what's happening on Pearl Harbor, using and manipulating this dreadful events for his own advantage to sell tickets. He throws in cliché after cliché and never once tries to tell a story. And he rips off greater directors and their films rather than trying to make his own. For instance, is it just me, or does the dogfight earlier seem vaguely familiar? He's ripping right off Star Wars! I'm not talking borrowing tiny elements or being vaguely familiar, I'm talking ripping right from the movie, almost shot for shot! And even using the same lines! Halfway through this movie, I had to ask myself one question: is Bay really using the tragedy at Pearl Harbor as a tool for this romance? I'm assuming he was trying to show how this tragedy affected real people, but this movie is way more about the romance than it is about the bombings! I feel like he *wants* to put the human element in, but he's not! He's completely removing it by giving us so much horrible melodrama. There is just this constant bombardment of melodramatic nonsense! Would it be so much to ask for him to at least stick to one story by the way? Half the time he's giving us this beyond-cheesy romance, but then he'll randomly cut to the Japanese military and US intelligence. Stick to one story! It kind of depletes the purpose of having us fear for the attacks if he's going to show us when and exactly how the Japanese are going to strike. He does not know how to balance the war aspect of this movie with the romance aspect. He either needs to stick to one or the other and not try to do both! And he rips off so many great movies it is pathetic. Bay very blatantly tries to rip off James Cameron's Titanic, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and George Lucas's Star Wars. Unfortunately, he has none of Cameron's eye for visuals, Spielberg's finesse with emotion and camera-work, or Lucas's talent for characters and action. And here is something else I noticed while I'm stuck on the director himself: he does not give the audience a sense of what it was like to be on board any of the ships before bombing them. So, we don't really feel an emotional connection to the ships or anyone on-board. By the way, Mr. Bay, could you please stop moving the camera? I feel like the movie is drifting away from me!! Now then, as I said before, I don't feel like director Bay or screenwriter Randall Wallace did their military research before starting filming. Did pilots ever play chicken with the enemy? I highly doubt that. And I really hated the way he made the pilots seem stupid, not knowing their right from their left. It is very obvious to me that he did none of the proper research for this movie.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor has one of the worst and most awfully clichéd scripts I've ever heard in my life. These lines that the actors have to say are just plain god awful, no other way around it. I seriously think Bay was trying to squeeze as many clichés as possible into the first half hour. In the first half hour of the movie, I counted no fewer than twenty clichés. I mean, this screenplay was just embarrassingly bad. There's no other way to say it. He should be ashamed of this screenplay.<br/><br/>As for the actors in this film, I hated them all. I didn't enjoy watching them on screen, they were stupid characters, and none of them carried any kind of emotional authenticity with them. They were all as shallow and selfish and pitiful as any character I've ever seen on screen. We're given no other reason to care about any of them other than that they are in love with each other.<br/><br/>And why does this movie hate women so much? I have never seen a movie that hated women as much as this movie does. All the women in this movie want are men. They joined the military to meet men. And every time we see a woman she's talking about men. Are these women really that shallow? All they ever talk about is sex and men! And then in the operating room, they're all just incompetent and panicky. Why does Bay hate women so much?? Now, I am going to give this movie a point for some pretty decent art direction and visual effects. Doesn't have anything on Saving Private Ryan, though. And I really wish this movie had paid as much attention to its dialogue, story, characters, historical accuracies, and general logic as it does to its effects and art direction. In fact, everything else about this movie is so bad that by the time we get to those scenes, I don't even care about them. And Bay doesn't really give us a whole lot of time to look at them. He's just running everything around too haphazardly.<br/><br/>Also, the visuals are pretty good, but I don't feel like I'm a part of this war like I did with other war films.<br/><br/>Bay epically fails with his monstrosity of a motion picture Pearl Harbor. This is among the worst films I've ever seen. Even its good portions-like its music and art direction-are dragged under by the weight of the horrible direction and writing. What the audience is left with is a movie whose good parts are still degenerating factors because they were used merely to try to distract the audience from all its other short-comings.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Right up front, let me confess to having been a World War II nut since early childhood.  You may thus understand the depths of my disappointment with this movie.  I believe Roger Ebert said it best: ""The Japanese attack an American love triangle.""  I find it inexcusable that such a pivotal event in history, and one as well documented from just about all angles, can come in for such slipshod treatment at the hands of moviemakers, but I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.  Just let down.<br/><br/>If the producers can expend so much time, money and effort to make everything look big and splashy, why not go the extra 1/4 mile and make it look *right*?  Spielberg managed it for Saving Private Ryan, even with the somewhat far-fetched plot device.  Flaws abound, and have been pointed out in great depth elsewhere (the most glaring are the guided missile frigates in the harbor, the off-scale appearance of the Oklahoma as she capsizes (with an impossible torpedo hole in her starboard side, which was shielded by the Maryland *and* Ford Island), no mention of Nevada's dramatic attempt to get underway and subsequent beaching, etc).<br/><br/>To my legion of fellow critics I say, ""read your history before trashing the 'token black' Dorie Miller subplot"".  Ship's Cook 3rd Miller did, in fact, give aid and comfort to West Virginia's dying captain, did, in fact, man a machine gun for 15 minutes (during which he believed he shot down a Japanese plane) and was, in fact, the first black recipient of the Navy Cross (awarded in early 1942 by Admiral Nimitz).  Aside from the mistaken coffee-service bit (he was actually bagging laundry at the time) that was one of the things the producers got *right*.<br/><br/>Focusing on the Dolittle Raid, I saw only lost opportunities - how Dolittle convinced his superiors to let him fly, the fates of the crews (who flew solo rather than in formation and were scattered all over the place afterwards) and Dolittle's dejection at the ""failed"" raid and his subsequent accolades... all of this was jettisoned as the producers got out the Ritz crackers and Velveeta and went for the cheesy, contrived, convenient resolution of the *important* part of the movie, that cockamamie love triangle.<br/><br/>In sum, so many opportunities, so little follow through.  Rent ""In Harm's Way"" for schmaltz, and ""Tora Tora Tora"" for the attack itself.  Better yet, snag a copy of ""At Dawn We Slept"", and read up on the historical tapestry that this movie never really touched."

","*****SPOILERS MAY BE INCLUDED********<br/><br/>OK, first off I was really hyped up about this movie. However, after seeing it several times, I find myself going back to Tora Tora Tora. The sheer number of errors in this movie are appalling, considering how much was spent on it. Let me name a few.<br/><br/>1. OK, Cuba Gooding Jr., playing the role of Dorie Miller on the USS West Virginia (BB-48) runs and grabs a twin .50 cal aircooled MG mount and opens fire. Already all this is wrong. When he fires it, as you look at different scenes, in 1 scene it has 2 closed ammo boxes, then 1 closed 1 open, and then only 1 closed, yet no one is around him and he is firing all the time. Secondly, on US prewar battleships, only single .50 cal WATERCOOLED MGs are used, and thirdly if you look in the background, you see a USN Frigate. Outboard of the West Virginia was the battleship Oklahoma, and on the other side Ford Island. No Frigates anywhere.<br/><br/>2. In the movie, when an A6M2 Zero gets shot down, it crashes into a battleships boat crane, and bends it. In all photos after Pearl, all the cranes on all the BBs are still straight, with the possible exception of the Arizona.<br/><br/>3. We see a tripod mast from an inboard battleship collapse, and fall on an outboard battleship. Only 4 battleships had tripod masts at Pearl Harbor, and none fell on another ship. Oklahomas broke off when she rolled over, Nevada and Pennsylvanias were undamaged, and Arizona's foremast slumped forward.<br/><br/>4. The battleship Missouri sits in for the West Virginia during Goodings fight scene. The Missouri's triple 16""/50 turret can be seen. The West Virginia had twin 16""/45s.<br/><br/>5. When the Oklahoma capsizes, it raises out of the water, with the only the deck to the fortop in the water before it sinks.<br/><br/>6. Ben Affleck are flying P-40N Trainers in closeups, and in exterior views are flying P-40Es. P-40Bs (2 cowling guns, 4 wing guns, not 6 wing guns) were at Pearl.<br/><br/>7. When Josh Hartnett is dogfighting Zekes, he is pulling hard on the stick, firing, and swinging everywhich way. IF he did that in real life, he would 1) Be out of ammo in 9 seconds (only 1,200 rounds total, at 700 rounds per gun), 2) couldn't hit squat, and 3) stall his plan and throw it into a spin.<br/><br/>8. When the B-25s take off of the Hornet, In one shot the flight deck is of a 3D modeled Essex (that's not a Yorktown style flight deck), then in another we clearly see the split flight deck of a Nimitz class CVN<br/><br/>9. When we see the ""Japanese"" carrier force (Kido Butai) heading towards Pearl, you can clearly see 2 Nimitz Class CVNs, Arleigh Burke class DDGs, and a surfaced Los Angeles Flight 1 SSN.<br/><br/>These are the 9 most glaring errors to me, and the ones I think I can fit in this comment. If you want a good Pearl Harbor movie that is factual, real, doesn't look like a video game, and isn't riddled with errors, go see Tora Tora Tora."

"mdouglasfresno","2","17","30","15 January 2007"," Bad history, bad movie-making
","With a big-budget ""epic"" like this one, where to begin? First is the excruciatingly long running-time; I was starting to squirm in my seat before the attack on Pearl Harbor even commenced. Next is a ridiculous (and ultimately VERY tedious) love-triangle; I guess the producers thought the only way they could sell ""history"" to the public was to wrap it around a romance story. Unfortunately for them, the boring romance angle only serves to turn-off action-movie buffs! <br/><br/>But the biggest objection to this film was what it tries to pass-off as history. The same pilot, Ben Affleck, is involved in THREE of the biggest events of WWII -- the Battle of Britian, the Pearl Harbor Raid, and the Doolittle Raid? What's the odds on that happening? 25 million to one??? And SINCE WHEN were hot-shot fighter pilots recruited by Jimmy Doolittle to pilot large B-25 bombers off the pitching deck of an aircraft carrier? Was there anything in the plot that even hinted that Ben and buddy Josh had ever been NEAR a bomber before? As any old combat pilot will tell you, a bomber pilot was one breed, and a fighter pilot a whole other breed. (Also, who thought of casting spoiled little brat Alec Baldwin, of all people, as Colonel Jimmy Doolittle? A laughable decision; I'll stick with Spencer Tracy in ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo""!) <br/><br/>As for the Pearl Harbor raid itself, a few good computer-generated shots of the battleship Oklahoma capsizing do not make up for truly comic-book scenes of our heroes dogfighting Japanese planes. First we're treated to Ben, Josh and their crews shooting down enemy planes from the ground. Next we see Ben & Josh in the air and working with their ground crews over the radio to lead the Japanese into veritable shooting galleries of bullets. I'll bet real 1941-era pilots would of loved to have had the kind of air-ground coordination this movie shows. Next we see our heroic pair dodging in-between hangers, about 10 feet off the ground! Then they wander out over battleship row and fight among the ship's masts. But the biggest ""groaner"" is when they ""play chicken"" and lead four Japanese planes to crash with one another! This is truly Hollywood at it's worst. (Oh, and corny dialog like Josh saying over the phone as the first bombs drop, ""I think World War Two just started!"" Another groaner). <br/><br/>Not only does our dynamic duo almost completely foil the whole Japanese attack with their magnificent flying, but upon landing they show up at girlfriend Kate's hospital to donate blood. As as if that weren't enough, then they volunteer to go out to battleship row and help rescue sailors trapped in the upturned Oklahoma! Whew! Instead of getting a medal, these two should have been nominated for sainthood. <br/><br/>Finally at the end of the picture, when they crash-land in China after the Doolittle Raid, our brave boys single-handedly destroy a whole Japanese platoon. (But, alas, Josh is mortally wounded in the process... sniff sniff.) Oh well, that neatly wraps up the love-triangle! <br/><br/>I remember the howls of anger from veterans when this travesty of a movie came out -- once I saw it I couldn't blame them. Stick with 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora"" if you want a realistic depiction of that momentous event."

","Pearl Harbor comes from that brought you Armageddon (which after further review is actually for me a lot lesser than what I once thought it was and shows what Fellini and Bergman can do to an under-developed mind) of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  And like that movie, they make the audience cry and automatically feel patriotism at no extra charge.  That is not fair in many respects, especially during Memorial day weekend.  For all those who think Spielberg and his company make manipulative films (which is arguable), you should take a gander at this piece of work.<br/><br/>Harbor here takes a Titanic type of approach (bad idea) as for nearly an hour and a half before a torpedo is dropped  a tree sap filled love story submerges with 2 people falling in love (Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale who deserve better than this) and then when the pilot Affleck supposedly dies (no one feels pity as thanks to the unimaginative innovation known as the trailer we know he's fighting at the big battle), she falls in love with his best friend, played in one of the lesser roles of the year by Josh Hartnett. But of course, this is all before (and sadly also partially after) the big attack by the Japanese on the Hawaiian base.<br/><br/>Credit should be given where it's due and that's why this film isn't a complete failure- the battle and action sequences are excellently put together with visual effects helping a lot and chaos giving good tension to the film.  BUT, the droning other story of the bad love triangle is so distracting it might just be worth waiting for video (or DVD might be appropriate) and just singling out the fine bombing.  One of the lesser blockbusters ever made, and now along side it's co-companion Armageddon (but at least the Rock is still intact).<br/><br/>Two little notes though: 1) this is to point out a pretty obvious flaw and goof.  Was it just me, or did it seem weird that several months after Beckinsale's character reveals she's pregnant that she's as thin as she was earlier in the movie?  I would think that Bay could've at least taken a couple of bucks from the 140 mill budget and supplied some stuffing or something.  2) Randall Wallace who wrote the outstanding Braveheart and good Man in the Iron Mask proves that even though a blockbuster doesn't need 10 writers, one can still botch things up.  Oh well, at least Shrek is still around.  C-"

","Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgments made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions and graphics, watch this film. If you want to be entertained while learning something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>Just one word about the commentary track if you get the DVD. The best thing about DVDs of films directed by Michael Bay are the commentary tracks. Hearing this track, I could easily see where some of the bad dialogue came from. The problem is that Michael Bay interviewed many Pearl Harbor veterans, and he used the expressions they used in the movie. There's 125 different personalities crammed into a few characters that are spewing the bad dialogue. I'm guessing Mr. Bay took all the expressions these people said and had two or three characters say everything. So all the clichéd expressions the veterans used during their lives are shoved into 3 hours. That's my take anyway. Mr. Bay does admit that one thing he would change if he could would be the earnest dialogue because the younger people seem to think it's corny.<br/><br/>The DVD is very cheap to purchase at this point, and is worth it for the commentary track alone."

The movie is so long and drawn out it's terrible. You just sit there and think to yourself, ""why am I watching this and why should I care about what's going on?"" There is NO plot that's worth while and NO depth to the characters. It's just a bunch of Hollywood garbage. The love story and the war were not tied together enough. Actually, they weren't tied together at all. It was like there were two stories going on at once that have nothing to do with each other. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, but it wasn't about Pearl Harbor, it was about a romance that has no depth. Blah. Boring. The only decent scene is when the ships are being blown apart. Wonderful. And I love how Hollywood film makers add in garbage to spice things up. Like the dog fight with the American planes and the Zero's. That never happened. Atleast make something that's SOMEWHAT historically accurate. No history No story. No depth. No plot. Gotta love the special effects, though! BOOM! BANG! POW! Watch everything explode.<br/><br/>
This is one of the worst movies ever filmed. It's one example that Hollywood would do anything to the public in  order to sucker them in to make a buck. This is Hollywood garbage at it's finest."

","Well, for those who liked the movie (and I saw this movie back in 2001, but it still sticks in my craw) or thought that it had a genuine historical accuracy about it, let's get the facts that the movie got right straight.<br/><br/>1) Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii, 2) Japan attacked the US at Pearl Harbor, and 3) The US launched a raid on Japan off of the USS Hornet.<br/><br/>They built a bad movie around 3 correct facts.  This movie was horrible and the dialogue was trite.  How likely is it that an American fighter pilot flying for the British would end up in Hawaii just in time for the ""big attack"" and then be switched to flying bombers days after the attack.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie on Pearl Harbor, you have to go back to ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" or for carriers in the Pacific, ""Midway"".  Don't waste your money on this movie, even if they allow you to see it for free! (Hey, you'll buy a Coke and popcorn, of course, that'll be the best part!)"

","This movie is in league with Titanic. It is a story of a tragedy, turned into a sappy love story, which seems to be a trend in Hollywood. First of all, this movie is historically incorrect in so many ways, that I'm not even going to use up my energy listing the inaccuracies. Then again, when is Hollywood ever historically accurate? <br/><br/>The love story itself is totally unbelievable and stupid. Affleck gets shot down, survives, and his friend falls in love with his girlfriend. What a slut! What a stupid story! You got your typical hot-shot American pilots flying around like a bunch of idiots, the sappy love story, the ""USA wins the day"" at the end, even though Pearl Harbor was far from a victory, the Japanese attacking and killing everybody they see, making the Japanese look like complete evil heartless bastards, etc.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood think that taking a tragedy and turning it into a love story is a good idea? What's next? The Hindenburg? TWA flight 800? The Lusitania? The WTC? Come on! Are people really running out of ideas this much? I'm being very lenient giving this movie 2 stars. The only reason I'm doing that is because I have seen worse."

","I know that there are some ""Pearl Harbor"" fans, and I'm sorry but to be honest this movie is just trash. It seemed to me that the director just wanted to have a huge action movie and lost all the details that this event really happened. They just added a huge love story in it that wasn't memorable and also that they were trying to make another ""Titanic"". I was looking forward to this movie when it came out, because I had studied World War II religiously and I couldn't believe this monstrosity of a film.<br/><br/>Ben and Josh play Rafe and Danny, two American boys who grew up together and are in the army. Rafe seems to just be in love with America and one girl, Evelyn played by Kate, she's a nurse who helps Ben get back to health after a certain mishap with his nose. They have a romance, but when it comes time for Rafe to choose between his country and his love, which does he pick? You just guess. But when an accident happens in England where Rafe is, they assume him dead and send Eve the message of his death. She and Danny then become real close through this lose and you guess it! They get down and dirty! Rafe comes back though expecting everything to be the same as before. Shock! Eve is pregnant with Danny's baby; but that's the least of their problems when the evil Japenese are thinking about bombing an unexpecting army base, Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The movie then just turns into nothing but action and makes the audience forget that this was real. I didn't feel a connection between Ben and Josh. If could actors just look more like they hate each other or didn't enjoy working together. Kate has a good performance, but unfortunately is not supported well by the other actors. The Japenese are made out to be total villains, even though what they did was wrong, but the movie might as well just should made them into those villains from the old James Bond flicks. The movie just doesn't work and doesn't deserve respect in any way historically.<br/><br/>1/10"

","when the script is bad, there is no Oscar winning actor, director or cinematographer that can mend it, not that this film had any that fall in this category. This is a typical example of film makers at the verge of career ending taking the money from a more than wealthy and generous as well as stupid and uninspired producer and not caring of public opinion or respect of history events. Titanic was better than this and I believe that one has plenty of ""worst film ever in cinema's history"" awards on its shelf.

","December 7th 1941. America received its worst attack of the Second World War.

Michael Bay couldn't have created a better cast. In my opinion, it was definitely worth all the money and hard work that everyone put into it. Josh Hartnett, is very hot and very good at acting. Along with co-star Ben Affleck who is very talented and could make any position of acting look real. The last half hour, contain some of the most exhilarating scenes of battle, ever seen in a film. The great acting makes the bond between the two friends all the more real during the fight sequences.<br/><br/>Pearl harbour is an emotional story containing war and romance; two genres that it combines to make one of the best war films of the early millennium if not of all time!"

","This is supposed to be a World War 2 based movie. Its the sort of movie anyone would expect to be an accurate enough dramatisation of events that actually happened.<br/><br/>Instead what we get is an attempt to make another Titanic by including a love triangle that is dominant over the whole history aspect. It just doesn't seem right.<br/><br/>Being a historic epic, they could have cut down on the whole love story and focused more on what would have been relevant such as the Japanese preparation of the attack and the situation President Roosevelt was finding himself in. The sequence of the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was spectacular! Perhaps if they extended it and made it a more major part of the film it would have been more worthy. Another major flaw with this movie is that after the attack sequence the movie dragged on for another hour trying to give an epilogue which was totally irrelevant.<br/><br/>I reckon if these were taken aboard, then Pearl Harbor would have been a much better movie and perhaps would not have flopped at the box office."
"SilentJerry","2","16","29","26 August 2006"," That was terrible.
","A few years ago, I sat down and watched the first half of the movie, today I watched the second half and sadly it's still really bad. With the exception of the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself, this movie is hardly exciting or interesting. A few years before this movie came out, Michael Bay had just assaulted the American people with Armageddon which had insulted anyone with any scientific knowledge at all. Then came Pearl Harbor which insulted everyone who knows anything about US History at all.<br/><br/>I won't get in to the fact that Roosevelt had browbeat the Japanese into striking first, or that the government knew the Pearl Harbor attacks were coming, or the fact that the Doolittle raid was a propaganda move, or the fact that fighter pilots would never become bomber pilots or you get the idea. Everything this movie knew about history it learned in Kindergarten. The writer/director were too afraid to do anything remotely challenging, write a decent screenplay, end with the battle of Pearl Harbor (Oh gee, did we win WW2?) and decided to throw in an American victory to make it more pleasant for the average American movie goer.<br/><br/>Thankfully this movie was a dud and no more long, boring war/romance movies have been made. United 93 and World Trade Center have proved that Hollywood can make good movies about tragic events. If they cut this movie down just to the bombing and a few tense hours leading up to the bombing, it had the potential to be exciting. Instead, Bay threw in a herd of uninteresting and clichéd characters, nearly an hour of build up, an idiotic last hour where they just had to show the Americans win, and finally where one of the heroes die and his offspring gets to ride a plane a few years later (I'm sure that said offspring likely died in Vietnam anyways...)<br/><br/>What next? Is Bay/Bruckheimer gonna make a movie where they show the Gulf of Tonkin (which is a big of a lie as Pearl Harbor) and then show the Americans winning the war in Vietnam?"

","Pearl Harbor<br/><br/> Pearl Harbor is Hollywood at its most ambitious. From glossy photography, beautiful wide-angle shots, eye-widening special effects and exceptionally good-looking people playing the lead characters, it offers a lot of eye candy to those who are willing to sit through the long movie. In fact, it reminds me of a big cake with a recipe in which the makers tried to include all the tried-and-true ingredients of a commercially successful movie: visual treats, humor, drama, action and a story involving love, passion, friendship, vengeance and a good dose of patriotism. It almost seems as if director Michael Bay wanted to challenge the audience with all these elements to be entertained by a movie twice the length of a typical feature without lapsing into boredom.  If that was the challenge then he succeeded: it was entertaining, it really did not feel like three hours, and I, at least, did not feel bored at any time during the movie.<br/><br/>My impression is that most of the negative reviews are critical of the movie because they are looking for something that went beyond its intentions. Definitely, A Saving Private Ryan this movie ain't. But I believe that one should evaluate a movie, as one would any other work of art, for what it is and not for what it should be. Take the love story, for example. It has been criticized by many as being extraneous. It is true that a story about philosophical and ethical questions raised by war (and treated in Ryan) would have been more fitting in the context.  As it stands, the life-changing attack could have been replaced by a natural disaster without losing much from the gist of the story. But what would a quintessential great Hollywood production be without a love story?  Besides, the beauty of Kate Beckinsale adds to the visual aesthetics. Another possible charge against the movie might be that it tends to glamorize war. That may be true, but again, this movie is not meant to be a propaganda call for arms, but just a few hours of good entertainment. I must admit, though, that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the WTC, the reply of William Baldwin's character to a question-that if he ran out of plane fuel, he would `find the sweetest military target and try to kill as many Japanese as possible'- sent chills down my spine because it illustrated how righteous the terrorists must have felt. I suppose the recent events highlight the movie's rudimentary treatment of the philosophical issues and conflicts associated with war, especially if one considers the obvious similarities.<br/><br/> In the end, if you eat this cake to be enlightened by some new insights, you will be disappointed. If you eat it, however, to enjoy it for its own sake, you will."

","Most war films delight in playing the victim card. Typically you're coerced into siding with a small group of beleaguered common folk who are forced by an unjust History into a position in which they must valiantly fight back against overwhelming and superior odds. In each case victimhood is conjured up and used as a ploy to justify victimisation. Godard called this Hollywood's ""stage wagon"" mentality, referring to old westerns which typically pitted outnumbered gangs of cowboys against hordes of Indians.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbour"" spends its first hour on a corny love triangle. Its second hour is essentially an extended action sequence in which the Japanese Navy decimates Pearl Harbour and interrupts the gooey domestic normalcy of the first hour. Its third hour, of course, is an extended action sequence in which Americans bomb the hell out of Japan. It's WWII as ""Rocky III""; a poor, innocent, out-of-shape America has to get its butt kicked before it gets ""the eye of the tiger"" back. <br/><br/>A big-budget cartoon - Spielberg and Cameron are the chief influences - the film bolsters all the usual WW2 myths. That Axis imperialism was a reaction to Allied imperialism is ignored. That much money was coming to Germany from ""isolationist"" countries is similarly omitted. As is the fact that wealthy factions in the US and UK supported Hitler up until 1938, as he was merrily crushing unions, anti-capitalists and communists. That many ""allies"" supported Hitler's taking ""back"" of Rhineland, Saarland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, West Prussia and Danzig is also whitewashed. Nevermind the fact that German's later expansions were formally no different to other Empires at the time. Indeed, as the US genocidally spread like a virus throughout the Caribbean, Philippines and Latin America, an equally psychotic Great Britain was ravaging India, the Middle East and Africa. Hitler himself justified his actions by likening Germany's land-grabs to Britain's slave trade. Hitler's allegiances to economist Gottfried Feder, and his defaulting on loans to outside banking cartels, proved even more irksome for the status quo. Cue Western blockades, some implemented as early as 1933. <br/><br/>Meanwhile the US was busy sucking up to buddies China and Russia, the former carved up by the UK, US and France, who kept it locked in exploitative trade deals which explicitly excluded Japan. Japan – a once isolationist country forcibly opened up by US gunboats in the 1850s for ""market reforms"", thereby setting it upon a path of Imperialism - thus moved into Manchuria, where it replaced dynastic dictators whom the Chinese themselves hated. Russia, China and the US freaked out. Wanting to expand into South East Asia and the Philippines, and wanting to protect Chinese assets and cosy up to Russia, the US began covertly and overtly attacking Japan. They put in place a series of embargoes, oil blockades, asset freezes and banking lock-downs, slowly strangling the country. Spooked, Japan began to back down. It offered to apply in China the principle of non-discriminatory trade relations on the condition that the Americans did the same in their own ""acquired"" territories in Latin America. The US told them to shut the hell up. The common view is that America then suffered an unprovoked attack at Pearl Harbour, but few officials believed this at the time. ""America forced the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a travesty on history to say that America-was forced into war,"" Captain Oliver Lyttelton would say. And Captain Russell Grenfell: ""It is beyond doubt that Roosevelt wanted to get his country into the war, but for political reasons was most anxious to insure that the first act of hostility came from the other side; for which reason he caused increasing pressure to be put on the Japanese, to a point that no self-respecting nation could endure without resort to arms."" Later the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal would come to the conclusion that the US provoked the war with Japan. <br/><br/>With the US and Japan now at war, Hitler declared war on the US. The US never intended to enter the European theatre outright, but Hitler was gambling that by declaring war, Japan would come to his aid and attack Russia with their Northern Forces. Japan didn't. They left Hitler hanging. So the US is dragged into Europe, Russia crushes Germany, China pushes Japan back and the US inadvertently comes out on top, holding this position for roughly a century. <br/><br/>So essentially you have one huge, childish scuffle over colonies, minerals and cash. Germany and Japan didn't have colonies and wanted some, the US, England and France had many and wanted to keep them. No sooner was the war over, did the West turn their backs on once-allies China and Russia. The conquered Japan and Germany were themselves brought into the economic circles of the West and quickly turned against the sequestered Russians and Chinese.<br/><br/>Forget good/bad binaries. Everyone was the ""bad guy"", everyone fought for old fashioned bounty, on all sides it was the poor who suffered at the expense of the rich, it was the big nations who indebted and bullied the small into violence, nobody had a clue what was going on, everyone read the future outcomes of their own actions incorrectly (the US expected to have big post war economic interests/assets in China; China shut them off) and every action sprung a myriad of unforeseen reactions. <br/><br/>Some lessons learnt: disrespecting the wants/needs of other nations (gains) leads to violent blow-back (losses), egos and pride bulldoze all attempts at cooperation/conversation, what we mistake as progress is but the accumulation of time, death and thought (progress is itself always loss, comes at a price), and the best way to topple a dictator is to either do nothing or to act wholly altruistically. WW2 is generally portrayed an an anomaly of a war, different to say, Vietnam and Iraq, but was largely the same thing.<br/><br/>2/10 - Worth no viewings."

","One of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Pearl Harbor had the opportunity to be an epic. But it failed miserably. The best description I can come up with for it is an unintentionally comedic, horribly Americanized, Titanic-meets-Top Gun.<br/><br/>How exactly did this movie go wrong? Firstly, if you're looking for something historically accurate, don't bother. I'm not quite sure which war this movie was supposedly taking place during, because it sure wasn't World War II. Of course, if you like laughing at how idiotic Americans are, you have plenty of opportunities, for example, when one of the characters shouts ""I think World War II just started"" - in 1941.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't half bad, but unfortunately the actors had very little to work with. The love story, which takes up most of the movie, had a plot more ludicrous than any bad daytime soap opera. The basic premise is a love triangle set against the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Ben Affleck plays Rafe, an American pilot who signs up for the Eagle Squadron and goes to Britain to fight, leaving behind Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), his one true love. The plot is complicated when Danny (Josh Hartnett), his best friend from childhood, falls in love with Evelyn. Now, normally, I hate predictable movies, but this one would have been better off staying the course. Instead, its plot twists and and turns are so ridiculous, they turn the love story into a comedy routine.<br/><br/>Not that this movie was all bad. It had its good points. The fight scenes in the planes, though short, were fun, as was seeing lots of ships get blown up. The special effects were definitely the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor had far too little excitement and far too much stupidity. At over three hours, it was also far too long, especially considering how the entire battle at Pearl Harbor only lasted two hours in reality. It's really too bad, because with a cast including Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and the surprisingly talented Josh Hartnett, and one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century for material, it really should have been much better."

","Upon hearing that we would be viewing this movie in our history class, I winced at the idea because I had not heard good things about the movie. However, I was one of those people who decided to try new things, and since we were watching it for history class, I figured it might have some promise. We watched the movie, and after only a few minutes of hearing Ben Affleck's and Josh Hartnet's dialogue, I felt ready to run out of the classroom. Yet I was only to discover that what began as a corny action movie later revealed itself to be an offensive masterpiece.<br/><br/>The historical accuracies in this movie are slim to none. Michael Bay even uses freighters and equipment (targeted by the depicted villainous Japanese soldiers) that would not be developed for many years to come. The story's sappy romance and incredibly false acting (save for a much appreciated Cameo of Cuba Gooding Jr.) stands out as a complete annoyance in the movie, yet serves to take away the equally idiotic video-game-like plane fights.<br/><br/>But what really is most unsettling is the overall mood of the film: it's an action-filled, romantic, heroic buddy movie. And it's also World War II. This film gives memories to the old John Wayne war movies and it's campy, almost unrealistic attitude with almost a bit of nostalgia, until you realize that this was made in 2001, a time when most people have realized that the subject of war, especially World War II, is not to be fitting for an entertaining popcorn movie. That in itself leaves the viewing standpoint completely uncomfortable, and almost wondering, with lines such as ""I think World War II just started!"", if the ignorance shown in this movie could possibly be real. The movie is false, campy, sappy, and in many views offensive to veterans who have experienced war firsthand. In addition, the film shows almost no respect to those who died in Pearl Harbor by showing overly dramatic death sequences quickly cut to make room for more time of Ben Affleck with his hair blowing in the wind.<br/><br/>Overall, a complete lack of focus on a film as a whole and disregard for important events to make room for intense action sequences. A film hopefully forgotten."

Rafe 'dies' and Evelyn moves on which you are supposed to do... but she moves on together with Rafes best friend Danny. And after a very romantic night she gets pregnant. Shortly after, while expecting Dannys baby, Rafe returns, as it turns out he didn't die. And there is Evelyn standing in front of a big choice. Should she go back to Rafe, her first choice of man, the one she loved first. That would be the logical way to do it, because at least i thought it sucked when he 'died', i guessed he'd come back but not that she would go get pregnant first. The other choice is to go to Danny which she was going to have a baby with. She chose the second choice. Still what kept the first so great Rafe alive was the thought of sweet Evelyn. OK, i accepted it after a while... but when Danny gets himself killed in the war she goes back to Rafe, notice th same Rafe she chose away and lets him be daddy instead. <br/><br/>Since this was a history film i already knew about the war so i focused on this love story, which totally sucked.

","This honestly has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Never mind the plagiarism of other, better movies; the empty-headed and monumentally annoying love story; the pathetic so-called ""acting"" (only Dan Aykroyd and Tom Sizemore make any sort of impact); the banal script and laughable dialogue; the cheesy music and rock video editing; or the gee-whizz attitude to violence and explosions. What really galls about this turkey is its offensiveness: surely none of the poor souls who perished at Pearl Harbor behaved as stupidly as portrayed here! <br/><br/>One scene sums up Jerry Bruckheimer, Randall Wallace, and Michael Bay's attitude in making this film. While military personnel and civilians are bombed and blasted, raked with gunfire, drowned and crushed in a sickeningly titillating way (whoever described this as war as pornography was spot on!), the filmmakers are more concerned with the plight of a small dog whose owner has just been shot. When the pooch is rescued, the obvious intent was for a heartwarming moment; but this was the moment at which this trash went from being extraordinarily dumb to being extraordinarily infuriating. Thousands of people dying, but we are expected to relate to a bloody dog!!!<br/><br/>Who are these people? I agree that there is a place for mindless action movies and a comic book approach to violence. But when you impose such an approach on what should have been a human (not to mention, humane) drama, evoking the terror of war and remembering, respectfully, the memory of those who sacrificed everything in one of the great turning points of 20th century history, I'm afraid that you have lost the plot in a big, big way.<br/><br/>The shame of it is that, given the budget and the resources at their disposal, Bruckheimer and co have missed a golden opportunity to present a really memorable, classic, and respectful motion picture. But, as they count their earnings, I am more than confident that making such a movie was the last thing they ever intended.<br/><br/>Cynical, mawkish, cliched rubbish of the highest order, this is the cinematic equivalent of defacing a war memorial."

","Michael Bay hit an all-time low here, honestly. Usually I can let go a lot of his ridiculous and overdone humor and action sequences due to the fact the stories he tell are of course fictional and hold no real relevance to mankind other than entertainment. But this, especially in the light of the much more realistic""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", had already been released, is just plain offensive. Bay delivers a story that is just overloaded with plot holes and historical inaccuracies. It literally feels like a slap to the face; as if Bay was really in such a rush to honor the victims of Pearl Harbor that the studio and crew didn't even check if the damn screenplay for the many errors within it all.<br/><br/>Not to mention the love story is poorly executed and overly drawn out. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character was the only historically relevant in the whole film, and yet his role is more of an after thought. Then he treats us to his usual explosion filled action sequences, which were hardly the point of any war film ever made, so to make special effects the focal point of a war movie instead of the characters and atmosphere was just plain stupid.

","Sitting through 2 and 1/2 hours of bad acting and paper thin storylines was almost worth it for the chance to watch crap blow up for a half hour. Than I realized it wasnt. I guess it was just the excitment of not having to watch Josh Hartnett mug and mumble through his scenes or watch Ben Afflek try desperatley to convince the camera that he's actually not Ben Afflek.<br/><br/>
Days of our Lives has nothing on Pearl Harbor! Its got the thinnest story, the most handsome fella's, the prettiest gal's and the least amount of talent you'll see anywhere. Theres not much to say about the script, mainly because theres not much of one to comment on. Its over dramatic, predictable and pointless. It couldve been written around any event in time but in order to draw some emotion from the crowd they opted to backdrop the bombing of Pearl Harbor behind this high octane emotional rollercoaster love triangle. Instead of making the audience feel what it was like to live through that time, Pearl Harbor actually has little to do with Pearl Harbor. Obviously they just wanted to blow millions of dollars for a special effects rendition of the infamous bombing, and wrote a quickie script around it.<br/><br/>Now the acting. Even though it seems to defy the laws of the universe, they actually found an actor with less talent than Ben Affleck. Josh Hartnet. For a while I wondered why they didnt subtitle his lines. I found out later its because hes actually speaking English. Most of my time was spent trying to interperet his squints and facial scrunches. Ben Affleck as usual plays Ben Afflek playing Ben Afflek playing some good looking guy doing some stuff. at least this is how I imagine him aproaching each role<br/><br/>considering every line he's ever uttered is completley devoid of any emotion or thought what so ever. For example; in Boiler Room, his line was ""Im a millionaire, it sounds wierd to say it, but im a F*ing millionaire"" Even though Ben Afflek is in real life a millionaire, he still delivers the line with no emotional involment. The rest of the cast which consists af many Hollywood A-list cameos arent there for you to enjoy. There only purpose is to bring the attention back to Ben and Josh after a brief history lesson.<br/><br/>
Any highschool student couldve recounted the events of Pearl Harbor more acuratley than Joel Shumaker and his money hungry cronnies. And by the way, what kids play baseball games at 7:00am on Sunday morning? I guess Im old-fashioned, but you can give me my history straight. This brand new version of history, although very poilitically correct, just doesnt do it for me. And if there going to dumb it down, at least make it good."

My rating: Shoot everybody who was involved in the making of this movie."
"filmismagic","3","14","26","28 January 2008"," Well Worth It's Rating . . .
","I have seen war movies of poor quality like Battle Of the Bulge etc. However, they were ten times better than this one. It's been a few years since I have seen this movie, but I have not forgotten much. Of course, there is great special effects in the battle sequences and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, especially the Japanese-themed music, but that is not enough to redeem this film from the bad points.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: Not too impressed. The camera angles were not so bad and it would look like it is well-filmed, but there were times when the camera just shook way to much and was not in the right position (I will talk about that later). It looked like the scenes were filmed in one take. It looked as though the director was not doing much directing at all. It seemed liked he told the actor/actress to do or say something but not how to, which might be one reason for the horrible acting.<br/><br/>CAST/ACTING: Also pretty bad. Why was Ben Affleck chosen for the main role? In my experience he showed one of the worst performances I have ever seen! He looked like a puppet being pulled by strings. He should have won his Razzie Award nomination for worst actor! As for Kate Beckinsale, she was not a bad choice, but mainly because of her good looks. Her acting was okay but would not win an Oscar.<br/><br/>SCREEN WRITING: Quite bad. Actually the emotion and settings would make this script closer to average, but thanks to the unbearably simple dialogue and historical inaccuracy and pointless love triangle, it makes this screenplay much below average. I understand that romance was put to reveal an anti war-like message, but that is not powerful enough. It is just so weakly portrayed. And war was not just about leaving your loved ones, but also about children losing their father and ladies losing their boyfriend/husband. They insulted that truthful reality by making Americans look invincible in the second half. I say that if Randall Wallace included something more realistic, and the second half of the movie was edited out (when the Japanese are bombed) he might be able to redeem this film, but sadly he didn't. Another problem is that you don't even care about the characters because they don't seem important. Josh Hartnet's character was decent, but Ben Affleck's character was wooden. The movie is simple American propaganda. It makes them look like invincible heroes and Pearl Harbour their victory. 4 planes shot down expertly by 2 American pilots and them making evasive manoeuvres to clash the Japanese planes. That is not how the battle went. This is not a documentary, but to make a good script about history, you need to stay true to the facts. This is why we should not respect Hollywood films like this for their style.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY/CAMERAS: I did not last see it at my house so I don't know if the TV had wide-screen, but if it did cameras were not well-positioned. The angles were fine, but in the beginning when Capt. Rafe McCawley reports to his commander at the airfield the camera is aiming at him from his front-right and cutting almost half of his face. Who in the world could think of doing that. Also, earlier on when the kid at the field runs and follows his dad. The crane shot for only one second has the kid in view at the left then it just shows the field itself for a few seconds more. Seeing all this it probably was the TV, but regardless of that Michael Bay should have studied these scenes better and try to make the camera shoot at the right position.<br/><br/>I won't say any more because all I wanted to list were the really bad points. So trust me, there are much better films worth 3 hours of your life which are a little bit less than 5.3 stars. Not to mention even better ones. So I have one thing to say . . . this movie is well worth it's rating, if not lower."
"dutch_guy","1","14","26","18 September 2004"," This rates as one of the worst of all time
","Here is the formula - take a bunch of pretty, young stars, cast them in a bizarre love and uninteresting love triangle and throw in a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with some cool special effects. First of all, the actors don't seem to even care about their lines or show any real emotion. The screenplay dialog doesn't help, hurts the character interpretation, and is at times painful. The director must have been out for a coffee break for half of the film. I would definitely pass on this film even if someone paid me to see it.<br/><br/>The movie is about an hour too long. It is extremely predictable in it's love story which is almost extraneous to the point of the story. Randall Wallace should stick with TV writing before getting into Hollywood war movie making. Don't even compare this to Tora! Tora! Tora! or the Longest Day. They just don't make them like those anymore."

","My suggestion: don't bother with this one. While it is beautifully shot, with some good acting (most notably Jon Voight as FDR), it is way too ""Hollywood,"" and too long. I don't understand why the makers would feel anything more than the attack on Pearl Harbor wouldn't be spectacular enough to cover in a film. Why go to the Dolittle raid too? Revenge, I suppose. Get back at those Japs! But we all know what happened with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that was way more of a spectacular revenge - - and decisive to the outcome of the war as well as consequential to mankind -- than Dolittle was. Also, what is with the 3 hour running time? I've always felt if a movie needs to run 3 hours, it had better have something good to say. This script just didn't have enough gas to propel its 3 hour span, even with the love story intertwined.<br/><br/>Also, for me, a lot of the fighter scenes looked too ""Star War-ish"" with the CGs, although using real restored fighters exclusively is understandably cost-prohibitive for even a large-budget Hollywood flick.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, check out ""Tora Tora Tora.""

Why does this no talent hack continue to get work? I'll tell you why, because he has a sure fire formula working for him. He signs on to big budget flicks loaded with oodles of special effects and he knows all he has to do is launch all of the effects on the screen and people will pay big bucks to see it. Never mind the fact that every other element he is in charge of is going to suffer irrevocably. The Michael Bay motto seems to be, Bells and whistles to the point of irritation. I have never seen a movie of his yet where you couldn't stop groaning at the tired clichés, shotgun editing, and junior high dialouge.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor, I think, Is a special turd in the Michael Bay kitty litter box. Not only is it too long, its too trite, too hokey, too dull and too saturated with missteps that only a joke of a director like MB can perpetrate. Mark my words, If they keep giving MB more directing jobs he will soon be on the fast track to beating out legendary schlock director ""Ed Wood"" for the title of ""Worst Director of all Time""."

","Last year When we went to Bali. We brought lots of DVD's home of course.One of them was ""Pearl Harbor"". I heard about it and I read about how much it was as a blockbuster.<br/><br/>My mum liked it. She loves her chic flicks. My dad absolutely hated it and he is a WWII lover. He researches and watches everything about it.<br/><br/>War movies liked to have actual accuracy of when the war happened. My father knows all the info in the movie was wrong. That was why he hated it so much. (along with soap oprah material) I was only 9 when it was first released. So of course I could not watch it then.<br/><br/>As for me I love a bit of romance. I loved Titanic and Japanese anime oriented romances.<br/><br/>Well I watched most of that I could from it. I found it in bits that were so boring. Kate Bekinsale was pretty but.........did it have to be a love Triangle. Really? I watched ""Home and Away"" (Australian Soap Oprah) with the same basic plot line. Except no war was involved.<br/><br/>Titanic captured my heart in the story line. It fitted perfectly with the sinking. Cause they both were in it ""Pearl Harbor"" didn't.... I found some bits sweet and endearing. But that was before Rafe died. Soon after it was a night fight and best friends next morning. I didn't like the love triangle that much....then she got pregnant with Danny's baby.....and this has to do with the war how? Coober Gooding Jnr did good in it. I wanted to see more of him.<br/><br/>I liked the score of the movie. Even though it was cheesy. but I still liked it. Hans Zimmer is a great composer.<br/><br/>I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"" that was an alright movie not my cup of tea. Trying to show as much realism of the war as possible without fully going over the top. To defeat the ""Evil"" enemies. Thats what I liked about it. That movie made you feel sorry for all the men and women who took part during the war.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" went WAY! over the top of defeating the evil people. Two model boys in planes. Flying around with no tomorrow. Even though everyone else who tries to take off dies. Defeating every single jap plane that they could come across. LIKE SUPERMAN! It made the Japanese look a bit stupid...... even though in real life during ""Pearl Harbor"" the Japanese really hurt the Americans bad on that fateful day......<br/><br/>But I had to admit before that part when the Japanese began to bomb. ""Pearl Harbor"" I think was really awesome. great graphics 40 mins of bombing! Just got ruined with ""True American Patrionism"". The Americans can win the war single handed by two men!!!!! I did not like American patrionism in this movie one bit! Sure it could show the American flag every now and then. But jeez......<br/><br/>I'm from Australia. Americans might like a lot of patrionism. But I sure don't like to be reminded that America is the most powerful country every 5 mins. Cause I don't care!!!!!!! Dr Dolittle's raid. I barely remember any of that. But I wasn't sad in the end......<br/><br/>My dad offers people to watch Tora! Tora! Tora! If you want a good more accurate movie about ""Pearl harbor""<br/><br/>overall 3/10"

The love story and how it ended made me want to throw up with disgust and boredom.

"hauntnut","Null","2","2","22 June 2001"," Good action bogged down by a sappy, banal love story.
","Upon exiting the theater after ""Pearl Harbor,"" I was set upon by a man who referred to the American officials portrayed in the film as ""bumbling idiots."" It's a good thing he said ""Americans,"" because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.<br/><br/>Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets.<br/><br/>
To make a long and tedious story short, Rafe meets Evelyn, falls in love with her, and is called away to duty in Britain. Circumstances intervene, and Rafe returns to find that Danny and Evelyn are now lovers, casting the whole relationship into strife just in time for the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese air forces.<br/><br/>The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent (the title, duh!). We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.<br/><br/>
But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present ""Titanic"" machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that ""Titanic"" was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.<br/><br/>
For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's too<br/><br/>many romance clichés which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.<br/><br/>
And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy. It makes Rafe and Danny out to be heroes known among all, hoping to instill some air of patriotism alongside flag wavers and cheers from the men in the water as they successfully down two Japanese fighter planes. Soon after, they must leave on a mission to Tokyo, where they set out to perform a counterstrike against the Japanese. At one point, one of the characters (I think it was Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin), makes the statement that the mission is ""to avenge Pearl Harbor."" Obviously an attempt to connect this action with the previous sequences, but no such luck. It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.<br/><br/>In summation, ""Pearl Harbor"" does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie: is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent ""Braveheart?"" Do the filmmakers think that by ignoring the actual focus of the story, it will become more involving? I have one thing to say about the movie: the trailer is better."

You find the actor Ben Affleck in both movies but he's better in ""Pearl Harbor"" than in ""Armageddon"" because he manages to avoid third-rate acting.<br/><br/> It isn't sufficient enough to make ""Pearl Harbor"" one of the finest movies made in 2001 because Michael Bay's movie contains a quite important number of faults. Michael Bay wanted obviously to give to his movie a Hollywood extent and as a consequence it makes the film uninteresting. Moreover this is an unoriginal film because it borrows several sequences or ideas from other movies. For example, as it was the case with ""Titanic"" (1997), Bay chose to shoot the Pearl Harbor tragedy through the love affair between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett but this couple can't make the couple DiCaprio-Winslet forget. In short, this device appears colorless.<br/><br/>But the Hollywood side of the movie can be seen at the special effects level. The action sequences are certainly impressive but they are crushed by special effects (when Affleck and Hartnett pilot fighter planes against Japanese pilots, you feel that you are inside a video game!).<br/><br/>From a historical point of view, the movie only suggests an academic vision of the Pearl Harbor tragedy and we learn nothing new.<br/><br/>Nevertheless when the film focuses on the very moving hospital sequences, Michael Bay knows how to create emotion.<br/><br/>At the end, the whole gives a heterogeneous, shaky and conventional movie."
"Antagonisten","3","10","18","28 February 2005"," Sleep-inducing
","It seems that this movie is one of the most hated movies ever made (at least reading comments here on IMDb and also listening to people commenting on it elsewhere). But then there's the other crowd who truly enjoyed it and thought it was among the best war epics ever. Myself, i must say that i have seldom seen a movie that felt so much like an endurance test. I was chewing on my seat just to have something to do while sitting in the theater.<br/><br/>The problems with this movie are numerous and of catastrophic proportions. While a lot could be said about the atrocious acting and overly pompous style of the movie, that is not the main flaw. Rather the script is the main offender. Seeing that writer Randall Wallace has also written such epic manure as ""We were soldiers"" and ""The man in the iron mask"" comes as no real surprise. The scriptwriting here is terrible, and it's completely insane that the demands for the script were not higher on a movie budgeted at over 135 million dollars. Basically this is a script and story worthy of a porn movie. It's one hour build-up, one hour massacre and one hour slowdown in the end. Unbearably boring is the key-word for all three sequences.<br/><br/>Because the main problem with this movie is not the keen patriotism, the laughable ""acting"" from Ben Affleck or the sappy love themes. No it's the combination of all these. It's not awful like ""We were soldiers"", nor is it crap in a ""bad but entertaining"" way. Rather it's just an insufferable bore. The only part of the movie where i was not half-unconscious was during the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. In that sequence one could easily see where the 135 million dollars went...<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me. But still i personally feel that demands should be a little higher on a movie that cost as much as this one. The least i should be able to demand is that i don't fall asleep in my chair! I rate this 3/10 with an extra point added because it can be used as a substitute for Valium."

","This movie is perfect. There's the action for the guys, the love story for the girls, the accurate historical facts for the teachers, and it educates all. It really opens your mind to what happened on December 7, 1941, and it really shows you new points of view. For example, the director and script writer gave the Japanese general a conscience, so that he doesn't seem like the ""evil tyrant"" that some text books classify him to be. The special effects and all of the war scenes are amazingly realistic. Some say that the movie is really ""sappy"" and ""predictable"" but even if that is true, the acting, directing, and music goes together so well that you can't help but get sucked into the movie and cry when they cry, pray when they pray, and laugh when they laugh.

"dazmayne","2","8","14","26 May 2008"," A revised history of WWII by Michael Bay
","1. The battle of Britain was fought in 1941 2. Apparently a pilot can convert from a p40 to a spitfire to a bomber without any training. 3. America is the only nation that suffered in WWII. 4. A pilot with no combat experience can easily shoot down seasoned and battle hardened German fighter pilots without so much as breaking a sweat. 5. In the battle of Britain sequence, British pilots used American tactics. 6. American pilots can desert their own air force to fly in another countries air force without a court marshal. 7. Navy nurses decided whether or not US army pilots were allowed to fly. 8. Bomber pilots can crash land and easily defeat war hardened and experienced Japanese infantry.<br/><br/>There are many more points, but I wont waste time by writing them down, overall, the worst distortion and alteration of history I have seen since U-571. Completely missing the point by including a silly and unbelievable love triangle, Bay goes further by taking the glory away from 2 real pilots (George Welch and Kenneth Taylor) who shot down 6 - 10 Japanese planes. As for the battle of Britain scenes, oh boy, I knew it would only be a matter of time before some director turned it into a joke, with British pilots kissing the ass of their American saviour, flying in a model of spitfire that wasn't available until later on in the war, and of course by that time the Battle of Britain was already fought and won.<br/><br/>Other than some attractive scenes of bombing, dog fighting and destruction in general, don't get the DVD, wait for when its on television, oh and only watch the middle."
"K_Todorov","2","8","14","6 April 2007"," A war movie without the war
","I didn't hate ""Pearl Harbor"" because it starred Ben Affleck, I didn't hate ""Pearl Harbor"" because it starred Josh Hartnet or because it was directed by Michael Bay or because it was historically inaccurate. I hated it because it was an insult to all these people who've fought and died during the war. Michael Bay had turned this historical event into a summer blockbuster, a date movie, a kiddie movie. It is so horribly dumbed-down that it no longer is a story about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor an event that plays crucial role on the outcome of the war no no. Bay's struck of genius comes stronger than a Hitchcockian plot-twist, he throws in a love story in it. Not confined with just that, he makes it the central aspect of the entire movie. So yeah I guess you could say the attack itself was an added ""bonus"" to the oh so thrilling romance that occupies two and a half hours of the whole thing.<br/><br/>How could you do this wrong? ""Saving Private Ryan""'s success opened many doorways and practically reinvented the war movie genre. Demonstrating proper use of effects that add to the overall experience. Spielberg had an eye for detail, he didn't want to discard anything he wanted to show war in it's pure form, in all it's chaos, all it's gory detail. And he did. An attack on the U.S. fleet by Japanese bombers could have been done in the same fashion and skill, but when you get a director whose previous work includes ""Bad Boys"" I guess you can't really expect that much. Indeed, the small fragment of this overlong, boring, melodramatic, sleep-inducing movie that actually deals with the attack is done completely wrong. Bay directs it like an extended action sequence from ""Bad Boys"", he doesn't take his time in showing the effects of war on people or showing the darker parts of the bombing (namely blood, gore) no, all he cares is getting that PG-13 rating so that more kiddies will go see it. The scene does not end with that oh no, no it ends when our great action heroes save the day by practically destroying half the Japanese air forces. A lot of explosions and people dying does not make a war, but what does Bay care about he is here to make money. No wonder war-vets left this thing half-way through, it is a disgrace.<br/><br/>But let's talk about acting. Yeah let's. Here we have an all star cast of overrated actors and yeah, it's bad real bad. Keanu Reeves would have done better if he had starred in all roles. The romance dialogue is a petty copy of ""Titanic""'s while the one concerning the war is filled with overly patriotic lines similar to something we might hear in a John Wayne featurette about the Vietnam war (and by that I do mean the likes of ""Green Berets""). Bay could have hired someone directly from the streets and it wouldn't have made a difference, hell he could have even saved some money. But I guess you need the big names to draw in the crowds and since Bay was looking to make lot's of cash he made the right choice.<br/><br/>The outcome of all that was no surprise. Money poured in like wild, all the kiddies were coming in to see their favorite actors, watch lots of stuff blow up and laugh at the silly dialogue. While the people to which this should have been dedicated to were left speechless. What better way to show your respect to those who fought for your country, than to turn the death of their comrades into entertainment.<br/><br/>Thank you Michael Bay for you have truly outdone yourself with this insulting movie."
"CSmowton","4","8","14","22 January 2003"," Visually impressive, but otherwise crap
","The good points of Pearl Harbour are fairly easy to summarise: 1) Damned impressive-looking and -sounding show. 2) Great recreation of Pearl Harbour itself.<br/><br/>However, the counter-arguments are a little more numerous. 1) The portrayal of the Japanese. They're cardboard cutout 'baddies'! I mean, we should be allowed to understand and empathise with the Japanese point of view (that America was heading slowly and inevitably for war under pressure from Western Europe, and that if they didn't strike first, America's Pacific Fleet would be a serious threat when the time came), but this was just pathetic.<br/><br/> 2) The portrayal of the whole of Western Europe. For 2 years worth of fighting, we get a few stereotypes thrown in and an odd look from Affleck. And the 'turning point of WW2'? A small bombing raid on Tokyo, included in the film only because the filmmakers thought audiences so shallow that they couldn't cope with a film that ended at its tragic climax, Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/> 3) The sickeningly predictable 'love story.' There wasn't anything in this that couldn't be seen coming several hours ago. The plane hits the sea - of course he's alive, it's only 30 minutes into the film! The two best friends go off to war - of course, one of them's going to die, so our hero can get back together with the stock love interest and live happily ever after. Yawn."

I didn't mind because the love story is better than normal, thanks to Kate Beckinsale, with that 1940s glamour look and dress. She never looked as pretty as this - just spectacular. Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck play likable-enough characters and the supporting cast is good. The film got panned because it didn't go into enough details about the war strategy but films that had done that in the past had wound up boring, so they made the right move here.<br/><br/>THE BAD - This is almost too much believe, except I saw it for my own eyes. The idiots who wrote this movie - Liberal history revisionists, I presume - make the attacking Japanese almost look like the good guys! This is either political correctness gone amok or downright anti-American propaganda that should have USA viewers upset, to say the least. Excuse me, but all eyewitness accounts (and common sense) do NOT have the Japanese pilots happily waving at kids just before dropping bombs. That, and almost making it sound like poor Japan had no choice in what it was doing, is an incredible insult to American viewers and those who lost their lives in that unprovoked incident.<br/><br/>OVERALL - The latter ruins making this glossy and interesting movie a ""keeper."""

Another thing that makes me angry about this film is that it is trying to make money off of one of the worst events in United States history.  In the movie soliders bodies are flung across the screen like extras in a Rambo film with absolutely no respect in the least bit.

"clemence-basset","5","5","8","12 May 2014"," ""Pearl Harbor"" or how to transform war into a romantic story
","Pearl Harbor, by Michael Bay, was a very awaited film thanks to its budget (about 140 000 000 $), to its cast -with a hot Ben Affelck (as Rafe McCawley ) and a oh-my-god-he-is-so-cute Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), without forgetting Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson)- and also thanks to its subject Indeed, narrating the attack on Pearl Harbor was an ambitious project. We were waiting for it, persuaded we would understand and learn more about this tragically famous event. Unfortunately the film failed its educative goal At least about the war, because it could be a sentimental education! And OK I'm a girl, I love romantic films, but I was pretty disappointed of considering Pearl Harbor as one of these romantic dramas. The film intended to be a kind of reconstitution of the attack, mixed with a fictional plot of course, but always with the idea of being accurate to History. Besides, the characters seem to be well-selected because it could have permitted to see the attack from different points of view. Furthermore, the film also shows the preparation of the attack on the Japanese side and what happened whilst in the American White House! But once again, what could have been a good point is not. It isn't enough exploited: the majority of the film is centered on a love triangle compound of Evelyn, Rafe and Danny. That is the major criticism The film lasts 3 hours and all the first third is about how Evelyn and Rafe met, who they are, how much they love each other... We forget we are in an action film relating the December 7th 1941 attack because everything is so devoted to emotion. But this is ""too much"" and when Rafe dies you think that it's over. Now, you're waiting for guns and planes and blood and death and action and diabolic Japanese laughs ! OK, I admit the last one is maybe exaggerated but you understand what I mean you blood-thirsty war-film-lover! However, you're desperately wrong Evelyn starts a love story with Danny to fill the void left by Rafe's death. But don't be so negative The second third is coming! And there, the attack begins. Let's start with something positive: the visual effects are good. The sounds of the battle burst in your ears, the torpedoes split the water At last some action! But unfortunately didn't you see the remake of Titanic coming?! Yes, I can almost see the deception in your eyes through my screen but don't worry, it remains an action scene. Besides I liked it even if I found it a bit too long and repetitive because the same shots come several times. What I can tell you is that the diversity of points of view saved me from boredom! I stop you: I'm not contradicting what I said earlier, I persist in saying that it wasn't enough exploited but the dynamic it brings at that moment is very appreciable. For example: the scenes in the hospital, with the nurses reflect the panic and the injuries. I felt involved in the action! A kind of ""truth"" exudes from the scene because we can see the fragility of the characters. However The attack is a bit ruined by the HEROISM of Rafe and Danny, I wrote it in capital letters because it becomes a burden; we're almost in the caricature! Don't you think that after ""saving"" the Harbor with two plays in a Hawaiian-printed shirt should our two heroes take break? Apparently they don't think so. I admit it would have been strange so I can understand that they hurry up to offer their help to the overcrowded hospital and maybe that they give their blood. BUT the close up on the coca-cola bottles filling with this blood is another time TOO MUCH! What a pity! It could have been a testimony of the ingenuity of the nurses in the panic but the way it is done turns it into a TV commercial! And it isn't over: after giving their blood, our two heroes go helping to save the marines stuck in the sinking ships. In all cases, Rafe and Danny show a real brotherhood during this part, they forget their romantic rivalry and all is well that ends well! Mouhaha ! I trolled you! Indeed, the film is not finished! What a pity Why did Michael Bay decide to relate Doolittle's Raid ?! We are out of the initial subject of the film, it doesn't bring anything but another long part and of course, it permits to reload again the love story. Another time, emotion and heroism are too present! Rafe and Danny go to sacrifice their life, again. And on top of that: Evelyn is pregnant and of course Danny is the father. So when Danny is about to die in China, Rafe tells him that he will be a father so he can't abandon his child. But he eventually dies (well, he had a piece of metal stuck in the neck!) and we witness to an umpteenth ""emotion scene"". Yeah!! HE IS DEAD! I was almost relieved because it announces the end of the film. You don't imagine how many times Danny and Rafe have been about to die, it becomes tedious! But here is the end: we find Evelyn and Rafe, in a field, with their child. And do you know what his name is? Danny! With this last tribute which is also an echo to the first scene of the film with little Rafe and Danny playing in the fields... I was surprised because I didn't find it heavy, so it ends well. <br/><br/>To conclude it was a long film, with some interesting parts but a lot of unnecessary scenes. I don't think I would advise you to see it However, I don't regret my choice because Pearl Harbor is in the trend of all other WW2 films, too much but cults. OK, it's over; you can breathe and leave your seat!"

About the only thing they managed to get right was that Pearl Harbor is in Hawaii.<br/><br/>Until the actual attack happens, nothing happens in this movie except some poorly scripted love story, but I'm sure they added that because Titanic proved that you can make money with a love story.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I recommend passing on this one.

"Movie_Talker","5","5","8","28 May 2008"," Reasons why this film got criticized so much.
","Why is this film so widely criticized? Here are the reasons I gathered. --May contain Spoilers --<br/><br/>1. Too typical ""Super Hero"" type American action movie for a movie that's supposed to be serious and realistic. Even the main characters are fictional characters, they shouldn't be almost invincible. Too many examples, here are some of them. Rake didn't die or seriously injured crashing his fighter into the English Channel. With Danny, in Pearl Harbor, sitting in the convertible car while rushing to the air field, was direct hit by gun fire from Zeros, yet both guys were unscratched. Even the 7.62mm gun from Zeros can penetrate that car, not to mention if they ever used the 20mm cannon. In the air field, while scores of armies and pilots were shot dead by Zero's strafing bullets, these two guys were completely unharmed so were some of their buddies. During the ""dog fight"", they were flying way too dangerously low to the ground and close to buildings. One shot showing the fighter going through a tight alley between two buildings diagonally, impossible! At the end of the dog fights, they must have been dead exhausted from all the running around and flying, yet they can still give blood, and later assist on rescue of the capsized ship. At the end of the Doolittle Raid, they're out of fuel and ditching their planes, while Rake's crash landing was sort of realistic, the way Danny's plane crashed and impacted on the ground would no doubt be killing all on board. From the remains of Danny's plane they're showing, there was no way that anyone in that plane can still be in one piece. Yet Gooz and Danny were still alive, aside from moderate injuries.<br/><br/>2. Too much historical, factual and technical errors, so much that you can call the producers insincere for making such a high budget film, which the primary purpose is to depict an important historical event, i.e. it's title ""Pearl Harbor"". The Goof list is a long one here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/goofs . The inconsistency of the positions of the battle ships during the battle scenes are completely unacceptable, since that's the most important aspect of the attack. It's an eye sore to see obviously modern Naval warships in the harbor, including 3 pack together side by side, being used as WWII warships that were blown up during the attack. If they're using CGI effects for recreating the battle ships, why not alter these to at least make them look more historically correct for WWII era type ships. Saving budget, no time, or just laziness? Same for the aircraft carriers, obviously are modern carriers, with the two rectangular protrusions in the front of fly deck, which are part of the steam catapult system for modern jet fighters! During the take off sequence of the Japanese planes from their carrier, a fly by showing an even more ridiculous sight -- an aircraft carrier having airplanes take off in the tail end of the ship (you can see the catapult in the front, while planes take off from the other end), completely in the wrong direction! No one, not even for WWII carriers, that you take off from the tail of the carrier, LOL! This is unforgivable mistake, but again it's so easy to correct with their CGI animation. I don't know if these lack of attentions to details are due to the fact that the director ""Michael Bay (himself were trying to) quit the movie project four times over various disputes"" (from IMDb Trivia of this film).<br/><br/>3. This movie is no doubt trying to pack too much stuffs into one film. Romantic stories, jam packed with historical facts / events / speeches, which some of these are just brief add-ins, like all the Japanese planning scenes are no more than 5 minutes combined. Jam packed with tons super action heroes stuffs, and of course all the CGI / explosives special effects, which is the main selling point of this movie. Pearl Harbor not only, but also battle of Britain, Doolittle's Raid, and a bit of close quarter combat with Japs. Too much! Sometimes, trying to do too much can be a very bad thing. And this movie shows.<br/><br/>It's OK to have some romance and hot chicks. It's OK to add a bit of fiction to a historical story. But it's not good if you're trying to do too much, with sacrifice to quality / details, and add in too much cheesy actions and dialogs. Especially, when you have a forerunner film like Tora Tora Tora to compare with, this film is simply inferior without compare.<br/><br/>This film do worth 5 points though, for its stunning color and picture quality, beautiful ladies, and at least for the effort of filming such complex project and coordinating those dangerous stunts. And this movie did provide additional critical details, that Tora Tora Tora had missed, such as the wooden piece that makes the torpedo able to be used in shallow water, and the Japanese spy activities in the area."

","Pearl Harbor. Another mindless, pointless, emotionless, senseless, & entertainment-less big-budget Hollywood Flop by Micheal Bay. This guy has tanked more movies then.....Ben Affleck, for chrissakes....Why Hollywood even promotes Micheal Bay's mega-flop movies is beyond me. All I gotta see is ""A Micheal Bay Film"", and I know I'm gonna see lousy acting, over the top special effects that insult your intelligence, slow motion crying scenes with crappy pop music background noise, and most of all, a lousy overall plot.....<br/><br/>Since this was based on Pearl Harbor, I had to see it for myself, simply out of respect for those who died there. This could've been a great movie, considering the $100+ million budget. The saddest part of this whole debacle was casting. They cast the two most monotone, emotionless, talentless jerk-offs in Hollywood as the leads, Ben Affleck & Josh Hartnett. These two guys make Frank Stallone and Jim Hanks look like Oscar worthy actors. Over the years Affleck has quickly built his own reputation for ruining big budget movies, and Hartnett is about as likable as a case of hemorrhoids. Unfortunately, these two idiots are in the movie too much for any other part of it to be remotely enjoyable.<br/><br/>The actual attack scene was very well shot, but the over the top flying sequences where Ben & Josh turn into the flying Mancini's and start pulling off barnstorming stunts with planes that simply weren't capable, is truly annoying. It's kind of like watching Armageddon, only in 1941. There's virtually nothing believable about the flying scenes. The best parts of the movie are the scenes that neither Josh Hartnett or Ben Affleck are in. The Japanese attack was very good. As well as the storyline of the Japanese command and the American high command. But, as stated, enter the Bobbsey twins, Ben & Josh, and every oz. of respect just flies out the window.<br/><br/>Overshadowed by Affleck & Hartnett's lame Bo & Luke Duke imitation, is Kate Beckinsale's performance. Too bad the casting director was on acid when he chose the male leads for this film....Alec Baldwin did a okay Jimmy Doolittle imitation, but once again, the attack on Tokyo with the B-25's storyline was ruined by the presence of Affleck & Hartnett.<br/><br/>A great start to this film would've been for Affleck & Hartnett to be failed out of flight school for being idiots, sent to the front line in Germany and killed, then get on with the rest of the movie without them in it....."

Titanic and Pearl Harbor do have a good bit in common. Based of of course a tragic true event in history, has a fictional romance between the two main characters, and they're both long!! But I love long movies so it's all good. I liked the romantic storyline Beckinsale had between her and Affleck and eventually Hartnett too. I thought all three of the main actors nailed their roles, especially Josh Hartnett, I very much liked him in this film, came a long way from Halloween H20 (another great film by the way). I also liked Alec Baldwin here too, good fit for him. The movie does a good job with handling both the romantic story lines and the with telling the true events of December 7th, 1941. The visuals were great! From the scenery to the very true to the period sets to the incredible effects during the actual attack scenes. Very well deserved academy award win there. And deserved nominations too, technically the movie looked wonderful. And I enjoyed the dialogue, story lines, and the cast. Don't listen to the critics on this one, give it a try.

","OK! Lets not beat around the bush, it's historically suspicious, badly written, badly cast and clearly an hour too long. A splendid ""support cast"" are wasted as Michael Bay and his production team think they can produce some sort of Titanic of the Skies like epic and fail in their objective. By the time of the brilliantly constructed assault by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, and ""it is"" exhilarating and edge of the seat heart pounding, you are left with the feeling that all the main characters in the piece are not really worth our emotional investment.<br/><br/>It's not an outright stinker, situations such as the nurses trying to cope in the hospital during the attack are poignant, and there's a jingoistic - cum - romantic fervour that screams out that the film wants to be genuine in making you feel, well, emotionally battered. However, given the budget and time you are asked to invest in the story, it's impossible not to feel cheated as the clock ticks past the three hour mark.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's unfair to use Titanic as a template for this type of epic? Especially since over the course of time many have come out of the woodwork to knock Titanic when previously there were nods in appreciation for it, all be it grudgingly. But Pearl Harbor just doesn't have enough about it to make it even a ""time waster"" recommendation, and this even allowing for some quality ""Bayhem"" action as the film rolls into its blunderbuss third quarter. 5/10"
"MacDuff7622","2","3","4","7 December 2011"," One of the most atrocious excuses for historical fiction in recent memory
","Stating that this film does not accurately depict history is unfair to the numerous historical fiction works that have preceded and followed it. Others have said it; I'll say it again: This film is an abuse of artistic license. Bay (in increasing order of egregiousness) colors planes inaccurately, misrepresents both Americans and Japanese as one-sided extras, throws in a romantic plot with no sympathetic characters, lifts a story from history without acknowledgment (more on this later) and dares to title this bloated mess ""Pearl Harbor.""<br/><br/>An elaboration on the third point, that of the plot: it is only 30% about Pearl Harbor, I would estimate. The female lead is wholly unsympathetic in her actions, the two male leads are nearly indistinguishable, and again, it has nothing to do with Pearl Harbor. The plot even continues after the attack to the Doolittle Raids...with a male lead taking part in those, too!<br/><br/>Now, the ""lifted story"": During the attack on Pearl Harbor, two American pilots, Kenneth M. Taylor and George Welch, managed to get airborne and between them downed six Japanese planes. This event is used in the film...except that the two valiant pilots were replaced by the aforementioned indistinguishable male leads, and the credits treat the event as fiction, with no acknowledgment to Taylor or Welch. Having an event fabricated for the film would have been less disrespectful than this.<br/><br/>The only relatively good parts of this film are the soundtrack (reminiscent of a Hans Zimmer score) and Jon Voight's performance as President Roosevelt. I can honestly say that he was the best performance in the film. These are the two elements that keep me from giving this a 1.<br/><br/>As I write this, it is the 70th anniversary of the attacks, and this abomination of a film is 10 years old. I found it appropriate to review this horrendous film on this day, as a kind of respect to those who were disrespected by this film."

After the attack is over, you can stop watching the movie.<br/><br/>I would have loved more detail with respect to the war INTEL on both sides, and perhaps more focus on the Japanese preparation of the attack.

","Before I watched this title, I already knew that it had been nominated, and narrowly lost to seven Razzies, and I felt slightly sorry for that fact, as I knew the money, time and energy that went into making it. <br/><br/>However, that was BEFORE I watched it. Post- Pearl Harbour, I'm shocked and mildly appalled that this dismal movie didn't win all of them. I have never sat through a film whereby ten minutes in, I was praying for the end. The only reason I didn't turn it off was the naive hope that it would pick up. It didn't.<br/><br/>The story is an American love triangle that gets interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1942, no I'm not going into more detail than that, as I purely cannot be bothered to waste my time on it. The worst and most sickening part of the movie for me, as an English girl, is the amount of victimisation that the Americans place upon themselves during this, and the blatant racism to the Japanese attack, weeping at how cruel, and how defenceless a military base was. I'm sorry Micheal Bay and crew, have you never heard of Hiroshima or Nagasaki? <br/><br/>The movie makes me almost feel physically sick at the amount of Hollywood that is just sprayed all over every frame, to the drippy acting and stupid love triangle, to the monologue at the end about how amazing America is, to the over the top and costly special effects. By all means, add the CG, after all, it would be hard to conceive the film without them, but at least support it with some form of storyline.<br/><br/>The only comfort for me is the knowledge that at least it was recognised by Hollywood and critics alike, that this movie is awful. I have nothing against America or the movie making system, but there is a way to make a film, without patronising everyone non- American and giving it a decent storyline. <br/><br/>Do what I didn't, and save yourself the near 3 hours of sitting through this rubbish, and put on something decent to the war genre."

There so many ways this story could be well told while sticking to the basic facts, there's no need to insult your audience's intelligence with garbage. There are so many things wrong other reviewers have already documented that I won't bother going over them again here.<br/><br/>If you're going to try to introduce a romantic sub plot (which this doesn't need), write a decent story/dialogue or don't bother, particularly if you're incapable of directing these kinds of scenes.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour was a pivotal event in world history, why not examine that aspect rather than following it up with a fictitious exercise in flag waving.

Only the well known events are explored, and even then in a shallow manner. The dialogue is predictable and recycled, as is the plot.

","""Pearl Harbor"" comes off like ""Titanic"" meets ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"". It's a three hour epic that has shades of those two movies, and in the end I was kind of disappointed. This film should have been better than it turned out to be. The big problem with this film is the director, Michael Bay. Bay directed this film pretty much the same way he directed his last film ""Armageddon"", sloppy and inconsistent. With the exception of the Pearl Harbor attack sequence which is excellently done, most of the scenes before that attack come off as corny and ridiculous. And the love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale doesn't even stand up to the love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in ""Titanic"". However, the big scene when Pearl Harbor comes under attack is a tour-de-force sequence. The special effects are superb and horrifying. But just think at how much better this film could have been. If Steven Spielberg or James Cameron had directed this, ""Pearl Harbor"" would have been a much better film. Spielberg and Cameron are directing geniuses compared to Bay, who foolishly tries to integrate comic relief in the first part of the film which comes off ineptly silly. But he's got the special effects in the right place. So all-in-all, I was kind of disappointed with ""Pearl Harbor"", the film that was predicted to be the biggest hit of summer 2001, but ended up being a slight box office disappointment (at the time of this review the movies' gross was at $197 million, still below $200 million).

And that is what I felt when I watched the movie for the first time. I really do not understand how some critics did not notice and did not respect and acknowledge that Michael Bay and his crew were able to bring us back to the early forties during war times. The behavior of the people, the clothes, the music, the band, the dressing, the make up of the women and the innocence of the (well, some) girls and boys looking for love are so impressive. I love the dialogs and the acting. The other main part of the film - what happened before, during and after the attack - is also very well shown, to my opinion. I love the talks of Alec Baldwin as Dollittle with the two main characters and the acting of Baldwin as well of Jon Voight as Roosevelt or Dan Arkroyd as intelligence officer.

The lives that were lost will forever be a sad reminder of the horrible nature of war. Unfortunately, this film is not a good portrait of the event. I feel bad for hating this film so deeply because the event that it is about is not one that should be screwed around with, and with such a tragic event you would hope that all the people who decide to do stories about it do it with care and respect for the event.<br/><br/>Basically what this is is a three way love triangle in which the event of Pearl Harbor just so happens to happen right in the background. And with such an inconvenient event taking place at such an inconvenient time, everybody in the film, for no reason at all, is forced to act stupid and pretend that they don't know what they are doing. The only bright spot of the entire film is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character, who is brave, smart, and very memorable. Unfortunately, he gets surprisingly little screen time.<br/><br/>When the event of Pearl Harbor actually occurs, we are left a little underwhelmed. The same things blow up repeatedly over and over with very little care for continuity and humanity, and more for just technical effect. Take for instance the sequence in which a bomb hits a boat and sinks it. The result involves a lot of people flying all over the place in all different directions and being blown to several pieces by different planes. The effect just comes off as gratuitous rather than sad. The CGI is terrible.<br/><br/>The director Michael Bay, has made some very enjoyable action films that I cared for hugely. The Rock was one of the most entertaining action films of the 90s, The Island was entertaining, Bad Boys was pretty good though the sequel was just gross, Armageddon was the closest a film has come to giving me a heart attack, and Transformers was alright.

This isn't like Independence Day, where none of it actually happened. People actually died. The movie is barely about Pearl Harbor, it's about acouple of people who weren't even terribly affected. Not to mention the rampant use of ethnic slurs being depicted as heroic(interesting also how black people are respected completely in the '40s). I recognize that that's how it happened, but don't make it look okay. I think we all learned after Saving Private Ryan that war is an awful ugly thing that ruins lives, and not fun thing to make simple enjoyable movies about. If you want a good war movie, watch The Bridge on the River Kwai, where war is simply two forces fighting eachother futily. Not this, where heroes blow away cardboard villains."

","I'm amazed that a film could be so simultaneously good and bad.  I gave it a 4 on the ol' IMDb vote-a-meter thing, but it would've been a 1 had the actual Pearl Harbor attack not been so well done.<br/><br/>Everyone's right -- the attack's great, everything else bites.  Overacted, manipulative filmmaking.<br/><br/>Although, once Alec Baldwin shows up in the last hour, the movie shifts into so-bad-it's-good territory.  Baldwin adopts a gruff voice that kept reminding me of Kurt Russell's Snake in ""Escape from LA"".  I kept waiting for Steve Buscemi to show up.<br/><br/>And oh, is there some magical dialogue.  Simply magical.  I just wish they would've used the phrase ""Jap suckers"" a little more.  You know, to really get the point across.<br/><br/>But the attack sequence is pretty breathtaking.  I found myself being quite moved at the harsh reality of it, and I gained even more respect for those who actually experienced Pearl Harbor.  Too bad they're all paid tribute by such a bad film.<br/><br/>I wish I would've taken everyone's advice with this DVD -- fast-forward to the Pearl Harbor attack, then ejected the disc as soon as that's over."
"kjnorman","4","4","6","26 December 2001"," Good action effects do not save this disaster of a film...
","I can honestly say that I can not remember the last time I saw a film this bad.<br/><br/>The film tries to do a Titanic by introducing the Pearl Harbor story through the eyes of two friends (Affleck and Hartnett) who go off to war and a love triangle with nurse (Beckinsale) they both meet.<br/><br/>The love story is predictable and corny.  Over half the film is devoted on the two friends and their relationships to the nurse trying to give a back story to the characters so that you will feel for them come the impending attack.  It does not work.  It is pure cheese and is boring as well.  I kept looking at my watch, wondering if anything would happen.  During the film you feel nothing for the characters, seeing them as nothing more than the ""pretty faces"" of Hollywood, rather than character actors who would add to a convincing (I wish it only was) storyline.  If this film wants to replicate Titanic, then it should sink with out a trace.....<br/><br/>The attack sequence on Pearl Harbor does liven things up a bit.  But being already over an hour and a half into the film, it seems somewhat late to pick up the tempo after so much boredom.<br/><br/>During the attack sequence there were many shots that reminded me of the open sequence of Saving Private Ryan and of the sinking in Titanic.  I guess that this is unavoidable given the nature of the film.  However in both cases I was given the impression that the film makers (Michael Bay) were coping the techniques, and were not improving on them.  Bay's typical use of slow motion in the effects was also overly used to the point of yawning with each successive slow shot.  This was a shame as the special effects were otherwise excellent and the only saving point of the film.<br/><br/>Finally the retaliatory strike on Tokyo was again a master of special effects, but this whole section of the movie seemed like another film and seemed out of place.  That as least was consistent with the poor pacing in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I rented the film on DVD.  I am glad that I only wasted 4 bucks.  The DVD transfer is very good and the sound (DTS) was masterfull.<br/><br/>
Score:<br/><br/>Sound (DTS): 10/10 Effects: 7/10 (let down by too much slowmo) Story: 1/10<br/><br/>Overall: 4/10"

","In all honesty, I am sure that this film might have been better on the big screen.  But I was greatly disappointed in the special effects of that actual attack.  I also felt the film was poorly edited with people and brief scenes that meant nothing to the total film tossed in as filler.  A movie this long did not need filler.<br/><br/>I also wonder why Hollywood has this need to take tragic events and turn them into love stories.  If it we my decisions, war movies would focus on the war.  Yes, there can be love and compassion, but a movie about Pearl Harbor should spend more time on the events, tragedies and heroism of Pearl Harbor, not about a love triangle.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an outstanding example of showing the emotions of war and evoking feelings whilst telling a war story.<br/><br/>Or, make the movie about a love triangle and find some minor battle to get in the way of the friendships without being the main event.  Then you have time to develop a relationship between the characters and allow the audience to feel something with them and for them.<br/><br/>This movie was ala ""Titanic"", in the attempt to mix love and tragedy, but ""Titanic"" was even better able to succeed at mixing the two than ""Pearl""."
"RestlessRust","3","4","6","27 December 2001"," Every American Should Be Insulted
","Let me get the good stuff out of the way first (since it will take the least amount of time).  The second act of ""Pearl Harbor"", in which the Japanese attack the Naval base, contains some of the most visually stunning and heart-breaking moments ever produced in a war film.<br/><br/>There is nothing else good about this movie.  That's not to say it's all bad, although a lot of it is--some of it actually rises to mediocrity.  But as an American, indeed as a human, I can't stand to think that the suffering and bravery of those lost in one of the most cowardly acts of war ever committed has been reduced to filler in a COMPLETELY predictable, sub-soap-opera love story.<br/><br/>From the opening moments of the film, we are introduced to the poor writing and bad acting that permeates the film as two young boys realize that violence strengthens friendship.  They grow up, join the military, fall in love with the same woman, fight each other, fight the Japanese, hate each other, and then move into a final third act that any ten-year-old could predict.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, this cartoon actually seems to believe it's being patriotic, that it is somehow paying tribute to those whom it claims to be about.  But this movie is just too stupid.  Think of it as an after-school special about WWII.  It's cheesy, it's uninspired, and it's insulting.  To think that after such excellent fictional war movies as ""Platoon"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" one of the most pivotal moments in American history ends up being made as a teen flick . . .<br/><br/>Now there's a tragedy."

","This was a horrible movie.  Once you got to the actual attack the special effects were impressive and entertaining but getting to that event was excruciating.  The sappy love story seemed written by pre-teens, Barbie goes to war.  The characters were one dimensional cut outs and every war movie cliche had to be included.  Events were staged for effect.  For example, in one scene in a factory the floors were wetted down to get that nice sheen for the camera.  Why would factory floors be flooded on purpose.  It made no sense besides getting a nice shot.  History was condensed and twisted to fit into quick sketches.  Anyone watching this film to gather some sense as to why this attack happened would be very disappointed.  The Japanese were portrayed as just the sneaky villains.  It is a wonder they didn't have mustaches to twirl.  The dialogue was stilted, the subtitles were barely legible, the music was maudlin, it was a bad, bad movie.  Don't waste your money."

","I found Pearl Harbor impossible to watch all the way through. I read a review of it which suggested that in terms of plot, it could have easily been a soap opera called ""The Pearl of the Harbor"" and I have to agree. Plus, I felt as if someone simply forgot that even megabucks productions need a little editing. Or in this case, a lot. It would have been much more tolerable at 100 minutes.<br/><br/>Editing or not, the script was the biggest weakness. No depth, no real character development, no decent dialog for much of the time, and no fun moments at all! Come on, even the Big Boat movie had some fun lines! Few, but still... Of course, I should have realized what I was in for considering Randall Wallace also wrote the ridiculously overrated Braveheart, which was an even bigger waste of time than PH. (Though high in terms of unintentional comedy, something Pearl does not have going for it.)<br/><br/>All actors - including those who can't act - are sadly wasted, ranging from Hartnett who's been better in every movie I've ever seen him in, to Affleck who's usually more entertaining, the underused Cuba Gooding Jr. (where have you gone, Rod Tidwell?) and on to the rest of them. Well, not everyone, actually, Alec Baldwin had an okay part, much better than what I've been seeing him in lately.<br/><br/>Rent something else.

","This film was absolutely phenomenal - I rated it a ten - but I would not call it a ""great movie.""  The reason I avoid that phrase is because of the connotation involved.  I will not see Pearl Harbor over and over again, I will not buy the soundtrack, and I will not put the poster on my wall. Here's why:<br/><br/>World War II is an incredibly serious subject, and I feared upon going into the movie that it would be treated lightly or with sensationalism. Fortunately, the makers of the movie were much more sensitive than that. What we saw was a very real story about very true people.  The mixing of fact and fiction was miraculously executed, and it stirred the deepest of emotions within me.<br/><br/>I gained new respect for my grandfather, who fought this war.  I realized as I watched that if it happened today, it would be my own brother battling to survive the fire and water of the Pacific.  I saw the film bear witness to children and the innocent and even the Japanese - for everyone who enters a war thinks God is on his side.  Most of all, I found myself thinking about my own inner self.  Had I been in that hospital alongside those nurses, would I have been able to save those lives?  Could I have made the tough decision?<br/><br/>Most of all, I left that theater knowing that we must do everything we can to stop this kind of war from ever happening again.  At one point, a Japanese soldier calls his commander ""brilliant.""  The commander's response? ""A brilliant man will find a way not to fight a war.""<br/><br/>Thank you, Michael Bay, for using the genre of film more responsibly than anyone I have ever seen.  Thank you, Randall Wallace, for writing a screenplay that shows respect for life instead of joy in fiery death.  And thank you to every name shown in those credits scrolled by - I stayed to read every last one.  Thank you for changing my heart."
"BStalker","10","15","33","1 June 2001"," Titanigeddon
","Before seeing this film it is important to note the following:<br/><br/>1. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 2. Directed by Michael Bay<br/><br/>Conclusion: Expect a high concept storyline, a script laden with testosterone, stunning visuals edited within an inch of their life, a rousing soundtrack (preferably by Hans Zimmer), a bit of humour, a bit of sadness, and a HUGE amount of ""God bless America"".<br/><br/>With this in mind, and with all expectations of a thought-provoking, 'sensible' film thrown away, Pearl Harbor is the ultimate summer popcorn movie.  Clearly, not everyone likes this type of film, and if your enjoyment of a film depends on the script and the quality of acting then this film could quite possibly make you ill.  I think it's reasonable to say that if you didn't like Armageddon, you'll hate this.  That's not to say that fans of Armageddon will necessarily like this as much.<br/><br/>In Armageddon, Bay had 2 1/2 hours to try and fit in as much action as possible and the tone was decidedly tongue in cheek.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay and Bruckheimer have tried to go more serious by following the Titanic-approach of a doomed love-story.  While this does produce a more emotional ending, it comes at the price of action and pacing.  The first hour deals mostly with romance and really could have been cut down a bit. We get some relief with the English/German dogfight sequences which are the first suggestion that we are going to witness something truly breathtaking later.  In fact, though this first hour and a half feel slow and tedious at times, this makes the Pearl Harbor attack all the more exciting by contrast.<br/><br/>The 35 minute attack is incredible with Bay's kinetic action style finally given a chance to shine.  There are similarities in technique to Saving Private Ryan but so what.  There are more than enough highly-original shots to compensate for the seen-it-before stuff.<br/><br/>After the attack, the film never slows down again, since it tones down the romantic plot and concentrates on the more traditional Bruckheimer ""let's kick the bad guys' asses"" plot.  Consequently, the film becomes decidedly more Armageddon-y with numerous rousing speeches, heroic slow-motions, tough training for a dangerous mission, and an upbeat ending tinged with tragedy before the credits role accompanied by a cheesy, charts-friendly, love anthem.<br/><br/>Ideally, the love story could have been shortened at the start because Bay is an action director and romance has never been a strong point in Bruckheimer films.  In fact, like the Rock and Armageddon, it is the male bonding that produces the more powerful emotional connection.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is at the top of its genre - big, loud and, assuming you can switch your brain off, very emotionally powerful.  It is not a Titanic, it is not a Saving Private Ryan and to compare it to such films is unfair to the intentions of the film-makers.  It is an action film and Michael Bay has yet again proved that in this field of visual entertainment, he is the best of the best."
"BillK-5","10","11","23","14 August 2005"," An excellent film if you're looking for a 1940's style WWII film
","It's fashionable to bash Pearl Harbor, but in reality it's an amazing piece of film-making and tells a story that sorely needs to be told.<br/><br/>So many people come to this film apparently expecting a modern, cynical take on the story - Quentin Tarentino's ""Pulp Harbor,"" if you will. This is NOT and is not MEANT to be that type of film.<br/><br/>Instead, the film reflects a 1940s sensibility, in which we see America attacked without warning, and what it takes to go from the nearly complete destruction of the Pacific Fleet to the first, largely symbolic attack on the Japanese mainland, the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.<br/><br/>Many people find the dialogue and story corny, yet watch most any World War II film made during that era and you'll find the same. Talk to many who were soldiers then and you'll find that people often did speak using the same speech patterns many people find to be trite and sappy today. That's what Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer were trying to achieve with this film, and they succeeded admirably.<br/><br/>Watching this film gives you, if you hadn't already had one, the deepest possible empathy for those who survived the events of that day, the most horrific attack America had ever suffered prior to September 11, 2001.<br/><br/>If what you're looking for is a modern, cynical take on the events of December 7, 1941, this is NOT the movie for you. But if you'd like some understanding of just what happened that Sunday morning, and a feel for how America rose to the challenge that faced her, you will enjoy Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Or, watch the trailer. If you can't watch the Japanese Zeroes fly by the kids without getting a lump in your throat, if you are filled with dread at the knowledge of what is about to happen to the Arizona, this movie is for you."

","Isn't it annoying when the boundaries between the war genre and the action genre are blurred to the point that the piece eventually just resembles out-and-out exploitation? Pearl Harbor, or 'Pearl Harbour' to the Brits or further still 'Pearl Harbore' to anyone with any common sense - regardless of nationality, is a film that blurs these boundaries to the point of blindness. It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action – Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film: romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box: ""This semester: Second World War Trivia!"" The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.<br/><br/>The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross – a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.<br/><br/>I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go. But with hindsight, does United 93 go on for another hour after it ends; further documenting what America did in response to the events explored in that film? Of course not; it's an honourable and harrowing depiction of something that happened, not a glamorous; 'feel good'; action movie designed to excite.<br/><br/>The film will eventually see Americans Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Danny Walker (Hartnett) become pilots, but initially they mix and mingle with one another as young kids. They play on Danny's father's farm in a disused crop-duster, pretending to fly and shoot down enemy planes; essentially capturing Bay's overall attitudes to the war genre, one of which says it is just one big game in which gun fire and dogfights play a large part in 'having fun'. One day, they accidentally take up a real crop duster – much to father's displeasure, and he berates them in what is one, brief fleeting moment of realisation of how horrid war is; when he recounts what it was like in the trenches of World War One.<br/><br/>From here, they follow up on their love of flying by becoming United States Army Air Corps First Lieutenants, all the time under the watchful eye of James Doolittle (Baldwin). This is in between getting involved with some of the nurses after they're all posted to Pearl Harbor, the nurses; of whom represent some of the loosest, dumbest, most flirtatious, most pouting ever seen on film. They are nothing but mere prizes, what with their bright red lipstick and on-screen vibrancy; they exist only to be 'won' by the male pilots and navy personnel - the one that causes the most trouble is Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale). Along for the ride is Red Winkle (Bremner); an annoying, stammering character whose deformity is nothing but the butt of most jokes; one of which occurs seconds before the Japanese actually attack Pearl Harbor as he blurts ""The Japs are here(!)"" in what is a monumentally mistimed gag on Bay's behalf.<br/><br/>Then there is the attack itself; while technically brilliant, displaying a good awareness of where the planes and boats are in relation to one another, it exists to titillate; to excite: it should be harrowing, but Bay turns it into the film's money shot – he turns it into the most exciting thing in the film when it ought to be saddest, with the item that is the saddest something else completely un-related to the Pearl Harbor attack. ""I think World War Two just started(!)"" spouts some idiot character as it all plays out. The film is a monumental misfire; a politically-driven load of clap-trap, with an ideology that reads something like: 'You do not mess with America!', one that sees the Japanese given five seconds of backlog and President Roosevelt, circa 1941, actually stand up and walk. Too bad there was no last stand in a church."

I could list the inaccuracies, but others have done so much of it already, what would be the point. The historical points of benefit from the moment in time were not even accounted for. The disaster led to a change in Naval warfare, IE, the Pacific War became a Carrier war. How many actual heroes of the times were poorly portrayed and confused as to their roles in life, war and times. It diminishes their contributions. The change in how we collected intelligence for the rest of the war. The real heroes, the 11 Dolittle crew men that died or were incarcerated for the war and how they perished. The incredible luck that the Japanese withdrew from the battle before inflicting incredible damage on fuel and dry dock facilities or caught our carriers returning to Pearl Harbor. Horrible, just Horrible."

The special effects were very nice but the story line and acting was deplorable.<br/><br/>This movie was nothing compared to ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", ""Midway"", ""To Hell And Back"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", etc. This movie was a slap in the face to the great war movies of the last 50 years. It's like a train wreck that never ends and everywhere you turn the same heroes are turning up again and again and again. They participate in every daring mission from England to Japan from 1941 to 1945... They shoot down Japanese planes over Pearl Harbor, participate in Doolittle's raid (massive overacting by Baldwin as Doolittle which is the norm for Alec) and fall in love along the way in the few minutes they aren't daring their lives against the enemy."

","Ya know for the longest time I could not understand why people despised Michael Bay. I mean Bad Boys 1 & 2, Transformers, The Island all fun entertainment. Then I saw this in my history class and realized what they all meant at once. This is the most clichéd, historically inaccurate turd of a war movie I have ever seen. It would be laughable were it not about one of the worst days in our history. Sure the battle scenes, top-notch but if we do not care at all about our characters, which is the cardinal sin of any movie were the characters are in constant peril, it's almost a meaningless exercise of lights and sound. I mean come on, does every line have to be from another film, and does every little plot twist (including the ending) have to be telegraphed to us. Here's my advice watch the 40-minute battle scene on you tube, then don't watch the rest. Not quite horrible but it's a bad movie by far and an incredible disappointment. Team America was so right"

","Never before has one of the 'Team America:World Police"" songs been so apt. This is one of the worst films that has ever been made. Pearl Harbour is one of the most important events in the the history of the USA yet Michael Bay managed to butcher it completely with an overly and blindly patriotic film interwoven with a hideously written script and awful acting from all of the leads in the film, not even sparred by a former Oscar winner Cuba Gooding who delivers a complete turkey in his version of a 1940's Snoop Dog. <br/><br/>This film did not even deserve one star, but I gave it one out of pity. After watching it, you will not feel a deep sense of gratitude for what happened in the war as you do with truly great war films. Instead, you wonder what on earth it is you have just watched. YOu wonder why you wasted such a lot of money on such absolute tripe.<br/><br/>First off, Affleck and Beckinsale have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever in this film. Their relationship seems awkward and at times blatantly false. Furthermore, Affleck stooped to an acting low rivalled only by his performance in Gigli, one which did no justice to the first world war. Bay seemed more concerned with getting young American children to salute and to paint the Japanese as animalistic, and the British RAF as completely incompetent, whilst completely ignoring the fact war had been established in Europe and had been raging for a few years before this, epitomised by Dannys (Harnett) awful phrase ""I think World War Two just started"" after being asked what happened.<br/><br/>A script interwoven with horrible clichés which look like they have been taken from just about every war film ever made.<br/><br/>To put it simply, Pearl harbour is a film for a blindly patriotic American, and for people who do not need a storyline, or do not need well built characters, or do not need to see good performances and only want to see over done war scenes that prehaps overdo the actual destruction that was done, and turn Pearl Harbour from the provoked retaliation of the Japanese (a point which is overlooked) into the start of a war which pitts the world against the United States.<br/><br/>Do not waste time or money seeing this film. And if you do, after reading this and the countless other negative reviews, then you deserve the disappointment that is coming your way."

","A magnificantly produced and directed film, highly recommended to see especially on DVD.It is a fact that in 1941 a attack was launched on the US base of Pearl Harbor, and this film correctly in my view portrays the surprise nature of that reality. Interwoven into the history of that attack is the story of the friendship and ultimate love and sacrifice between two boyhood friends. I find this picture compelling and brilliant and am mystified why so many ""critics"" thought otherwise. Done with more gusto, enthusiasm and style than Titanic all the characters come across as interesting human beings and giving, as appropriate, humourous or dramatic performances. And the violent scenes are spectacularly good though horrific.Where this film rates so highly in my respectful view is that it can stand alone as explaining the surprise nature of what is Pearl Harbor, independent from the love story and vice versa. Further, the crux of this movie in post September 11 retrospect is about the failure of intelligence, or perhaps the failure to heed intelligence reports. Well done to the film-makers, please ignore the critics, you have a 10 out of 10 from me!!! -rbrb."

","As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good. Everything about it. The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form the summer blockbuster Pearl Harbor. Upon reading reviews of this film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers. They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of ""the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory."" What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans all over the country. Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves. Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it. It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail."

My father served as a pilot in the Korean War, long forgotten, and I feel these films give some concept of what these brave individuals went through. There have been many war movies made in the past.

It's essentially the same as Titanic before the ship starts sinking.<br/><br/>In theory, the climactic attack sequences should be the crowning glory of the movie. The movie has the benefit of 30 years improvement in special effects technology over 1970s Tora! Tora! Tora!. And yet, I didn't find it as impressive -- At least partially because the digital effects artists got too clever. What was seen in Tora! Tora! Tora! was restricted to what could actually be done with the real airplanes used to shoot the scenes, or in model work. Pearl Harbor doesn't operate under this restriction, and thus the attacking planes do all kinds of absurd things that would never have happened in reality -- I guess because it looked cool. As a result of this, what should be the dramatic highlight of the film ends up coming off like a cartoon, or a cheesy video game. The earlier film, while not having the benefit of recent CGI technology, at least attempts to reproduce the events as they actually happened.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a brainless action movie with pretty-boy actors, this will do -- just skip over the first half. If you're interested in history, and want to know what really happened at Pearl Harbor (and equally importantly, why), watch Tora! Tora! Tora! instead."

","OK here is the good news, This film is visually amazing as well as the sound and the score. Now for the bad news. first off who came up with this idea because they half ass-ed the script. Many will complain about the inaccuracies and the love story. Im not one to completely criticize those elements because any movie portraying historical events will have plenty of those. The thing i have against this film is an interview that Michael bay did with movie line magazine that had him talking about the formula that made Titanic successful. Put a historical Background with special effects and a love story to bind it together and you got a box office and Oscar giant. Very naive statement there. First off what Titanic did only works once and they tapped into it not to mention that James Cameron completely did the research on everything that was true and what was myth. Why Titanics love story works is because its characters were fiction and only they were fictional. Everything else was fact and the fictional characters did not depict what happened that night. James Cameron was very careful with not letting the love story contradict the historical facts. He guided them around it and bouncing off it but never affecting it. Michael Bay was not so careful with that and it cost him. His naive approach was more about box office and Oscars that he forgot what he was making. For a summer blockbuster i enjoyed it the first time i saw it but only as something entertaining to watch. I don't go to the movies souly to critique the hell out of every film i go to enjoy a cinematic experience unlike some of the people who just come on here to bash films. Peral Harbor is not anywhere the greatest films of all time but its not the worst filming thats ever been displayed you can at least appreciate the effort that was put into this.

"oneflewovertheapocalypse","4","6","11","15 January 2005"," Let us forget this ever happened and if not then remember the special effects
","Michael Bay, not the greatest of directors it's fair to say but always blows us away with his action sequences in Bad Boys 1+2 and Armageddon and even Pearl Harbour set's us all up for a great entertainment but with a Story like Pearl Harbour is Michael Bay really the best choice director? In my opinion then answer is no and after first seeing Pearl Harbour I thought he actually did quite a good job. The action was excellent, the sets were very standard and expected, some actors were better than others, I'm talking about Josh Harnett acting the pants off Ben Affleck. Kate Beckinsale was very good as Eve but after viewing it twice there was something definitely concerning me, the script.<br/><br/>This film portrays America as people who don't like to admit to their history and what's happened to them in the past. The ego of this gradually gets bigger and bigger the more the film s goes on. One scene in particular that really rubbed me up the wrong way and others that I have consulted with is when Rafe is writing Eve a letter home and a British pilot comes up to him and commends him on his piloting and then says or something along the lines ""If Germany goes to war with America, god help them"", I'm sure there was a point the screenwriter was trying to make but I sure as hell didn't get it, there are other scenes which I could go on about but I'm sure you already know of them so I will now judge the film on other points.<br/><br/>As far as action goes like I said before, it is amazing and the bombing of Pearl Harbour is really a cinematic experience. Everything apart from the Pearl Harbour invasion is very badly directed. It shows that Michael Bay doesn't really have a connection with his actors like Scorsese and De Niro do. The script is nothing but god awful. The dialogue apart from being cheesy is just terrible, it really makes the actors not do a good job when you got someone saying lines like ""Japan realised they were no match for America and turn their forces back"", what's that all about, it maybe true but there's no need to rub it in, that's just careless and not really something you should put in to a film like this. I was hoping to see a film that would show how much WW2 destroyed so many lives but it just seems to show how great America is and how well they can.<br/><br/>This is also the downfall of Ben Affleck. Armageddon was very enjoyable and his cheesy performance was just manageable by Bruce Willis stealing the show but here there is no forgiving him for his bad performance. Towards the end of the film he starts to act well but right up to the moment the Pearl Harbour invasion happens I thought he was poor, Kate Beckinsale wasn't far behind and poor Josh Harnett must have been black mailed into this because I think his performance is the best though has a few moments which I would rather turn my head in embarrassment.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's action sequences do save the film but his direction in other places is needed by somebody who knows how to deal with his or hers actors and actresses and get the best of them, Pearl Harbour sadly does not have any sign of that ever happening. It's fair to say that no one's career has gone on to better things since apart from Jerry Bruckhimer and at least he can say ""I never directed and starred in it so don't blame me"", clever these producers aren't they? Effects can only save this film with a nice soundtrack to go on top but no one will remembering this film"

With a title like ""Pearl Harbor"", I assumed this was supposed to be a picture about the horror and the heroes, about the event.  Instead, it was a sappy love story between three fictional characters.  If anything the special effects and melodrama just distracted the audience from the fact that real people actually died.

"The Original Sam Gray","1","6","11","7 June 2001"," Worse than you've heard - Shows a shameless lack of respect for war that borders on immoral
","Congress should pass a law prohibiting both Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer from making films - especially together.  With the likes of Armageddon and this film under their belts, who knows what horrors they plan to unleash upon us next?<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is the worse kind of insult to both good taste and intelligence.  The characters are 100% lifeless, and they speak mostly in the language of catch-phrases (""Not anxious to die, sir.  Just anxious to matter."") and middle school love letters (""You're so beautiful it hurts.""). As if to compensate, Hans Zimmer provides an oppressive score to tell the audience exactly what to feel at any given moment.  If the music actually spoke, it would say things like ""Now is the time to feel patriotic!"" and ""Why aren't you crying?  Can't you tell something sad just happened?""  Add to this visuals that, while impressive, are nothing out of the ordinary, and you're left with a movie with a plastic atmosphere.<br/><br/>In of itself, this is all bad enough, but Pearl Harbor gets even worse.  In strictest terms, it is a war movie - but only because it takes place during a war.  The first half of the film is nothing more than bad romantic drama, and, once the raid on Pearl Harbor finally begins, the movie plays less like a period war piece than it does like a bad summer action film (which is precisely what it is).  Also, because the movie is rated PG-13, the violence is muted to the point of near-bloodlessness.  Now, in a true war classic such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, I can except such muted violence because it is indicative of the time in which it was made.  However, to minimize the violence to this kind of an extent in a modern film is unnecessary and therefore an insult to the memory of what truly happened, but Bay and Bruckheimer aren't interested in honoring the memory of those who died.  They are interested in making money, and so we get a movie custom-made to be The Biggest Movie of the Summer by playing on the United States' collective patriotic consciousness.  Hmmm, makes me wonder how well this will play in other countries.<br/><br/>Of course, with all that's already wrong with Pearl Harbor, one cannot expect Bay and Bruckheimer to pay much attention to such small details as historical accuracy and setting.  According to Bay and Bruckheimer, Hawaii was, in 1941, a state occupied almost entirely by white people and Cuba Gooding, Jr.  And speaking of Cuba Gooding, Jr., while he plays a real historical figure, he is onscreen for a mere six or seven minutes and seems to be in the film only so that Disney can advertise his presence in its commercials.  Gooding, therefore, portrays not a character but a marketing tool - the final insult in a movie already overflowing with them. 1/10"
"zeno303","1","6","11","23 December 2001"," ""Patriotism"" does not justify this miserable script
","Let me say first that I really wanted to like this film, despite what I had heard about it. It was much worse than I feared. Jerry Bruckheimer should be exiled to Bombay Films or beyond  for producing this overblown piece of garbage and then trying to sell it as a must see patriotic epic.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film contains some of the most stilted, cliche ridden dialog I have been subjected to in years.  I know the love story was included as a sort of ""chickflick within the guy flick "" to appeal to female viewers, but the lady I watched it with kept bursting out laughing at the ridiculous cliches spouted by the contrived characters. (Maybe the target audience is really 13 year old girls.) Ben Afflech was incapable of delivering a convincing Southern accent, and many of his lines sounded like they were delivered in a not very good high school play.  This has got to be his worst performance ever. Ditto for Alec Baldwin.  Jon Voight has the only very good performance as FDR, but he is ""lost at sea"" in this one.<br/><br/>What truly amazes me is that this corn ball script ever made it into production.The inclination to inflated, melodramatic dialog that writer Randall Wallace showed in Braveheart runs totally out of control here. Bruckheimer & Bay must have thought that dramatic lighting, sweeping cinematography, great special effects, and a lot of loud, Dances With Wolves style movie music would turn this turgid Harlequin romance into some kind of a patriotic, misty eyed nostalgia piece. Message to Jerry B.,  ""Garbage in, Garbage out!"" But what about the much ballyhooed action sequences? Admittedly, they were often exciting and, at times, inspiring, but IMO, Bay & Bruckheimer once again shot themselves in the foot by wretched excess.  For example, they spent millions on a very convincing computer generated recreation of the Japanese attack on battleship row, and then proceeded to intercut fake explosions on unmistakably modern US navy ships that happened to be moored in Pearl Harbor at the time they did the shooting.  For a movie that touted itself as ""as historically accurate as modern technology can make it"", this is the equivalent of having the the Nurses drive around 1941 Pearl Harbor in a red 1968 Corvette in the midst of 1939 Fords. Flashy but totally wrong. How could this happen? Bay's explanation on the DVD is revealing.  He says when they saw the modern ships moored in the Harbor, they got Navy permission to stage real explosions on them, so they would have ""real ships"" blowing up, as opposed, (I suppose) to historically accurate, but computer generated ships that they  had already spent millions to destroy in such dramatic and convincing fashion. The contradiction of adding modern guided missle destroyers to 1930s battleships apparently did not trouble anyone. If anything, this reveals a total lack of any real passion about producing an accurate historical depiction of events.  That was all just BS marketing talk.  The irony is that this movie really didn't even need those extra fireworks. If you have seen the film, you know that, if anything, it has more than enough slam bang explosions and the running time is much too long to support the shallow material.  So why add the modern ship explosion shots at all? Because, for Jerry Bruckheimer & Michael Bay, there are never enough explosions.  There is never enough loud,melodramatic music. There are never enough golden hued Norman Rockwell shots, piled one on top of another, oozing ersatz atmosphere. There can never be enough heavy handed, manipulative dialog. Because they fear if they let off the sensory accelerator for one second, the audience will snap out of it's stupor and realize that this film  has the depth and artistry of an over produced 3-minute MTV video stretched  to almost 3 hours. More explosions are better than historical accuracy 'cause the kids like 'em and the audience forgets, for a moment, about the very silly script..  Everytime the fireworks stop in this film, the shallow dialogue and endless cliches proved more deadly to this viewer than Japanese torpedos. IMO, on the DVD, Jerry B's lack of real confidence in the film is painfully obvious. He knows it is a turkey. Ditto for Randall Wallace -- he sounds like a defendant on trial. The special effects are sometimes amazing, but they cannot offset the endless, mind numbing mediocrity of the rest of this shallow film. Some people have said, ""well this is an important subject, and Hollywood has to make  trade offs to popularize the material and attract a wider audience.""  Fair enough, but there are good Hollywood epics and bad Hollywood epics, This is a really bad one, being sold as a ""must see"" because of it's historical content.. Using patriotism to sell second rate schlock is disgusting. I have no problem with pop Hollywood renditions of historical events, if they are reasonably well done.  I would recommend ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" any time over this flick. And,  IMO,  if you want to see a really good Hollywood war movie, set in this historical period, rent  ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo.""  It puts ""Pearl Harbor"" to shame."

How anyone in their right mind can watch this film and feel it to be a romantic action movie is beyond me. It is about three hours too long, the romance is poorly written and quite trite to watch and the action sequences want to make you yawn and go home doing income tax returns instead.<br/><br/>From seeing the trailers I expected a movie about the events of Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. A movie about the tragic loss, that was alas necessary to get the US off their collective ass and do their part in World War II (where Europe had already bled for two years). A movie about the event that awakened the slumbering Titan and in actualíty was a major turning point for WW2.<br/><br/>What did I get? A run-of-the-mill love triangle that didn't feel the least bit innovative or gave me any feeling of sympathy for the three ""soap opera"" leading characters. I just couldn't care less about their small problems, when young men and women were about to get their lives cut short in a tragic event or when the rest of Europe experienced far worse. This movie should not have been a Titanic rip-off. Love has its place, as always, but not soap opera one liners and boring repetitions of ""I can never look at a sunset without thinking of you"". Ewwww!<br/><br/>There was about 30 minutes of Pearl Harbour. Hallo! What was the rest of the movie supposed to be about? Apparently not about Pearl Harbor. This movie was merely set in some Americanized version of Hawaii, where apparently someone got killed in the short scene you missed because you took a sip from your soda.<br/><br/>I expected far more from Randall Wallace (of Braveheart fame) and something of Michael Bay (Armageddon was at least just that, a film about an Armageddon). What I got was nothing to do with WW2 or Pearl Harbor. It didn't honor the memory of the fallen, the heroes of WW2 or at least attmpt some modicum of historic relevance.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope noone watches this movie.

","The day of May 25th dawned. I was planning on attending opening night of Pearl Harbor with one of my good friends, Laura. We counted down the entire day, giggling and thinking with smiles that we would see Ben and Josh in uniform very soon. Well, we got to see them in uniform, but we got much more...<br/><br/>Laura and I seated ourselves in the theater. We were pretty quiet, but talked about our friends, other movies, food, etc. to pass the time. I noticed by the fact that the theater was huge that this movie was going to be something. But I didn't pay much notice of it except for that observation. Then, the previews rolled, the lights dimmed, and the theater grew silent...then I watched...<br/><br/>Several times while I was watching, I kept saying to myself ""Are you really watching this? This is Pearl Harbor! The most talked about movie all year..."" I remembered the bad reviews, e.g. Rotten Tomatoes, and wondered how they could beat on a movie that was so wonderful. It was completely lost on me. I said to myself ""Were they even watching the movie?""<br/><br/>As the movie ended, the lights came on, the credits rolled, and Faith Hill's unutterably beautiful song ""There You'll Be"" sounded from the speakers, I noticed the people were having a very difficult time getting up from their chairs, as I was. My hands were cupped around my chin, and I turned to Laura. She was wiping tears from her eyes. I finally got out of my seat quietly, as people began to exit the theater. Laura coughed, and said ""So how about we shoot all those people that gave this bad reviews?"" I heartily agreed, laughing.<br/><br/>We stumbled up the stairs and outside, talking nonstop about how great the movie was. I took note that everyone walking out of the theater seemed to be having my difficulty walking, and I saw many wiping tears from their eyes and saying how awesome the movie was.<br/><br/>Now, I'm no critic, but I have to say that this movie was probably the best I've seen in a long time. It ran the gamut from an epic-journey of grandeur, to a small-town tale of romance and heroism. The cast was stellar and refreshing. Ben Affleck shined in his role as Rafe, and delivered his lines wonderfully. Josh Hartnett was perfect for his role as well, as Danny Walker. He was both believeable and tremendously realistic. For Kate Beckinsale, this movie could be her big break. I was touched by her heroism and courage, and I felt my heart ache for her the entire time.<br/><br/>Major kudos to Michael and Jerry, who were stars of this film without even being onscreen. They directed this movie very well, and the action scenes were phenomenal! Absolutely mind-blowing...astounding...I couldn't believe how good they were. They certainly did not disappoint.<br/><br/>All in all...this is a masterpiece film. Critics trashed it...my friends trashed it...but I loved it. Ironic, I know. But for me, Laura, the audience, and the veterans...this is a movie to remember. :)"
"worship_HIM97","10","10","22","29 July 2005"," An excellent retelling of the event that changed America!
","This movie is an outstanding effort to take a tragic life-changing event and portray it in a realistic and heart-pounding manner. The film is also backed by a very supportive and entertaining storyline, which includes Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale as the cast for a love triangle that makes the movie so it doesn't bore the audience. <br/><br/>First of all, if all the entertainment business wanted to do with this movie was portray the attack on Pearl Harbor and only the attack on Pearl Harbor, the movie would only be approximately fifteen to twenty minutes in length, so there has to be some sort of storyline to back it up. Second of all, if all they wanted was an informative film that educates people about what happened sixty-four years ago on December 7, 1941, then they would be wasting their time with a pointless remake, as there already is a boring and disappointing movie out there like that entitled Tora! Tora! Tora! which was released in the year of 1971. No, they wanted something better. They wanted something that would attract a movie audience, not something that would attract a History Channel audience. In my opinion, this was accomplished successfully and wholesomely. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck plays Captain Rafe McCawley whose only dream is to be a pilot. When a young woman named Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale) deliberately passes him when she tests his sight even though he wasn't deserving of the deed, he immediately falls in love with her and the two become an item with no time wasted. However, a tragic event leads to emotions composed of envy and revenge. When December 7th comes upon them, people find that they must fight for their lives and their only chance of survival is through strength and hope. <br/><br/>This is a wonderful and brilliant film that is supported by an outstanding cast, an excellent storyline, and a tragic ending that is guaranteed to leave you in tears.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10!"

Alot of people didnt like the fact that the love story was a bigger part of the movie than the actual bombing, but I think that the build up with the love story just emphasises the tragedy and how it affected so many people.

It is a bit of a typical war love story but still good with great actors.I liked the fact that it didnt end straight after the attack, but showed another event, which gave it a sad, but good ending.It certainly deserves alot more praise than it has received."

This movie had so much potential and they absolutely ruined it....so what's really wrong with it?....Let's see <br/><br/>1) Casting: Jesus Christ! Who came up with the idea of casting Ben Affleck in the lead role??? I mean Affleck has to be the worst famous actor right now.He is wooden² - just horrible - and he'll never be able to portray a tough guy - remember my words: NEVER! Dan Akroyd??? in a serious role?Now I love Akroyd but come on - i laughed for 30 minutes when they tried to portray him as a serious character.<br/><br/>Cuba Godding Jr.: well he may fit the character but his story part was just weak....really weak.<br/><br/>Tom Sizemore: seems like you can't watch a war movie without him doing the crazy bastard type of warrior.....<br/><br/>Jennifer Garner: don't panic if you didn't find her in the movie - her part is laughingly small <br/><br/>2) directing: now - Bay is able to shoot action sequences....but that's about it. He fails trying to do anything else - hence the best part of the movie - 30 minutes of action....who would've expected that? <br/><br/>3) historical accuracy: another ridiculous aspect of the movie because there is none....but hey that not the point of the movie right? I mean just because it's called Pearl Harbor doesn't mean it's supposed to be about that historical event....NO!It's about a cheesy love story...what else? <br/><br/>4) stereotypes: US= good;Japan= bad; Yeah we got it yada yada yada; Life can be so easy living in black and white.<br/><br/>5) structure of the movie: why didn't the damn movie stop after the attack? It would have been a good ending, but no we need to have a crappy 45 minutes more of unnecessary stuff <br/><br/>ALL TOGETHER: I didn't expect much - I didn't get much! Michael Bay did his job."
"departed07","5","5","9","17 February 2008"," Somebody drop a bomb on this movie!
","I mean that literary when I say that Pearl Harbor is one of the worst war movies I've ever experienced despite a promising trailer where I would think some history could be stuck in my mind. What we end up is a schlock of a film that endures romance more than a lesson.<br/><br/>If there's a title that Ben Affleck should earn, it's ""Why am i the sidekick that never catches a break?"" since pointing him in a action movie or any movie with him in the top billing without the aid of good actor Matt Damon always fails in the end. He plays Rafe, a daredevil pilot who is best friends with Danny (Josh Hartnett) where they enter the air force together before they separate after Rafe is called into action by the British Air Force leaving his friend along with hot nurse Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) behind. The story then concentrates on Danny trying to comfort Nurse Johnson after reading a telegram stating that Rafe has died in battle where he falls in love with the nurse until seeing that his best friend has risen from the dead.<br/><br/>The real action doesn't take place until at least seventy minutes when the Japanese planes start attacking the ships at Pearl Harbor leaving some of the most memorable scenes in movie history despite the fact that this film is deemed as a chick flick.<br/><br/>Overall, a real extreme disappointment for those that were going to see a great war epic. Even the talent here is a waste with too many actors from Affleck, Hartnett, Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Dan Aykroyd, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jamie King, Jennifer Garner, Ewan Bremmer, Mako, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Sara Rue, and many more good names that deserved better than this."
"thor-abe","1","5","9","8 February 2008"," One of the Worst Movies of All Times
","Pearl Harbor is without doubt one of the worst movies of all times. And the reason for that is not that it features Ben Affleck, probably the worst actor ever, nor that the dialog is truly awful, Josh Harnett declaring ""World War II has just started!"" just to mention one. It's not even all the numerous anachronisms and historical blunders that makes this picture The Worst. <br/><br/>No, that would just make it plain bad, but what really earns this film 1 out of 10 (would have given it negative vote if i could) is that it really is a propaganda movie nearly as bad as bad as anything Leni Riefenstahl has ever made! Maybe even worse because in Pearl Harbor it's more subtle and disguised as an epic war movie.<br/><br/>The propaganda in Pearl Harbor works, in short, like this: First we are shown how the horrible attack on Pearl Harbor was launched and are treated to all the pain and suffering caused by the evil Japanese. Which is supposed to fill us with righteous wrath against the Japanese. Then comes vengeance; America must revenge this most horrible deed, and decides to do so by launching a small air raid on some Japanese factories and strategic points, in which we are shown the bravery of the young soldiers and their glorious victory against all odds.<br/><br/>Victory! Accompanied by epic music it's declared that from that moment on ""America has known nothing but victory"" and claims that this is what ended the war. Oh how glorious and brave! And with so few civil casualties, what a victory! ...or no wait, something feels wrong! No mention whatsoever about what really ended the war: the nuclear bombs dropped over the two major Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki! THE ONLY TIME IN WAR HISTORY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE EVER BEEN USED! With the immediate death of about 300,000 civilians as a result! About 100 times as many as died in the attack of Pearl Harbor! And god knows how many others died and are still dying of cancer because of the radiation! So instead of mentioning one of the biggest massacres in war history we are treated to a glorious false victory with only the tiniest amount of casualties and the feeling that those Japs really got what they deserved! In other words exactly how propaganda is supposed to work.<br/><br/>This kind of history rewriting is an insult not only to those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki AND Pearl Harbor but to all who died in WWII on both sides. This and the fact that many people gather their historical knowledge by watching motion pictures like this one, is what make Pearl Harbor one of the most untruthful, insulting and truly bad pictures ever made."
"eekeeley","1","5","9","12 January 2008"," Truly terrible
","I watched this again for a second time on television, thinking it could not possibly be as bad as I remembered, but it was actually worse.<br/><br/>This movie suffers from any number of flaws Most obvious is an overly long script due to the seeming insistence that this movie must end on an American victory through the Doolittle raid, not the actual devastation of Pearl Harbor. In addition, we have to have the useless, distracting story of Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dory Miller, which might have worked if the movie didn't seem to also need to cover the RAF, an unbelievably sappy love story, a fiancée torn away from her love, some other unimportant but present nurses and airmen, and everything else jammed into this film. It was three movies jammed into one, and none of them were done well except for the special effects from the actual attack on Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The dialogue and script are also truly horrible. Alec Baldwin's character has the lion's share of ridiculously cheesy, undeliverable lines that he hams up like his character on 30 Rock, which doesn't work for this film. I don't know if Doolittle ever actually said some of that stuff, but Baldwin's delivery made me giggle. Rafe and Danny also have some doozies. This movie must contain every sappy love story line ever written, every cheesy motivational speech ever delivered.<br/><br/>There are also just too many characters to care about in this film. Betty, Red, Jennifer Garner's character, Dory Miller, etc, their pain and everything else about them gets lost in the overwhelming quantity of people we are introduced to. Even Danny and Rafe aren't really developed characters, and apparently we're supposed to believe that Kate Beckinsdale's character sprang up from the Earth just as the war was starting as we know nothing about her.<br/><br/>Whoever made the remark about the score being overpowering is exactly right. The music is overwhelming and drowns out any emotional power of the scenes. I'm not sure if Hans Zimmer was trying to overpower the bad dialogue, but the main theme gears up almost every two minutes and just becomes annoying.<br/><br/>The battle scene is rather impressive, but it's seemingly lost in a morass of bad movie rather than the climax of the film, which is a testament to just how bad the surrounding film is.<br/><br/>Overall, a terrible movie that should have confined itself to one incident and a few, realistic people instead of creating a gigantic mess."

","Horrible film that has so many faults, it just isn't worth my time to list them all. By all means read the other reviews, as they give a good account of them. The Battle of Britain scenes had me shouting at the screen. Even if you put aside it is the wrong year! It was an insult, not least of all to the American volunteers who did serve in the war with Britain and were NOT part of the US military who at that point, did not consider Germany an enemy.<br/><br/>Why an event so significant as Pearl Harbour, wanted or needed the implausible and repeatedly inaccurate story line is beyond me. It was and is an important story to tell - the right way. Combine a script that would make a high school history teacher cringe, with an implausible love story and some of the worst acting I have seen in a while and you have a recipe for a movie that should never have made it to the screen.<br/><br/>Watch the twenty minutes of the actual raid.

","I'm sure that 'summary' has been used many times before to comment on this movie... I was dragged to see (during it's actual run time in the theaters) it by a naive girl. Being a history buff, who has studied the war in great detail (including the attack on Perl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid on Japan), I sat through the entire film with either the look of in-credulousness on my face, or in a fit of laughter (which would have appeared to be inappropriate for any other film dealing with these subjects. Having been born on Long Island, and visited the Mitchell Field area many times (just south of Roosevelt Field where Lindberg took off from) I began my laughing fits at the site of California hills and a modern garbage incinerator in the opening moments of the movie. The fits continued right through to the end of the film, where the 'fighter jocks' suddenly were able to fly B25's off of carrier decks, and had somehow gotten Browning machine guns installed in the nose (which wasn't implemented for another 2 years) and flew the planes like strafing fighters... Granted, almost all of the John Wayne films of the time were not much more than propaganda for the cause, but you wouldn't see anyone switching from PT boats to steering a battleship overnight either..

","At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, ""I think World War II just started!""--ignoring the fact that no one used the term at the time. This is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, often flatly impossible, and flogging every cliché to the nth degree.<br/><br/>Although it markets itself as a highly authentic depiction of the events leading up to and the attack on Pearl, PEARL HARBOR is essentially a three hour long and extremely improbable soaper about a love triangle between two friends and a navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself.<br/><br/>Although the attack at Peal Harbor is an exciting bit of film-making, it is really here that the film falls completely apart, asking us to believe that the two male leads not only manage to get their planes off the ground, perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and then land safely to return to the woman they love. As if this is not absurd enough, the film then goes on to send both men off on the Doolittle Raid on Japan itself.<br/><br/>By this point the men have been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, been through Pearl, and are now crash landing in China--and I began to wonder why they were bothering with the nurse; given that their primary interests seemed to be in each other they might as well have dropped their drawers and gotten in bed with each other too. Indeed, such a turn of events would have at least added a touch of curiosity value to this otherwise dreary bit of high-gloss cinematic nonsense.<br/><br/>The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a ""Making Of"" documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not.<br/><br/>Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
"soccer64","10","6","12","23 May 2005"," The BEST Movie...
","This contains 2 things, 1) A response to the review by oatwich (some true historical facts), and 2) My review of Pearl Harbor <br/><br/>I, personally, think that oatwich's review was nuts. I do not recall the Japanese ever shooting at innocent people in the movie, considering the Nurses had military ranks, and that's what the Japanese were there for. The Doolittle Raid was not an attack on civilians. It was an attack on the military structures such as war industries, shipbuilding facilities, and power plants. In fact, Doolittle strongly reiterated that no hospitals, schools, or other civilian targets, were allowed, and got very angry when hearing that some of his men wanted to hit the Imperial Palace. Therefore, the movie portrayed those American bombers as heroes because they WERE heroes, according to the current president. So maybe the movie is not 100% accurate, but what movie is, unless it's a documentary? MOST of the movie IS historically accurate. I also do not see how one can say it was insulting to the Japanese. The movie crew was nervous on how Japan would take the movie, but they obviously liked it, considering Japan was the first or second country, where the movie made the most money. The movie was NOT disrespectful to the world war veterans, they loved the movie, got to advise in the way some of the scenes went, spent time with the cast and crew of the movie, and even cried at the ""real feel"" of it.<br/><br/>Overall, I think oatwich needs to learn to speak for himself, instead of taking it upon himself to speak for all of Pearl City and Honolulu.<br/><br/>Usually (even with movies that I like), I am sitting there, looking at the DVD player to see how much time is left until the movie ends, because I want to get up and do something. With this movie, I was looking to see how much time was left, because I could not WAIT to see how the movie ended! I think this is an awesome, well balanced love story and action movie (almost exactly half and half), if you are able to sit in one place for almost 3 hours, and like action and romance, I would definitely recommend this movie. :) <br/><br/>Also, if you watch this on DVD, when you put the second disk in, make sure you don't look at the chapters, or you'll ruin the ending. :P<br/><br/>(This is my favorite movie in case you couldn't tell, and I could rant on it forever, but I won't take up any more of your time here, so if you need to talk about the movie, e-mail me.)"

Already have it on my list to purchase for home video. It's gonna be something to watch again and again.  What i really liked about the film as well is that it has a lot of great actors and ones that most everyone around the world has heard of like baldwin, affleck, beckinsale, gooding, sizemore, aykroyd, voight, hartnett, and fichtner.<br/><br/>The special effects couldn't get more realistic sinking ships, explosions and smoldering etc were realistic looking and the story line followed smoothly without quickly skipping ahead to the action or tense/scary event. It's also a good history lesson.<br/><br/>One way or another this is something to see probably 3 times a day.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""A date in which we will live in infamy"". Spoken by Roosevelt, these words were the words of war for America in 1941. Today, these words bring back memories, of when America became strong. This movie, ""Pearl Harbor"" brought back those memories for the veterans of that day, and also gave the citizens of the US a glimpse of that tragic day. Special effects gave this movie it's realness in every way, and the intentness became real to every viewer. Telling the Pearl Harbor attack, the way many saw it, and the love story between soldiers and nurses, and the life of flying of two best friends, this movie became a memorial to many. Brought tears, almost no laughter, and pains for all veterans. This movie touched me deep, as the memory of Pearl Harbor does. The plot was rich with life, and history. As a teen, I'm not fascinated by history, but I do love Pearl Harbor. The movie told every view, from nurses, to soldiers, to citizens. Sadness reached me at the end, as did many. This 3-hour movie (it needed to be!!!) shows life briefly before and after, but with great context about Pearl Harbor attack. Showing views from Japan and US, it tied in history very well.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett worked very well side-by-side, along with Kate Beckinsale. The duo made out to be great working together.  The romance story between them made in Hollywood, but Pearl Harbor made it history. I agree. This is a blockbuster, of history!!! Touched me deep, as I saw it yesterday, but forever will I remember this movie. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!"
"movie-addict","10","6","12","29 May 2001"," Pearl Harbor - a must-see movie epic!
","As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good.  Everything about it.  The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form this summer's blockbuster Pearl Harbor.  Upon reading reviews of this newly released film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers.  They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of ""the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory.""  What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all.  It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans.  Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves.  Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it.  It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail."

","If I like the actors in a movie and the movie itself it OK, but but not that great I won't go to the trouble to see it in the theater more than once. ""Pearl Harbor"" has been in theaters for only two days and most people have seen this film once so far. I've already seen it twice and I love it more and more! I first saw the film late Tues. night b/c of a special situation and even in my tired state at 4 AM I was dangerously close to writing the production company to tell them how AMAZING ""Pearl Harbor"" is.<br/><br/>Some critics have said the only good part about the film is the actual bombing scenes of Pearl Harbor, but I believe the love story gives a face to the suffering for those, like myself, who are unrelated to the history. We have been removed from the pain and US History lectures aren't enough to comprehend the defeat, complexities, and final W.W.II victory started at Pearl Harbor. I believe The movie is a beautiful representation of the situations faced by all involved with a great cast, very real special effects (better than any other movie I've ever seen), and amazing camera shots that capture the emotions (e.g. blurred spots and slow motion to show confusion or devastation)."

","I went into this movie with almost no expectations. I had heard much of the negative criticimm of the love story and the director's attempt to create a another Titanic. I think that criticism is a bunch of bull. Titanic had an unbelievable love story set to a historical event. The love story in that movie took away from the integrity of the film-to the point where the viewer HATED both charaters (I personally had no sympathy for Jack). In Pearl Harbor, you are dealing with the reality of war, and what happens when someone is presumed dead. I mean, you can put yourselves in the position of Rafe, Evelyn and Danny. It makes the film more poignant, and the war that much more dramatic. Plus there's not the class-system BS that Cameron tried to push on viewers in Titanic in this movie. The only negative to this movie is that, like Titanic, it could have been an hour shorter. I almost fell asleep the first hour, and it takes about an hour or so to pick up. But I feel that criticism is minor compared to all the negative stuff I've said about Titanic."

"anastasiia_shystovska","10","4","7","8 April 2020"," Pearl Harbor: Movie Review
","'Pearl Harbor' is a wartime drama that was directed by Michael Bay and released in 2001. The scriptwriter who worked on this movie is Randall Wallace. Before this movie, he wrote for such projects as ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1998). The soundtrack was created by unsurpassed master Hans Zimmer, who also wrote music for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""The Prince of Egypt"", ""The Dark Knight"", etc. The stars that played the main characters were Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett. In 2003, Kate went on to star in ""Underworld"" and in 2004 she took on a leading role in ""Van Helsing"".<br/><br/>On 7th December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, where the US Pacific Fleet was situated, leaving the US deeply shocked. It is a movie about war, love, courage and honour.<br/><br/>The trailer, which I have personally seen more times than I had expected, really made me, and I hope you, want to watch this movie. The movie length is 3 hours 3 minutes and to my mind, this is just right. You can watch it the whole thing in one go. Moviegoers won't be able to look away from the screen because of the stunning visuals and deep emotions that they'll no doubt feel. Both the main and minor characters are highly convincing and during the whole movie, they effectively engage with each other and what is more, with every member of the audience. You truly believe every moment.<br/><br/>Written by Anastasiia Shystovska"

"ddegalembert","9","4","7","12 May 2014"," Pearl Habor
","Pearl Habor is a historical movie directed by Michael Bay in 2001. It's a perfect way to show how America entered in WWII. There are three main characters: Captain Rafe McCawley played by Ben Affleck, Captain Danny Walker played by Josh Hartnett and Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Johnson played by Kate Beckinsale. At the beginning of the movie we follow Rafe and Danny's childhood. They wanted to be pilot and some years later they join the Royal Air Force. Rafe is in love with Evelyn, since their first meeting. He goes to England to fight against the German Air Force: Luftwaffe whereas Evelyn and Danny are sent to Pearl Habor. When Rafe is back at Pearl Habor there is a surprise attack by the Japanese Air Force. This movie plunges us aptly in the horror of war. Through the actor's play of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett we can feel exactly the solders' feeling during this period. Firstly through the childhood of the two young men we understand that a lot of little boys wanted to serve their homeland, to be soldier and wanted to participate in the protection of their country. Then, when Rafe goes to England and he announces it to Evelyn we understand it was difficult for a wife, mother, sister or whatever to see their husband, son, or brother leaving. And we see it's also difficult for Danny because a friend is precious and he is afraid of his friend's death. Moreover when Rafe's plane crashed into the sea he thinks all the time of Evelyn in order not do die. So we can see that women are very important to soldiers to give their strength and courage. This movie also emphasizes brotherhood between soldiers. Indeed during all the movie, the young men build a relation of friendship which seems to be very strong. And it's very important to mentioned that this sort of group, had need to the strength relations. During the scene of the bombing we can see the panic in the eyes of the actors. We can see soldiers crying and saying ""Mom!!"" This moment transcribes very well the horror which soldiers underwent during this historical event. Moreover with the sound and the special affects we can believe we are part of the scene, we are with soldiers, we can felt their fear when they see the first Japanese plane. We can see soldiers were ready to sacrifice themselves for their country. We can think that the beginning was a little bit long but I think it's important to follow life of those soldiers before the attack because we can identify with them thanks to the scenario. After seeing this movie I can say they were not only soldiers, cannon fodder but they were friends, husbands, fathers, and above all, they were human beings and they gave everything they could to their country."
"d-allen1-147-455070","10","4","7","30 August 2011"," A great film that provides entertainment throughout
","Pearl Harbour is a fantastic film, it's exciting, romantic and even makes you cry a little bit! The film in my opinion has been misjudged by overly serious people who pick faults in everything and have completely missed the point of the film. Pearl Harbour is loosely based on a historical event and therefore contains some historical references but it never claims to be a film 100% accurate and it never claimed it could pass you your history test. Pearl Harbour is a love story which just so happens to be set during WWII and Pearl Harbour. The film contains action, romance and it's simply fantastic to watch. Several times during this film I was in tears. I'd call Pearl Harbour a woman's action film which is perhaps why it has received so much negativity. It's a chick flick with a tinge of history and a bit of action. Kate Beckinsale puts on an amazing performance full of emotion and you really feel it, it's a great film that deserves more credit."

Like all the things that he made, it was a complete failure. The only good thing were the visual effects. Besides that, this film is absolutely worthless, like the other films directed by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>This movie is a good example of how NOT make a war film.<br/><br/>I would give this a negative score if I could.<br/><br/>0/10"

The fight scenes are pretty spectacular (an earlier user comment said that it didn't give any ""honor"" to the Japanese fighters...But I beg to differ, I thought Bruckheimer and Bay did a good job of providing the Japanese with lots of honor), and the story line keeps you interested. My boyfriend who is in the Army didn't really like this movie, but every woman I know loved it.

"gladtobesaved5","10","8","18","5 November 2002"," Don't let the Sunsets ruin what history the film does have in it.
","Now to enjoy stuff like this, YOU HAVE  TO KNOW WHEN TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! The attack is incredible and has lots of fireworks and the Arizona was done in all its sickening detail. You see the 2 football-feild long ship go up like a 50 cent firecracker and you KNOW 1,117 men just went out into eternity (which is so much worse when you think that many weren't even saved!) The only event I can think of that was worse is what happened 14 months ago, 14 days before my 17th birthday in September, 2001.<br/><br/> Now the film would be utterly beautiful if it could back up the FX with a good solid, based on history, PLOT. Unfortunately, Micheal was so mesmorized by the Sunsets that he forgot. The Battle over England was so realistic, I wish a whole film about 8th Air Force would come out that looked like that! Speaking of bombing raids, this film also covers the Doolittle Raid, and I can't find ANY inaccurracies in that part of the film, SO if you have a DVD of it you can just watch those parts (And they are worth the money in themselves).<br/><br/>NOW, I love computer games and my favorite is World War 2 Fighters. I first saw this in a theater and seeing those P-40's take down enemy Zekes; well, it felt the same way as the game, (AND IF YOU'VE PLAYED WW2 FIGHTERS YOU KNOW THAT IS A GOOD THING!). So watch the first 5 minutes, fast foward 20 minutes, then another hour and 5 , and finally another hour to see the worthwhile stuff. I won't even start talking about the real plot. From reading others' comments, I think that's been covered."
"Xanadu","10","8","18","21 December 2001"," Better than I expected
","I put off seeing this movie because our actions towards Japan and Japanese-Americans were some of our lowest moments in history. Fortunately, this movie decided not to come anywhere near those events.<br/><br/>This movie had to be made, just like Titanic had to be made.  And just like Titanic, the Hollywood producers wouldn't have allowed them to be made due to their insane budgets unless the movie appealed to a large audience, and the best way to do that is to include a love story.<br/><br/>Yes, the love stories were rushed and perhaps unnecessary, but that doesn't destroy the movie.  I was surprised because I was on the brink of crying a few times.<br/><br/>The action sequences were the best.  This was a very toned down Michael Bay movie, if you can believe that, because although there were a lot of effects, they didn't seem so unrealistic or overdone.  It was just right.<br/><br/>I believe this may be the best war movie I've ever seen because it captured the emotions of the event so well, sort of the way Titanic captured the emotions, but not nearly as good...although perhaps better than the other war movies I've seen, and I've seen them all.  It just killed me to see those Japanese planes keep bombing and bombing Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. military not being able to do anything about it.  I kept wishing for the attacks to stop.<br/><br/>The one thing I wished they did a better job of was showing us more of who these Japanese pilots were.  I give this film a 10 because I went in expecting a 5 and was simply blown away (excuse the pun).  I think if Michael Bay keeps the effects toned down, do some lower budget films, and keep the camera a little more steady, people may start to take him more seriously and maybe appreciate the talent he has."
"kitkat-1","9","9","21","26 June 2001"," What's the problem??
","I've read more than enough negative reviews of Pearl Harbor to last until next summer's blockbuster comes out. Apparently, looking for the good elements in a  film is old-fashioned and naive, but I found plenty to appreciate in this film.<br/><br/>The cast is charming, funny, and believable. The stars are, perhaps, too attractive, but this is the way almost every movie is cast. Why rake Pearl Harbor over the coals for choosing appealing actors? The characters are memorable, and real, despite some cornball dialogue. Were all the critics expecting Shakespearian complexity in a big-budget re-creation of 1941? Even a less-than-poetic script can't diminish the impact made by this fine cast, who give the ""greatest generation"" an accessible, familiar face.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor's romanticized look at pre-war America certainly misses the mark on historical accuracy, in favor of beautiful shots and a politically-tactful summary of world events that led America into war. If the film had concentrated on facts and figures, it would have been an expensive documentary, and an obvious rip-off of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Instead, Pearl Harbor gets involved with a group of people who lived through an extraordinary period of world history. It gives the audience,  especially young adults, the impetus to seek out more information about the attack on December 7, and World War II as a whole. Even those who criticize the film have been motivated to examine its flaws and to exhort the public to learn the ""real"" story of Pearl Harbor. Education and awareness of America's past is a positive outcome, regardless of the critical review of a film.<br/><br/>As for the motivation behind Pearl Harbor, I must admit this is the weakest point. The film was not made for love of country, but for love of money. Released on Memorial Day weekend, in the year that will see the 60th anniversary of the attack, Pearl Harbor was carefully calculated to be a success. It is not as visionary and artistically inspiring as it should be, but it can be appreciated on its own merits.<br/><br/>The film is touching and well-acted. It succeeds as a love story, a war epic and an action spectacular. It is well worth the price of admission, and is a fine addition to the ranks of WWII films from Hollywood's past.<br/><br/>Rated 8 of 10."
"llamadrama-11132","10","5","10","4 August 2015"," Its the best movie I've ever seen!
","The thing is, looking through all of these other reviews, I don't understand why this movie has such terrible reviews! Maybe by watching this, they were looking for a hardcore war movie. This really isn't a war movie at all; its a story of love and friendship supported by the time period of World War 2.<br/><br/>I have never seen a better movie, literally. I cried my face off at the end. Watching Josh Hartnett's adorable character die because he was saving his best friend's (Ben Affleck's role) life is just so heartbreaking and emotional and it makes me want to role up into a ball and die on the floor. And then, on top of that, Ben Affleck tells Josh Hartnett that he's going to be a father (throughout the movie, the female lead changes between loving Affleck and Hartnett and gets pregnant with Hartnett's child) and Hartnett replies with ""No, you are,"" as he releases his final breath and that's when you lose it. Then the end comes with Affleck flying in a plane (he's a pilot) with Hartnett's son that they named after him and all of your heartstrings collapse and shrivel up... K, that's enough with the spoilers.<br/><br/>Anyways, the soundtrack for this movie is so pretty.. I had to buy it on Amazon to get the CD copy. The soundtrack reminds you of the devastation of the film; the joy that comes out of an unfortunate event.<br/><br/>The whole second hour of the film is dedicated to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It's similar to the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan at Omaha or the sinking of the Titanic in the movie Titanic. If what you're looking for is a war movie, that's as ""war"" as you're going to get. You'd be better off watching Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, We Were Soldiers, or The Patriot.<br/><br/>Looking for a tearjerker about love and friendship, watch it now."
"beki_ash","7","5","10","30 August 2005"," Criticism to the critics
","I'm sorry; I do not understand why everyone hates this movie so much. Unless every single one of you are veterans of the Pearl Harbour attacks I don't see how you can so openly criticise the historical content of the movie. It was made over 40 years after the attack happened. Isn't it obvious it's not going to be a bit-by-bit re-enactment of what happened back then? If forty years on someone made a film about September 11 or the London Bombings there'll probably be just as many historical inaccuracies as Pearl Harbour. And it's not like the producers tried not to make it as accurate as possible. They interviewed over 70 Pearl Harbour Veterans and tried to weave in every account they could. If the 'Rafe' and 'Danny' characters were real, they wouldn't be doing the Doolittle Raid, that is true because of the differences in flying (fighters and bombers), but a: they wouldn't be able to end the film without the Doolittle Raid, and b: surely you can't expect them to bring in two entirely new characters at that time in the film? <br/><br/>I will admit, it does seem to be a little over the top with the love triangle but seriously, how many people watch documentaries compared to the amount that watch romance movies? It's a Jerry Bruckheimer film for goodness sake, of course there had to be something in it that attracted the people, not just the big explosions. But you have to see that they weren't only doing it for the romance. If you get completely immersed in the love affair off those three characters, you may get a glimpse at the emotional side of things. I wouldn't know for sure because I wasn't there but I know for sure I got caught up in the emotional side and I'm not that kind of person normally. The nurses had to be in it because of the stresses and stuff they went through when the casualties started coming in and with that many sailors and only that small amount of nurses of course there had to be some sort of romance. The nurses weren't just placed in the film because of the romance, they were also, and more importantly there for emotional circumstances.<br/><br/>This film wasn't meant to be a documentary, it's meant to be an entertainment film. Duh!"
"sweetsk8r410","9","5","10","18 August 2005"," Have some perspective (May contain spoilers)
","******Spoilers at the end only******(just to be safe)<br/><br/>This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I have seen from these posted reviews that most people either sincerely love this movie or completely hate it. I am typically an analytical person and I don't ""love"" things without a reason. I love and respect Pearl Harbor as a movie because it is the first movie that made me cry. Repeatedly. In public when I first saw in theaters. And at home when I watch the DVD for the 10th time. History always has to be taken with a grain of salt. There are no absolute truths. And when making a movie it is 100% positive that there will be historical errors. This is a movie, first of all. It is a multi-million dollar venture to become a blockbuster hit. It is not meant to capture historic accuracy perfectly because the average American doesn't care about the history. It is sad to know that most culture and history is lost on people. But one way to make it up is to drawn them in with things that do attract them and be able to get to their emotions. People are attracted by sex and violence. I, along with many others, were drawn in by the story of Danny, Evelyn, and Rafe. through their eyes I was able to experience one of the horrors of American history. It may not have been exactly how it happened, but this movie gave me a glimpse into how it felt. Something I KNOW i will never TRULY experience, but something we who won't experience it should be grateful for. This movie showed me the power of love, which does not always have to be bashed by cynics. It showed me the pride that people can have. To me it was not 100% pro-American. I felt emotion for the Japanese fighter pilots as well. He, too, had a love waiting for him in Japan that he would lose. Love and loss are universal. I felt respect for out nursing profession and doctors and ordinary people who step up in extraordinary circumstances. I feel ashamed for the fact that 2 countries had to resort to this kind of destruction due to a lack of communication and cooperation. Most importantly, I felt pride in soldiers, all soldiers. We may not respect their battles, but we must respect their lives of sacrifice and bravery. Including a love story in this movie does not lower its standards. In one post someone talked about how a movie about 9/11 could be ruined with a love story if it is made into a movie. I tell that person that I would watch that movie and I would not be upset about it because Love is something that can never be lost even in the face of any great tragedy.<br/><br/>I am not usually a fan of history, but everything about WWII interests me since I picked up the Diary of Anne Frank when I was in 4th grade. I have attempted to learn everything I can about the war, but I realize that people are interested in different things and probably WILL NEVER know the historical heroes of our past that fought bravely in this war. And I can't blame them for that. But this movie had the emotion to draw people in and maybe even for a little while give them a break from the cynical view of the world to believe in people again. To recognize mistakes but to also re-energize pride. I will never forget some of the images and quotes from this movie, such as ""There is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer"" and the quote something along the lines of ""A smarter man would find a way not to fight a war"" to the final scene with little Danny and Rafe flying away.<br/><br/>Maybe tears are a superficial to love a movie but good old emotion can be a better teacher than cold hard facts.<br/><br/>If you have actually read all of this, congratulations. I hardly ever post a message on here but I felt compelled to lay out my opinion on this subject and apologize that is particularly verbose. I respect everyone's opinions, and I only ask others to do the same."

I agree when people said that the movie was based on a tragic event and then they just added a stupid love story into it. But wasn't Titanic a tragic event as well, the two events may had not had the same effect on the country but still many peoples lives where lost. If you watch this film not concentrating too much on the historical facts and on the planes and guns and things that were used in the movie, then, it was a fantastic thing to watch. It was the same in Titanic, as both of these films had a love story in them, but wasn't that the idea of the film. if the film was just about the facts then i think it would have been called a documentary.<br/><br/>SQUIRE"

"Haydn Cook","10","5","10","9 June 2001"," Pearl Harbor is a great film. It mixes sweeping romance with the tragedies of war. All war films should aspire to this level.
","Pearl Harbor is the best film I have ever seen.  Michael Bay's direction is flawless, an almost guaranteed Best Director at the Academy Awards.  Hans Zimmer's music scores are so beautiful and sad, making the battle scenes more intense, and the mournful scenes, sadder.  Randall Wallace has written a screenplay better that his 1995 effort, BRAVEHEART. I've seen this film 8 times at the cinema so far, and it still makes me angry when people flat out say - 'it was crap'.  No one in their right mind could say this movie sucked.  Not liking a movie because of its running time really isn't a very valid reason.  A longer movie means it can fit more in it. I would say that Pearl Harbor is a combination between ARMAGEDDON and TITANIC.  This film is so watchable and entertaining, the love story really couldn't have been much better.  It was the most entertaining way to start the first 80 mintutes of the film. Ben Affleck has outdone himself, giving an even better and more mature performance as Rafe McCawley. Josh Hartnett is going to be such a huge star after this film, as well as Kate Beckinsale.  She put in a flawless performance.  How beautiful is she? Don't listen to insane people who put this film down, if you haven't seen Pearl Harbor, please hurry and do so.  If you have seen it, watch it again."
"RodyaKy","10","5","10","25 May 2001"," A story for the times, a tragedy for a nation, this film is excellent for so many reasons
","A date which will live in infamy. I certainly remembered it, and once our school got time out on the day to watch Tora Tora Tora piped through our tv system. When I saw the previews for Pearl Harbor, I was awestruck, yet I was also wary. I wondered if this could reach Tora Tora Tora's level of glory, or well-crafted cinematography and acting. What I saw today proved that today's cinema has just as much to offer. This movie was simply amazing. It shows the backgrounds of the characters which, even though it takes awhile, didn't make me bored. In fact, I did not realize the time that had passed. The scenes were realistic, the acting was emotional, but not overdone. The cinematography was original and flavorful, using techniques which brought the war truly home. And throughout, I had a sense of being there almost, feeling the air, smelling smoke. But then again I have an overactive imagination.<br/><br/>My third cousin died in the battle that brought America into World War II. He was nineteen. When I saw the ships sinking in flames, the men screaming, it sent shivers down my body. Even if there is never a stone memorial to honor him(which there is), this movie will always be a national memorial to his sacrifice, to me."

The first half of the film was basically about the love story. But the 60 minute bombing scene that came after that covered that small negative up. <br/><br/>Most of the story was based on a true events that occurred during the war. This film is wonderful.

","I had heard repeatedly that the love story was lacking before I saw that show, but that you should go just to see the 40 minute effects show. I couldn't agree less.<br/><br/>I thought the entire movie (except for about 30 seconds at the end where they just got lazy with the story and a couple of other things I'll get into in a bit) was great. It was well balanced, and well shot. And the love story... the decision Evelyn had to make was heart wrenching. The interplay between the three main characters was wonderful. The battle scenes were riveting, hauntingly realistic without being gory. I started crying at about 8:30 and cried almost all the way through to 10:00, pausing only for the lame president scenes.<br/><br/>That was a part of the movie I didn't think went over well, nothing against Jon Voight, I liked most of his stuff in this movie, but what seemed to be some sort of inspirational scene completely fell flat. The whole standing up thing was waaaay too hokey. I also didn't appreciate all the references to ""Our Country"" and ""Us"" in the version they released up here in Canada, I thought it was absolutely crude. They changed those words in other international releases, why not for us? We put up with enough Amerocentric crap as it is. I guess I have one other qualm about this movie, it seemed to me that the Cuba Gooding, Jr. bit of the movie was tacked on as an afterthought. It almost didn't fit. I hate to say it was just to expand the demographic, but that's what it seemed like.<br/><br/>This movie did make me an instant Josh Hartnett fan, just add water and stir. That boy is gorgeous. I could go on and on. And on."
"kristi700","10","7","16","31 May 2004"," The real history in this movie - is it so important?
","Many people say, it is fictitious, not real history, but who can make a film nowadays about the Second World War, which is exactly the same, how it was then. But the most important thing here is, that if you like to watch real history, watch reality shows and documentary films, but not an artistic movie. This story about three main (created) characters makes this film interesting. It's entertainment, which is based on history. So you can learn something about history by sitting in front of TV- isn't it good? So if you are interested in history, you must watch this movie and if you like good lovestories, it is also for you. It's a good, interesting and lovely movie and I think, that many people agree with me. *Sorry, English is my foreign language, so there may be some writing mistakes."
"J4Me","10","7","16","23 June 2001"," Despite fallbacks, Pearl Harbor soars
","Dramatic climaxes. Love triangle. BIG explosions. Despite many harsh reviews Pearl Harbor did not sink, as many would have liked to see it do. Yes, you will have to sit on your butt for three, long hours but it is worth the time. And must I remind everyone of how many times the majority of us sat through Titanic? Ignoring the clichÃ©s and striking similarities between the two movies 'Pearl' tops Titanic on all levels. Enough said. The love triangle becomes a little monotonous, although what was M. Bay drinking when he did the casting? The only reason Ben received the lead was because his name was Ben Affleck, his role/character dangerously like that of his in Armageddon. No stunning performance there. And who decided to use Kate B. as the heroine of the movie? As the story progresses you wonder why these two men are fighting over her in the first place and by the end of the movie end up hating her and her character. Josh Hartnett, who by next year, should be up for at least one Oscar nod, captures the ONLY intelligently good role in the movie. The boy is seeping with talent that Hollywood is now, disappointingly, only discovering. Finally, there's that BIG 40 minute explosion scene, which I must admit wasn't too bad, although realistically, would never have looked like that. Despite some fallbacks, you'll get your money's worth. Some action, some romance, and, yeah, OK a numb butt. Ignore the critics- Pearl Harbor soars."

Alec performed a great Jimmy Doolittle with his raspy dictatorial voice, although, I had the distinct honor of meeting Gen. Doolittle who was brought to my desk for introduction in the 80's and his voice was not such, lol.<br/><br/>I felt that the movie brought out a personal side to this historical event; the surprise, helplessness and devastation; not just in the attack but with the three main characters' lives.<br/><br/>I cried through the whole movie, so ladies, take your kleenex.  The movie was so well made that every sad moment was followed by a comical moment. So, you are not left in the doldrums.<br/><br/>There were about 1,000 attendees at the special advance viewing and at the end of the movie, we all clapped.

","Pearl Harbor is a wonderful masterpiece in the art of movie making. This movie truly touched my heart and is the best movie so far since<br/><br/>Titanic(1997). This movie has you on the verge of tears almost throughout the entire length of the film. They did a wonderful job of recreating the atmosphere of Pearl Harbor back in 1941. The quick romances that actually occurred between the men and the nurses in 1941 was beautifully portrayed. This was an actual factor in the tragedy of Pearl Harbor as many lives were lost and loved ones never to be found again. The movie was very accurate especially in the scene where a cook, Petty Officer Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) got on the guns to fight back at the Japanese Zeros. In history the real Dorie Miller did just that and was awarded the Silver Star. The characters in this movie recreate the sense of bravery and sacrifice that men and women actually portrayed during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941 such bravery and sacrifice was indeed displayed and that is good to see in this movie. This is definitely a must see. This is a movie all of us will never forget!!<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10"

If you want to see a great and accurate film that is actually about the attack on Pearl Harbor watch TORA, TORA, TORA!

Then he and his best friend have a fight, then the Japanese attack. They want revenge so they bomb Japan, then they go to China, where one of them dies and the other goes back home and lives with the nurse. The love triangle in this film is pointless<br/><br/>The film lacks historical accuracy, such as the Japanese zeros being painted green instead of White/Grey. The scene when Affleck and Hartnett play chicken is so unbelievable it's funny. <br/><br/>With the lack of history and the unbelievable battle scenes makes this film an insult to the sailors who died at Pearl Harbour. <br/><br/>The Dialogue is so bloody ridiculous. Lines that come to mind are ""I think World War II Just started!"" and ""Not anxious to die sir, just anxious to matter!"" Seriously, who wrote these lines?

Of course the story does not end with the Pearl Habor attack, but with the US final victory of the war - because in the end America always wins ... of course.

"Cooki3","3","3","5","10 March 2011"," The never-ending Pearl Harbor
","Pearl Harbor is Micheal Bay's parvum opus. Some say Transformers 2 is his parvum opus but I managed to enjoy that film. TF2 was a dumb action film and recognized itself as one, who can blame it? Pearl Harbor, however, is a dumb action film that thinks it's a gripping romantic epic when it fails at the latter while ending up exposing the former to the max.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor tries to be Titanic. There's the cheesy script played by up-and-coming actors carrying a love story set during one of the biggest catastrophes in the first half of the 20th century. I find Titanic to be overrated but where it succeeded is where Pearl Harbor does an u-turn in the wrong direction. I hate Josh Hartsnett with a passion, so that's a minus for this film already. Our main leads are mediocre at very best and the dialogue is tremendously terrible. This really becomes a problem because they go through the same pretentious romantic dilemma again and again for what seems like an eternity. The action was fun...at first, but overstayed it's welcome since the action scenes too where drawn out as long as possible. The entire movie is the same repeated stuff over and over and over and over and it goes on for three hours! When the Pearl Harbor attack ended I expected the film to end, but no! It was still going! I had completely lost my attention at that point and curled in my couch waiting for the film to end. Thankfully once the douchebag Hartsnett's character dies the film goes through it's ending pretty quickly.<br/><br/>Some things work, most of it doesn't. It's a film that could have so easily been trimmed down an hour, because there is very little evidence that this film utilize a three hour length to it's advantage.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Ten years in, and this has the most hated/loved war movies ever! The film is one thing, but the reviewer/viewer public has been pure bi-polar on this one. Most truly bad films just fade and are rarely seen or shown after a few years. Not this one, ten years later and it's still on all the time on TV. People watch it, I watch it. It gets ratings.<br/><br/>I first saw shots of this movie in a electronics store in Pearl City, back in about 2003. Strange twist, I saw it there of all places. Anyway, the action and cinematography blew me away on those early big screen LEDs. And it still does. Historically?? Right, I get it - it couldn't be right. But, entertainment isn't all about historical accuracy, or it would all be just documentaries. Entertainment is about love, heroism.. Stuff like that.

I should think that with all the talent, effort and money invested in this film they would have had a better result. And where in the film did that nurse earn a Purple Heart? There was not even a hint that the American aircraft carriers, which were at sea and not in the Harbor at Pearl when it was attacked, were of concern to either the Japanese or the American military commands. To the Japanese because they did not know where they were and the Americans because they did! Having a copy of Morrison handy after seeing this film should serve as an antidote."

The only other thing I can say is to quote Col. Kenneth Taylor, one of the pilots the characters portrayed by Affleck and Hartnett were based on. Col.

"Electrified_Voltage","5","3","5","2 November 2008"," A very long war film without much going for it
","For some reason, I was shown some of this highly criticised 2001 war and romance story in English class sometime during the second half of my high school years, which would have been several years after its release. I'm not exactly sure what I thought of it at the time, and had never heard of it before, so I had no clue what the general reception of it was. I would later find out that its general reception certainly wasn't very good, probably the worst I've ever seen for a war movie! For that reason, it didn't surprise me when I finally got around to watching the entire film and it failed to impress me for the most part.<br/><br/>Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker have been friends since childhood. By 1940, they are young men, and both join the Army Air Corps. Rafe meets a nurse named Evelyn Johnson and a romantic relationship between the two quickly begins. America has not yet entered World War II, but Rafe has volunteered to join the British in battle, so he soon finds himself far away from his new lover, and Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbour in Hawaii. Eventually, Rafe's plane crashes into the water, and he is presumed dead. Obviously upset about this, Danny and Evelyn begin to develop a relationship. However, it eventually turns out that Rafe is still alive, and Evelyn and Danny soon see him again! Unfortunately, Rafe soon learns about their relationship that started while he was gone, and as Japanese forces plan their surprise attack on Pearl Harbour, conflict between the two former friends begins! <br/><br/>""Pearl Harbour"" is often criticised for a number of things, which unsurprisingly includes historical inaccuracy. Even though I'm no history buff, I'm convinced this film is very inaccurate (even that might be an understatement, I don't know) but I've learned to expect that from films based on historical events, even ones MUCH more popular than this one. However, this film is also criticised for having poor dialogue, and after seeing it myself, while I can't say I think the dialogue is consistently horrendous throughout, I can definitely understand the criticism! Another thing is the romantic scenes, which I'm also going to have to agree with, especially early in the film, before Rafe leaves, an example being Evelyn telling the other nurses how her relationship with Rafe began. Yes, a lot of the poor dialogue comes from the romantic aspect of the story early in the film, and it sometimes gets unintentionally funny, including some of the dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn, which made me laugh quite hard at least at one point! Also, after Rafe has gone, Evelyn writes a letter to him, telling him, ""It's so strange to be half a world away from you,"" as if they knew each other for a long time before he left, which may have made me snicker or at least smile. For most of the film, the unintentional humour doesn't continue, but instead, we have some tedious action sequences, and a shallow story. There may be some mildly touching moments, but not usually, not enough to make up for a mostly dull approximate three hours the film goes on for.<br/><br/>I thought there was a good chance I would end up disliking this film more than I did. I could have ended up joining the many viewers who found it to be a well below average blockbuster. Now that I've seen the whole thing, I think it's basically average. It's a severely flawed, unsatisfying, and overlong romantic war film, but personally, I'm not exactly displeased with it enough to trash it as much as so many others have (I guess it could have been worse, and much more poorly received movies have been made). However, I still don't consider it a worthwhile effort, I'm definite on that one. Lots of highly acclaimed war movies have come from Hollywood over the decades, but ""Pearl Harbour"" is far from one of them, and there are obvious reasons for that. Even when an historical film is extremely inaccurate, it can still be extremely well written and scripted, which this film certainly isn't."
"vespasian79","1","3","5","4 November 2007"," My Comments on this P-O-S are probably superfluous . . .
","I'll be very succinct, for now, and go right to the point: This movie SUCKED! It is a PIECE OF CRAP! It is so bad, I can't adequately describe just how awful it is. Are you beginning to get my point? I couldn't care less what happened to the male leads. I was fervently hoping they would all get greased, smoked, wasted, blasted, shot down, killed, blown away, nuked. You know. Dead. I was rooting for the Japs in this movie. I was cheering on the Imperial Navy. I stood up and saluted and bowed whenever Admiral Yamamoto or Admiral Nagumo appeared on screen. I think I would've probably even GIVEN them US Atomic Secrets just so they could make a thorough job of their attack without they're having to expend maximum resources in aircraft. That's how much I hate this cinematic piece of garbage. TITANIC was much better. So was the overlooked film Genius, Timothy ""Orson Wood"" Hines and his celluloid masterpiece, ""War Of The Worlds"". Okay, the Chicks were Hot, but so the f*** what? Jon Voigt was good as FDR, even believable, and Cuba Gooding was wasted in what was merely a supporting role as a Token Negro Doing His Bit, although he did it well. Just as Messers Stone and Parker say in ""Team America"", he should have had a bigger, better part. Okay, moving on to the ridiculous Alec Baldwin and the Doohicky Raid, why did the idiot director try and bastardize and rape Jimmy Doolittle's morale-building strike against Japan after Pearl Harbor? Lt. Colonel Doolittle used a medium BOMBER group with its own personnel to mount that attack, he didn't call for volunteer FIGHTER pilots of DUBIOUS quality to fly his planes. Despite Ben Afleck's continual pissing and moaning to get him to a goddam airplane during the Pearl Harbor attack, his track record in the air prior to that hadn't been too good, had it? The Germans shot his butt outta the sky during the historically dubious Battle of Britain segment (the Eagle Squadron didn't see service until well AFTER the BOB, and it's America volunteer pilots DIDN'T arrive in Blighty wearing their US uniforms, they were required to first resign their American commissions), and I WON'T forgive the Luftwaffe for letting Big Ben survive in the first place. That's something that should have been brought against Herman Goring at Nuremberg after the war. And I wouldn't have let Film Actor's Guild member Alec Baldwin lead an attack, or command anything. He played Jimmy Doolittle as if he were severely constipated, and still looking for the head on the RED October. And it doesn't surprise me that Randall Wallace had a hand in this sneak attack piece of garbage: Look what a terrible mess of Scottish history he made with ""Braveheart"". I'm going to stop for now, before my pacemaker shorts out and I die, becoming another casualty of this truly worthless waste of money. Besides, I'd bet good money that Timbo Hines LIKED this movie. It may have inspired him to make ""Bore Of The Worlds"". Actually, come to think of it, maybe HE should have directed this godawful piece of you know what. At least it would have been ENTERTAINING.<br/><br/>Peace."

","If I could rate this movie a 0 I would have. To this day i'm not sure why anyone put director Michael Bay in charge of such an important subject as Pearl Harbor. The director couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be a mainstream Hollywood romance film or a movie based on REAL historical events that happened and shaped a generation. Pearl Harbor is a muddled nonsensical monumental waste of money by a studio hack. The real events at pearl harbor only receive a big budget Hollywood CGI nod with the attention purely focused on the big name movie stars galvinating across the screen. Replace the planes with horses and the leading actress with a damsel in distress and you could have sworn the dialogue was lifted from a 1950's TV western.

In addition to its gross historical inaccuracies, it is one of the most dramatically inert piles of manure to see a cinema screen since the rotten ""Inchon"". From a technical perspective, the attack on ""Pearl Harbor"" is a fine achievement, but every positive is cancelled out by a dozen negatives. If director Michael Bay and Co. had not crapped on about the historical context of the film and its ""importance"", it could have passed for disposable rubbish.

Why are there more historical inaccuracies than you could shake a stick at? Why is reknowed comedy actor Ben Affleck involved? His idiotic mugging through every scene is simply impossible to take seriously.<br/><br/>Hugely amusing, and as a comedy I would not hesitate in giving it top marks.

The two battle scenes were what I found worth watching, and I hadn't expected anything else, from what everyone told me about the film. Had I not been fully aware that nothing other than those two scenes were worth watching, had my state of mind been completely open to this film, I would have hated it, and my review would have been a thoroughly negative one. It's more than likely that I would have commented on Jerry Bruckheimer's and Michael Bay's lack of actual talent and their extreme use of explosions(usually overplayed and overdone ones) to cover this up. But I won't. I won't comment much on plot, pacing, acting or characters. I could complain that this is just another typical, empty Hollywood film that takes a historical event and smothers in with romance and sappy sentimentality instead of bringing the real story(as if it didn't have enough impact on its own), much like they(seemingly; haven't seen it, for obvious reasons) did with Titanic. I could argue that the plot is thin and everything but the actual historical events seem bland and unimportant, that the acting seems flat, the pacing excruciatingly bad and the characters paper-thin clichés and stereotypes. But I'll try not to. Instead, I will comment on the two battle scenes, for those who share my point of view on the sappy romantic drivel of many late epic films. They look pretty good. The effects are impressive, though the CGI is overly obvious at times. Most of it looks good, and the overuse of explosions supposedly won't bother most action fans(though I, being in favor of realism in war movies, found this to be quite bothersome and annoying). If you really like strong war-action, you should check out a movie that delivers more of it(like Black Hawk Down) or at a far more realistic approach to it(like Der Untergang). However, if you want to see the Bruckheimer version of a war scene, by all means, see this film. I warn you, though, most of it is simply not worth paying attention to. I recommend this to fans of war movies with Hollywood action scenes and/or people who can't watch a movie that doesn't contain romance. 6/10"
"Oriental-Princess","Null","3","5","26 March 2005"," Reccomendable, but not for all. Best for those who don't mind a fictional romance interweaving with a historical war event.
","Pearl Harbor is definitely one of the best movies that portrayed a historical moment in time...BUT it's not the best. It's well done enough to pass as almost an epic, but it's not a movie for war fans, or ones there who really want a big action/war film.<br/><br/>It's a wonderful movie for those who want to learn about a historical event, and for those who don't usually watch the war genre. I personally can't stand anything with a war theme, but this one caught my eye. I'd only recommend this movie however, to those who are into romance; for the love story between Rafe/Evelyn & Danny/Evelyn is definitely heart tugging. With the romance interweaving with the tragedy of war, it definitely was a script that was deeply thought about."

","The trailer for this movie contained all the action and interest in the movie. You might as well not watch the first tape because you will be very sad if you do. Pearl Harbor was a carbon copy of Tora Tora Tora except that it had an hour and a half of meaningless love story; however Tora Tora Tora Made sense and had a more original name. Pearl Harbor was not even vary accurate to history because they did not want to spread hard feelings to Japan. This movie makes you WANT the Japanese to attack, and leaves you feeling glad they did."
"jimbofletch","1","3","5","12 July 2001"," This movie STINKS
","Pearl Harbor is garbage, genuine trash, but not the kind of trash that previous Bruckheimer blockbusters like The Rock and Con Air were. They were at least quite fun, but this is just trash as in complete rubbish. Bruckheimer movies are usually passably entertaining, but their non-existent characterisation, terrible dialogue and tacky storylines didn't really become overwhelmingly apparent until you watched them on video, for the movies themselves were so fast that you didn't really notice. With Pearl Harbor you do notice, because Michael Bay, actually believes that he can handle drama, and slows the >pace to fit this drama in. He cannot. Bad Boys and The Rock were fun because they were mostly tongue in cheek and action-based. Armageddon was pitiful because there was a worryingly major amount of sentiment, and all of a sudden you realised that Bay was actually trying to make us care about the characters, which is all very well if you're actually good at that sort of thing, but Bay isn't. (SPOILER ALERT FOR ARMAGEDDON)When Bruce Willis died at the end of Armageddon it was funny! That can't be right. Still, at least that film was ten percent good (the start, any action sequence), but there are literally no redeeming features in Pearl Harbor. The fact that it is historically inaccurate didn't bother me that much, for there were far more obvious flaws apparent to make me care about that.<br/><br/>REASONS WHY PEARL HARBOR STINKS!!!<br/><br/>1. Pearl Harbor is COLD. As in totally dead. There is literally no emotional involvement, except for that of boredom and suicide contemplation. It's characters are so unrealistic and corny that you're hoping the whole film is a parody, but it's not. Are we actually supposed to care what happens to these ""people""? Obviously. Why would Bay devote an agonisingly long amount of screen time about their laughably pathetic romance?<br/><br/>
2. The script is awful. But it's not even bad enough to be unintentionally funny. It's just boring.<br/><br/>3. The action stinks. Everyone's going on about how good the actual Pearl harbor attack sequence was. It was rubbish! The shot following the missile was so ridiculous that it belonged in the hilarious excesses of Con Air, not this nonsense! I felt no fear for the characters under attack because they weren't characters, which made the attack (I heard it was bordering on the terrifying when it happened in real life, just a rumour)completely ineffective. I was so bored with the first hour or so of terrible cinema that this spectacular but completely uninvolving sequence was too little and too, too late.<br/><br/>4. The song at the end. Makes Celine Dion sound incredible.<br/><br/>5. The overworked camera movements. Notice how the camera moves for no reason in all Bruckheimer travesties. It doesn't add ANYTHING. Bay's just desperately trying to look cool. He fails.<br/><br/>6. Too long. Top Gun is the best Bruckheimer film becasue it's under two hours long and doesn't outstay its welcome. Top Gun is still rubbish, but at least it isn't boring. Pearl harbor is THREE hours long. Every 180 minutes a total waste of my time.<br/><br/>All in all, Pearl Harbor is the worst blockbuster i have ever seen along with Wild Wild West. The thing is is that i have actually contributed money towards this terrible film and I am, in the filmmakers' eyes, no different from someone who paid the same amount of money as me to see it yet enjoyed it. I am therefore no longer seeing rubbish blockbuster films simply for the sake that they are the biggest films of the year. You see other films this year like Almost Famous, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and realise that films can be good, and that's a relief, for I become very cynical with the state of current cinema after watching this. What has happened to blockbusters? They were always just entertainment (with the Indiana Jones films and Ghostbusters being golden examples), but now they're not even entertaining. I was never expecting Pearl Harbor to be profound, or a masterpiece. All i wanted was to be entertained yet not insulted for a couple of hours (or if you insist, THREE hours). You did not entertain. You definitely did INSULT. Of all the blockbusters coming soon, i will only watch AI and Planet of the Apes because they have good directors behind them who can make entertainment. As for Tomb Raider and Jurassic Park III, not a chance. They won't be as bad as Pearl Harbor, but they'll come close."

I'm sorry but it's boring. Give the audience some credit and pay for a decent screenwriter.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is totally wooden and unconvincing. Kate Beckinsale looks like she's walked on to the wrong movie set by mistake. And do we have to have the whopping and hollering of joy every time an American character patriotically kills the enemy, it's embarrassing and out of place for that time period. To make matters worse the director's just can't let America finish the movie by getting it's butt kicked. You can not compare the Doolittle raid on Japan as some major military victory and certainly it should not be seen in the same context as the Pearl Harbour attack. If you've got some money to spend on a decent war story wait for 'Band of Brothers' mini series to come out on DVD and don't bother with this tripe."

Worst of all is the insulting of the intelligence of anyone who knows even a little bit about what actually happened that day. No nurses died at Pearl Harbor. Sorry. No women in service died that day at all, actually. We all know that women made a good, solid contribution to the war effort, but historical fact cannot be shoved aside for the sake of symbolism. The women who died at Pearl Harbor were all civilians and, embarrassingly, were all likely caused by US antiaircraft shells landing in the civilian areas of the island, according to the National Park Service. <br/><br/>So there you go.

"freemantle_uk","1","4","8","27 March 2009"," Really Bad
","This is what the world really needs a Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, Randall Wallace film starting Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale that re-writes American history and World War Two.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour is meant to be a film about the famous attack by the Japanese Navy that forced the United States into get involved in World War Two in a military scene. However, what could have been an interesting and entertaining study of the military and intelligence failures/successes and the change of American attitudes fails because Randall Wallace (who wrote the awful Braveheart) turned the story into no more then a romantic film whilst Michael Bay tries to pay to his strengths which is bombastic action and Jerry Bruckheimer whilst is the master of dumb blockbusters. The film markers felt that they needed to turn an American tragedy into a success and a patriotic exercise.<br/><br/>The casting was terrible. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all can't act and they end up as the leads. Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyn, a Navy nurse, who ends up having a relationship with Rafe (Ben Affleck). However Rafe is called to serve in the Eagle Squadron in the Battle of Britain and asks Danny (Josh Hartnett) to take care of Evelyn for him. However when they both think Red had died they end up comfort each other and end up having a relationship together when stationed in Pearl Harbour. But Red comes back and you can imagine he is a little upset and falls up with both of them. But things get patched up when Japan attacks. I did not believe in the relationships that Evelyn has but if anything it should be Rafe and Danny have sex with each other.<br/><br/>They are some subplots as well in the film. There is President Roosevelt (Jon Voight) who has to lead the country through the crisis and Voight is best performer in the film. Another element is the story of Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is the first black sailor to win the Navy Cross. However it felt like Cuba Gooding Jr. was no more then the token black guy. There is also some romantic elements involving Pilots and Nurses (the nurses are a right bunch of slags).<br/><br/>The writing is awful. There is nothing but war movie clichés and terrible dialogue. The film has historical inaccuracies, but Wallace has never seen history as an important in historical films. He insults the memories of British and American pilots and portrays the Japanese as a blood thirsty and backwards people. The number of Americans who fought in the Battle of Britain was small and not servicemen picked by the air force. They were volunteers who opposed Fascism and not in the American Air Force. They were brave men, like the British, Canadians, French, Polish, Czechs etc... who all fought in the battle. The other major problems is they is no reason why the Japanese attacked America, no look at the run up to the war. There is only a brief mention that Japan was running out of oil but that's it. Also the film makes out that Red and Danny did most of the fighting for the air force, able to fly fighters and bombers and getting involved in the Doolittle raids which insults the real pilots who were involved. As well the film makes out that the Doolittle Raid was an important event, but it was really a foot-note, doing nothing for against the Japanese whilst only a propaganda tool for the Americans. I'm a believe that historical accuracy should be maintained all times in films and shouldn't take too much of an artistic license to real events. But Wallace doesn't understand that. The same critics and fans who praised Braveheart thinking history isn't important take a hypocritical view with Pearl Harbour. Americans feel insulting other countries history is okay, but when it comes to American history it's basically 'How dare they'. Roger Ebert is a good example.<br/><br/>The visuals are impressive and some of the scenes during the bombing sequence are fun, but it isn't enough. The whole film is too long and drags. During the bombing sequence some moments are totally unbelievable and makes the film silly. It's the same with the end after the places clash in China, with American pilots with small arms easily kill Japanese soldiers, but only one of them dies. The final narration was sickening saying America never suffered a defeat, recovered and became all powerful: what about Vietnam? What about the efforts of Britain, the Commonwealth (i.e. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand etc...), the Soviet Union and the Chinese? Bay was properly the worst choice of director because he is no more then an action director. He doesn't do deep story or romance or very much really. The film needed a director of gravitas like Spielberg or Scorsese to happen a lot of material. But most of the blame is reserved for Wallace.<br/><br/>A new film about Pearl Harbour would have had so much potential but Americans can't accept a defeat. The military, diplomatic and intelligence all could have made an interesting film or book, but Wallace thought an fictional story was needed. No it isn't!<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour tries to be a hybrid of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, but fails on both. It is a really bad film."
"laura-vanbaren","3","4","8","31 August 2008"," Poorly excuse of a movie
","You know, every once in a while people have to make a romantic love story movie with a historic event as an excuse to make the story. Pearl Harbor is one of those movies. I bet all of the girls between 12 and 16 years old will drool with the sight of Josh Hartnett, and if you've got bad taste Ben Affleck (not that I like Hartnett that much, but if I had to choose... well, you know), in a love story movie.<br/><br/>Well anyway, I'm one of those people who hate that people shameless take a historic event, turn it inside out and make a love story out of it and then are still claiming it's all about the event. O sure, Pearl Harbor shows what happened so many years ago, and perhaps it's even true that during World War II there were two men madly in love with the same woman at Pearl Harbor, but if you want to show what happened there in WWII, do you think it's really necessary to show the ups and downs of two fools, blinded by love? I don't think so.<br/><br/>And then there's the disappointment of Ben Affleck. I didn't believe him one bit, even though I was such a foolish girl of 12 years old when I watched the movie. At one time I thought by myself: this movie can only be a bit more good, if Affleck dies. He's one of my least favorite actors, I hate watching him, I don't believe him, I don't like his looks, and I don't like the way he acts. Well, maybe that's personal, but in the end it's always personal how we think of movies, and his presence doesn't make anything good.<br/><br/>I'll give some credits to Josh Hartnett, because I find it kind of cute how he's doing his best to give this movie something.

"Phantasm01","8","4","8","15 May 2006"," Run for the hills! It's a positive review!!!!
","I'll just say this and bring it to the table; Pearl Harbor ain't that bad.<br/><br/>Have you clicked that ""No"" button yet? Great, I'll continue.<br/><br/>Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle. To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it. And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as ""Pearl Harbor,"" directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that ""Will live in infamy."" Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event. And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement. This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with ""Titanic,"" there's no better way to do it than with a love story.<br/><br/>Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished. Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective. By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective. And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.<br/><br/>Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like ""Bombardier,"" ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""The Bridges At Toko-Ri,"" than the more recent ""Saving Private Ryan"" (though it does have ""Ryan's"" same level of realism). It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story. She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story. If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, ""over-reaction"") to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.<br/><br/>Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty. Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else. In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.<br/><br/>The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha). One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical ""accuracy"" of the film, but without question, ""Pearl Harbor"" succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable. It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered."

","I can see why people wouldn't like this film, it's not for everyone.  To me it seems like director, Michael Bay, took his formula for ""Armageddon"" and Cameron's ""Titanic"" and tried to mold it into ""Pearl Harbor"".  But, despite that, I still liked the film a great deal.<br/><br/>I do have a few complaints about the film though.  There were a number of particular shots in the film that were filmed in a very strange way, there was a slight blur to them.  I just don't get stuff like that, I didn't see why that was necessary, I think it kind of took away from the reality of what was going on.  My second complaint is the length of the film, the film was just too long.  Granted, it went by rather quickly, but still...there were a number of shots that were just redundant or unnecessary.  Personally, I also thought the character, Red, was pretty annoying with that stupid stuttering that he did.  One other thing I would have changed is that Betty died, wasn't too fond of that.  That's really about everything I have to complain about.<br/><br/>The story was pretty good, although, definitely more of a love story than a war-story.  That right there is definitely going to anger some people.  Yes, there is lots of shooting and things getting blown up, but there's a great deal of romance to the film.  I thought the story was pretty interesting and fairly well done.<br/><br/>The special effects are the reason enough to see this film, they are fantastic.  I cannot believe there are people on this site (and everywhere else) that claim the special effects were not well done!  You HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!  The special effects are just unbelievable!  I can't even imagine how much work must have gone into this film.<br/><br/>The acting in the film was fine for my tastes.  There were a few cheesy scenes, but overall, I thought everybody did a great job.  As far as the cast goes, I thought it was excellent.  There was a surprising amount of familiar faces throughout this film.  I was a bit surprised to see Dan Aykroyd in this film, but in the end he pulled it off.  I won't really go into the cast, but all the players did a fine job.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this is Michael Bay movie, so you can expect some cool action sequences and this is also a big love story.  So when/if you see this film (assuming you haven't already), treat it like one.  I thought it was a good film, with a lot of good stuff.  It's not the best film I've ever seen, or even the best film of 2001, but it was a good film.  When/If you see the film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"FlickJunkie-2","6","4","8","27 December 2001"," Another puff piece from the master of puff
","Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.<br/><br/>The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls' is merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the 40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all. Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn (Kate Beckingsale), who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.<br/><br/>Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers', `say' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.<br/><br/>The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic if one had actually been there.<br/><br/>The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.<br/><br/>I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I dislike Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).<br/><br/>Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.  Thanks Jerry."
"Doylenf","Null","4","8","20 December 2001"," Spectacular war film with routine romantic drama...
","If PEARL HARBOR had been made back in the '40s, you'd see a war film with a romantic triangle from stars like Tyrone Power, John Payne and Anne Baxter (ever see CRASH DIVE with Power and Dana Andrews both in love with Baxter?). What we have here is a good, old-fashioned romantic triangle yarn set against the spectacular bombing of Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The action scenes are awesome with the relentless attack portrayed with searing realism. And the History Channel documentary on Pearl Harbor is chock full of details used in the screenplay, even including the bit about the cook who seized his opportunity to be a gunner. <br/><br/>This is definitely a well-crafted film that shouldn't be panned as extensively as some of the reviewers here have chosen to do. The performances are first rate, sincere and earnest with Ben Affleck doing an outstanding job as Rafe, completely believable in his role as the pilot who is believed killed but returns to resume his romantic partnership with a nurse. Outstanding in supporting roles are Jon Voigt, strongly resembling FDR, and Alec Baldwin.<br/><br/>A disappointment is the score, which I assumed would make full use of '40 swing tunes from that era but instead uses a bland love song that sounds like a leftover from 'Titanic' and never uses the music in a way that evokes the 1940s. Nor does it have any power in the dramatic moments.<br/><br/>But above all, this is an enjoyable enough war film which relies heavily on the old-fashioned Hollywood triangle romances that came out of the '40s when patriotism was at an all-time high."

","This movie was the bomb!!  The romance plot was much better than Titanic. Love triangles always make for better storylines. The cinematography was amazing!! The entire movie looked so realistic. If you're into action/war films, the attack on Pearl Harbor scenes will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie also tugs at your heart. Not just with the romance story between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett's characters, but also with the feeling that all those innocent men lost their lives that day. You will find yourself welling up with tears over that more than with the love storyline. As history goes, we all know what really happened. However, the biggest surprise comes with how the love triangle story plays out. You will be shocked at the ending (some might not be, but I was.) I gave this movie a 10+ and I fully recommend you go see this film while it's still in the theaters. It's one of those films you have to see in a theater.

"outofmychair","10","5","11","27 May 2001"," Best movie I have ever seen
","I saw a preview for Pearl Harbor several weeks back, and immediately I was interested.  I saw the movie opening night and was in awe.  It was one of those movies that after you watch it, you just sit back in your chair in awe.  I've read a few reviews in complete disappointment.  One said that the plot was too corny.  The movie was terrific.  Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, wrote this.  The directing was great too.  One of my favorite things about the movie is how powerful he makes scenes to the viewer.  There are a few parts that especially stand out in my mind.  One of the ships are sinking and there are men trapped inside.  Water is feeling up the ship.  On top, men are trying desperately to get the men out, but they can already tell its a lost effort.  They get a hole in to the ship just as it is moments away from being completely pulled under by the ocean.  One of the soldiers reaches his hands up through the hole.  He is reaching for life, reaching for help, reaching for hope, reaching for nothing... One of the soldiers grabs his hand and holds it until all movement stops.  At that point, the hands just stand still.  Another part is where hundreds of soldiers are in the water treading for their lives.  They stand defiantly against all hope and against Death whom seems to be standing more on their enemy's side then their own.  While they are stranded, Japanese continuously shoot at them while they lay helpless in the water.  The noteworthy part of this scene is where the American Flag falls into the water.  There it is waving in the water filled with bullet holes, Yet it still waves showing that it may be a hole in America and a big loss, but America will still pull through.  There are many amazing scenes just as the above two mentioned. The special effects were without doubt the best I have ever seen.  The plot set aside from Pearl Harbor, was enough to make me cry.  There was definitely adequate character depth.  In all, the movie was the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen A LOT of movies.  I urge you all to give it a chance and go see it."

These war hungry people (the Japanese) didn't even surrender after the first one - it took two bombs!!!!!!!  Other than this the movie was utterly fantastic - if you're a patriot and have any love for our country you can't help but be teary eyed through a lot of the movie - not just because of the events but because of the love story too, which was no more contrived than Titanic (in fact it was better!).  The visuals were stunning - the acting was good - I had no complaints.  I felt fullfilled after this move was over.  It was long but well worth it!!  If you like movies, go see it.

","I spoke my mind about it in an earlier note and enjoyed reading other comments, obviously some in favour some against.  Democratically speaking, everyone is undoubtably entitled to their opinion and it should be respected, but, one thing really struck me and made quite an impression on me... people love to hate...<br/><br/>Point of fact moviegoers:  the film never supported that it was a documentary.  There were, no arguing there, boo boos {even a couple that were whoppers}.  But, if people want text book history {which is often criminally distorted and misquoted} they should turn to exactly that... history text books.<br/><br/>The Next Titanic?  In all honesty other than great effects and a tear jerking, sinking Di Caprio I thought the film was absolute rubbish with nothing other than a very vague plot.  Was Pearl Harbour {English spelling folks, I'm not illiterate}a love story?  Oh, yes!  Remember that anachronistic, medievil word people seem to think that they can do without in this hitech, hipowered era?  Was the heroine unable to make up her mind?... Yeah, right, as if none of us has ever been in any dilemma of any sort in our lifetimes...  Although those who chose to shred this point of the film to pieces might do well to look a little deeper into the actual human dilemma presented.  By the way, some of us might also do well to ask any participant of any war what it is that war can do to people's minds and hearts... but why take into account the human factor, hey?... hitech era remember?<br/><br/>Cliche?  Without a doubt.  I've been very happily married {to the same man I might add} for 15 years and life is full of cliches which touch us every time when they come from the heart... and our film heroes had plenty of heart.  Predictable ending?  I would say so.  But, my God my eyes were still riveted to the screen.  Why?  Cause our heroes carried the whole thing off superbly.  I still say there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema.<br/><br/>Moviebuffs, why not just let your hair down and simply enjoy?  Why does everything have to be turned into an intellectual issue?  Which is more or less the case with the westernised world nowadays.  I said it before, I have an I.Q. of 180 and if you think MY habits and/or preferences leave something to be desired from that intellectual point of view, you wouldn't belieeeeve some of the ones Einstein had.<br/><br/>So, if intellect is the issue here... perhaps you would do well to do a doublecheck... and just sit back and enjoy a damn good film with actors who oudid themselves and were also veeeery easy on the eyes... unless everything bores you, anyway...<br/><br/>Way to go Ben..."

","When I critique a movie, I look at 4 basic categories.  Character Development, did I understand the character's history and life, did I relate to the character, did I know everything I had to but not more than I needed to?  Plot.  Did I buy into the story?  Did it resolve everything it started? Did it follow logical sequencing?  Did it keep me interested?  How was the ending?  Set, Design, and Costume.  Explains itself.  And the most important category is the ever popular Entertainment Value.  For the first time in my life, a movie scores a perfect 10 in all 4 categories!  Pearl Harbor is quite possibly the best movie, I have ever saw.<br/><br/> Character Development - Beautiful.  I felt like I was in their lives.  We new everything we had to know about each character.  One Problem.  How did Rafe go from struggling to read and write to writing and reading the eloquent letters to Evelyn?  Don't get it.  How ever the movie did a great job of giving us something at stake in every character's life.<br/><br/> Set, Design, Costume - The battle of Pearl Harbor was one of the best war sequences of all time.  They did a great job with costumes and sets.  A lot had to do with filming on location in Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/> Plot - Wonderful.  It flowed so well that you don't realize it is so long. You can't cut anything out.  Great Ending.  The battle of Pearl Harbor wasn't the climax.  Great Job.<br/><br/> Entertainment Value - Once again, one of the best movies I ever saw.

","A good film to sit and watch but that's because the acting and the action lifts the film above a very weak script. The love triangle dynamic is almost completely botched, where Josh Hartnett falls for Kate beckinsale (while I dont blame him) almost instantly because Ben Affleck died and other reasons that are never quite explained. Overlooking the blatant jingoism and historical inaccuracy, like for instance the whole reason the Japanese attacked us is completely left out for no reason other than for Bay to push Jingoistic right wing propaganda. HOWEVER, I'll give the film this the films main action sequence involving the attack on Pearl harbor is very well put together and the film, in my opinion poses some interesting questions about how much the United States knew about the attack prior to it happening and that they could have possibly avoided it. It's easy to crap on this film, most of the criticisms are legitimate (I didnt even mention the poor dialogue) but the film is entertaining enough to watch and enjoy."

I couldn't believe people given guardians of the Galaxy a 7 something on IMDb and 6 for Pearl Harbor. Like all those marvel movies are like pieces of shot to me.

"anthonyspera","9","2","3","25 June 2017"," I loved this movie. Not being facetious
","Completely non spoiler review: See this movie and don't read the other reviews. They are, in my humble opinion, not reviewing a movie. They are nit picking a historical account, sometimes based on their own biases and sometimes based on their disappointment in what really happened! For example, yes, there is a token black guy. THEY WERE ALL TOKEN BLACK GUYS BACK THEN! It's called discrimination. It still exists! How is that Michael Bay's fault? Anyway, watch this movie to see a good movie with amazing effects, likable characters, enough history to teach you something (if you don't know the history behind Pearl Harbor) and the best ending this movie could possibly have.<br/><br/>Mildly spoiler review (but if you know your history, this is not a surprise: Japan attacked the USA at Pearl Harbor in 1941!):<br/><br/>When I was a boy, my father took me to see the story of the Pearl Harbor attack in the movie ""Tora, Tora, Tora"". I still remember the room shaking as the planes took off from the deck! I looked up at my dad with a huge smile on my face. Yes, that was a good movie. More like a documentary than a movie. At the end of the movie I felt empty. Was that it? I was about 10 years old and confused (also disturbed by the scene where the son lands his plane all bloody and screaming). My dad then explained to me that we (the USA) won the war and etc, etc, etc. But the scene at the end with the 2 military guys just chatting was so weirdly confident to me. Didn't they realize they just had lost thousands of men to a rotten sneak attack? There were no characters throughout the whole movie to get emotionally attached to, just like a documentary.<br/><br/>Fast forward about 25 years. My wife and I went to the movies and saw Pearl Harbor. I loved it. I've seen in about 4 times now and still love this movie. The scenes were excellent, the characters likable and the emotion felt right. A good balance of respect for the subject matter and the true parts of the story. If you don't know the story, the movie tells you. But, unlike Tora, Tora, Tora, they weren't trying to make a documentary, and they included some relatively minor characters (like the ""token black guy"" some other reviewers are upset about (should he not have been included at all?!?) and Michael Bay found a way to include an excellent story about a lesser known story: the Doolittle raid and he ended on that note instead of just the defeat at Pearl Harbor. Frankly, a brilliant way to tell both stories and have the audience leave feeling better about the story.<br/><br/>I realize I'm in the minority here, but I'm confused about what people hated so much about this movie and I can't wrap my head around it. I read a couple dozen reviews and it seems to me that they just can't understand that they are watching a movie, not a documentary.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good, the music great and the action scenes fantastic. And, I am a history buff and have read many WW2 books, including the entire series written by Winston Churchill, so yes, I knew where Pearl Harbor wasn't completely accurate. Had it been, Micheal Bay could have called it ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" and the haters would have blasted him for just doing a remake of that movie.<br/><br/>The nitpicking in the reviews about ""that model jeep was not being used in that year"" and ""that guy's name was misspelled"" and ""this US 5$ bill not yet in circulation in that year"" and ""those are not the exact two guys who flew the planes"" are hilarious. In 2001, the attack on Pearl Harbor was 50 years old. What percentage of the movie goers would have any idea about these details? Could Michael Bay have been less lazy and/or more accurate? Sure. If you want to see the exact story, the History Channel has some excellent programs. If you want to see a great movie, which is about 85% historically accurate and captures the zeitgeist of the times it portrays, watch this movie: Pearl Harbor is excellent."

The re-enactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor is done in a very stunning and visually appealing way. Do I think it is absolutely geek-historically accurate? No. But there is not another movie that does a better job of capturing the attack. I have watched and read many documentaries on the attack on Pearl Harbor. While it lacks certain historical credentials, it more than makes up with great and awesome CGI! Not ridiculous CGI that takes you out of reality, but really riveting CGI that actually works and draws you in to the movie. There is a great deal of historical accuracy in the movie, and the less than accurate stuff did not bother me one bit! I am not a huge Ben Affleck fan. But he does not disappoint in this movie. Yes, the movie spends a lot of time developing the complicated dramatic romance between Ben and Josh and Kate Beckinsdale, but I have decided it doesn't take too much away from a very satisfying War Movie about Pearl Harbor and the aftermath! No other Pearl Harbor movie has ever done as good a job at depicting the attack as well as this movie visually. And what about the Doolittle Raid On Tokyo? That was done exceedingly well! What is not to like about this movie? The special effects and CGI are awesome! This movie is worthy of a high rating.

","Pearl Harbor is probably one of the biggest targets for movie critics, everyone seems to enjoy picking this movie apart. I have seen Pearl Harbor several times and have enjoyed it, but it is obviously two movies blended together; a historical action/drama and a cheesy romance. The Pearl Harbor attack scenes ( Dec 7th, 1941 ) were amazing, some of the best war movie action sequences ever. John Voight was outstanding as President Roosevelt. But the romance part of the movie was nauseating, and seemed to be detached from the war story. A few cliché scenes didn't help either, and did the movie really need a character that stutters ( though I am a fan of Ewen Bremmer ). It was hard to take Dan Aykroyd seriously as a navy captain as he was a cast member from SNL. The Doolittle Raid was a great add to the movie ( 'We're going to Tokyo....and we're going to bomb it' got the adrenaline going! ), but after the raid was over, the movie seemed to go nowhere, like 'ok, what now?'.

Sure, the Pearl harbor sequence was silly in places, like flying down streets, and the whole tower sequence, but fun silly. And the Doolittle thing was great. But here's my point.

The rest is, shall we say, less than stellar. Never mind that only twenty minutes is spent on the attack of Pearl Harbor...never mind that those twenty minutes had only one accurate fact (Yes kiddies, Cuba Gooding did get the one ""vaguely accurate"" portrayal in the entire movie), never mind that they try to get you to believe that two fighter pilots suddenly become qualified multi-engine, medium bomber pilots in order to participate in the Doolittle raid on Japan...never mind that those same two pilots were flying Curtis P-40 Tomahawks during the attack on Pearl Harbor, AND matching the Japanese flying Zero's (Two real life pilots DID take off from Haleiwa field during the attack. After calling ahead to get their planes ready,they drove 12 miles and jumped right into their cockpits, then downed 5 attacking planes.

","This film is so bad, it's almost worth unclicking the 'contains spoilers' box, then being banned from ever reviewing again by including them anyway. But I won't, I'll be good.<br/><br/>Please, I beg of you, for the sake of all that is good and pure and right in this world, don't watch this moronic abomination of a film! As one can see by watching anything else Mechael Bay does, he's great at making things explode at slow motion montages, empty romance and irrelevant hot women, but who thought these were good ingredients for a real-life war film? Transformers, yes. The appalling opening actions (for the Americans, that is) of a catastrophic war spread across the entire globe? No. <br/><br/>It's a real shame, because there was a window for the actions of Pearl Harbor to be retold for a new generation; Tora! Tora! Tora! was 30 years old when 'PH' (the film will be 'PH' now) was released. Instead, a great chance has been missed. History takes a back seat and in its place we're given a clichéd love triangle, a brainless script and a over- sentimentalised score. <br/><br/>We're all familiar with the notion of girl and boy people falling in love, boy going off to war and girl hooking up with boy's best mate. If such a cliché is to be used, it's bearable if it's used only as a vessel to tell a real story by proxy. What Bay has done quite expertly is make a boring storyline the centrepiece, then blow up everything around it to make it seem exciting. What is unforgivable is that he has used real events to do this, cheapening the real loss of life and harrowing scenes that actually occurred. History is bent and twisted to make it seem more heroic and and thus palatable, yet Pearl Harbor was nothing of the sort. It was a calculated first strike from the Japanese that failed totally in its main goal and a mixture of dumb luck and bad calls with occasional moments of good sense from the Americans that combined to cause a colossal amount of damage and more importantly, a huge loss of life. <br/><br/>If an alien came down and you used 'PH' to show what happened on Dec 7 1941, he'd be forgiven in thinking the Americans won the battle! The Doolittle Raid was almost 5 months later and in that time the Japanese ran riot in the Pacific, most notably in the Java Sea, Guam and Wake Island. All of this is glossed over! If you want to see just how historically inaccurate this film is, check out the list of anachronisms and factual errors listed on IMDb.<br/><br/>Sadly, all you are left with is an extremely patchy romance and the odd big explosion. In other words; classic Michael Bay. He should not be allowed anywhere near history again, to make up for the faked that he wasn't anywhere near it for this film.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour. Watch Tora! Tora! Tora! and then watch Princess Diaries. You'll get historical fidelity, some big explosions and then some good clean romance as well. And not a Michael Bay in sight."

I have seen it a couple of times on TV since and have sat through parts of it due to sheer boredom, a mistake I am unlikely to repeat while I still have full control of my cognitive faculties. This film is shallow, historically inaccurate, dumb, loud and jingoistic. It's an insult to the Americans, the Japanese, and the film industry. John Wayne's guilt at dodging the draft caused him to churn out war movies that are more watchable than this turkey. The acting is woeful and the characters are paper thin. Affleck and Hartnett mumble through their performances.Alec Baldwin has a few good lines as Jimmy Doolittle, but he's wasting his time here. Beckinsale is underfed eye-candy. Cuba Gooding Jr plays Token Black Guy, and the normally watchable and engaging John Voight is reduced to a caricature of FDR. <br/><br/>The attack on Pearl itself is kinda shoehorned in there as an afterthought, oh yeah we've spent 2 hours doing this love story, we might as well put some ships blowing up while we're at it.

The writing is very poor, the direction is below sub-par, and the acting is beyond clichéd and hammy. The only redeeming grace is some of the action, but I'll get to that later in the review.<br/><br/>The story, or lack thereof, is the love between a pilot (Ben Affleck) in the army, and a navy nurse (Kate Beckinsale.) He goes off to England to fly with the RAF (historically makes no sense as no American officer could ever do that before Pearl Harbor) and is assumed dead. His best friend from childhood (Josh Hartnett), also a pilot, looks after the nurse and they begin to fall in love. But *SHOCK* *AWE* GASP* he's alive and the dreaded love triangle forms. All this entails really really really bad dialogue, love scenes that are extremely awkward, and absolutely no character development. All three actors are at their worst pretty much (only Affleck has saved himself through the power of directing later in his career.) <br/><br/>Right now you're thinking, what does all this have to do with Pearl Harbor? Well, the Japanese are planning the attack while Hartnett and Beckinsale kiss and say stupid lines, and are on their way when Affleck shows up again. Then after an HOUR AND A HALF, we get the attack. This is the only pretty good part of the movie, and the special effects are really good. But even the bad writing can get in there. One of the worst moments of the movie is when the Oklahoma capsizes (great sequence by the way) is marred by a NAVY SAILOR says ""I Can't Swim!"" WHAT THE ****???? This movie makes the U.S. Military look like complete morons and total idiots when it comes to fighting a war. It's humiliating to those who really died on December 7. <br/><br/>Then Affleck and Hartnett get in the air and shoot down some Japanese zero fighters.<br/><br/>Those 40 minutes of action are over and we're right back to the love triangle, but thank God ever so briefly. The Doolittle Raid occurs, also a good part of the movie. The ending I don't want to talk about because I'm getting sick of talking about this movie. Typical ending though. Danny dies Affleck gets Beckinsale back. Happy Ending!! Hooray!! HELP! There's a ""happy ending"" in a movie about Pearl Harbor. that's just wrong<br/><br/>Three hours of total abomination. While I do praise some of the action, the rest of the movie is insufferable. Michael Bay is at his lowest here, and ""Bravehart"" writer Randall Wallace has effectively destroyed his career in Hollywood with one of the worst scripts I have ever heard. Avoid this movie at all costs. It's inaccurate, boring, terrible, and should be destroyed."

","Pearl Harbor is a war film that mixes action and romantic drama elements.It features a large ensemble cast, including Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Dan Aykroyd, Colm Feore, Mako, Tom Sizemore, Jaime King and Jennifer Garner.It is a dramatic re-imagining of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.The film was written by Randall Wallace and directed by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>When the Japanese military launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on that fateful day in December of 1941, the United States was caught completely off guard by the formidable force of 350 heavily armed aircraft and leading to one of the most tragic events in U.S. military history. How could the military base not have known about such a massive attack? Was it due to the amazing strategy of the Japanese pilots, or did their fighters just hit the right place at the most unexpected and vulnerable time.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor tries to be the Titanic of war movies, but it's just a tedious romance filled with laughably bad dialogue. For the first 90 minutes of the movie, Affleck and Beckinsale find a nice, appealing chemistry that plays on his strengths as a movie star and hers as a serious actress as he gives her glamour, she gives him smarts. Their truncated romance - the beginning of which is told in flashback so we can get right to the point where he has to leave her to go to England - works, thanks to their charm. They're no Kate and Leo from Titanic but they're pretty darn adorable in their own right. Hartnett, as the not entirely unwelcome third wheel, squints bravely but makes only a slight dent in the film. Everyone else in Pearl Harbor - from Cuba Gooding Jr.'s brave navy seaman to Jon Voight's able impersonation of FDR - is pretty much a glorified walk-on, taking a backseat to the pyrotechnics and action sequences that keep the three-hour film in fairly constant motion. But when that action does take hold, Pearl Harbor is quite a thrilling ride.The 40 minute action sequence is spectacular though.It's just a bit unfortunate that such an incredible, noble story, one which turned a nation around and galvanized a generation into action, should be told by such weak storytellers."

","This movie is as terrible as you have heard. It is bloated, overblown and tediously overlong. It is very slow paced, the performances are absolutely deplorable and laughable. And it is an absolute bore. The only good sequence in this movie is when the Japanese are bombing Pearl harbor. The visual effects were outstanding, but that does not make up for the awful performances. Michael Bay should have done his research on the events around the time Pearl Harbor was bombed. Reason being, if he did that research, the movie might have been much better than it actually is. On the whole, this movie is just a downright atrocity. Do not bother with this movie. It is just a waste of your time and money."

","Calling this film awful is an understatement. I can't even begin to explain the historical inaccuracies in this film. Every director and screen is allowed and expected to take some artistic license with a story but to totally ignore facts is pathetic. What were the writers thinking? This movie is worse than The Memphis Belle and that is saying a lot. Now for what I consider the worst part of this piece of junk; the casting of Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle is an INSULT to that great man's memory and legacy. Baldwin, politically stands for nearly everything that Doolittle stood and fought against. Over and over in his long life, General Doolittle put his life on the line for his country and what he believed in. Many of the safety standards in aviation today were pioneered by Gen. Doolittle. He made the world's first instrument and helped to develop the first ILS systems. Volumes have been written about what he did. And he lived by a code that a person should do what ever they could to leave the world a better place than it was when they entered it."

You might even be surprised that they weren't shown flying the Enola Gay when bombs were finally dropped on Japan. The story centers around a love triangle you couldn't care less about. Much of the time and resources used to embelish the bad soap opera storyline squash any hopes to see a realistic portrayal of serious and factual events and history makers that are real American History, and the very real reasons the United States entered World War II. The Japanese military portrayal in the attack is whitewashed. Don't expect to see anything remotely honest about this Roosevelt, who in actuality had hoped to enter the war on the side of Great Brittain since 1939. Wow, what a lousy movie."

","Welcome to the worst war movie ever made, the technical details on the aircraft, ordnance and use are mostly erroneous. The legal requirements for service personnel prior to US entry into WWII are totally misquoted.<br/><br/>Examples, the view of the bomb propeller spinning in the galley of the Arizona and then the bomb going off is impossible. This propeller (and one like it in the tail), is a safety. It operates by screwing itself off in the airstream as the bomb falls. If the bomb is stationary, the propeller will not spin and come off. Therefore the bomb will not go off.<br/><br/>Additionally Fighter pilots in the US Army Air Corps, would not and could not fly bombers. The criteria for joining Doolittle's squadron was to be very proficient in the B25. No fighter pilot would have made the cut.<br/><br/>Prior to WWII, service personnel who wanted to fight for any other country, had to totally resign from the US military. A naturalized citizen had to relinquish their US citizenship. This was due to the Neutrality Act.<br/><br/>On top of that the love story is, at best,inane.<br/><br/>I guess the writer and producer wanted to cut costs and omitted the Technical Advisers.

"deconstructing","5","2","3","16 April 2011"," All over the place
","Pearl Harbor is way too long, way too all over the place and it takes itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>With its blatant ignoring of historical facts, Pearl Harbor is disrespectful towards victims of the tragedy. But it's hardly the only movie of the sorts (Titanic, I am looking at you). It's also hardly the only one that tries to mix overly sentimental romance story with real life historical events. So, what went wrong here? First of all, it's too long, and it focuses on way too many things, which in turn makes the film lose its point. The bombing of Pearl Harbor is hardly the central theme of the film, and it's a huge mistake. Because of the need to end the movie with victorious note for the US, the film continues long after the Pearl Harbor attack, telling us, completely unnecessary and out of the place, another story, of the Doolittle Raid. The film completely loses its pace and coherence. Cheesy dialogues and uninspiring love triangle don't help, nor does the fact the plot is completely predictable 20 minutes into the film.<br/><br/>The cast does its best with the lines given, but the acting is wooden and forced. Supporting characters prove to be more interesting than the main trio. Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn seems bland and without any personality. Ben Affleck's Rafe is cocky and egoistic, not at all a noble hero he's supposed to be. Josh Hartnett seems completely confused as Danny and you can just feel he doesn't want to be there. In a way, it works for his character, and he almost makes us believe he's this shy farm boy who doesn't know how to ask a girl out on a date. In a way, he proves to be one of the few things that draw people - teenage, female people - to this film.<br/><br/>Is it the worst movie in history? Hardly. It is watchable, once you gave up on the historical facts or clever writing. At the end of the day, it proves itself to be a breathtaking romantic film for those who are too young to know history, or real romance."
"neil-476","6","2","3","10 October 2010"," Lesson learned, but not very well
","James Cameron's brainwave when filming Titanic, in order to avoid the charge that he was making light of a real life tragedy, was to provide a romance between a fictional couple for audience identification purposes, and then dress it up in the genuine events. In so doing, the identification with the fictional characters drives home to the audience just how harrowing the sinking must have been.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour attempts to do the same and, to be fair, the Japanese raid, the centrepiece of the movie, is very well staged (albeit marred by moments like Tom Sizemore emerging and popping off a shotgun at Zeroes overhead without even aiming it).<br/><br/>But the fictional characters inserted for audience identification purposes and their plot line - oh dear. Despite having a liking for all three of the actors involved in the romantic triangle, a) this is seriously drippy stuff, and b) there is oh so much of it. I got to the point where I was hoping that the Pearly Harbour raid would polish them all off so that I wouldn't have to endure any more drippiness.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that you should try to catch the hour in the middle."

"The_Stuff_of_Dreams","5","2","3","6 April 2010"," A bad case of Titanic copycat syndrome
","There are some differing qualities to Pearl Harbor but pieces of the film are direct copies of Titanic. The plot is the same: a whirlwind love triangle, set against catastrophe, has star-bursts of comedy but ultimately ends in tragedy. The flying scene between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, as breathtaking as it is, is an obvious theft from the ""flying"" scene between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic. ""There You'll Be,"" the love song for Pearl Harbor in the end credits... think ""My Heart Will Go On."" A ;ove song written for the film in the end credits is not unique to Titanic, but still, come on, in the case of Pearl Harbor, it's obvious where the idea came from, as fine a song as ""There You'll Be"" is. Also, and you can't disagree with me on this, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay made a two-hour movie into a three-hour movie. Why? Because Titanic was three hours long. Now, here's the key difference: every bit of Titanic is necessary. Every bit of Pearl Harbor... not so much. It's bad when a film feels like three hours. There was no need for the revenge sequence, and definitely no need for the prologue. That was ridiculous. Aside from its lack of creativity, Pearl Harbor also has lacks in several other crucial film-making fields. First of all, Michael Bay as a director... no. Second of all, Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer... yes, if it's a popcorn flick, not an attempt at a masterpiece. Third, Cuba Gooding Jr, as competent as he was in this movie... no. Fourth, Ben Affleck... definitely not. Who wrote the script? I hope it was his or her first and his or her last, so that the trash is limited to only one piece. No, Pearl Harbor is pretty bad. I don't think I'd ever recommend it to anyone. But I have a soft spot for it. Have you ever seen a movie that you know is bad but you watch it anyway? That's how it is with me and Pearl Harbor. Maybe it's because my mom liked it, maybe it's because my grandma likes it, both cases giving me a sense of childhood nostalgia, I don't know. All I know is: don't watch Pearl Harbor. Watch Titanic instead. Just because I watch both of them doesn't mean you should."
"evilresident097","5","2","3","13 July 2009"," Signature Michael Bay - Great effects, yet weak in almost everything else.
","I'm a fan of big war films, like Platoon, We Were Soldiers, and Saving Private Ryan. When I saw Pearl Harbor six years ago, I thought it would reach the ranks of those films. But in like the recent Michael Bay, it was all effects, no movie.<br/><br/>It follows U.S. Air Corps 1st Lieutenants Rafe McCawley(Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker(Josh Hartnett), buddies since childhood. Rafe goes to join the Royale Air Force Eagle Squadrons while Danny is transferred to Pearl Harbor. Before he leaves, Rafe falls in love with Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale), a nurse who is also going to Pearl Harbor. Soon, while in battle, Rafe is shot down and presumed dead. Danny and Evelyn are shocked, but then they begin dating. Three months later, Rafe returns to find this out, but soon forgives Danny. Then the big one happens: the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn are swept into.<br/><br/>Here's the positives. The score by Hans Zimmer is great and I think ""Tennessee"" one of his best pieces ever. The cast is A-grade, with roles filled by Jon Voight(President Frankin D. Roosevelt), Dan Aykroyd(Captain Thurman), Alec Baldwin(Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle), Cuba Gooding Jr.(Petty Officer 2nd Class Doris Miller), and Tom Sizemore(Sgt. Earl Sistern). Watch for small roles by Eric Christian Olsen and Never Back Down star Sean Faris in the Doolittle Raids part. The best part, which I I do have to give my thumbs up to, is the effects. The explosions and aerial fights are excellent. The attack, while extremely flawed in historical accuracy, exploits all of those in a adrenaline fueled ride.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives. The acting is TERRIBLE. Affleck is a joke, and Hartnett is no ace either(at least he did great in Black Hawk Down). The film is also highly inaccurate. I mean I know this is a love story/ action film so there's supposed to be some inaccuracy, but this is way over the legal limit in my opinion. It's even inaccurate on the Doolittle raids. The only good parts are in the fighting and in total that only racks up about an hour and 10 minutes, leaving nearly 2 hours of boredom.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a so-so 5 out of 10 for the effects, cast, and music. Nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>P.S.: I recommend viewing the director's cut, only in the fact it's rated R and has a couple of extra scenes."
"JamesHitchcock","5","2","3","6 June 2009"," Japs One, Yanks Nil
","The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most important events in twentieth-century history, but from an American perspective it is a difficult one to film. The Japanese fly in, they sink the American ships, they fly out again. Japs one, Yanks nil. <br/><br/>No American audience is likely to take kindly to a film which ends with that particular scoreline. Although the attack was not as decisive a victory as the Japanese high command had been hoping for (only two out of eight American battleships, the USS Arizona and the USS Oklahoma, were permanently put out of action), it was nevertheless an American defeat. The solution adopted by producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay was to make the attack itself the central act of a three-act drama. <br/><br/>Act I, hoping to copy the ""Titanic"" formula of adding a fictional human-interest story to the spectacular recreation of a real historical event, deals with a love triangle between two American pilots and a Navy nurse. The story opens early in 1941 when Lieutenant Rafe McCawley, an American Army Air Force pilot, volunteers to serve with the Royal Air Force's Eagle Squadrons. Later, he is shot down in combat over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. In fact, he has survived, and after three months in occupied France returns to his base at Pearl Harbor. (Exactly why he did not return to his squadron in Britain is not explained). Unfortunately, two people are less than overjoyed to see him - his best friend Danny Walker and his girlfriend Evelyn who, presuming him to have died, have commenced an affair during his absence and who make it quite clear that Rafe's unexpected return from the dead will have no effect upon their relationship. Unsurprisingly, this development causes a rift in Rafe and Danny's friendship (although, rather more surprisingly, the rift proves to be only temporary). <br/><br/>Act II deals with the Pearl Harbor attack itself. Act III tells the story of the Doolittle Raid of April 1942, in which Rafe and Danny, by now once again the best of friends despite Danny's continuing affair with Evelyn, take part. (It is not explained how the two, originally fighter pilots, have now learned to fly bombers). According to the film this raid avenged America's defeat at Pearl Harbor and was a major turning-point in the Pacific War. Japs one, Yanks two. <br/><br/>Actually, the Doolittle Raid, although undoubtedly daring, had little effect on the course of the war; the real turning-point came at the Battle of Midway two months later. Indeed, the film, and Jon Voight's rather over-the-top performance, inadvertently left me with the impression that the raid had been a piece of reckless bravado on the part of President Roosevelt who, desperate for a propaganda coup, was prepared to send America's carrier fleet into danger, even though he had been advised that it was needed to defend the West Coast against a possible invasion.<br/><br/>The love-triangle story is unnecessary and overlong- indeed, it is the main reason why the film itself is overlong-, and the attempt to emulate ""Titanic"" falls flat. Although neither Leonardo di Caprio nor Kate Winslet gave a particularly good performance in that film, at least their characters Jack and Rose were two likable young people that the audience could empathise with. In ""Pearl Harbor"", by contrast, Danny and Evelyn both come across as thoroughly unlikeable; shallow, self-centred and rather cruel in their treatment of Rafe. (Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous, but this is not one of her better films). Of the three main characters, Rafe is the only one who engages our sympathy, and even in his case our sympathy is limited by the fact that he is played by the stiff and wooden Ben Affleck, the man with a bigger collection of turkeys than Bernard Matthews. <br/><br/>Probably the most interesting way of making a film about the battle would be to explore the reasons why the Japanese leadership took such an insane gamble, but I suspect that American audiences would not be interested in a film which paid more attention to the enemy side rather than the American one. The portrayal of the Japanese characters is not as hostile as in some earlier films about the Pacific War (""The Purple Heart"" being a notorious example) but even so it is rather perfunctory, and there is no serious attempt to trace the origins of the conflict. <br/><br/>The action sequences are good, particularly those depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor itself, and are the main reason why have given the film an average rather than a below-average mark. Nevertheless, there is little else that is good about the film- not the plot line, not the script and not the acting (with a couple of honourable exceptions, notably Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the black navy cook who unexpectedly proves to be one of the heroes of the attack). Roger Ebert described the film as ""a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on December 7th 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle"". Bay called this the most offensive review he had received in his career, but to me it seems like fair comment. 5/10"

","I honestly can say that I can not remember the last time I saw a film this bad.<br/><br/>The film tries to do a Titanic by introducing the Pearl Harbor story through the eyes of two friends (Affleck and Hartnett) who go off to war and a love triangle with nurse (Beckinsale) they both meet.<br/><br/>The love story is predictable and corny. Over half the film is devoted on the two friends and their relationships to the nurse trying to give a back story to the characters so that you will feel for them come the impending attack. It does not work. It is pure cheese and is boring as well. I kept looking at my watch, wondering if anything would happen. During the film you feel nothing for the characters, seeing them as nothing more than the ""pretty faces"" of Hollywood, rather than character actors who would add to a convincing (I wish it only was) storyline. If this film wants to replicate Titanic, then it should sink with out a trace.....<br/><br/>The attack sequence on Pearl Harbor does liven things up a bit. But being already over an hour and a half into the film, it seems somewhat late to pick up the tempo after so much boredom.<br/><br/>During the attack sequence there were many shots that reminded me of the open sequence of Saving Private Ryan and of the sinking in Titanic. I guess that this is unavoidable given the nature of the film. However in both cases I was given the impression that the film makers (Michael Bay) were coping the techniques, and were not improving on them. Bay's typical use of slow motion in the effects was also overly used to the point of yawning with each successive slow shot. This was a shame as the special effects were otherwise excellent and the only saving point of the film.<br/><br/>Finally the retaliatory strike on Tokyo was again a master of special effects, but this whole section of the movie seemed like another film and seemed out of place. That as least was consistent with the poor pacing in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I rented the film on DVD. I am glad that I only wasted 4 bucks. The DVD transfer is very good and the sound (DTS) was masterful.<br/><br/>Score: Sound (DTS): 10/10 Effects: 7/10 (let down by too much slow mo) Story: 1/10 Overall: 4/10"

","Some good effects in the battle scenes overlook the fact that other movies before this one did a better job sticking to the actual history. Few people research historical documents and Hollywood knows this, which is why they are able to abuse artistic license this way. So if you are looking for historical accuracy this is not your movie. If on the other hand you like a half-decent love story, lots of eye candy of both genders and good war action scenes, this flick is for you. <br/><br/>The story centers on the relationship of the two main characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, who grow up in time to go off to join the Army to be combat fighter pilots. With the U.S. on the sidelines, one of the newly-minted pilots goes off to fight for the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain. Important plot complications arise from his action, as he is shot down and no one either in England or Hawaii knows his status for months. He reappears in Hawaii just in time for Dec. 7. <br/><br/>The scenes involving the actual attack do a good job of portraying the chaotic effects upon the military and civilian populations. There are realistic scenes in the harbor among the damaged and capsized ships that may be disturbing to younger viewers. There is also no shortage of the carnage at the hospital, in the city and the airfields, although not too much of the bloody raw liver and hamburger variety.<br/><br/>The aftermath of the attack and scenes related to immediate retaliatory action against Japan seem anticlimactic and abbreviated to the point that they are made almost gratuitous. This movie turned out to be more of a mini-series condensed to fit an extended format DVD. For that it suffers by telling portions of the story to a greater or lesser degree, that looks like it was rushed to print. Some good footage and passable acting was squandered to put this film together."

","Okay, most everyone has panned the film and for all the right reasons. Let me toss in a few pet peeves from an anal retentive who reads the occasional history book. First (and this is classic Bruckheimer), he takes exceptional pains to do extremely accurate CGI renditions of the Jap aircraft---then he has many of them whizzing around Pearl Harbor at sea level doing 400+ knots. The Aichi ""Val"" dive bomber could only manage 200 knots at altitude (like most dive bombers they used air brakes to limit speed in their dives) and best the Mitsubishi ""Zero"" could do was 289 knots at 15,000', less at sea level. The ships---again great representations but here are several squawks in ascending order of significance. First, he left out the sun awnings which all the battleships were sporting while in port (I was stationed on Oahu---it gets hot in the sun even in December). Second, the bomb that destroyed the Arizona went off after a millisecond delay, not after some poor sailor in the damn spud locker had time to look down and contemplate his pending misfortune. Lastly and most egregious, after the attack when the long boats are poking about battleship row recovering survivors and the dead, the battle ships have changed positions AFTER THEY SANK! For those who care, of the ships moored on the south side of Ford Island, only the USS Nevada, tanker Neosho, and repair ship Vestal went anywhere except straight down. Another thing that gets lost in most of the Pearl Harbor lore, this flick included, is that Ship's Cook 3rd Class Doris Miller earned his Navy Cross for assisting his mortally wounded captain and manning a machine gun under fire, NOT for shooting down any aircraft (if he hit any, the record is silent on the fact)---manning the gun under direct fire with no training was more than enough to attest to his bravery. He died in the service of his country when his ship, USS Liscombe Bay was torpedoed in November 1943. This movie reminded me of a graffiti epitaph reportedly seen on John Belushi's grave paraphrased somewhat: ""It could have been so good but Oooh Noooo!"""
"hankhanks12345","1","2","3","9 December 2006"," Shameful Crap
","Let me explain what I mean when I say that this movie is shameful crap.<br/><br/>First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word ""trite."" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.<br/><br/>Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that in a few years people will forget that this thing was even created."

","Well, Industrial Light & Magic certainly earned their fees on this one. The battle sequences are truly something to behold. But that still leaves almost 2 hours of movie to sit through. The framing story is OK, but simply doesn't match the rest of the film. There is, for the most part, no one on screen that demands attention. That has that special something, that charm, that charisma, that makes you unable to tear your eyes away from the screen. That thing I call star power. This lack is amazing in a film with this kind of budget. Affleck doesn't have it. Josh Hartnett has it even less so. Kate Beckinsale, while very pretty, and a good actress, doesn't have it either. Jon Voight was kind of an odd special case in this film, with his heavy make-up, he didn't look at all like Jon Voight. But he didn't look at all like Roosevelt, either. Now, Alec Baldwin, as much as it pains me to say it, does have it. But he wasn't in the film long enough to make up for the rest of the cast. The definitive Pearl Harbor movie is still ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" (And for the last part, ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"") I gave this one a 6 just due to the amazing visuals in the battle scenes, but if not for that, it would have been a 5."

","This movie, as many have stated is more like three movies in one. I think they are interwoven beautifully. The characters are all great and believable. Their situations seem real enough. The characters that really stand out for me are Josh Hartnett's Danny Walker, Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn and the actor who played Red. I enjoyed Alec Baldwin as Doolittle, also. I waited 2 years before I saw this movie and it is the human relationships that really drew me into the movie. Another story it follows is the build up of the Japanese attack. I thought that was very well done. And then of course there is the attack which is pretty amazing and realistic. All together this movie has a little bit of everything. I have been watching it over and over and over and have not tired of it yet. A number of people talk about the inaccuracy of the historical content. Seeing this movie has interested me in looking further into the event and they took some liberties but all in all I think they portrayed it fairly straight.

Even though it is useful to have some background knowlege of the horrific event that shook America, Pearl Harbor grabbed and kept the attention of everyone I know.<br/><br/>It tells the tragic story of the day Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan in 1941.

","I have to wonder how much of the criticism of this film is a personal attack on Affleck and not actual analysis of the film. I thought the romantic triangle and the relationship between Affleck's and Hartnett's characters were quite moving. The action sequences were exhilarating and the film had a look of authenticity to its period. I am not enough of an historian to know if every depiction is factual. Perhaps it wasn't politically correct to set a romance in such a sensitive setting in US history as Pearl Harbor, a la Titanic, but still the zeal of the critics seems overblown. I even thought the Japanese perspective was given fair consideration. On another note the later use of atomic weapons on Japan was justified, even Japanese generals later agreed, as it saved countless American lives that would've been lost had a conventional force tried to take the archipelago. I think it even saved many Japanese lives that would've lost resisting that invasion. On the film, my score: 8/10."

"imyjr","9","2","3","29 May 2001"," Moving and Exciting
","I went to see this movie mostly for the flying and the action. Critics have been picky and implied the plot was boring. Well...... the action was great. It was the most thrilling flying I've seen in a movie.... it's not just bombs exploding and ships on fire...... but great reconstruction of air battles and thrilling flying before, during and after the Pearl Harbor attack. The best. The interesting part is that I was moved by the film as well...... even shed a tear or two, much to my surprise. The love affair plotline is certainly not new to the screen.... but it works very well..... and issues of friendship, loyalty, respect, are treated seriously, in mature, ethically responsible fashion. It's amazing how fresh it seems.<br/><br/>
The historical aspects are depicted in relatively accurate fashion. I've read a great deal of the literature and though some events were, of necessity, written in shorthand, the general thrust was true to what we now know. Jon Voight presents the courageous and compassionate side of Roosevelt; it's a pity he did not show his aristocratic spirit as well. They were part and parcel. After much thought, he was our best president after Lincoln and Jefferson (I never understood why Washington is usually regarded as the best being that not much happened under his stewardship).<br/><br/>Tora Tora Tora is an exciting film but it tells the story from a less personal perspective..... a very different movie it is from Pearl Harbor, but also a very good one."

This is one of the longest movies I have ever sat through (at least that's what my back tells me). It has some of the worst writing I have ever heard. The set-up and the romantic intrigues are predictable and uninteresting. There is absolutely no suspense. The whole plot is contrived. Oh, yes, there is an endless attack by the Japanese, but by the time it happened, my mind was wandering. As far as those tragic lovers, I thought I was watching a bunch of eighth grade girls and boys ticked off because she said he said she said, whatever!! Then, of course, we have Jimmy Doolittle, going on his raid to make up for what those guys did to us. What a slap in the face to the real event. How can a director with 135 million dollars make the attack on Pearl Harbor dull. Yes, it probably looked like that. Those bombers and fighters moving clandestinely in on the island--destroying the fleet with no conscience. What about a script? What about the building of some sort of momentum? How about focusing on the realistic politics of the time and seeing the world from both sides. I was so disappointed in this film. People wonder why it's so expensive to go to the movies these days.

"MissFortinbras","7","1","1","28 January 2015"," Might not be historically correct but is still worth seeing.
","I will admit that I am not the most accurate person when it comes to the history of the world, so thus I am unable to speak of this film from a historical point of view. I will say this: I did enjoy the film even if it was a wee bit long (but that's okay, since it is a war movie). My only issue was the relationship between Hartnett and Beckinsale's characters. Your best friend dies in the war and the first person you think of hooking up with is his girl? There are literally plenty of other fish in the sea. When Afleck's character returned, I had to slap the space bar on my laptop and laugh at the sticky situation these two new lovebirds found themselves in.<br/><br/>As I said previously, I am not entirely sure about how accurate this movie was in portraying the historical events of Pearl Harbour but judging from many other reviews, I'm guessing the producers didn't do the best job at the keeping the film accurate. But yet again, in their defence, if you want accuracy then you should go hit some documentaries.<br/><br/>But I must say this: Affleck and Hartnett's portrayal of the relationship between two best friends was spot on. There wasn't a time when I felt as though their friendship was forced. What was also touching was Affleck's tendency to want to protect his best friend. We see this in the beginning of the film when as children he displays this characteristic by slamming his best friend's dad on the head with a plank. However, tables turn when Hartnett's character literally takes bullets for his best friend.<br/><br/>I will admit that I did cry a little (okay, a lot) at the end of the movie because it dawned on me how unfair life can be. I found myself frustrated at how everyone's plans did not work out the way they wanted. But that's just me. I tend to think a little too deeply at times. The movie is good.

"Wuchakk","9","1","1","12 March 2014"," A fine drama/romance combined with great war action
","""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor -- a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941. <br/><br/>It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the dramatic-romantic part of the story BETTER be good, and it is -- and it's believable too (except for the premature sex part, which inaccurately transfers modern sex morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we see some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. Believing him to be dead, his girlfriend (Kate Backinsale) and best friend (Josh Hartnett) spend a lot of time together and naturally develop a relationship; but ***SPOILER ALERT*** Rafe miraculously survives, which leads to some more action ***END SPOILER***.<br/><br/>Many criticize the acting and dialogue of the drama, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it quite well done and realistic. For instance, the film shows that Danny (Hartnett) was abused by his father while growing up. Later while dancing & drinking Evelyn (Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny seems to be while Danny is shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him and he therefore lacks confidence. This is REAL, my friends. Much later, after it is believed that Rafe is dead, Danny goes to Evelyn's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, ""You're such an idiot!"" This is good, realistic stuff.<br/><br/>The film also shows that the timid average-looking man (Danny) can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man (Rafe). It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.<br/><br/>As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? -- Go ahead and state them. Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right -- Oh my God!!), but what film ever has everything 100% right? They for certain got the gist of the event right, what more do you want? Get a life.<br/><br/>You want accuracy? The subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the winning Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story. Research it, it's a fascinating story.<br/><br/>The film is also respectful of the Japanese' viewpoint as they plan, prepare for and carry out their attack. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression.<br/><br/>There's also a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.<br/><br/>After the attack I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.<br/><br/>I never even knew about this bold bombing mission until I saw this movie. It took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in U.S. military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. 16 modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. They paid dearly for helping, however, as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! What evil bastages!! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the movie showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? It caused American moral to soar from the depths to which it had plunged after Pearl Harbor. It has the very same effect on modern viewers.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for ""Pearl Harbor"" to stumble and fail, but it never happened -- there's not one misstep. Yes, the viewer has to be open to and patient with the opening drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I d have zero interest in seeing the ""Transformers"" films, but this is fine movie-making. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"klamt1","6","1","1","5 February 2006"," Slightly underrated, but not overly spectacular
","After seeing this only a week ago I felt slightly compelled to write a review on it. Let me just say first off though, that while it was most certainly not the greatest movie ever made, it was also definitely not the worst. Pearl Harbour tries to tell us about the ordinary people who were effected by the drama that occurred on December 7, 1941. It's main characters are I guess somewhat believable. Rafe (played very badly by Ben Affleck) is a charismatic, and slightly cocky pilot who just can't wait to be a hero. Standing in his shadow is the much more insecure and more logical friend Danny (Josh Hartnett i thought played him surprisingly well), who looks up to Rafe like a younger brother looks up to his big brother. And lastly Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who is a slightly stereotypical 1940's girl who just can never make up her mind about what to do. <br/><br/>The plot is rather predictable, I suppose. Rafe falls for Evelyn. Rafe goes off to war and is assumed dead. Evelyn and Danny fall in love. Rafe is suddenly not dead. Danny and Rafe get at it over Evelyn. Pearl Harbour is bombed. Evelyn picks Danny over Rafe. And then we all know what happens in the end... Although the romance was a bit Jerry Springer, and there was absolutely no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, Pearl Harbour manages to keep you interested in the characters and what their fate will be.<br/><br/>Positives: <br/><br/><ul><li>Hartnett and Beckinsale both provide relatively good performances </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>special effects were extremely breathtaking in the bombing scene </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jon Voight is the highlight of the film as Franklin D Roosevelt (best scene in the movie) - battle scenes are very well developed </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>supporting actors were just as good as the main actors, providing a bit more interest to the ""ordinary"" people of Pearl Harbour</li></ul><br/><br/>Negatives: <br/><br/><ul><li>once again, Ben Affleck was not at all talented in this movie, his acting was very wooden </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>cheesy script ( way too many cheesy romance lines to count) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Alec Baldwin as a ""hero""? eugh </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>historically inaccurate</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>not enough of Cuba Gooding Jr.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>my main problem is the ending. It was an absolutely awful one in my opinion. </li></ul><br/><br/>To be honest, it wasn't the greatest movie ever, I watched it, it was worth the 4 dollar rental and I did cry a bit at the end. I think the main thing people can debate is who the love of her life was... Rafe or Danny? My vote will always be on Danny. I mean, the parachute scene? =) <br/><br/>Anyways, 6/10"
"ray-280","6","1","1","24 January 2006"," From Here To Stupidity
","First, the errata: Dorie Miller wouldn't have been flirting with Evelyn.<br/><br/>Dorie Miller died on a ship a few years after the attack and received his medal posthumously. He did, however, fire the 50-cal and it is believed he shot down one or two planes. His captain also survived in real life.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, people smoked. A lot. They also played poker.<br/><br/>No nurses died in the attack.<br/><br/>The Doolittle raid was tidied up for Hollywood.<br/><br/>While factual, I still do not believe that Jon Voight could ever have sired Angelina Jolie, but give the man props for his creation. His acting? He said it best in the movie, after the attack: ""How bad?"" It is true that America scrambled a few fighter jets and shot down a few Japanese planes. This may have been one of the reasons that the third wave was called off (Japan suffered 29 casualties).<br/><br/>The plot? The first half is ""From Here To Eternity"" while the second is Tora Tora Tora. The action scenes of the attack, which run a full twenty minutes, save the film. You really get a feel for what it was like to be bombed like that. Where the film almost, but not quite, perishes, is how it attempts to insert a chick-flick into a war movie. The result is what I imagine it would taste like to mix milk and orange juice, two things which are fine on their own but not pleasant when combined.<br/><br/>The movie's other main strength was in its portrayal of the Japanese as an honorable nation that felt it had to conduct this war to preserve its place in the world. We have certainly done this ourselves, and the film also captured the sense of total victory experienced by the Japanese pilots, many of whom are now interviewed for documentaries on the war. One cannot help but respect the efficiency of the attack, including how the Japanese altered their torpedoes so they could navigate the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Without question, we got our tails kicked good, and from a military standpoint, it was one of the most lopsided battles of all time.<br/><br/>The movie chose to end with the Doolittle raid, but it would have been smarter to give minor screen time to that attack, and more to the role it played in our winning the Battle of Midway, which was the true turning point of the war. That battle was won by mere seconds, as our bombers beat the refueling Japanese bombers to the attack by a whisker.<br/><br/>The film is a good way to show a historical event to a young audience that can smooth out the inaccuracies in the history books or on the internet. The cast could have been stronger, but Affleck (Rafe), Hartnett (Danny), and Beckinsale (Evelyn) do not drop the ball while carrying the film. Jennifer Garner as the mousy Sandra was an interesting performance, especially in light of her future stardom. Dan Akroyd as the decoder was convincing as only he can be. It was good to see an SNL alum play his role well in such a big-budget feature.<br/><br/>Watch it on cable if you're an adult, and keep the DVD around for the children for when they have a history bug. At 3:20, they'll be occupied all evening."

","While I like certain aspects of this movie, it left me longing for Tora Tora Tora. Ben Afleck is a pretty boy and must make the feminine hearts throb, he isn't much of an actor. The acting overall was acceptable and the story was to if one could ignore the dumb romance plot. The absolutely worst part of this movie is the Dolittle Raid. It was totally unbelievable that two single engine fighter pilots would be chosen to fly twin engine bombers a few months after Pearl Harbor. Not only was this sequence unbelievable, it is unnecessary and anti-climatic. What idiot decided to add this to a movie. On the plus side, the attack sequences were quite good and seemed very realistic. The exception to this are the low level fighter scenes created by computer graphics. (The aircraft are flying much faster than they are actually capable of and seems to be an attempt to mimic the Star Wars land speeders on the forest moon.) Also in the plus column is the way the movie is split on the 2 DVD set. It ends with the aftermath of the attack where it should have. The DVD set also includes two documentaries that I found to be more interesting than the movie itself."

","(This contains no spoilers about the love story. I'm assuming, though, that most viewers know some of the historical events).  <br/><br/>Mixed feelings about this movie.  A terrible and memorable time in US history.  Terrific special effects, beautiful photography, gripping and hair-raising attack and piloting scenes.  Could have been much tauter and more cerebral, had the film not bloated itself on the love story in its attempts to combine The Titanic with Saving Private Ryan.  The graft diminished it.  It didn't have the cleverness of Titanic, and Saving Private Ryan is a far better film; for one thing, it did not condescend to the audience by trying to sanitize the violence and grisly mayhem that is war--as Pearl Harbor does.  Compare the harrowing opening forty minutes of SPR to the forty minutes of PH's attack scene.  Impressive explosions, people scrambling around on sinking ships, just like the Titanic; but few if any severed hands, no faces blown open.  No blood in the water even.  That's because SPR's main point is that war sucks, and PH's main point, God bless it, is that America emerged victorious.  One of the best lines in PH is the one given to Yamamoto: ""A brilliant commander would have tried not to go to war in the first place.""  Straight out of Sun Tzu.  <br/><br/>The movie was too long.  You've got the two best friends, you've got love story, you've got the Japanese strategies, you've got the love story, you've got the tension in Washington, you've got the love story, you've got the attack, you've got the love story, and then you get the Doolittle Raid and the love story... if you've come this far why not make some reference, SOME reference, God help us, to how America ended the war with the Japanese?  But that wasn't heroic.  And I guess it wasn't Pearl Harbor, either.  Just think of Jacques Aumont, film theorist in _Esthestique du film_: cinema shows ""the recorded shadows of objects that are themselves absent.  In effect, the cinema has the power to 'make absent' that which it shows.""  Spot on."
"wforstchen","Null","1","1","16 July 2001"," An Angry Historian & Writer
","As a professional historian and published author I find it impossible to avoid throwing in a few comments about this film.   I finally went to see it this weekend (July 14th) long after the hoopla surrounding its release, and yes I did go primed as a critic due to what I heard from students who take my course on WWII.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling angry,  angry over the fact that the film could have been far more effective, entertaining, and revealing simply by being respectful of the history of that fateful day. Of course I understand the need for profit in film.   I've had several books optioned for the screen, and whether I am writing fiction or history, I of course have an eye on the bottom line.   And yet I would like to think that when it comes to certain subjects, that these subjects would be approached with the respect they deserve.  Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Gettysburg, the deaths of Kennedy, King and Lincoln are sacred moments in our history and when done on film should at least be treated with some respect.  I am not asking for a somber documentary, or even a high tech remake of ""Tora Tora Tora,"" but I was hoping for a bit more than the trivia dished out with an obvious eye towards marketing to the 18 year old female audience. I can not fathom why second rate directors and production teams feel compelled to trash over history in favor of improbable fiction, when so often the real stories are far more compelling. Spielberg did this beautifully in both Schindler and Private Ryan.   The real history was respected, the fiction blended in with skill and grace, creating films that are the highest level of entertainment, while at the same time being films worthy of historical respect.   I use both in my classes, and the most successful class I've ever taught involved bringing in four D-Day vets and opening the class with the first fifteen minutes of Private Ryan.   I would never dream of insulting my class, or veterans, with the use of Pearl Harbor. Of course I could carry on about the absurd plot lines, (come on, the guy would of gotten a telegram out the day he got out of France), the technical screw ups (1980s frigates as targets, flying in the wrong direction when the B-25s head to China. . .the sun is setting behind them. . . and the planes did not bomb as a group, and why did Affleck get on a train in New York to go to England when the Queen Mary was sitting in the harbor) but I think the issue runs far deeper. It is an issue of all the lost potentials of this film.   Sure, go ahead and create fictional characters in a real setting, some of the best books ever about history are actually historical fiction, but what was lost was the potentials of the real stories.  Forty five minutes less of poorly written romance replaced with a rich cast of supporting actors playing real roles could have transformed the film.    When the ""Oklahoma"" rolled over hundreds of men were trapped inside.   They touched on it in the film, but what a lost moment for a real character, the boxer who fought Dorie for example, with just a couple dozen lines of writing to develope him out and we could have better felt the horror of it.   Yes we did see Dorie, but it was sensed that the role was almost an obligatory salute to diversity, rather than a heart felt introduction to the gallant role played not just by African Americans but also Latinos and Filipinos serving that day.   How frustrating---all the lost stories that could have been brought to life. The Japanese side deserved far more, instead it was reduced to a few attempts at imitating Kurosawa's ""Ran"" with the outdoor sets and banners. I did like the dialogue of the pilot writing to his father, but damn it, here was a chance to create a real character, a pilot with a family, willing to die for his country, and then indeed he does die, shot down in the raid. If we had followed his perspective for just a few minutes the raiders would have been far more than soulless killing machines.   The only human touch I felt for the Japanese side was the gunner waving the children off, a genuine act which did reveal at least some humanity on a side that fought brilliantly even if it was for a cause that was wrong. As an historian yet again I left a theater frustrated at what could have been, and angered how a crucial moment in our history was reduced to trivia. I must repeat that there are certain moments in history which are sacred to a people and should be handled as such when someone wishes to make money off of them. This film trashed the memory of that day of infamy, and tragically another twenty years must now pass before someone attempts to do it right.  Unfortunately those brave few survivors of that day will no longer be with us to see it. I just hope that the next ""historical"" film that comes out does in some small way truly connect to the real history, and in so doing both the producers and the public will profit from the result."

","I guess that's a pretty bold statement, but ""Pearl Harbor"" took me out of my seat and into the film--into the characters and situations--in a way that I've never felt before. And I've loved movies since before I can remember! I saw, back when ""Titanic"" or ""Braveheart"" came out, the reaction people had to them, and now, I've found my ""Titanic."" I know why they saw ""Braveheart"" a half dozen times. Watching Michael Bay's film, I was reduced to a child, bright-eyed and completely believing, and also forced to recognize my adulthood in the knowledge that people like my grandfather made great sacrifices in the second World War that I will never understand or appreciate. And I got to, for a short period of time, be someone I never was, who fought not just for his country, but for the love of an elegant, beautiful girl. I don't think I'll elaborate much more on any of this, as it could only cheapen the sentiment. I do suppose there will be many who didn't like the film, and mock those that did (there always are), and some of their complaints may even be valid, but there's no way anyone can tell me I didn't FEEL the joy, despair, love, and hope that I felt in that theater on May 25th, 2001."

","After half way through this movie, I am pretty sure that they should make it into a TV series, such as an hour a week for 8 weeks. Its narrative style (and the romance) is so old-fashioned TV series like, and the story-line as well as those characters really need sometime to develop. Besides that the perspective and the lines are embarrassingly simple-minded, the history should have been better presented. After a bit hard work, people may then find it deserve a watch on a TV screen.<br/><br/>You can still go to watch it since a few scenes really worth a look in the theater.

"jessestlr","4","1","1","18 June 2001"," Definitely not as good as I hoped
","Pearl Harbor is definitely not what I wanted or expected.  Instead of being a movie that was the total favorite for the best picture Oscar next year, we get one of the worst films of the year.  The attack scene is fine, no question.  But the love story is flat out BORING.  I am going to compare this movie to Titanic, because it's like Titanic (Only Titanic was MUCH better.)  Titanic at least has an interesting love story and great chemistry between Dicaprio and Winslet.  Pearl Harbor has Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale in this love triangle that leaves a viewer totally unsatisfied. The love story is intense in Titanic.  The love triangle in Pearl Harbor is sleep inducing.  The really unfortunate thing about this movie is that it had great potential, I thought, and decided not to use it.  It would have been in much better hands with a director like James Cameron.  Alot of characters are wasted in this movie, because they don't need to be there. As much as I like Cuba Gooding Jr., he is just wasted in this movie, along with Dan Aykroyd, and Alec Baldwin.  The length of this movie totally turned me off.  It's a three hour movie that would have been alot better if it were two hours.  Some historical accuracies left me unsatisfied, especially not getting FDR's December 7, 1941 speech right.  There are only two really good things in this movie.  The attack scene (visually stunning), and Voight's performance as FDR.  Although the speech wasn't correct, Voight sounded just like FDR.  Instead of being a best picture contender, all it's going to contend for is best sound and stuff like that, hopefully."
"jakeandelwood","1","1","1","18 June 2001"," Three hours filled with ...nothing
","As a European I saw Pearl Harbor, and after three of the most boring movie hours of my life I wondered if in Hollywood they realize that also non-Americans go to the cinema.<br/><br/>This is another Patriotic load of crap. It has got an uninteresting love triangle, bad acting and some (ok) nice special effects.<br/><br/>This was going to be the Blockbuster of the year??? Those crazy Americans. Do they really believe that the audience would love this crap? I heard that Disney expected it to beat Titanic. They are so arrogant over there. How long did it last as the no.1 movie? ...A week? and rightfully so.<br/><br/>As an audience you do not feel compelled with any of the characters. In fact you don't care if they live or die. And (in opposite of Titanic) you certainly don't want to see it once again. It's much too long and boring to go through it once more. <br/><br/>In an effort to make a new Titanic they forgot that the strength of that movie was the emotional binding with the characters together with the great visual spectacle. That same thing made Gladiator a big hit (or did you think that it was the sight of the digitally built arena that did it for this movie?). No, this one (Pearl Harbor)just has some great effects and that's it. <br/><br/>But maybe that the Americans think differently about it. They are in fact very patriotic (when I saw ""the Shadow"" in the states in '94, there is a line in that movie where Baldwin as the Shadow says to his opponent something like: ""Hey watch it, that's the US of A your talking about"" Every proud American soul in the theater started to clap their hands and cheer, I think that says enough) but then again, maybe it's even too much for them to handle.<br/><br/>However as a European I could not appreciate this long movie. Bad acting and no story made it give me a 1 out of 10. Sorry but in my eyes it didn't deserve any more."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS I was already beginning to feel like a shell-shocked veteran about 20 minutes into Pearl Harbor, after essentially nothing had happened. Clocking in at a feels-like-every-minute-of-it 3 hours and 3 minutes long, Pearl Harbor starts off at a leisurely pace and then gets slower as it introduces two kids from farm country dreaming of flying fighter planes. They filch Dad's crop duster, and the dream becomes a real ambition. Flash forward to 1940, and viola!, the two corn-fed flyboys, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) are student fighter pilots on the same squadron. How lucky is that?<br/><br/>Rafe falls hard in love at first sight with an army nurse, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), who is coolly pretty, but about as exciting and sexy as a dress form. Before long Rafe volunteers to go out and fight the good fight, leaving his love behind (she seems surprised... she's the only one who didn't see that one coming). When Rafe is lost on a dangerous mission over Britain and presumed dead when his Spitfire plunges into the English Channel, I didn't miss him. But, I knew he'd be back (after all, Affleck's name is above the title). It's completely predictable when Danny, the concerned, grieving boyhood pal, believing his buddy is in a watery grave, takes the despairing Evelyn under his wing... and under the covers. Of course, Rafe does turn up in Hawaii just in the nick of time for the attack on Pearl Harbor. All that kept him alive as he recuperated was the sweet face and true heart of his girl back home, he says (I wonder if he was rubbing his thumb and forefinger together -- playing the world's smallest violin -- as he delivered that corny dialog). When he finds out about the betrayal he's spitting mad at first, but seeing as this is a buddy war flick, Rafe and Danny kiss and make up... Evelyn keeps kissing them both.<br/><br/>Sappy cliches abound as Rockwell-era Americans look helplessly into the bomber-infested heavens above, and a black mess attendant (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), in the midst of the death, destruction and falling debris, cradles his white commander and tells him everything is going to be okay as the higher-up expires in his arms. The good die young here, and the Japanese attackers are little more than cardboard cutouts (the marvelous Mako, who portrays Admiral  Isoroku Yamamoto  is believable but sadly allowed only to be one-dimensional).<br/><br/>Actually, I only have a few minor complaints about Pearl Harbor: the writing, the casting, the cinematography and the direction. Other than that, it's a fine film. Seriously, Michael Bay, whose films I usually enjoy, does not seem to concern himself with the actual directing here: Ben Affleck is playing Ben Affleck; every bit of dialog Josh Harnett has is delivered with fierce, furious intensity for no apparent reason; Cuba Gooding Jr. looks like he'd be much more comfortable doing back-flips and shouting, ""Show me the money!"" (show us the money, indeed: the attack scenes are cool, but are they worth $180 million?); and Kate Beckinsdale's flavor is about as bland as a tongue-depressor. Alec Baldwin was well-cast as Jimmy Doolittle, but he takes the waving flag, Mom, and apple-pie patriotism thing just a tad too far. If John Voight was directing himself as well, kudos to him: he's the only one who can truly be proud of his Pearl Harbor performance. As President Roosevelt, he practically disappears into the historical character, putting a real, three-dimensional and believable person up there on the screen for us to enjoy.<br/><br/>The cinematography, by John Schwartzman, has its moments (particularly early on, in the train station), but those moments become eternities as he goes back to his shallow, limited bag of tricks again and again: how much steam can there actually be rising off of every paved street? Does he know any other way to shoot a close up that isn't decapitatingly extreme and claustrophobic? Most unforgivable is the footage shot inside the chaotic base hospital, moments after Pearl Harbor is bombed.<br/><br/>Like Grandma's home movies, the camera shakes and shimmies so hard ones fears it might fall apart. Almost as annoying is the inexplicable blurring. This is a feature film, not an amateur docudrama. What does work, and work exceptionally well, is the attack scenes. The Kate dive-bombers soaring, and downward-spiraling birds-eye views  of bombs shattering ships are awesome; but Industrial Light & Magic had more to do with that eye candy than Schwartzman did.<br/><br/>When it comes to writing a script based on romance and tragedy, one must be careful to strike a believable balance. James Cameron accomplished that with Titanic. Randall Wallace does not achieve it with Pearl Harbor. Everyone knows what happened at Pearl Harbor in 1941. The film's reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor is spellbinding and edge-of-your-seat exciting (if a bit too long). There is no doubt Bay knows how to convey chaos fraught with fear and flair. It's an awesome visual assault but is it worth sitting through the first hour and a half for what we already know is coming? Unlike Titanic (everyone knew the ship was going to ram that iceberg and people would perish), Pearl Harbor (everyone knows the ships are gonna get bombed and people will perish) doesn't have a love story that compels us to care.<br/><br/>
Pearl Harbor is no gem. I want my ""I survived Pearl Harbor (the movie)"" tee-shirt!"

","Pear Harbor is Starship Troopers without the irony, wit and intelligence. It has the same plot as Troopers; the same mindless gung ho (it's remarkable that America, which panics these days at the thought of just one US bodybag, should produce a film extolling the merits of sacrifice); and the same homoerotic, fascist aesthetic - Leni Riefenstahl meets Norman Rockwell. Perhaps this was the screenwriter's little joke - pretend to write a serious film about war and then smuggle through a camp satire of American self-delusion, patriotism and political correctness."

Granted, this film did have it's emotional moments and I did get choked up a few times, but it was when the film focused on the real events and the real people caught up in it. It was never during the lame, blandly acted love triangle. Who approved this love triangle story? And three hours of it? Example & semi-SPOILER: the movie hit rock bottom right after the bombing, after we've witnessed an unbelievable - and true - horror story. Ben and Josh show up in the hospital - full of dying men - and Ben gets all cranky because his feelings were hurt. Are we really supposed to care about what happens to this flat love triangle after we've witnessed such real life carnage? And since everything is shot so picture perfect (aka antiseptic), these characters never become real. They look like models in a detergent commercial. Another low was the second half of the attack sequence, when the movie goes Star Wars and Ben and Josh become superhero flyboys (""Yee-haw! I got me one!"") I won't even get into the shots that were ripped right out of Titanic. They even threw in the Queen Mary, and ruined the scene with some corn ball hijinx.  I could go on, but life is too short."

"MadReviewer","5","1","1","1 June 2001"," Emotionally Hollow and Insulting
","Over the past couple of years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have proven themselves to be extremely adept at creating `popcorn movies' - good, solid action films that probably aren't going to win any Oscars, but are undeniably entertaining.  The secret to making these sorts of films (`The Rock', `Armageddon') seems to be to hype up the action and to not take things terribly seriously.  Unfortunately, Bruckheimer and Bay took the same cavalier attitude in making `Pearl Harbor', a film whose very subject matter demands a certain amount of respect. By its very nature, `Pearl Harbor' should've been a film that made the audience ponder the absolute senseless horror of war . . . instead, it's a popcorn movie.  The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor is treated with so little respect is not only disappointing, it's downright insulting. SPOILERS ALERT Like `Titanic', the film `Pearl Harbor' uses a romance between fictional characters to help tell a true story.  Not a bad idea, except the romance in `Pearl Harbor' is so wooden and forced, watching it is like having a salad fork stuck in your eye.  (For those of you who thought the romance in `Titanic' was bad . . . heh, heh, wait 'til you see `Pearl Harbor'!)  The film starts with two childhood friends from Tennessee named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). After the obligatory opening childhood sequence to demonstrate how tight these two guys really are, we get to see them enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love - gee, who could've seen this coming? - with the same pretty young nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).  Evelyn first chooses Rafe as her love interest, but when he's reported dead, Danny gets his chance. The reports of Rafe's death turn out to be greatly exaggerated, and he of course returns to find Evelyn . . . in Pearl Harbor, mere hours before the start of the bombing.<br/><br/>
Forgetting the actual bombing for a second, the romance is so witless it's funny.  I kept expecting to see Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K pop in the corner of the movie screen.  Lines like ""I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you"" scream Tori Spelling TV-Movie-Of-The-Week . . . the fact that they're in a big-budget movie like this is hysterical.  The problem is, the romance is so uninteresting that it's impossible to care about either Rafe, Danny, or Evelyn - so when the bombs start falling on Pearl Harbor, their fate really doesn't matter.  This lack of emotional investment in any of these characters turns large sections of the film into something that can only be watched with clinical detachment instead of with genuine feeling, and the fact that it doesn't really matter if the main characters live or die makes the movie, very, very boring.  As Rafe, Ben Affleck continues to demonstrate that he's little more than a good-looking store mannequin.  Kate Beckinsale, who's normally quite a good actress, puts in an equally wooden performance as Evelyn, as does Josh Hartnett as Danny.  Considering that these three are the leads of the film, that's just pathetic.<br/><br/>As for the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself - well, even if you're willing to ignore the many historical inaccuracies, the bombing is handled with such inept direction that it's embarrassing.  Despite the fact that it technically looks very good, it's constructed in a manner that suggests adolescent glee, not somber reality.  The battle scenes of `Saving Private Ryan' were designed to evoke horror.  The sinking scenes in `Titanic' managed to evoke similar feelings of dread.  In `Pearl Harbor', there's nothing but cartoonish violence.  There's an attitude of `look how cool this is!' throughout the bombing that's completely inappropriate.  For example, during the destruction of the USS Arizona in the film, Michael Bay cuts to the reaction of a cook as a bomb strikes the ship . . . the cook gives a Buckwheat-esque reaction that belongs in a `Three Stooges' short.  When I saw this in the theater, the audience, for the most part, laughed heartily at the cook's reaction.  I'll only pose this question: Should anything at all about the destruction of the USS Arizona, where thousands died in senseless slaughter, be something to laugh at?  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seems to be little more to Bruckheimer and Bay than an excuse to make an action movie and to blow things up.  They rarely give the actual bombing - and its survivors - the respect they deserve, and their few attempts to actually do so are heavy-handed and pandering in nature.  In another director's hands, the story still would've been awful, but at least the tone of the film might've been on the mark.  Hopefully, Bay will never get another change to butcher a serious subject like this again, and will stick to stuff like `The Rock' from now on. <br/><br/>Are there positives in this film?  There's some, I guess, but not enough to make `Peal Harbor' good.  Despite Michael Bay's mishandling of the tone of battle sequences, they are technically brilliant, and the effects work is outstanding.  (However, I get the feeling Bay should be paying out some cash to James Cameron, Terrence Malick, and Steven Spielberg for so shamelessly ripping shots from their films.  Bay is apparently turning into a new version of Brian DePalma - a technically brilliant director with no style of his own.)  Cuba Gooding Jr's performance as Dorie Miller is great . . . for the ten minutes he's actually in the movie.  It's nice, but he either needed to be a more significant character or cut from the film entirely.  Ditto the smaller roles of model James King as Nurse Betty, and Dan Ackroyd as Thurman - they're excellent, but underused.  Even though their performances are great, the overall film might've been better if losing the scenes using their characters meant trimming an hour off this already bloated film.  The only small role that was both outstanding and critical to the film was Jon Voight as FDR - he was inspiring to watch, and was one of the few important characters who didn't seem to be sleepwalking through the film.<br/><br/>
If `Pearl Harbor' was a film about a completely fictional subject - like `Armageddon' - it would still be incredibly dull and mediocre, bordering on bad.  The fact that it deals with an important historical event brimming with true stories of heroism and tragedy makes the film `Pearl Harbor' even worse.  It's an insulting film that's not worth renting, let alone watching in the theater.  Grade: C-"

","When Randall Wallace (Braveheart) was commissioned to write this script, they must have made him sit through at least five screenings of Titanic. They wanted a Titanic success and the best way to do that would be to recreate Titanic. but in a different context.  They reviewed Titanic's salient story points:<br/><br/>· A three-hour long movie with. · a glamorous look and evoked a period feel that had... · a love triangle leading up to. · a terrible, massive disaster will occur that the audience knows is coming because this is based on a historic event well-known to American audiences during which time. · Sympathetic main characters (e.g. Dicaprio) are allowed to die.<br/><br/>Then they started casting about for a scenario that could include the love triangle, and have a story in which it was obvious to all what would happen because it was historical fact.  When you add in the Bruckheimer/Bay requirements for explosions and bullets whizzing by, the answer has to be a war film, specifically about a famous battle with historical resonance. They settled on the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, a salient event in American history.  In addition to providing the requisite characteristics of a well-known story of an epic disaster, the Hawaiian vistas would provide a glamorous backdrop.  They turned the screenwriter loose, got a heck of a lot of change out of Disney (even while cutting their own fees to stay in budget), shook well, stirred once or twice, added a Maraschino cherry, and have served it in a massive marketing campaign and over 3,000 screens for its American debut.<br/><br/>The High Points<br/><br/>The Pearl Harbor battle scene is first class spectacle.  The battle scene runs 40 minutes, which are almost flawless from a technical standpoint. Mr. Bay has enormous ability at creating exciting carnage, and given a task force of five Japanese aircraft carriers, 300 attacking aircraft, and an entire naval base to destroy, he has done a remarkable job.  This is one battle scene meant to be seen on a big screen.  If you don't see it in a theater and wait for video, you will be missing some outstanding images. Almost all of the battle scenes, including the earlier ones at the Battle of Britain, are done remarkably well.  They might have spent $140 million on this film, but they left all of it on the screen.  The scale of the attack is evident and its details are incredibly well done.<br/><br/>The Middling Points<br/><br/>In spite of following of Titanic's formula, the ability to create interesting characters and emotional interest is not something that can be done in an FX studio.  Although the actors are not incapable, there is no Oscar-worthy performance here to draw the audience in.  Kate Beckinsale is the female love interest, an American nurse who first falls in love with Rafe (Ben Affleck as a square-jawed good ol' boy) and then Danny (Josh Hartnett) after Rafe is (seemingly) killed fighting the Nazis over Britain. She is winsome and pretty, but this is not Kate Hudson.  Affleck's Rafe is earnest, but Affleck always seems to be Affleck, just with some different words in his mouth.  Hartnett is quiet and sincere, and probably turns in the most grounded performance of the three main characters.  None of them are served particularly well by the script, which distances the audience from the characters by putting them in situations where they are in danger of dying of corn poisoning.  Cases in point include Affleck's meet-cute with Beckinsale's nurse, where he pretends to be another soldier so he can keep getting shots from her until he keels over, and the scene where Beckinsale regales her boy-crazy nurse colleagues of that particular meeting while the girls are riding a train to New York.  It's bad enough watching it once, but then have running commentary from a hen party kind of doubles the displeasure.  Rafe's fake death is the catalyst for Beckinsale and Hartnett to come together, and Rafe's sudden unsurprising return on December 6, 1941 in Hawaii causes some poorly done scenes of 'I-thought-you-my-friend' and 'but-we-thought-you-were-dead'.  Finally, the Japanese arrive.<br/><br/>The handling of the causes leading up to Pearl Harbor are perfunctory but serviceable.  Jon Voigt as Roosevelt is a bit more blustery than the sturdy patrician ever came across in the newsreels.  The scenes of the Japanese point-of-view are also a bit short but to the point.  This movie isn't about causation, it's about explosion.<br/><br/>The Low Points<br/><br/>Although the movie proves to be middling to poor melodrama and great action spectacle, it doesn't truly run off the rails until after the battle scene at Pearl.  In response, Bruckheimer/Bay tacked on a pointless third (fourth?twelfth?extended denouement?) act about the Doolittle raid on Tokyo in April, 1942.  The Doolittle raid was a propaganda event meant to encourage American morale with virtually no military impact.  The main characters even question the value of the raid themselves and never get a good answer.  Furthermore, the narrative about the raid itself is never established as being important - the movie feels over the whole time we watch this.  The least redeeming feature for this hackneyed, wasted hour of screen-time is that there is virtually nothing of interest happening in these scenes aside from the childhood buddies tying up some loose-ends for a bittersweet ending and an incredibly bad voice over about how the Doolittle raid marked the end of America's losses in the Pacific and the beginning of the victories, and how America was changed forever by the war.  Oh yeccchhh.<br/><br/>
There were also parts of the first hour that were so bad I was really concerned I was about to see a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Final Score Pearl Harbor isn't going to get anyone a James Cameron night at the Oscars. The first hour had moments of truly insipid melodrama but looked gorgeous and had nice-looking leads who seemed earnest while they fell in love.  It was enough to keep my attention until the battle scenes, which were spectacular.  Then, for all intents and purposes, we had a one hour denouement that makes this film's rating drop from a hopeful 6 to a 4."
"flicklover","4","1","1","29 May 2001"," An embarrassing so called historical epic!!!!
","When I first saw the trailer Of Pearl Harbor last year and saw that the team of Bay/Brukheimerwere behind the film I was a little apprehensive, the trailer was great it showed what would hopefully be an old fashioned war epic, but a movie that would do justice to the historical event that it was depicting.these guys are better at making mindless but really entertaining action movies like Armageddon, and The Rock. Those movies could get by on being just entertainments, this movie had to be something more. My fears came true, Pearl Harbor is nothing more than a chance for Michael Bay to blow things up! The movie has no heart, the characters are so shallow that you feel nothing for them. True the attack on pearl harbor is impressive technically, but it has been directed and edited as an action sequence not a terrifying surprise attack. The tone of the sequence is all wrong. Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are given nothing to do except look pretty for the camera. The love triangle between the characters is one of the blandest, most uninvolving love stories that I have ever seen. They say there lines as if they were reading them of cue cards. The screenplay is embarrassingly bad, even by summer movie standards. The movie wants to be very patriotic, Jon Voight as FDR does what he can to add honor to the film, but it rings hollow.<br/><br/>This movie is a more than obvious attempt to repeat the Titanic formula. That film is far superior to this one. It was a grand Hollywood spectacle, but the screenplay at least created two characters that the audience could care about. Pearl Harbor didn't have to be Saving Private Ryan, but it makes no real attempt to be a historical account, forget accuracy, most films of this kind take dramatic license, but this film doesn't even try to offer any insight or perspective on what occurred. So the movie outright fails as a love story and historical drama. What is left if 35 minutes of well produced action. Too bad that the filmmakers paid so little attention to rest of their story. This movie will make a lot of money, but it will be remembered more for what it should have been, not what it is.<br/><br/>Grade: D"
"ariesjow","5","1","1","30 May 2001"," A must-see for cheeselovers! Wait for video for everyone else.
","I must say that this film was rather cheesy. I don't want to be too critical of it because I understand that different films are made for different people, but this was not a great film and I hope many don't believe this to be one of the best films of the year. It was entertaining nonetheless. The story of Pearl Harbor is captivating and great care was taken to make sure the plot was not offensive to anyone. Now for the criticism. For a movie that cost this much to make the editing is awful. The acting is not great either. Lets face it..Ben Affleck is no future Al Pacino, but this role does not actually do flattery for his talent. I know so many people that claim this to be the next Titanic. Well, the Titanic was actually a solid all-around film. This is not. Therefore this film does not serve a place among the other modern epics that have become the norm in the last few years such as Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, or Gladiator. The plot is very predictable and suffers from many holes. Not a single actor in this film will deserve an academy award nomination. The casting definitely had flaws with so many great actors in small roles or with poorly developed characters. But hey..I'll stop criticizing. After all, this is no more than a Hollywood blockbuster so not much else should be expected."

","Pearl harbor<br/><br/>For Europe, World War II began with Poland's invasion in 1939.  For China, it began eight years earlier with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. While the fighting waged abroad, the United States clung to its isolationist stance in the hope that these ""regional"" conflicts would be decided without them.  This laissez-faire attitude was shattered at 8:00 am on December 7th 1941 with the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.   While the intention was to immobilize the US fleet before they could become a factor in the Pacific Theater, it instead served to galvanize a nation.<br/><br/>
True friendship is a rare commodity, something that Danny and Rafe are lucky enough to share.  Friends since childhood, they join the military together to become fighter pilots, find adventure and look after one another. Their relationship is strained by Rafe's decision to join the Eagle Squadron, a unit of the British Air Force filled with American volunteers.  Although upset, Danny tells him to be careful and promises to look after Rafe's newfound girlfriend Evelyn.  They soon discover that love and war are difficult bedfellows.<br/><br/>If you skip the entertainment section of the newspaper, don't watch tv , never go to movies and live in a cave, it's possible that you haven't heard of this movie.  Maybe.  With a voluminous cast of name and no name actors, a budget bigger than most films gross, and lots of special effects, this film is going to draw huge crowds for the Memorial Day weekend.  I have no doubt of this.  What I'm curious to see is how the audiences will respond to it.<br/><br/>
Once again the trailers are deceiving: while there are hints of the romantic nature of the movie, the focus is on the attack of Pearl Harbor and leads you to believe that it will examine the whys and wherefores behind the event.   The bulk of the screen time (and at three hours plus there's a whole lot of it) is devoted to the relationship between the three main characters.   I found it interesting that the marketing campaign in Japan meanwhile stressed this aspect over the action. Enough about the marketing you say, what about the film?<br/><br/>Historians and battle aficionados take note - other movies on this subject have been more historically accurate and informational.  This movie is the Coles notes version of the events surrounding the infamous day in question. However, that means it will be more accessible to the casual moviegoer and no one will quibble about the superb special effects sequences (it is often difficult to discern what is a set and what is computer generated).  I was surprised that the battle sequences, originally intended to be as graphic as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"", were considerably toned down.  They opted for hazy dream-like sequences at the hospital that proved to be more disorienting than disturbing.   The attack should have taken a more central role and been introduced sooner - there is little action for the first hour and a half - because younger viewers, and men (okay I'm generalizing here but it's true) will quickly lose interest.   Especially when they have to sit through mushy stuff.  : )<br/><br/>While the romantic triangle is captivating (although things become a bit too complex at times - and no I won't give anything away here), the characters have little depth and the actors don't have much to work with.  Ben Affleck is his usual affable self, giving a far better performance that he did in his last romantic lead  (I've always liked him better than his cocky alter ego aka Matt Damon).   Kate Beckinsale (looking remarkably different that she did in ""Brokedown Palace"") acquits herself adequately as the lovelorn lead, and Josh Hartnett, smolders as the fresh new kid  (to me at least - I haven't seen him in anything previously) and demonstrates a modicum of skill along the way.  Others aren't so lucky - Cuba Gooding Jr. barely qualifies as a supporting actor (things have been downhill since the Oscar), and Alec Baldwin has the misfortune to utter some of the worst lines ever written.<br/><br/>
Ultimately, Pearl Harbor has the elements required to be a summer blockbuster: it's being released at the right time, it has impressive special effects and action sequences, the story is pretty straightforward and it is very American.  That doesn't mean that it's a good movie.  Don't expect too much and it will make for a decent matinee (albeit a long one)."
"BRUIN30","9","1","1","26 May 2001"," Better than expected, but still historically inaccurate.
","I walked into this movie with an open mind. I also knew the producers were not trying to make a documentary on Pearl Harbor. The story line was actually not bad (or at least not as bad as I expected). The acting of Ben Affleck was in my opinion horrible. Kate was terrific as was John Voight. The movie did tend to be a bit long at just over 3 hours. Of course, the CGI bombing scenes were as intense as I ever imagined, but 45 minutes of explosions??  Come on!  Ive read the books, seen tora,tora,tora, many times and My father was a fighter pilot in WWII. I took him with me and he enjoyed the film on an entertainment level. Plenty of blunders from a historical point of view. FDR standing up?? Pure hollywood. All in all, aside from what I stated above, the movie entertained me. And thats what I go to the movies for. I watch the history channel for true information."
"Keyser Soze-12","6","1","1","26 May 2001"," A good, entertaining movie. Don't expect Saving Private Ryan though...
","I think the reason many critics hated Pearl Harbor is that they went into it expecting Saving Private Ryan.  Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor is no SPR. Then what is Pearl Harbor, you ask?  It's a popcorn movie.  No, it's not a war movie in the traditional sense.  No, it is not a great movie in any sense of the word.  It is an entertaining movie, and I heavily enjoyed it.<br/><br/>First off the bat, I'll discuss some of the bad stuff.  I didn't like how the movie started.  There are no opening credits, just a short cut of the title.  The opening, in my picky opinion, was too short.  I think that they could have slowed it down and made it a bit more dramatic.  Oh well, this will do.<br/><br/>Problem number 2: While some parts of the movie move too quickly, other parts move too slowly.  Many of the romantic scenes are nice, but they draw on for too long.<br/><br/>Next Problem: There isn't much here that you haven't seen before in terms of character in story.  I could have (and did) predict the entire movie before hand.  The story is that clichÃ©.<br/><br/>Okay, another problem: This movie didn't take enough opportunities.  There are so many stories involving Pearl Harbor, that I was disappointed that the never told any of them.  Well, they did tell of Doris 'Dorie' Miller, the first black man to receive the silver cross.  But there are so many other stories.  The USS Nevada tried to make a run for it out of the harbor and got shot to death.  I think that would have been great.  Another historic disappointment to me was the USS Arizona.  Correct me if I'm wrong (please), but I read in a book that a torpedo hit the ballast tanks (or what-have-you) underneath the Arizona, causing a massive explosion that shot the ship into a 90 degree angle with the water.  It sat there, pointing into the sky for ten or twelve minutes then crashed back down into the water.  The Virginia or the Utah, I cannot remember which one, was connected to the Arizona, making repairs to it when the Japs rolled in.  When the Arizona shot up like spring, the repair ship was thrown like a toy boat into the shore, where it landed face down in the mud.  There are so many chances this movie could have taken, but sadly, this isn't Spielberg quality.  Oh, and please, I don't want anyone crying about the historical accuracy.  I know some things are fictional in this movie, but Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator are filled with made up crap, so stop your bellyaching.<br/><br/>Final problem: the movie is too long for its own good.  After the tragic happenings of Pearl Harbor, the movie goes to the Dolittle bombing of Japan. I think it would have been better just to end the movie at Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Okay, the good stuff.  This movie has the best special effects of the year (at least so far).  Some special effects range from spectacular/photo-realistic to something I could have made in PhotoShop.  But, when they're good, hot damn, they're good.<br/><br/>Another good point is the movie is very entertaining.  I can't really explain how, it just is.<br/><br/>Well then, next point: this movie will get your patriotic blood pumping like never before.  Well, at least since you saw SPR.  Lots of people said Gibson's The Patriot made them feel proud to be an American.  Well, I never liked that movie, and let me tell you, when our boys start fighting back against the enemy, I have never felt so proud.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Pearl Harbor is not a great movie.  But it is a good movie. If anyone hates this movie, they cannot call themselves Americans.  As a film critic of sorts, I admit the movie has a lot of problems.  Hell, that's an understatement.  This is a mess of a movie, and yes, it could have been much better.  But see this movie for what it is: a fun popcorn flick.  I still can't believe people expected this movie to be Spielberg material. I mean, really, this is Jerry Brockhiemer and Michael Bay.  These guys made The Rock, Topgun, and Armaggedon.  What the hell do you expect from people who have never made a serious movie in their lives?   I laugh at you.<br/><br/>If you want a realistic war movie in the Pacific, just wait a few years. Steven Spielberg has bought the rights to the great, GREAT book, Flags of our Fathers, which is the true story of the six guys raising the flag on Iwa Jima.  I hope that he makes it, because it will be one hell of a movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"

","Micheal Bay has suceeded again with his latest block buster, Pearl Harbor. That's right, the team that brought us Armageddon and The Rock has now brought us a new classic. As we all know unless you fell asleep during history class, Pearl Harbor is about the Japanese sneak attack that lead America to WW2. Micheal Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have captured these events perfectly in this film. Not only do they make it historically accurate, but also portray the actual historical characters such as Gen. Yamamoto, FDR and James Doolittle and captures them as they really were. Not only was the actual bombing scene beautifully shot but also the Japanese planning the attack was also great. I know it's not as well done as Saving Private Ryan and cannot even compare to that, but it captures the attack as it truly happened: Unprovoked and completely without any warning whatsoever. I know that many critics have shot this movie down by saying that it was over cliched and over dramatized and in curtain parts of the movie they are right. However, those parts were few and far between. Also why should we listen to critics anyway? Their job is basically to be cynical about anything and insult people's work around every corner. Me personally, I don't base a movie on whether or not the critics liked it. I base it on my taste in movies and what normal everyday people say about it. Not on what some guy in a newspaper says. Anyway I sort of lost track of my reveiw there but anyway go and see this movie. Take my word for it, however much you spend to see it will be worth it."

","Allright.. it wasn't as TERRIBLE as I expected, but it wasn't Saving Private Ryan, either.  The actors all seemed to fit their roles with the exception of Alec Baldwin's impression of Jimmy Doolittle.  As Doolittle, Baldwin DID LITTLE.  Jon Voigt was a great FDR, and had most of the jerky movements as our 32nd Prez.  I think that the first 45 minutes could have been a bunch better but what do I expect from Jerry Bruckheimer and his gang?  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s part wasn't really necessary except to appease the NAACP (no offense, but really.. where DOES he fit in?)  He seemed to be reprising his Men of Honor role, and if it had been Denzel Washington he would seem to reprise his role on Hurricane...<br/><br/>Overall, good fighting scenes, bad inspirational moments (specifically Alec ""Doolittle"" Baldwin's 'that's just me' business)."
"Firehawk","6","1","1","26 May 2001"," The Film just doesn't work!
","Yet another piece of hollywood drivel by Ben Affleck - the actor who can't seem to find another Oscar hit after ""Good Will Hunting"" or a performance that would actually challenge him (Chasing Amy). Pearl Harbor was a movie whose whole purpose is to try to please as many people as possible, and fails to do that on all fronts. While a lot of the big details ARE historically accurate (The lipstick, Cuba Gooding Jr's character, the fact that two planes DID get off the ground to fight back at Pearl Harbor, and other small things) the story just doesn't really ""take off"". Without spoiling the movie, one can say that the love triangle portrayed was a typical hollywood romance with no dynamics.  Invariably, anyone who's seen a romance can see where the romance will head. The battle scenes show gratuitous violence.  There were many more explosions in the movie than there probably were in Pearl Harbor or Tokyo. And, as it turns out, Dan Ackroyd gives the most convincing performance... and he's monotonous, with only a few lines! Also, while there are several scenes that seem to skip around, and are used to portray the plot and describe the history (ie, FDR standing, the Japanese planning the battles), it also distracts from the movie.  They even try to portray the movie from the viewpoint of the Nipponese, by having a ""voiceover"" read the letter than one of the Nipponese pilots is writing home. In the end, I gave this film 6.  Generous, because of the somewhat historical value... The movie itself goes nowhere for 3 hours.  They tried to do a Titanic/Saving Private Ryan... but in the end, they got the worst of both movies. Just rent Tora! Tora! Tora! and give that a go..."
"nightshift1","Null","1","1","24 May 2001"," Superb action scenes, too much focus on love story
","Well, I was among the lucky ones who were able to see this 3-hour long epic before it hit movie theaters all around the world. I expected great action scenes and high-level acting from Ben Affleck and all the others. And this was what I got, only with slightly too much romance... I have to tell you folks that every dime spent on blowing up carriers and fighter planes was worth it. Finally a movie where flames are not computer generated! Watching the Zeros fly in low towards Pearl Harbor gives you goosebumps. Your flesh is crawling with excitement whenever an action scene is on. IT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT MORE PERFECT. BRAVO MR. BAY!!! One ""flaw"" of the movie, though is its length. So, my fellow action-fans, do not expect 3 hours of full-throttle machine-gunning and stunning explosions. The romance part is stripping this experience from you quite often. But it's not a big deal and the ""corniness factor"" is as low as possible. Josh Hartnett first proved his talent for me in The Faculty. This work of his, however, shows way beyond that performance. He's now in one league with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon... John Voight as the president of the United States was also a remarkable choice, and so was Tom Sizemore and Alec Baldwin in the supporting roles. Cuba Gooding, Jr. had only a minor part to play, but did it with strikingly convincing power. As usual... All in all, a magnificent movie was put together for us by Michael Bay, with outstanding performances and breath-taking, highly realistic action scenes. The romance part could have been cut a little shorter, but it is just an uplifting feeling to watch these guys play..."
"Kirasjeri","1","1","1","25 May 2001"," Disney's PC WHITEWASH of HISTORY, and Schmaltzy Romance
","""Pearl Harbor"", the biggest, most expensive, most hyped, and most anticipated, of all the Summer season's films, has finally arrived. Like a bomb flung from a Japanese warplane it has crashed into theaters with a resounding noise. Yes, for what this film could have been it is, in fact, a Big Bomb; for what it is, overall, it can be considered a mediocre let down.<br/><br/>The film has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a schmaltzy love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago. That includes the ""lost lover back from the dead"" routine, which was old even when it was done well, as in the classic ""Waterloo Bridge"" from 1941. We also received a noxious dose of an equally labored love triangle involving two lifetime friends. Beyond that, we get History so white-washed it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two.<br/><br/>Some Disney apologists have claimed that there had to be a story wrapped around the history, ""or else we'd be left with just a documentary"". Not so. Out on DVD is 1970's excellent ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", a Japanese-American production on the attack, and it was factual and compelling without the need for a none too convincing romance. For those who do want romance, done well in the context of the attack and America's entrance into World War Two, I suggest they rent ""From Here to Eternity"" from 1954.<br/><br/>Disney is telling us the actual attack sequence on the U.S.  Naval base at Pearl Harbor lasted over 40 minutes in this movie. By my watch it was 30, tops, only about half of which involved attacks on American warships. The rest was much less spectacular aerial heroics by the two heroes.<br/><br/>Be it noted that in 1970, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" did not have the benefit of digital special effects. In 2001, ""Pearl Harbor"" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD to be able to savor each frame of the attack. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism and verisimilitude is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. ""Pearl Harbor"" bears no resemblance to the real horrors of the opening sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, white-washing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.<br/><br/>We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did ""Pearl Harbor"" ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.<br/><br/>To Disney, there was no need to ""offend"" the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from ""Pearl Harbor"".<br/><br/>Historical events themselves are depicted in various ways ranging from complete distortion, to convenient omission, to fabrication, to absolute accuracy. Some of the more irritating examples follow.<br/><br/>Jon Voight, doing a not very convincing interpretation of President Roosevelt, supposedly stood up on his own at a staff meeting to dramatize the need to strike back at Japan. Not so.<br/><br/>Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named ""The Ruptured Duck"" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", which should be rented and seen by all.<br/><br/>The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: ""So help us God"". Perhaps God is not PC.<br/><br/>The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.<br/><br/>Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.<br/><br/>American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.<br/><br/>The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.<br/><br/>Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.<br/><br/>Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.<br/><br/>The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.<br/><br/>Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.<br/><br/>So we have a banal romance mixed together with white-washed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make ""Pearl Harbor"" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts."

","I have not seen the movie Pearl Harbor since it first came out in theaters back in May. But after a recent experience, I could not help myself from writing a review.<br/><br/>Recently, in my history class, we were discussing about how Hollywood changes events in history to make movies more entertaining and commercial. One person brought up Pearl Harbor, asking if Hollywood messed up the history or not. If I weren't so in control of myself, I would have gone off on that person! I asked him that why should an important and violent event such as the bombing be toned down for a PG-13 rating and why we pay to see a three-hour love story that should have been a war movie. Being in a classroom full of MTV Generation morons who wouldn't know good movie making if it smacked them in the face, I was told by several people to shut up. But whose has the last laugh.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor, admittedly, is entertaining. But should this awful event in our history be turned into a duel by the visual effects artists for the explosions? Considering the time period this movie was made in and the filmmaking techniques available today, this could have been as realistic and brutal as Saving Private Ryan. Also, since it was unrealistic towards the attack, it defeated another purpose of the producers; to encourage young people to study more about the attack. If that student in my class had read a book on the attack, he might not have asked if the movie was unrealistic. He would have already known.<br/><br/>There are several other problems with the movie. One of the big ones is the reasons why Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. In the movie, the only reason given was that the U.S cut off fuel supplies and trade. Japan decided to show the U.S not to mess with them.  If one were to study up on the attack, they would realize that Japan was invading islands and lands in the pacific. Thus, the fuel that the U.S was providing would have been used for the wrong purposes. The Japanese, who launched the air strike and thus brought the United States into war don't even have a big role in the movie. Even the title place of the movie doesn't have a big part, being only the mere backdrop for two young lovers.<br/><br/>One might call me a hypocrite, for I trash a movie like Pearl Harbor for lack of combat accuracy and praise something like The Longest Day, which has some inaccuracies in its view of the D-Day landings. But one also has to know that these movies were made in two different time periods: The Longest Day came out in 1962, a time when censors had more control over film content and thus wouldn't permit Longest Day's producers to show a bloody D-Day landing (This was also the era of the war epic). Pearl Harbor, however, has been released in a time of more leant censors and could have been the definitive movie of December 7, 1941. Instead, it was only made as the ultimate M.M.M (MoneyMaking Machine). When will Hollywood learn to stop cashing in on the dead?"

","SPOILER ALERT The previews I repeatedly saw in the movie theatre for Pearl Harbor made me really want to see it. It has an ensemble cast (Affleck, Beckinsale, Hartnett, Voight, Sizemore, Gooding, Akroyd, Baldwin). However, as I watched the movie, I couldn't understand it. I didn't like it the way I thought I would. The story, at times, seems to make no sense and is at times, rather disturbing to me. For instance, the whole love triangle. Most of it makes sense but the outcome doesn't (guy meets girl, guy ships off, guy ""dies"", girl mourns, guys best friend mourns, friend and girl mourn together, friend and girl sleep together, guy comes back from the dead, gets mad at friend and girl for being pregnant with friends baby, friend and guy go on mission together, friend dies, guy mourns, girl mourns, guy and girl get together again, guy and girl name baby after deceased friend). The acting wasn't as good as I thought it would be. At times, it was mediocre (like Baldwin, as always, overacting). Yet, the cinematography was excellent and the relationship between Affleck and Hartnett from childhood to adulthood is touching and is cleverly woven throughout the story. Also, the movie, to me, didn't provoke a great feeling. It didn't make me feel anything for any of the characters. I didn't laugh or cry or think. That's what great make movies make you do. They are so great that they can make shivers go down your spine. Pearl Harbor failed, in that aspect."

(it's even in school textbooks that he might have known about the japanese attack.)<br/><br/>as a typical ""summertime movie aiming for box-office records"", i say it's okay (although the storyline was poor and shooting scenes too monotonous). but people making the film should be aware of how much misunderstandings or biases can come out from a movie.  especially war movies."

","When I first saw the trailers for this movie I thought it was probably going to be great.  It looked like a Saving Private Ryan level movie about Pearl Harbor rather than the Normandy invasion.  Boy was I wrong. In a 3 hour movie we have about 40 minutes dealing with the attack.  O.K. I wasn't expecting one long battle scene but the actual battle is the only part that has ANYTHING to do with the attack at all.  Except for the American attack at the end, the rest of the movie is just a love story/romance novel. Simply as a movie it really wasn't bad at all. The problem is that if you title your movie ""Pearl Harbor"" you might want to actually deal with Pearl Harbor.  This movie was merely SET in Pearl Harbor."

","I did not see Pearl Harbor in the theater, just on home video.  I was expecting the worst and that is exactly what I got.  The hokey dialog is the worst that I have ever seen in a movie.  They should have spent the first 90 minutes on the Japanese preparation of the attack instead of what they spent it on.  I personally will now skip any movie that Randall Wallace has writing credits for in the future.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the music soundtrack of the movie.  That is the only good thing that I could say about this movie."
"homer_simpson91","5","1","1","6 December 2001"," A good movie
","I found it difficult rating PEARL HARBOR. This is certainly not a great movie, although there was some solid acting and an amazing 40 minute battle scene that made me feel both sad and patriotic. But the majority of the movie is a love triangle between the three leads, and I only found myself only slightly interested in it. In TITANIC (9/10), I found myself almost in tears during the sad parts because I cared about the main characters. In PEARL HARBOR, I didn't care about them as much, (I didn't MIND them, but I didn't care much about them) and so during the sad parts I was mostly bored.<br/><br/>I blame this not on the actors, but on the screenplay. I know Randall Wallace, who wrote for us the brilliant BRAVEHEART (10/10), is capable of better. Most of the dialogue is unsatisfying, and some is laughable. As I mentioned earlier, I feel the acting was one of the PEARL HARBOR's best qualities. This was the first time I was impressed by Ben Affleck as an actor. This was also the first time I had the pleasure of watching Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, both of whom I can't wait to see more of in the future. I also enjoyed the (brief) performances of Cuba Gooding Jr, Mako, Tom Sizemore and especially Jon Voight as President FDR. Jon Voight stole the show for me, especially in the scene in which he stood up from his wheelchair in order to demonstrate to his associates that nothing is impossible.<br/><br/>The battle scene was incredible. So incredible, in fact, that it's enough for me to call this movie recommendable. Maybe because there was no (bad) dialogue to ruin it, but I felt the sadness I was supposed to feel for the victims while being impressed with the overall coolness of it at the same time. I never felt the kind of emotion during the romance of the movie as I did during the attack scene. I was speechless during this part of the movie, which is exactly how I felt during TITANIC, and the exact feeling any film-maker could hope for or movie-goer could wish for.<br/><br/>The redeeming qualities of this movie is enough for me to give a thumbs up. I just might buy this movie just so I can watch those redeeming qualities, and rewind through the rest of it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Pearl Harbour, I cannot describe how HORRIBLE this movie is!!!!!!!! It is long, boring, pointless, and stupid. I mean how can one even sit through this movie without going mad!!!!!?????? The entire movie was nothing but romance and a love story. The only action was for like the last 25 mins of the movie, and some how (i don't know how that is!!), is that the Americans won in the end? Doesn't anyone find that strange? Cause the way i learned it in school was that they got slaughtered during that battle and it wasn't till WAY later that the Americans and they allies won!?

"theshape79","Null","1","1","5 December 2001"," Michael Bay should not have directed this.
","Let me begin my comments on Pearl Harbor by saying this could have been a good movie if it weren't for Michael Bay. Now I have nothing against Michael Bay. I believe he is capable of directing fun, excitingly big stupid movies. But should a film detailing an infamous attack where thousands of Americans be big and stupid. No. Bay is just not the type of director that should be directing an epic picture of this scale. In my opinion Pearl Harbor could have been much more. There are scenes here that in a better directors hands could have been staged differently and perhaps more succesfully. A better director might have eliminated the cliche riddled plot, and axed the mundane storyline. He might have hired better actors or at least helped the ones he had into crafting a skilled performance. As I see it a movie detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor all the way up to the famous raid by General James Dolittle would be a very interesting movie indeed. But the problem lies with Bay and him alone. Its the way he directs. Scenes are too short that should be long. There isn't enough time to flesh out characters that are interesting, and with the fact that the three you have are about as interesting as a fly on a windowsill, thats a bad thing. Even the Japanese should be more insulted by this tripe since they are shown to be bloodthirsty war mongers who only wish to attack America so they can continue raiding China unabated. The only interesting character I found in the movie was a dog aboard one of the destroyers. This movie feels more like a three hour music video instead of an epic the size of The Longest Day, or The Godfather. If you should even be interested in the least of seeing this, be smart and do like I did; rent the DVD. That way you can at least skip to the battle scene (the only thing Bay seems able to do right) The only qualm I had with this is one bad special effects shot that shows planes that look the size of model air planes zooming by the sinking ships, and the fact that the overall feel of the scene made it feel like Independence Day, which dosen't really show any respect for an event of this magnitude."
"Kakueke","3","1","1","22 September 2001"," Banal and unimaginative
","The only reason to see this movie is the battle scene toward the end, but in contrast to the scenes at the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it is not complemented by the rest of the film.  After a not-so-bad start, the screenplay of Pearl Harbor degenerates into the insipid and uninteresting.  Altho the acting, while not great, is not terrible either, it does not matter.  There is very little character development, especially of the women, and of course, none of the Japanese (contrast this to the great film ""Tora Tora Tora"").  The cinematography shows some good sunsets, but overall loses the backdrop in favor of unneeded continual close-ups of the characters.  Very little of Honolulu and inadequate as to other surroundings --""Tora"" was also much better here.<br/><br/>From everything to lines like ""I just want to matter,"" to the insipid love lines, to the reappearance of Rafe after the fall in the sea, Pearl Harbor exudes banality and triteness, hackneyed and clicheish lines, and predictability.  A further downside is achieved by including the Doolittle Raid (suddenly, fighter pilots are bomber pilots)--is not Pearl Harbor enough of an event in itself, with the focus partially lost by the filmmakers' need for a cheap vindictive counterraid?  Is not the implied result of the sneak attack on America enough?  And how many total unentertaining minutes does that give this turgid film?<br/><br/>As one who sometimes thinks the critics are unfair, for various reasons (including self-aggrandizement) in trashing movies, this time they certainly were on target.  A blockbuster disappointment."

","To be honest, I'm quite surprised by how many people dislike this movie. Then again, whenever a blockbuster movie about a historical event comes out all people can ever talk about are the historical inaccuracies. I'll admit that I don't know much about what happened at Pearl Harbor, but what I do know was quite accurate in the movie. People act like movies like these are suppose 100% correct. If you want to watch a movie like that go pick up a documentary on Pearl Harbor instead of watching a movie that is obviously going to have some fiction in it to attract More people to watch it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film because it was shot excellently and the special effects were amazing. The main reason I watched it in the first place was because I heard about the dramatic romance (I am a chick after all), but even I thought it was a little cheesy. The writing in some of those scenes were a little over the top, as if anyone would ever say, ""I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you"". I think, however that the love story brought more feeling to the movie. It made it seem more real, people that had loved ones were dying.<br/><br/>The movie might not be a number one in any aspect (writing, directing, acting), but I think it deserves a little more because for a blockbuster movie, it was pretty good. I mean, look at some of the crap that is being put on the big screen nowadays."

I have visited Pearl Harbor and the Museum in Honolulu, but didn't think much about it at the time.  Since seeing this movie, I can reflect back on the visit and it has brought a whole new meaning to my visit.  If you own or rent the video version, you can view the documentary at the end of the movie.  The documentary will bring a whole new meaning to the fictional movie.  If you haven't taken the time to see the movie, the time is now!  If you men out there think that this is just a love story, take the time to watch it, you'll wonder why you really didn't want to see it to start with.  The special effects are great and Hans Zimmer has out done himself with the music.  This is a movie to watch with your children, so you can explain America's past.  (Although there is adult language, drinking, and one carefully handled sex scene). Comparing this movie to Titanic:  Think about it, which will be more believable?

","If you think that this movie casts an ugly light on the Japanese, you obviously do not know your history. What happened at Pearl Harbor is well documented, and it would behoove you to read it before stating ignorant half truths and showing the entire world what a buffoon you are. If you hate the movie fine, but don't hate it for it's portrayal of the Japanese or anyone else. Let bygones be bygones, but the Japanese invasion on Pearl Harbor was just what the movie portrayed: an unprovoked attack that left thousands of Americans dead. After the attack came the Doolittle raid, yes, but more importantly, a very long and grueling war on all fronts. If you must protest the American response, protest the bomb...oops too late. In retaliation for the most ignorant and thoughtless attack on American soil, the US destroyed an entire city in a matter of seconds. I'm not going to say that the US did right by dropping the A bombs on Japan, but I will not watch someone spout their mouths saying that the Japanese did not commit such an atrocity as was shown in the movie. The attack was real, the pain and death was real. Sometime take a flight to Honolulu and pay a visit to the Arizona memorial. Yell through the water to the bones of those still trapped inside that they only died because they were in the USNavy during a war, and that the Japanese did not attack them and kill them in cold blood. Again, learn some history before spouting that garbage, please."

","(!!Possible Spoilers!!) Well I just got back from watching 'Pearl Harbor' and I must say I am in absolute awe.. This definetly has to be one of the most amazing films I have ever had the privilege to witness.. The CGI/effects throughout the movie is amazing.. no.. Mind-Blowing!.. The aerial scenes are terrific.. Better than those of Star wars fame!! Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) have really outdone themselves and surely will win the Oscar For Visual Effects.. But what really got my juices flowing was the initial attack on 'Pearl Harbor'.. It was an eerie site following the 350 Jap Zero's on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor.. And once the bombing commenced all one could do was just sit and stare.. It was so realistic that it felt you were right there getting hacked to pieces by zero fire.. Kudos go to Michael Bay for staging the 40 minute attack sequence. Michael Bay is definetly one of the world's best action directors.. The action in this movie is absolutely amazing.. from the scenes of the Battle of Britain to the DoLittle raid.. amazingly crafted.... But what really spoils this film from being one of the great motion-pictures ever.. is the love story.. which is very ordinary.. and VERY cliche'.. The script is penned by Randall Wallace who co-wrote 'BraveHeart' and in his latest outing he hasn't delivered the goods. It was sadly just too predictable and corny. I won't go into detail about the love triangle because I don't want to spoil anything worth spoiling. Overall this is way above your average Summer 'Blockbuster'. The script is your ordinary Summer Blockbuster fare, but what seperates this gem of a film from the rest of the pack is the action which surpasses anything in modern cinema. I know that's one hell-of-a statement but it's true. The 'critics' (who I honestly think should go f*** themselves) have blasted this movie from every penetratable angle. Please people don't let these hypocrites deter you from witnessing the spectacle which is 'Pearl Harbor'. It is by far the best summer movie in the last decade and I highly recommend it. Just stay comfortable for the first hour so the love story can unfold then prepare to be dazzled.<br/><br/>In my opinion I think this movie deserves 8 out of 10 on the imdb scale.. 2 off for the predictable love story.."

","When a true story of a horrible tragedy is told there are great expectations hanging in the balance.  Will the story be told accurately and factual? Will the individuals and their families who took part in the actual event feel honored in the way that they should or will they be displeased with the way it was told?  In this such case a truly inspiring film about a historical event was told in such a way that the shock of the event was felt again.  This movie will help innovate the way many people look at the attack on Pearl Harbor who never really grasped the intensity, the pain, and the losses that we suffered during that time, but will also help them come to realize how from such a tragedy came a new understanding of our place as Americans, a new maturity as a country, and finally a more noble and victorious outlook as a nation.  This movie was undoubtedly the most moving movie I have ever seen.  An outstanding on the edge of your seat story portrayed in a way that you have come to expect from Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Definitely one of the best must see movies of the year!"

learn in a historical film including a love story which was well written and I thought it was good very emotional the actors have good chemistry and the script was excellent my parents loved this movie and especially my mom loved it she thought the love story was the best thing about the movie but I didn't think it was the only thing great about the movie the love story is actually not what makes the film good what really makes the film good is the action sequences like when Japan bombed america and all the aviation which was the flight of the planes that were attacking the harbor and as well as when America was fighting back. the love Story was pretty good but like I said it's not why the film is good and even though my mom liked it the dialogue was quite cheesy but I respect her opinion and she thinks everything was great about the film besides that love story and the two main characters Rafe and Danny were in love with the same women Evelyn who is one of the nurses who helped the poor and in the end it all turns better it ends up with all the people who fought and helped for the country get honored that includes the nurses the soldiers and the pilots who get promoted to team captain in the squadron this movie has a heart and a soul and the cast , crew and makers of the film made one of the best plane aviation films ever and especially the ones about fighting in battle wars it is one of the best war films of all time along with saving private Ryan, from here to eternity , platoon , black hawk down , the thin red line and even tora tora tora which is more historically accurate though this amazingly awesometacular and brilliant epic romantic war film is also accurate in many ways with both having fictional characters and real characters alike it is very realistic and the characters are likeable and I loved the actors portrayal of the characters their ensemble was great , the cinematography was great , the editing was great even though it was very long and had unecesarry scenes but it also has good scenes where the two pilots Rafe and Danny were talking with their commander and when the fighters were discussing their next movie and how they were going to bomb Japan I also really like the depiction of president Roosevelt Jon Voight did an excellent job in portraying him and Alec Baldwin was also good in depicting commander Doolittle and also some of the screenplay was good to it was written by Randal Wallace who is a really good writer and especially because he wrote Braveheart here he tried his best and though he didn't really do the script good enough and many say it misses the point but still it is a really good movie it is for sure a top classic and it is very overrated and overhyped and it gets praised so much for its action scenes and the depictions of Roosevelt and Dolittle as well as the nurses and even though people didn't like the screenplay and some say the love story wasn't good Still everyone I meet loves it and some people love it completely including the love story and my mom is one of those who thinks it's so good that even the love story was well written and that the love part was really good and the film is on the same level as titanic I personally think both Pearl Harbor and titanic are both very great and overrated classics and they both deliver emotion and provoke thoughts terrifically here it provokes thoughts with how tragic , sad and violent it was when America was bombed while titanic provokes thoughts with the tragic disaster of the ship that got sunk by the iceberg again many people I have met in real life love it and even some of them say it is the citizen Kane of war movies though personally I wouldn't say that because this didn't get that well received by critics and that's the only problem with the movie everything else is perfect and I don't get how some critics hate it , it's awesome and amazing and to all the critics who gave this movie negative reviews shame on you, and whoever criticized and panned this film should be fired and not only that but any critic who gives Michael bay's movies bad reviews , hates him and says mean things about him like calling him a hack should be fired and have their mind checked and changed Michael bay was the right choice for making this movie he was right to direct it because he uses a lot of explosions in his movies and in this even there was a lot of bombing and there were a lot of explosions 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥 💥so bay was the perfect director to make this he made the event even more brutal and violent with more explosions and what he did was show us how much it was tragic and violent the war was and he captured it brilliantly he is for sure an intelligently talented genius and you must respect him at all costs just like other great directors, Scorsese, Spielberg , Lee ,Cameron, Jackson ,Lucas, Fincher , Coen brothers, wilder, Wyler, hitchcock , Kubrick , Eastwood , Zinnemann , Ford, felini, Leone and Bergman he is almost as great as those amazing directors though he is already as great as only peter Jackson , James Cameron and in parts spielberg whom he is great friends with many people say they wanted Kate to be with josh and the good thing is that Ben and josh didn't compete for the girl they wanted and that she loved both of them but chose to be with josh if he survived but he didn't and Ben won the girl and she then ended with him who became the stepdad of her newborn son and i agree it would make more sense if Kate should have stayed with josh because many wanted this to be in the ending then it would have better and if josh won the girl which he almost did Ben would have to have married one of the other nurses especially the one played by Jennifer garner who was his wife in real life still the ending was very sad and good and I am happy Ben got the girl he wanted that was in the love triangle even though josh's character Danny died it was very sad but it is still nonetheless a great and amazing movie and is worth watching once in a while This movie deserved Oscar nominations in the following categories<br/><br/>Best director: michael

","In garish detail and stunning investigative probing, PEARL HARBOR digs deep below the surface of the gasoline embargoes and jingoistic fomenting and reveals exactly what this WWII conflict was all about - the love triangle between three young American Models.<br/><br/>You see, Ben loves Kate. And Kate loves Ben. But Ben's best friend, Josh, also likes Kate. And there's a war with Germany or something happening. Ben is a hot pilot, and reports to somewhere overseas that is Not America for hot dogfights that make his biceps thrum with the need to hold Kate.<br/><br/>Ben is shot down and reported Missing In Action back in the United States, a land where every waking hour is spent looking to get laid (if you were a nurse like Kate) or looking to get laid (if you were a flyboy like Josh). So when Ben is reported missing, Kate cannot face the next five long days wondering if she will ever get laid again, so she falls in love with Josh.<br/><br/>Now Josh loves Kate. And Kate loves Josh. But Ben comes back. And he hits Josh for falling in love with Kate. Then they have a beer. And then the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. The end.<br/><br/>Don't even want to go into the real politics behind that Day of Infamy, December 7, 1941, when the Japanese launched a surprise attack that wasn't really a surprise on the American Pacific Fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. God knows, director Michael Bay doesn't.<br/><br/>Remember, if it weren't for those young models in love, none of this woulda happened. Written with emotive overkill by Randall Wallace (BRAVEHEART, 1996, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, 1998), HARBOR reminds us of TITANIC (1997), where the insufferable love story sucked all the oxygen out of the movie until James Cameron redeemed himself with that magnificent CGI boat-tipping.<br/><br/>Discounting the three-way pap between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, PEARL HARBOR's redeeming war scenes are cinematography gone insane. Spielberg never took to the air in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) - he still holds the crown for best ground skirmishes - it takes Michael Bay's sweeping cranes to now claim the crown for best air battles: Affleck gets to fly a Spitfire, the coolest fighter plane ever, in rampaging dogfights that put us so square in his hot pilot's combat seat that we can feel the sweat puddling on the backs of our patriotic thighs.<br/><br/>The scenes of the stealth Japanese planes flying low over American farmers and people out enjoying the world, thinking the war was in some other country, look surreal enough now - imagine how it must have looked in 1941. The thunderous grumble of amassed Zero engines splitting the rural morning, each plane loaded with one bomb each, tilting low over fields and schools, under American radar, Bay's characteristic American Blond Kids in slow motion below them.<br/><br/>The Pearl Harbor attack is launched with a tracking shot of a bomb loosed from a Japanese plane down to the USS Arizona, silently falling, then exploding and actually undulating the ship like a steel snake spasming. From there, the incredible realism of old school battle is more exhilarating than walking in on Kate Beckinsale sandwiched between Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.<br/><br/>Bay and cinematographer John Schwartzman have such a knack for creating iconic images that even whilst we cringe at the melodramatic slomo and hero framing of certain scenes, they wring a tear as well with their beautifully evocative composition. The art overshadows the story.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. fires a big deck gun. Tom Sizemore runs around his airfield and swears. Jon Voight shucks off his Republican idiocy to play Democratic president, FDR with great empathy. Obvious that Bay believes HARBOR to be his MIDWAY (that 1976 war epic with A-Listers piled on A-Listers: Heston, Fonda, Coburn, Mitchum, Mifune, Wagner...), as he populates his film with numerous ""names"" in smaller roles: Alec Baldwin, Jennifer Garner, Mako, Colm Feore, Dan Aykroyd, Ewen Bremner...<br/><br/>Beckinsale - ever the female double standard bearer - asks boxer, Cuba Gooding Jr., ""So why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?"" completely forgetting that her own boyfriend is gunning down strangers in planes to keep her respect, with his big Spitfire-shaped penis.<br/><br/>Kate tells Josh as he's going off to war, ""I love you and I'll be here waiting for you when you come back."" Of course, that's provided you don't go MIA and my thigh twitch compels me to turn to the Next Best Thing...<br/><br/>Cuba looked pretty hot on that big gun..."
"Shinzons","2","3","6","11 August 2008"," I felt physically ill after watching this
","Pearl Harbor is not only a terrible movie because it's just so terribly done, but because it leaves you feeling sick. I actually felt woozy after watching this film, i am not kidding. The music is so over the top it makes you feel like you're drowning in syrup, the characters are so undeveloped and underused that you don't care about them, and so the spectacle of the film feels hollow. And as for all of the sailors on the battleships who were blown apart, shot apart, and drowned, this movie doesn't show them at all until the attack comes, so when we actually see them dying, we don't really feel much. And the special effects actually aren't as good as they should be. The whole movie is a massive Titanic wannabe about an event that took twice as many lives yet has almost no emotional connection once the actual attack comes. And all those historical inaccuracies. Be respectful to the victims for god sakes. After seeing this i had to watch Schindler's List to remind myself that it is possible to make great movies. So to sum it up Titanic-James Cameron-James Horner+Michael Bay+ Hans Zimmer + Randall Wallace- any amount of talent= Pearl Harbor. Its as bad as they say it is."

The fleet did encounter some Jap fishing ships near their coast, which resulted in a longer flight over the Pacific Ocean. Several planes did did land or crash land in China, and some of the crew were captured. During the first part of the attack on Hawaii, the Generals were playing Sunday golf, as my Uncle was part of the group. On the Jap side the date was the 8th, not the 7th.

","If you type in ""pearl harbour"" into your Internet search engine, the two likely results will be: 1 - an event during WWII when the Japanese attacked the US Navy - causing thousands of casualties.. or 2 - a pointless love story<br/><br/>I'm not a historian - so lets concentrate on number 2 for now. Let me start by saying I have only seen this film once at the cinema when it first came out so my memory may be a little hazy.. I was genuinely excited about seeing the film - and although glorifying war is not right, I was looking forward to some good special effects and action scenes. The first half an hour or so was very good, when the Japanese were attacking it was edge of seat stuff - great drama. But then something happened, maybe someone lost the script? Maybe the dog ate it..but the rest of the film was a complete mess.<br/><br/>The cast is led the ever-terrible Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and the amazingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale. In a nutshell, Affleck and Hartnett (who play good friends in the film) compete in a tug of war over Kate Beckinsale (who wouldn't) - Ur, and thats it...nothing much else happened...its almost like it cant decide what it wants to be, either be a war drama or a love story, it starts off being one thing and turns into another.<br/><br/>Add a soundtrack more cheesy than a pack of Edam - and you have one of the worst ""blockbusters"" of all time."
"hackneyslim","Null","3","6","29 November 2004"," That's ""harbour"" actually
","Jerry Bruckheimer's latest large film - tipping ships over sideways, elevating Ben Affleck to Big Chin Leading Man, and not being as rude to the Japanese as perhaps one might have expected. Apart from the end bit.<br/><br/>December 7 1941 is a fairly important date in American history. The Japanese launched a surprise attack on the entire US fleet as it lay at anchor (read 'parked up') in Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian islands. As a result, President Roosevelt brought the USA into the war, and that was more or less that, according to people who aren't British. And that's 'harbour', anyway.<br/><br/>Our story follows two friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, as they grow up obsessed with planes and flying, and then the war comes and they get drafted as cooks. No, wait Rafe  Affleck  falls in love with a nurse  Kate Beckinsale  and then gets shot down over France and disappears and Danny  Josh Hartnett  falls in love with her himself, and they end up naked in Pearl Harbor together. Phew. This takes about 4 days of screen time and you're wishing the Japanese would hurry up, when guess what? Yeah, Rafe turns up, not burnt or anything  he was, like, hiding with the French for a year or something! Amazing! The same guy wrote this wrote Braveheart, so if you swallowed Willy Wallace speaking French and knocking up the Queen of England, this is nothing.<br/><br/>So the love story comes to a head, and then the bombs start falling and the budget just triples, man. The critics hated the slush and okay'd the bangs, and some folks reviewing the DVD on Amazon obviously liked both and gave it 5 stars. This, in my opinion, would presumably make something like Runaway Bride into a work of immeasurable genius. What do they think is a BAD film?<br/><br/>What is wrong with this film? Almost everything. Casting, plot, pacing, length, breadth, spelling... It's full of really off-putting cameos. Examples include boffin-typecast Dan Ackroyd as the Navy 'Intelligence' man who thinks something's up because 40 billion tons of dangerous shipping has gone off the radar. Yeah, we know. Why didn't you? One of the one million Baldwin boys  the old one  strolls around in Indiana Jones's leather jacket preening his hair-do and fingering his cheque as some horrible psychotic pilot person, who resurfaces to lead us into the most startlingly irrelevant ending I have seen since the 1999 European Cup Final. Almost as meaningless is Cuba Gooding's cameo, as a frustrated boxing cook who beats up honkies from other boats. You can imagine my profound shock when he turns Real Sailor and shoots down some Japanese plane attacking His Ship. Bring back Jeff Chandler and back projection if this is progress.<br/><br/>The last hour is frankly unbelievable. The bacon sandwich dropped from my numbed fingers as the film resolutely refused to end. You see, after the Japanese go back to their ships  (Navy radar people: 'Oh, There they are!') there's what seems to be an entire other movie stuck on the end. We haven't finished with Rafe and Josh and Kate and that stuff yet  and not enough foreign people of dubious religious conviction have been sent to meet their particular maker of choice, obviously. 183 minutes is an awfully long time to spend watching people who you don't care about sort their problems out. Even if they do have guns.<br/><br/>The love story is a bit silly, something akin to the Titanic romance, except longer and with quiffs, and the action scenes are interesting from a technical point of view but do not disturb like Ryan or rouse like Braveheart. The film looks like they didn't really care  one of those times when the hype gets you into your seat and the producer runs to the bank before you can figure it out and ask for your money back. The best thing I can say about the whole thing is that at least it gives you the opportunity to re-tell the one about the half-black, half-Japanese bloke who every December 7 would attack Pearl Bailey."

How about you forget that for a while and try tearing up the script and starting again or better still forgetting the whole idea.

Then the love story, painfully awful, the love of her life leaves, and she is so in love that she falls in love with his mate and then the fun of a boring love triangle begins. the action goes on forever and tell me how many people you actually see being killed during this time?

","This movie is a perfect example of why big-budget Hollywood movies are total garbage.<br/><br/>You'd think that the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor -- which resulted in the death of 2200+ soldiers/civilians -- would make for compelling drama. Apparently, Bruckheimer, Bay and Wallace didn't think that was dramatic enough.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer: ""We really need to punch-up the drama. The surprise attack, the appalling loss of life, the chaos and disorder... it's just not dramatic enough.""<br/><br/>Wallace: ""Hey, I know! Let's add an insipid, and totally irrelevant, love triangle into the mix!""<br/><br/>Bruckheimer: ""Perfect! Now the attack on Pearl Harbor will have the *oomph* it needs!""<br/><br/>This movie is a gigantic slap in the face to all the soldiers (Japanese and American) and civilians who lost their lives in this attack. Their travails, unbelievably, take a backseat to idiotic melodrama.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert put it best when he said, ""Pearl Harbor is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec 7th 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.""<br/><br/>Rating: 1/10"

","You'd think that in the decades since ""Tora Tora Tora"" (1970) and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944) that there was room for improvement, maybe a more personal story or a more historically accurate one.  Instead comes this monstrosity, one of the worst war movies, or movies of any kind, I've ever seen.  Not only does it take enormous license with the events at Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but the plot centers on a hackneyed love-triangle plot that was worn out even in the 1940s.  Even the highly touted ""special effects"" in this turkey look fake compared to the other films I've mentioned...this film belongs in a class with ""Inchon""."
"Patriotlad@aol.com","2","3","6","24 November 2003"," Butchering History For Profit
","There is apparently nothing in the march of the history of these United States that some flunkie in Hollywood will not co-opt, manipulate and then corrupt.  The 2001 edition of Pearl Harbor is a classic example of throwing huge money at a project in the hope that some of it will stick.<br/><br/>There is really only one way to view this movie and that is to see it in the Director's Cut:  some very explicit profanity and some very gruesome gore is included in that version, and when combined with the magnificent portrayals of the nurses, led by Kate Beckinsale, it makes this extraordinary failure bearable to watch.  Having been required to see it four times, for reviewing purposes, constitutes 'cruel and unusual punishment.'  The film churns the true history of the country as if it was raw milk being prepared for butter.<br/><br/>The script is a fraud.  From conversations with men and women who were actually there, at Pearl Harbor, on that hideous day in 1941, I can say that the portrayals of the pilots as being 'goody two shoes' kinds of guys were wholly inappropriate.  There's hardly a cigarette to be seen in the course of Pearl Harbor, when in fact seventy-five to eighty percent of those people who were depicted in this sham, were smokers.<br/><br/>The way the director and the costumers ""tart up"" the nurses is despicable. They were Navy nurses, not saints, and not Brooklynite bimbo girls. Jamie King is great as the goofy runaway kid, Betty, and Kate Beckinsale is the only reason to see this movie more than once.<br/><br/>She does, in fact, carry the whole plot line of the movie.  The rest of it is little more than Hollywood-style historical butchery, for profit.  In the time leading up to the December 7th attack, which covers almost all of 1941, there is not one indication of how fervent and widespread was the popular opposition to the ""interventionist"" views of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his kitchen cabinet, who are not even portrayed.  The America First Committee, which organized huge rallies against having the United States get embroiled in the war between Germany and Great Britain, featured members as diverse as Gore Vidal and John F. Kennedy.  Public sentiment was overwhelmingly against getting involved in the European war's bloodshed, and there were many leaders in the military who questioned giving the British any war materiel:  not because they liked Adolph Hitler or Benito Mussolini, but precisely because they were watching the rise of Japanese militarism with growing alarm.  Painting Franklin Delano Roosevelt as some kind of a secular political saint, in this movie, is another brutal re-rendering of the true history.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is lauded for its ""representations"" of the aerial attack on the Pacific fleet.  They are technically brilliant.  One survivor of Pearl Harbor, who was a mere stripling youth of 18 and 1/2 on his first posting for the Army, told me that after seeing the movie he felt ""dirty.""  He said the way the violence was glamorized amounted to a kind of pornographic treatment.<br/><br/>He said that the panic and confusion of that day was barely touched on in the movie, and he felt cheated by the whole experience.  After four complete viewings of this movie, so do I."
"truiz1","9","3","6","5 July 2001"," I don't care what the critics say, I like Ben Affleck and I loved this movie.
","Pearl Harbor kept me in my seat from start to finish.  I could have lived without the love story (or at least with a different version of the love story, which is the most I can say without giving it away), which probably would have made the movie 45 minutes shorter and a little less commercial. But Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett made great war heros and their relationship brought a warmth that often doesn't exist in a war movie. Yes, Pearl Harbor was written to be a blockbuster rather than a critical success, but aside from Alec Baldwin's badly written part I thought it was a great lift-your-spirits patriotic movie in these times where we are no longer proud to be Americans (or at least afraid to show it).  And it was a good portrayal of young soldiers during that time."

","As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good.  Everything about it.  The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form last summer's blockbuster Pearl Harbor.  Upon reading reviews of this film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers.  They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of ""the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory.""  What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans.  Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the  sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves.  Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it.  It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail."

","Michael Bay is known for applying his astonishingly fertile imagination to producing gripping, pulse-pounding cinematic action. PEARL HARBOR delivers all this and more because, unlike most of Bay's films, much of the movie has a mysterious, poetic quality. It actually has the unmistakable feel of a tale told from memory ... that sense of days gone by, and long-remembered. The director interviewed a large number of survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack before making the film and screened it for them before it was released. Unlike most American film critics, they found the movie to be powerful and very true to what they felt about their experiences. The key word here is ""felt"". While the film - other than the battle scenes - is not meant to be taken as a literal portrayal, it is remarkably true, it seems, to the inner, emotional experience. American film critics have always had trouble relating to abstraction - probably because the American film tradition itself is so deeply rooted in ""wrought iron"" realism. But the critics and viewers who have dumped on this fine work have really missed out on a significant and insightful creation. The core subject of PEARL HARBOR is the way events in the early 1940s plucked a generation of young people out of their peaceful lives and forced them - almost instantaneously - to enter adulthood. They were called upon to sacrifice - to become heroes - to die for a way of life they would ultimately have to deny to themselves. Bay's work here is brilliant and compelling. For once, he devotes his considerable genius for creating powerful images to a higher purpose - and, for the viewer who responds to this, the film lives on in the mind through these magnificent images. During the battle sequence, there is one particular shot of an American flag that serves perfectly as a metaphor for what happened on that fateful day. Though many of the details people have scoffed at are, in fact, authentic, this film is nowhere close to being a docudrama. PEARL HARBOR rather speaks the language of archetypes and leaves you with its powerful and memorable imagery. Most importantly, it is a great, moving, unforgettable monument to the inner experiences of the people who actually lived the epic drama of World War II."

And according to my history teacher (Mr. Miller) PEARL HARBOR was historicaly correct (except for the character, obviously) he also said that most people hated it cause of the love story thrown in there but he told me that it happened in real life (the fact that the guy was shot down and she moved on).  Also the music was great.  I don't remember any music in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  If the critics have convenced you that this movie stinks don't listen to them this movie was great.  If you haven't seen it go and see it, it is worth the money you pay."

","Pearl Harbor was an excellent piece of love story with a very realistic view of war.  Pearl Harbor has different genres for everyone: A love story for the ladies, special effects and action for the thrill seekers, historical events for the intellectuals, comedy for the laughter-seekers, and things blowing up for the macho men.  Pearl Harbor will make you laugh, and make you cry, and also gives people a patriotic feeling of victory while revealing the horrors of war.  The cast were also magnificent.  Ben and Josh were absolutely gorgeous, and Kate was a brilliantly leading lady, her accent didn't even slip once!!  Jerry Bruckheimer's movies are always so lively and interesting to watch.  A great job by both the cast and the crew. Compared to Pearl Harbor, Titanic was just a sinking ship!  I didn't even like Titanic, and Leo had little to offer compared to Ben and Josh!!!"

","Pearl Harbor is very well done in every aspect of movie making. Yes the movie is long but it is needed to be that long to show everything it needs to show.<br/><br/>The acting is superb.All should win an oscar especially- Jon Voight, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. The visual and sound deserves oscars. The directing and producing deserves oscars. Since Jerry and Michael are the best in film making these days. overall this movies rocks, and an epic movie that i hope goes down in history, for making you cry making you cheer and making you sit on the edge of your seat.

I was greatly surprised at the outcome of the movie and I am very disappointed that the critics gave it such a low rating. Shame on you, It makes you wonder whether the people should be doing the reviews instead of the critics. Ben Afleck a wonderful actor and is most suited for the part. Josh Hartnett....

"frontstreethamilton","10","4","10","18 June 2001"," Excellent film, Excellent cast!
","The film really was brilliant! 'Pearl Harbour' portrays the importance of romance in the 40s which helped people through the difficult war period. How everyone had a clear, very important role to play, not just the men, but the women too!  Kate Beckinsale was a great female lead, everything from the acting, to the 40s hairstyles, lipstick and nail polish.  The whole cast were excellent - very sexy men and their acting of course!  Ben Affleck was my favourite actor, I love most of his films and, he is gorgeous, but ... has a certain sexiness about him!!!  Faith Hill's 'There you'll be' really compliments the film and is a great track!"
"grease1739","10","4","10","15 June 2001"," Superb! An epic that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion.
","This movie has been trashed since its release, but is a true epic.  The performances by Affleck, Hartnett, and Kate(who looks like an angel) are all strong and convincing, and the special effects are so realistic that it will make your stomach churn.  It is rare that a film affects me that way this one does.  One minute I was laughing, the next filled with anger, then in awe of the action, and I even cried.  Those who have trashed this movie are the people who go in expecting non-stop action for the entire 3 hours, and those who have labelled it another mindless blockbuster, without giving it a chance.  Don't get me wrong there is PLENTY of action involved, but it is more than just the action that makes the movie.  What makes the movie in my opinion, is the love triangle, and the strength of Raef and Danny's relationship and the situations that life throws at them.(This is coming from a guy, so it is not the chick flick that many label it as.) I have seen this movie twice already, once with my brother and the other with my girlfriend, and we all loved it.  As I said this is a movie for both guys and the girls. While the script isn't anything Oscar worthy, it definitely draws you and keeps your interest, and builds up to a beautiful yet horrific climax, after all, this isn't just a movie about the bombing like many people go in expecting. I was not one of those people so I went in with an open mind and just hoped there was plenty of action throughout the movie(Which there was)  Beckinsale was absolutely georgeous, and perfect for the role of Evelyn the nurse.(After watching her performance, I was glad Charlize Therone did not take the role) I have always been a fan of Affleck and once again he did not disappoint, but the strongest performance was by Josh Hartnett who I have been following closely from his early days in The Faculty, and H20. He really steals the screen every time he is on.(even when sharing it with Affleck)<br/><br/>Critics may have blasted this movie, but in my opinion they went in with the frame of mind that they were already going to blast it, so don't take what most of them say about this movie too seriously, and give it a chance, it is definitely the best movie of the summer so far, and has all the makings of an epic.  SO GO AHEAD AND SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I know I will enjoy this movie time and time again. (****) out of (****)"

","Pearl Harbor is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen.  It is simply brilliant!  And I can't believe the critics said it had a weak love story.  It was such a good, refreshing love story - entirely original with strongly developed characters!  In fact I was surprised at how well developed the characters were.  I thought that it would basically just be an action movie, but was I pleasantly surprised.  The movie totally gripped me emotionally AND visually.  It's simply out of this world.  It was funny, it was sad, it was exciting, it was tragic!  This movie has everything!  Pearl Harbor deeply moved me.  Ben Affleck was awesome, Kate was endearing, and Josh - well, what can we say about him?  He is simply stunning - WOW!  I really wish him well in his future - his future in a movie career looks really bright.  The attack scene was excellent.  I've never seen anything like it in any movie.  It really made you feel as if you were a part of it - as if you were right there!  Good work, everyone! What else can I say, except that I simply LOVED the movie.  It's BRILLIANT!!!"
"sim-richmond","10","3","7","21 August 2012"," The Best Action-Drama Film!
","Honestly, this movie is my favorite movie of all, even though it is heavily criticized, and the reason behind is because of these:<br/><br/>First point: We all know that what happened in the actual Pearl Harbor attack was just bombing and nothing else. That's why Michael Bay had to make a story out of it having the Pearl Harbor bombing as its theme because it would be boring to watch a film full of explosions without any revolving story. This is also the main reason why we could not sue the producers for all the historical inaccuracies because in the first place, they haven't claimed that the story was a true story nor based from a true story.<br/><br/>Second point: The heavily criticized part of the movie was of the love triangle, but I see it the other way around. They have just put some sort of convolution on its plot and they have chosen romance particularly love triangle, because it would be the best way to put drama in it and is the best way to put the people into the shoes of the characters, especially because the target audience of the film was not those who were living since 1941. Besides, having the romance on the first part gave the audience a hinge of feeling during the 40s.<br/><br/>Third point: It was not only about romance that the story revolved on. It also was about the friendship of the characters, how it was destroyed by a simple love triangle, and how destiny made them push through with their lives. And this part is very touching and relatable.<br/><br/>Literary wise, the techniques used by its producers were effective enough to raise the feelings of the viewers. <br/><br/>The computer generated effects, on the other hand, used in the movie was simply amazing. It really looked like real. Hands down and thumbs up for that! The cinematography is to be critically acclaimed. It is obvious that the latter really was planned thoroughly and was given much effort.<br/><br/>Congratulations to all the people behind this quite good movie and you deserve a perfect 10!"

"patrick-braley","10","3","7","7 August 2005"," In spite of all that's been said: a remarkable movie
","If instead of calling this movie ""Pearl harbor"", they had called it, say ""Enemy at the Port"" (like they did with the movie on Stalingrad), I'm sure most viewers would have been more positive in their comments. Yes, it is set on and around Dec. 7, 1941, and the location is (mostly) Pearl Harbor, but the story could have been the same, and been called, say, Iwo Jima, or Tarawa, with the same romance (whether one likes romance or not is another thing altogether), and the war scenes could have been along the same lines, only in a different setting. The reason for the movie's low rating is simply that: people thought they would be seeing a movie on the historical Pearl Harbor events, and they left the theater bitterly disappointed. Agreed, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a much better historical movie. But don't go buy a 7Up and say that champagne is better -- they're not in the same league."

I would just like to say that maybe you should do a little reading because if you did, you would find that the ""soppy"" love story that was in the movie was actually true. The reason it was put in the movie was because it actually happened, so before you start talking s**t about how they never should have put that in because it had nothing to do with Pearl Harbor, you should know what you're talking about.

If you still don't agree with that, then who cares? What about how well the movie itself was made? The effects were EXCELLENT and the acting was EXCELLENT and it was VERY relevent and realistic. Have you watched the documentary on the history channel on Pearl Harbor? It's almost EXACTLY like the movie! The movie sticks to the facts, while touching your heart, and expanding your emotions. This movie definitely deserves a 10. For excellent directing, producing, acting, historic references, stunts, and effects. Just look beyond the story, and into HOW the movie was made. Watch it again.

"JackDevoe","10","3","7","29 August 2002"," One of the best of 2001
","I don't care if a movie is 3 hours long, or if every little historical detail is not 100% accurate. I know the film makers were not making this movie for the sake of ""pretty actors prancing around in a bogus movie."" I know for a fact that Michael Bay set out to make a great film. He dropped out of this movie twice before getting what he wanted. While this movie is also around to bring in money, it was also meant to be good. Michael Bay was at his best in the director's chair. The visuals were fantastic. The cinematography was comparable to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where bright colors are not so apparent. The dialog was not cheesy. Even though some story-telling elements are basic, it's all worded differently by the actors who do a great job. Ben Affleck is one of my new favorite actors. Over the years he's matured as a real serious actor. Josh Hartnet has still got it too. Kate Beckinsale did a nice job too, and it's hard to believe that she was difficult to work with in this movie. Even though it was a small role, it was nice to see Dan Aykroyd. (Did I spell it right?) He had something of a serious presentation with the few lines he had, and made his extended cameo more noticable than it normally would be. Alec Baldwin was also a good touch to the movie. I only wish to see him more as a leading man than a suporting man. The special effects looked very real. I could not tell what was computer animation and what was real. This was especially effective during the big moment of the movie. The seemingly 40 minute battle sequence at Pearl Harbor was one of the most intense sequences in any movie. This scene alone is worth the whole movie. It has been a long time since I held tightly to the seat, pushed against the cushions, and had to catch my breath when the scene was over. Plus it wasn't glorified to a stupid level. The sequence didn't make it look like the Americans won. But it did show how they were able to take a stand as best they could during the horrible battle. They at least lost while giving the Japanese everything they got. Another great touch was how old WWII footage would be shown, and how the movie was filmed within it. And how it would fade from old film to new film in between scenes. This movie was critically panned simply because people got their hopes up WAY too high. A movie shouldn't fail because of this. It seems like people would like movies better if they weren't so ready for ""the best thing in the world."" PEARL HARBOR isn't the best, but it's one of the best of 2001."

"tfrizzell","Null","3","7","31 July 2002"," Will Definitely Make a Case for Biggest Bust of the Decade.
","Oh gosh a pure disaster of a film that is to the 2000s what ""Dune"" was to the 1980s and ""Wyatt Earp"" was to the 1990s. A totally disappointing would-be masterpiece that never does find its way and bores with a sappy love story more than it intrigues with a loud and empty action sequence that is interminable. It is 1941 and the U.S. is on dangerous ground as the attack on Pearl Harbor looms as Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale fall in love, but when it appears that Affleck is dead, Beckinsale starts to fall in love with his best friend (Josh Hartnett). A torrid love triangle gets in the way of the tenseness that made ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" such an interesting, albeit under-achieving, production. The attack comes, oh does it ever come, and Pearl Harbor is left in shambles. So now Affleck and Hartnett must put their differences aside when the U.S. couter-attacks in the almost unknown Dolittle Raid (which is not written about much because it too was such a disaster for the U.S. military). A long and sometimes incredibly dull film that does best when Cuba Gooding, Jr. is on screen. He co-stars as an African-American sailor who tries to earn respect from his contemporaries in a military that is fueled by racial unrest. Gooding, Jr.'s character is based on a real person who actually shot down several Japanese attack planes and was awarded a medal that was later taken back by the government. That possibly intriguing story is only given a minute glimpse as Michael Bay gets carried away with corny special effects and Randall Wallace's irritating screenplay. A major downer of epic proportions. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

I noticed some have harped about the historical value of the movie but hey even the stars touted it as being a love story in all the pre-movie interviews. I suppose if you want to watch a War movie you might be disappointed...go rent Blackhawk Down.  The atmosphere of this love story reminded me of the good old fashioned romance/war movies.  I thought the acting was good and I did feel the chemistry in the love triangle.  The parachute hanger scene alone is worth watching the movie for.

"Kmay4422","10","3","7","3 June 2001"," A Historical Love Story
","`Not anxious to die, sir, just anxious to matter' says Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck: Forces of Nature, Armageddon).  Primarily Pearl Harbor is a love triangle between Rafe, his best friend Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett: Here on Earth, The Faculty), and an army nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale: Emma, Much Ado About Nothing) set in 1941.  This love story takes a violent swing when on December 7, 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on the naval base.  The director, Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) did a wonderful job of depicting that infamous day and also tying in a love story making it a wonderful War/Drama/Action movie.  This movie is one of the best in a long time.<br/><br/>To begin, this film will be how future generations learn about Pearl Harbor in their history class.  It gives a fantastic view on what happened on that fateful day because of the wonderful job Bay did sharing his vision.  Bay could not have done any thing more to the movie and he could not have done anything less.  The script, by Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask), was enough to make anyone feel that they were there.  Wallace did a wonderful job of tying in a non-fiction event with a fiction love story and making it easier to understand.  Even though there were a few minor historical flip ups, such as two Japanese strategists being combined into one and having a hospital being at the center of an attack which did not happen, it did not take away from the historical significance.<br/><br/>Another good part of the movie was many big name actors.   Affleck, Cuba Gooding Jr. (Doris Miller), Jon Voight (President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and Alec Baldwin (General Doolittle) built the base of the film but did not overpower any of the lower caliber actors.  Voight did a convincing job of portraying Roosevelt and made it believable that he was really there serving his country.  There was a lot of tension and love that these actors had for their characters and the other characters around them.  The actors acted as if they were there in 1941 and it was very easy to believe. The action and special effects of the battle scene are some of the best ever made.  The shots that rang out and the planes flying by made it feel that you yourself were fighting the battle.   The camera angles used and lighting put the audience into the action.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint the movie flowed very nicely and separated the love story from the war story.  The sequence of events was very believable from the Japanese planning the attack, to Washington, and back at the base. The moods also flowed very nicely from the tense moments of the war to the sad moments of the love story. The music helped make this transition even better.  With a love theme, `There You'll Be', sung by Faith Hill and the score composed by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Prince of Egypt) the music makes the film wonderful and will move anyone to buy the CD, which they will be listening to for years to come. Finally, this is going to be the blockbuster movie of the summer and sweep the Academy Awards next year.  This movie gets 4 out of 4 stars.  There are things to be learned about the war and yet very entertaining for 3 hours, which does not get long in fact it ends too soon.  `Pearl Harbor' has a PG-13 rating for sustained intense war sequences, images of wounded, brief sensuality, and some language.  This is how it was and is a perfect way for anyone to learn about the day that started World War 2; Pearl Harbor"

"queenie3_00","10","3","7","30 October 2001"," Best written and acted movie ever!
","Okay so when Pearl Harbor came out I wasn't all that excited to see Ben Affleck in yet another movie. But after almost 6 months after it was released into the movie theatre I broke down and decided to see this movie in a dollar theatre (which I might add that the place was packed with people).  I fell in love with this movie.  It seemed so real to the events that took place, though it was brilliantly censored to the actual happenings of Pearl Harbor.  But it was so factual and so close to the way things were like back then. From the way the people acted, to what they were thinking, to the clothes they wore, to the actual events that took place.  The only event the movie didn't really emphasize on was that WWII actually was what brought the U.S. and the rest of the world out of the Great Depression.  But other than that, it hit the nail right on the head. It was indeed a sad movie, but thats the effect that war leaves on a country.  Though Ben Affleck was supposed to be the big star of the movie...I feel that his friend Danny(Josh Harnett) did a much better job at acting than he did.  He was more into it, and more realistic.  When a ship exploded for example, instead of just running behind a car and squating like Ben Affleck did, he (Josh) seemed more jumping and panicked and kind of fell behind the car and couldn't seemed to find his foot grip.  Now that to me seems more realistic. So bravo to all the actors and the producer and director who created such a wonderful movie. And the composer Hans Zimmer for created such an awesome sound track, and to Diane Warren for writing such a beautiful song ""There You'll Be"" and to Faith Hill for performing the song so beautifully."

"starlet86","10","3","7","22 September 2001"," a worthy effort
","I can't deny this film was overhyped and ridiculously compared to Titanic. They were both love stories with a historical disaster as a backdrop but the similarities end there.  Pearl Harbor's story was less straightfoward and the characters weren't as well-developed as Titanic's.  You don't see the love developing and growing in Pearl Harbor.  However, the acting was decent enough to make you care about the characters.  No one was miscast. Although Ben Affleck's Tennesee accent was overdone, he was able to convey Rafe's emotions very well.  Jon Voight and Alec Baldwin were exceptional, though I don't see why Doolittle knew they were gonna win the war through Rafe and Danny.  Plus, the historical aspects were woven smoothly into the main plot. The humor was also well-done, especially the opening scene.  The opening foreshadowed how funny the rest of the movie was gonna be.<br/><br/>For those of you who say the Japanese were depicted poorly, they weren't supposed to be developed.  They were only supposed to be there for the sake of being there.  For those of you who criticize the PG-13 rating, fear not. The DVD is gonna have all the rated-R stuff that Disney made Bay cut out. So when you turn on your VCR/DVD player to play this, kick your feet up one more notch."

","No it is not the overpolished shots, nor the melodic sound track, nor the brave hunks libe Ben and Josh, nor the lacrymal effects of the death of one of the hero, nor the classical love-story, nor the underlying jingoistic heroism after the humiliating coward attack that make this film disappointing : it is the waste of so much talent and money.<br/><br/>The acting is fair and mostly credible whereas the story is so cliched. Ok yes you can feel a few emotions but it seems so  ""Bruckheimered"" that I find it hard to really identify myself during the emotional scenes. If you don't see what I mean just imagine the slow-motion camera on the hurt soldiers + hans Zimmer music and you will already  fancy the revenge of the sleeping giant (the US). Or you could imagine the third role good black guy (Cuba Gooding, Jr) who should also be entitled to be a true American hero by shooting one plane.<br/><br/>Anyway  besides the clichés and once you forget the historical inaccuracies, you could have ""the epic romance story during tragic history"" style of film, and that's where the shoe pinches because the epic soufflé never rises and the romance is predictable, contrived and too melodramatic !<br/><br/>Understand me, the movie is not that bad : you get more at watching it fully despite the 3 hours long than watching the trailer. It works as long as it aims at entertainig and has even some good points : the battle scenes are impressive (and even should I say it : nice),and the film is also a respectable tribute to the American heroes of WW2. Ben Aflleck is rather convincing, every shot of the film is like a Hawaian postcard. So bad the clichéd storytelling entangled all that.(6 out of 10)"
"TxMike","Null","4","11","1 March 2002"," Good film. This review which follows is perhaps the most balanced anyone will find.
","some SPOILERS will follow...<br/><br/>I purposely waited until ""Pearl Harbor"" was on DVD so that I could see it not only in the comfort of my own home theater, but also take advantage of all the interesting extras sure to accompany the DVD. I am not disappointed. What follows are (1) a review of the film itself, (2) a commentary on the misleading negative reviews, (3) a short discussion of the statistics of IMDb votes, and (4) a comment on the DVD itself.<br/><br/>REVIEWING THE FILM - The film itself is rather long, about 3 hours, on 2 DVDs. As we see from the ""extras"", great care was taken to incorporate realistic stories composited from several real Pearl Harbor heros, and to accurately recreate the horror of the surprise attack at 7:55AM on Sunday, December 7, 1941 by the Japanese. It is a highly pro-USA account, but considering that this is a ""movie"", and the target audience was primarily American, that makes sense.<br/><br/>The story starts in 1923, in Tennessee, where boyhood friends Rafe and Danny pretend to fly and shoot down Germans. Cut to 1941, Long Island, where both of them are fighter pilots.  Rafe falls for pretty nurse, Evelyn, then is asked to go to England to help fight the Germans. Very successful there, he is eventually hit, ditches, is recovered by French, but presumed dead. Distraught and now both assigned to Pearl Harbor, Danny and Evelyn become friendly, real friendly, she becomes pregnant.  Rafe is alive, he shows up, there is an emotional struggle among the three to do the right things.<br/><br/>
Then the attack comes, all three are heroic, Evelyn in triage, Rafe and Danny shooting down 7 enemy planes. As the war progresses, Jimmy Doolittle conceives of a plan to launch bombers from a carrier, and Rafe and Danny volunteer to participate. The success of this mission is pivotal in the Japanese feeling vulnerable while the USA feels they can win the war. Rafe survives but Danny doesn't. In the end, Rafe and Evelyn and young son ""Danny"" are seen building their lives, all forever changed by the events of WW II.<br/><br/>Is the movie perfect? Far from it. Are there some cheesy lines? Sure there are, mostly because it seeks some ""entertainment"" value. However, the film overall is a fine achievement, showing through a fictional love story how some of the people likely were affected during that historic period. Plus, it contains 30+ minutes of truly magnificent re-enactment of that short but critical attack on Pearl Harbor. It cannot help reminding us how horrible war is.<br/><br/>My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, everyone should see it and understand it for what it represents, without being overly critical of what some may consider its weaknesses. We thought Ben Affleck was very effective as Rafe and Kate Beckinsale as Evelyn. The best acting accomplishment, however, was Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The IMDb ratings for ""Pearl Harbor"" cluster near ""7"" and that, or ""8"", is an appropriate rating, compared to all other modern feature films.<br/><br/>MISLEADING NEGATIVE REVIEWS - ""Pearl Harbor"" is a victim of ""the bandwagon effect"", where people read the opinions of others then adjust their own opinions to reflect the majority. At release, many well-known critics (see Ebert, for example) said some very negative things about this film. General audiences then went to see the film, and, jumping on the bandwagon, formed negative opinions also. Reading many ""user reviews"" reveals that the majority of the unbiased reviews are quite good, which is appropriate. To learn more about this do an internet search on ""bandwagon effect"" and read several of those summaries.<br/><br/>STATISTICS - The 13% of ""1"" IMDb votes for ""Pearl Harbor"" and the 15% of the ""10"" votes are equally out of place.  Remove those two extremes and the votes cluster strongly around a rating of ""7"" and are fairly normally distributed.  Compare that, for example, to a less-emotional recent film, ""The Yards"", which clusters much like ""Pearl Harbor"" but without the unusual ""1"" and ""10"" votes. ""Pearl Harbor's"" current rating is 5.8 while ""The Yards"" is 6.7, with almost identical median votes.  All of which supports the contention that this film deserves a rating of about ""7"" overall.<br/><br/>THE DVD - As DVDs go, this one deserves a ""10"".  It has either Dobly 5.1 or DTS 5.1 sound selectable. As I have found in all other DVDs where both are available, the Dolby sound track is much more aggressive in the low bass region. Example, at my normal volume setting for movies (-20dB), and at my listening position, the first big explosion at 90 minutes into the film recorded 102dB in Dolby but only 93 dB in DTS.  Since the dB scale is logarithmic, that represents EIGHT TIMES as much sound on the Dolby track. That is not a subtle difference! The DTS track overall is more realistic, however with a great subwoofer the Dolby track is certainly more exciting.<br/><br/>
Disk #2 has the last 1/3 of the film, plus two very nice extras. The first is a 47-minute ""making of"" which in many ways is more fascinating than the film itself. Just money would not have made this film. The men and women behind the location scouting, first-hand accounts, filming, special effects did almost unimaginable work to get this film made.<br/><br/>The second nice extra is a 45-minute History Channel special on the ""Unsung Heros"" of Pearl Harbor. Watching it convinces us of the accuracy and validity of the story told in this film. As I have said in other reviews, anyone still watching movies in the theater or at home on VHS are missing at least half, sometimes more, of the enjoyment of recent-release movies. DVD has come of age and it is the only way to go."

The film shows the extreme determination of the japanese and their love of honor. The two main charachters, two friends, are attaching and their love stories with the same woman is very tragic and it gives his emotion to the movie. 
However, this emotion can be also a negative point when it's cliché and mushy. The relation between the characters are too stereotiped, the nurse falls in love with the two brave soldiers who risk their lives fighting the in war... But it's a good point for the afficionados of love stories.

","This movie is almost an embarrassment to the legacy of the Pearl Harbor attack and the men and women who lost there lives that day, and through out the war. When I started watching this cheesy movie I thought someone had put the wrong DVD in the case, seriously. Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for this one.<br/><br/>The action sequences were the only slightly redeeming quality of this movie. The script was atrocious. The acting even worse. I expect bad acting from Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, but how did they get Kate Beckinsale to do a horrible job as well?<br/><br/>You would think after the success of a GREAT war movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" that a director like Michael Bay would want to present a great movie, that stays a little close to history, and has some semblance of the real life and times of the people of that generation. Instead he gives us a cheesy puff piece that pretty much uses every cliché of the 1940's era, and doesn't even come close to resembling real life.<br/><br/>Let's face it, this was more like some horrible dime story novel romance, and bromance set against the backdrop of WWII. If you want to see a war movie either don't bother with this filth, or just fast forward to the attack sequence and watch that ONLY. It gets worse as they drag out this disaster to give a even worse bromance sequence loosely based on the Doolittle raid.<br/><br/>This movie is trash!"
"TOMASBBloodhound","5","2","4","22 February 2011"," A grand miscalculation.
","It would be easier to overlook the historical errors, the poor dialog, the spotty acting, and the overly glossy direction of Michael Bay were it not for the most glaring flaw of all. That being the script that makes the whole thing revolve around a pointless love triangle. With so much going on, the last thing on earth you will care about while watching this are the three main characters and their love for one another! <br/><br/>The script touches on many interesting aspects of the earliest days for the United States in WWII, and one wishes we'd learn more about some of them. How about an entire film about the Doolittle raid? That whole sequence is thrown together so hastily in the final half hour that you almost want to shout, ""Okay, hold on! Who is Jimmy Doolittle? How did he put this thing together so quickly?"" But even this sequence is polluted with elements of the love triangle. I'm sure Kate Beckinsale would have been allowed close enough to listen in to the radio chatter during the raid. Of course she would! More could have been learned about the Japanese and their motives for the attack. Especially with Mako playing their commander. He was always an engaging actor, and you'll want to see more of him. The film has a lot of decent actors (Voight, Seizemore, Baldwin) who you'd much rather see and listen too than Affleck and Hartnett. Come on Jerry Bruckheimer! You're a smart producer and clearly the man in charge on this set. Couldn't you see that the southern accent only made Affleck's acting seem worse? Wasn't there anyone there to doctor up some of the hilarious dialog in Randy Wallace's script? Or did they assume the semi-literate multiplex PG-13 audiences that pay to see Bay's films wouldn't care?<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor made a little money, but was far from the hit they obviously intended. The success of Titanic a few years earlier had to lead the the story being constructed in such a manner. But what a miscalculation thinking the two tragedies had anything in common. Ben Affleck's career has since waned after even more poor films. Josh Hartnett's also stalled after this film. Bay continues to churn out PG-13 commercial slime that often does make money. But thankfully his efforts now don't try to re-write and gloss over actual history. Now he is free to make movies about cars that turn into robots and throw punches at each other. He's much more qualified for that kind of thing. 5 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

She is wrong on all counts.<br/><br/>I assert it was a success, it was excellent revenge, energizing the fervor on the home front was key to winning hearts and minds, and the negative affect on Japan's morale was enormous.

"rickhavoc1","3","2","4","3 September 2007"," Good in spots, but mostly bad.
","Here's my take on this movie. First, it was just too long! The editor should hang his head in shame. Some of the acting was good, but a lot more was either mediocre or bad. Ben Affleck should study some movies like ""Sergeant York"" and ""Glory"" to learn how to use facial expressions to effect. Also, Alex Baldwin's portrayal of Jimmy Doolittle is just laughable. Read J.H.D.'s autobiography ""I Could Never Be So Lucky Again"" to get a true portrait of this remarkable American. The best acting in the movie is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s and Jon Voight's. While the scenes showing the Japanese preparations were probably pretty accurate, and the attack and it's aftermath were great, it should have ended there. The rest of the movie was totally BOGUS. I don't insist on 100% historical accuracy, but I hate it when a major part of the plot is historical fabrication. The USAAF would never transfer fighter pilots directly to a bomber squadron like the movie showed. Especially not for a mission where they were attempting something that had never been done. I also think that the whole love triangle subplot was just a device to get women to see it, and the movie would've been better without it. Now, I want to answer some of the other comments I've seen here. First, it is well documented that Admiral Yamamoto was opposed to war with the U.S. Here's a quotation from him I found on Wikipedia: ""Should hostilities once break out between Japan and the United States, it is not enough that we take Guam and the Philippines, nor even Hawaii and San Francisco. We would have to march into Washington and sign the treaty in the White House. I wonder if our politicians (who speak so lightly of a Japanese-American war) have confidence as to the outcome and are prepared to make the necessary sacrifices."" He KNEW Japan would never win. The ""sleeping giant"" line at the end of the movie is also a direct quotation. Also, the scene showing the Japanese pilot waving to the boys playing baseball to warn them away is one of the few things in the movie that IS 100% historically accurate. One more thing, in 1941 FDR's health hadn't deteriorated too badly, and he was still able to rise to his feet unassisted, which is something he would have insisted on doing in public. So, watch the first 2/3 of the movie and the very end, and it's not so bad."
"gohlson","1","2","4","13 September 2005"," should be burned
","This is one of the worst movies of all time. We are lead to believe that two fighter pilot buddies happen to reunite in Hawaii the night before Pearl Harbor. Before that they were on Long Island, New York together before one goes off to England to fight the Germans. Then, somehow, he gets transferred back to the USAAC from the RAF in the middle of World War Two to go to Hawaii to be ready for the Japanese attack. yeah, right. All of those ships the Japanese destroyed in the attack look suspiciously modern, too. I don't think the US Navy had Aegis class guided missile destroyers in 1941. Yet, those are what the movie shows getting sunk. Then, the final coupe de grace, and if this is giving away the ending, it doesn't really matter since the movie doesn't really matter(as a piece of film, it should be burned/ as a piece of cinematographic art is should be placed in a trash can and as a reflection of history it doesn't even shine a dim light of truth) the fighter pilot from England and Long Island leads the first bomber raid on Tokyo. This would've been bad war propaganda in 1942 and is even worse as ""history"" in 2002. Every actor in this film should have their credits changed to ""anonymous"" and the directors, producers, and writers banned for producing banal tripe. It sucks."
"stewartatmountcarmel","8","2","4","9 July 2005"," Much better than it is given credit for.
","Having heard the negative publicity that this film had received, I set out to watch Pearl Harbor in order to experience the special effects - I was expecting little more in the way of entertainment. The film was a very pleasant surprise - much, much better than I had expected. Sure the Pearl Harbour battle scene, which lasts the best part of an hour, is absolutely incredible and worthy of recognition by the Academy or the Golden Globes for sound, or effects, or cinematography or whatever! Home Cinema absolutely essential mind you. I would strongly recommend that viewers watch the 45 minute documentary ""Making of Pearl Harbour"" on the second disc as this opens one's eyes to the fantastic achievement that the making of this movie represents.<br/><br/>In spite of the fact that the film lasts over 3 hours it never seemed to drag and was a very enjoyable experience. Certainly the two main characters (played by Affleck and Hartnett) are a bit like Batman and Robin as they strive to defeat the entire Japanese Empire with a little help from a few friends but, as you will find from the documentary, their actions were someone's actions - it's just that a lot of people's heroics have been rolled into two characters. The love story sub-plot involving our two heroes plus Beckinsale is somewhat unlikely (but not impossible) but adds to the film by allowing watchers to become more emotionally involved with the plight of the characters.<br/><br/>In my view the movie's emphasis on viewing the lead up to, attack on, and aftermath of Pearl Harbor through the characters leads to a more satisfying cinematic experience overall than, say, Tora! Tora! Tora! which is an historically more accurate but, due to its more documentary nature, less emotionally involving.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would recommend this film. If you set out to accept the movie at face value as the lives and tribulations of a number of characters set against a back drop of Pearl Harbour you will not be disappointed. And as I say the battle scenes are phenomenal!! PS: Jon Voight as the president is very, very convincing and deserves special mention."
"mOVIemAN56","3","2","4","11 May 2005"," Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Pearl Harbor is the so-called epic by Michael Bay following the true events that occurred on December 7th, 1941 in Hawaii. Instead of being an amazing epic film, this just fails on almost every level. <br/><br/>Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) have been friends since boyhood and are both in the US Airforce. Rafe has a girl(Kate Beckinsale) and is a fine pilot. Danny is his best friend but the two are separated when Rafe is shipped off to Germany. They don't hear from Rafe but from the War Department saying he has been killed in action. <br/><br/>Without having any sympathy for a plot or for Kate Beckinsale, Danny moves rite in and puts the moves on her. The whole group is in Hawaii having the time of their lives when Rafe returns from Germany saying that he survived the crash. Then fights break out and somehow Danny and Rafe drive off the base and into the mountains. <br/><br/>Next day, bombs are blowing up everywhere and soldiers are being slaughtered on the decks of their ships. Japanese have launched their offensive and an hour-long battle occurs which just gets boring after awhile. Somehow Rafe and Danny are able to get planes off the ground and drive away the bombers alone.<br/><br/>From here, what little story there is goes into the Pacific but I won't waste the unbelievable story. The only excitement in this is about the first twenty minutes of Pearl Harbor. Affleck and Hartnett equally suck as their southern farm boy soldier characters. Cuba Gooding Jr. is totally wasted in a supporting actor job. <br/><br/>The film is way too long, extending 2 hours and 40 mins. the acting is bad and it seemed every line Alec Baldwin said was suppose to be defiant and stunning. Guess what. They weren't!<br/><br/>There is about an 1 1/2 hour of dialog and boring crap of Hartnett and Beckinsale making out and Affleck breaking down into tears over and over again. The visual effects are good and the Japanese actors aren't bad, but if you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, I recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor.

And Dr. Zhivago is one painfully long, Harlequin Romance of a movie.<br/><br/>They try to follow so many characters in this movie, and switch between them so often, it is hard to get any continuity, or develop any sympathetic feelings for the characters.

There is little required anticipation, as what will next happen to the characters is basically the most formulaic and dramatic thing you can think of:<br/><br/>** SPOILERS - plot and dialogue ** Geez, I wonder if the pretty nurse who ISN'T Kate Beckinsale will die during the attack? Sounds predictable and dramatic, yep that's what happens in the movie. Geez, I wonder if the Kate Beckinsale pretty nurse will get between the two leading men? Of course. Geez, wouldn't it be ridiculously predictable and dramatic if pretty nurse Kate was pregnant, and wouldn't it be even more dramatic if these fighter pilots became bomber pilots, and then went on Doolittle's raid on Tokyo (not one of the other Japanese cities) and then the unborn child's father is killed but the other leading man in the end being with pretty nurse Kate? Oh, and what if the daddy-to-be doesn't even KNOW she's pregnant? Now you're getting the hang of it!<br/><br/>I can't exactly remember the dialogue, but I believe there are lines such as: ""My heart aches for you"", ""Whenever I see a sunset I'll think of you"", etc. and any memorable lines Roosevelt ever delivered relating to the historical incidents are in the movie too of course. As a rule, a few minutes of chatter are interspersed between the ""dramatic speech"" or ""dramatic scene"" by someone as there appears to be some need to have a really, really dramatic or CGI-filled or heart-rending scene every 5 minutes or so throughout the entire movie.

I can say confidently a goose could of better handled the seemingly limitless budget this film had. Camera's on bombs, CGI sequences all clouded the fact that the realism of the events was minimal. In all the big explosions it is only regretful that Ben Afleck didn't get singed. His performance was ridged as ever but some of the blame must be shifted to the embarrassingly awful love story. The leading female had fell in love so many times that by the films conclusion you didn't care who she stayed with, it was either pretty boy one or two, both equaling each other in stupid acts of heroism. The horror of war was over shadowed by the demonstration of cash. Films such as Saving Private Ryan pay tribute to the devastating effects of war, however in Pearl Habour all that seemed to happen is a few people fell in love. Salmon Salmon Salmon. I only wish the big directors in Hollywood would consider what they are doing rather than just chucking bundles of cash around the studio. Of all the war movies I have ever witnessed I think this is the only one that makes me wish I was being bombed. Perhaps this is a declaration of American pride in blowing up the Japanese who were by all accounts already out of the war, the bombing of Pearl Habour is grossly over sized as a massive attack on American soil. Get real. The odds appear to be stacked against the American's throughout the whole film which is frankly a bag of beetles. My advise to anyone who plans on watching Pearl Habour is to take a bath in gravy...it'd be more fun."
"UltramarineX","6","2","4","26 July 2004"," I saw it once...and will probably never see it again
","**Warning: Spoilers**<br/><br/>When I saw the first trailer for Pearl Harbor back in late 2000, I thought that it looked damn cool, and it would be one of the movies that I planned to see in the summer of 2001.  But, for some reason (I forget exactly why), I never saw it when it was out in theatres.  I also never bothered to rent it when it came out on Video/DVD.  I guess this is due in part to many of my friends saying it was a bad movie, although a few did say they liked it.  I swore that one of these days I would see Pearl Harbor, and decide for myself whether it deserved all of its negative/positive reviews.  Now, three years after it was released I caught it on cable TV while flipping through the channels.  And what did I think of it?  Pearl Harbor sacrifices strong character development for special effects, and becomes a movie that is at best average.<br/><br/>Let me start off by talking about the high points of the movie, the battle scenes.  The computer animated fighter planes were well done, and seeing waves of Japanese Zero fighters flying over Pearl Harbor was just plain cool.  The attack on Pearl Harbor, as depicted by the movie, is chock full of explosions, guns ablazing, and well-choreographed dogfights.  It's the only sequence in the movie that held my attention for any length of time, but I would expect no less from a director like Michael Bay.  His resume of movies makes him well suited to vividly rendering tremendous scenes of carnage.  Yet, at the same time as I thought how cool the special effects were, I realized that this was a weakness too.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in this movie, specifically the Pearl Harbor attack, are not something that should make us say ""Yo! That's so cool how the Arizona blew up!""  These battle scenes should make us focus on how horrible the attack was, and it hindsight, the attack on Pearl Harbor in this movie looked more like a scene from Independence Day, but replaces the alien and jet fighters with World War II era craft.  The American planes unrealistically fly only a few feet above the ground, while strafing the Japanese fighters.  I couldn't help but feel that this was dishonoring the memory of those who died in the attack.<br/><br/>The characters seemed more like a second thought in this movie, taking a back seat to the battle scenes.  The dialogue was often very corny, and the acting itself was pretty stilted on the whole.  I've lost count as to how many times Capt. Rafe McCawley (played by Ben Affleck) tells Nurse Evelyn Johnson (played by Kate Beckinsale) she's so beautiful.  One would think she would get the point after the first five times.  Their romance (and her eventual romance to Josh Harnett's character) looks too forced, as if they are supposed to fall in love simply to advance the plot and nothing else. This movie also, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, attempts to sledgehammer the point that you are supposed to feel sorry for all the soldiers and civilians.  They show tons of scenes of giggling young women, happy-go-lucky men having a beer, and several cheap love scenes.  What I don't think director Michael Bay realizes is that since we know about the tragedy to come, there is no need to take such a heavy-handed and redundant approach.  Bay appears to think otherwise, and has to constantly reinforce the idea that ""you must feel sorry for these people.""<br/><br/>Lastly, there are a couple scenes in Pearl Harbor that I have to talk about. The first is the scene during the attack when Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Harnett's character) radios that ""I think World War II just started.""  When he said that my eyebrows were drawn together, and my hands clenched into a fist.  World War II did not start at Pearl Harbor!  Countries like Britain, France, and Canada were fighting the Nazis, and the Chinese were fighting the Japanese before Pearl Harbor happened.<br/><br/>The second scene would be during the Jimmy Doolittle raid on a Japanese industrial area.  One thing that I (and other critics) noticed was that there were very few Japanese civilians that could be seen in the area.  And once the bombs dropped, we saw buildings being blown up, but no screaming Japanese civilians.  This is probably because the filmmakers did not want to put too much of a damper on the movie, by making the audience realize that Americans bombed civilians too.<br/><br/>I will admit that I did feel a LITTLE sadness when everybody thought Affleck's character died in Europe, and when Harnett's character died at the end.  Other than that, Pearl Harbor the movie is entirely forgettable.  My recommendation is that if you want to see a war movie with great drama (and no cheesy love story), coupled with great action scenes, go see Saving Private Ryan (1998).  If you want to see a more historically accurate depiction of the Pearl Harbor attack that has little cheesy dialogue, and shows what happened on both sides, go see Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970).  Tora! Tora! Tora! has special effects that still hold up even today despite its age, and in my opinion, is a much better film than this 21st century Pearl Harbor movie.<br/><br/>I give Pearl Harbor movie a 6 out of 10."
"yf21bowman","2","2","4","12 June 2004"," Craptacular
","This movie is easily the most long winded, pompous, and self serving piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune to see. Hollywood has got a formula for movies like this, and it's so predictable and hackneyed, it makes you want to get up and scream the rest of the plot to other people watching with you. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was done terribly, and I think it was stupid to focus on a couple of yahoos who did nothing more than shoot down the tiniest fraction of a fraction of a massive attacking air fleet. The Japanese were also done terribly in this film, being portrayed as intensely remorseful and afraid of what they did to America. Only one man of import in Japan thought this: Yamamoto. And guess what: he mostly ignored these thoughts. The rest of Japan was ecstatic, becoming doubtful only after around Midway. The Doolittle raid was blown way out of proportion: It was NOTHING. In fact, it was almost laughable to see these men risk their lives and important military hardware to strike fear in the heart of...you guessed it, no one. In the end, Hollywood needs to stop making movies about Pearl Harbor. It's been done to death, and never done very well, mostly because it's depressing and there's nothing uplifting about it, which is what WWII movies invariably have to be. To solve that, Hollywood throws in a bunch of sappy love interests and ""poor little soldier boy"" stories. What the hell, they may as well have had every man who died in the movie say, ""Two more weeks, and I'm retiring to Montana to be a farmer."" It might have been more effective. Big thumbs down."

","How far should sentiment go? 'Pearl Harbour' is the proof that it can go too far. Michael Bay's epic should have been great, it had all the right elements to propel into majesty of cinema but unfortunately it faltered. It is in short, too damn long! Full to the brim with unnecessary plot development that tried to make you care for the characters. It is a classic example of sentiment getting in the way, like 'Titanic' the film covers a moment in history that is so full of real life heroes who stories would have better been told instead of creating fictional one dimensional people.<br/><br/> From the opening scene, I found my self wishing for access to the fast forward button. It took too long to build up the rivalry between, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and also to introduce the love interest in Kate Beckinsale. There is no believability in their characters and I found this whole section of the plot pointless. <br/><br/>At 3 hours long I found the film 2 hours too long. The first hour leading up to the attack I found pointless, the attack it's self was stunning and well executed. But the part of the film that for me ruined it, were the Doolittle raids on Tokyo. There was no need for this to even be in this film. If it had ended once the presidents had made his address after the sacking of Pearl Harbour then I think personally that this film would be worth seeing."
"jdpow1","Null","2","4","12 April 2004"," Important historical event, worthless movie
","It amazes me that Michael Bay could have so much money to make a movie about one of the most important days in American history and produce such a weak effort. I looked forward to this film, having a personal interest ingrained from stories my father related from his experiences  that day. Fortunately, he survived the attack, too bad this movie survived. If you want to see a convoluted love story, its there, but as a historical piece it is sorely lacking. And for all those who were moved by the love triangle, I have this to say; if my best friend was MIA or killed in wartime, I certainly would not jump into bed with his girl. If you did not experience this emotion you were played.    As to the historical, this movie was a joke. The depiction of the Doolittle raid had the planes, in formation, dropping their bombs on Tokyo when they actually flew individually, not wasting fuel to form up after takeoff. See ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" to see this event more true to life and as a good example of a Hollywood depiction of history.. In the attack scenes Bay had a large gap between the rows of Battleships off Ford Island and the Japanese planes flew  between them. He may have thought this added intimacy but was ridiculously unnecessary. The ships were moored right next to each other, making this scene impossible. He could easily have shot realistic scenes of historically correct individual attacks that would have packed more dramatic punch. He used computer generated effects but dropped the ball on simple shots. And he wanted to make such heroes of Affleck and Hartnett that he insults our intelligence. Japan lost 29 airplanes during the attack and the director has them accounting for 7 or 8 of them, several during a laughable chase between buildings ending in a game of chicken. Maybe the scene where Tom Sizemore shots planes from the tower was used to make the chicken game only the 2nd worst air combat scene in this movie. If this were Star Wars or Independence Day it would be okay, they're fantasies; a skilled director would find a way to make a believable yet dramatic depiction of such an important piece of history. I guess it was easier for Bay to copy bad Sci-Fi, or Spielbergs underwater shootings(right after a unique shot of torpedoes passing under men in the water).      I could go on forever, but I'll refrain. Basically this movie is a sappy love story with as bad a take on real history as any Custers' last stand film ever produced. Michael Bay had an opportunity to make a truly significant film and he gave us trash instead. The good news to filmmakers is that the attack on Pearl Harbor has yet to be made into a great film. Spielberg, are you listening?"

","First off, I would like to say that I'm not going to talk about the truckload of historical errors in Pearl Harbor but instead talk about the movie for what it is.<br/><br/>I've managed to avoid Pearl Harbor ever since it premiered, and it was never a movie I planned on watching, but when it aired on tv the other day my curiosity got the better of me. I have to admit that I had a really hard time hindering myself from switching channels. During some of the more unbareable moments of the movie (and there's lots of them!) I caught myself wishing that everyone who participated in this movie should be banned from acting ever again. Adding to the turkey-esque feeling of the movie is that fact that just about every cliché known to the movie industry is fired off at some point during the movie. Everything from the unlikely black guy hero (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to the amazingly sluggish and painfully sentimental love story to the run-off-the-mill war heroes (i.e. Affleck, Hartnett - which by all accounts manages to look handsome in uniform - but are about as interesting as a complicated tax return). Just about the only thing they got right was the prolonged battle sequence at the end which no doubt looked spectacular, but that alone is not enough by a longshot to save this movie from the abyss of cheesyness. It's simply nothing more than a bad script, bad acting and bad dialogue trying to look good by a budget that could feed a third world nation.<br/><br/>I'm not the first one to say this, but if you want to see a good movie about the Pearl Harbor attack, watch ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and do yourself a favour: try real hard to avoid this garbage."

","Could a movie be any more idiotic than this? Michael Bay uses Hitler's tactics in his movie making: ""Always go for the lowest common denominator"". Of course making movies like that will always bring him huge profits, since most people are deeply stupid, but he will never get the respect of the eclectic ones.<br/><br/>The direction is the usual intolerable Michael Bay direction. 90% closeups, slo-mo in every ""important scene"" and continuous fast cuts. Did I mention the close ups?<br/><br/>The screenplay makes George Lucas seem like Paul Schrader. It is probably Michael Bay's impression that movies are being watched by a bunch of people who are occasionally looking at the screen, while eating pop-corn and talking to their friends at the same time. I am not going to go into details, but this script contains the line: ""I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset, without thinking of you"".<br/><br/>Of course Michael Bay is PC, since this is a big production and he needs the money of the African-American population, so a black cook rises above the oppression and becomes a hero in a most pretentious scene.<br/><br/>The usual anti-everything-not-American theme didn't bother me much, except for the triumphant(?!) ending. As I said, Bay goes for the idiots.<br/><br/>The 'Titanic' ""references"" are great though. They emphasize how shamelessly talentless Michael Bay is.

It's called « Pearl Harbor », and is the story of the guys living in hawaii in December 1941. The story is based on historic facts, but not only, on a love story also. First, the music is absolutely great. It's signed by Hans Zimmer, which is a great composer. The photographs are wonderful, and show amazing landscapes. Secondly, the actors play of course very well, but play a role completely breathtaking. The characters are profond, pure, realist, and set a mindtrouble due of their comportement during the movie. Actually, this is truly my favorite movie. Because of the message, the thematic, the brotherhood and the jealousy between characters for the same woman. Do you know that the story told in the movie is the pure reality ? Actually the Japanese attack the Americans in December 1941 on Honolulu. A lot of controversies on the truth of the story has started recently, due to the fact the Americans may have known the attack of the Japanese on the archipel. So, the movie is very interesting, emotional, historic, and pass some good messages, but it also have the probleme that it long 3 hours non-stop, it's always on the American view that the story is told, and never from the vue of Japanese.

","In Pearl Harbor, the movie is based on real events, but no one likes the story line. Which is understandable but the audience should look at the history as informing and exciting, rather than booing the movie as a whole. There are varieties of historical films such as history as drama, history as anti drama, history without heroes, and postmodern history. History dramas are mainly produced to tell a story, these films are produced to appeal to the audience in a way of the historical setting is intrinsic to the story line and meaning of the work. Like, how Pearl Harbor told a love story to appeal more to a certain audience. Historical films want to make the audience think that they are reality. Meaning, the technology advancement has placed bits and pieces together to represent the reality of what is being presented. Like when the Japanese were attacking the bay. There were many visual effects of bombings and aircrafts and bullets flying everywhere to seem like it was from 1941. This movie to me was a great depiction of history, and the story line was really dramatic but it still was an all around good movie."
"ironhorse_iv","6","0","0","10 December 2013"," It was a Day of Infamy when this movie came out. This made up movie is an insult to those who died on Dec. 7th 1941. Still, it's not the worst movie.
","Pearl Harbor is a pretty awful movie looking back at it, but it was a successful box buster movie. It was kinda insulting to the veterans and those who live around the tragedy event. Directed by Michael Bay, and written by Randall Wallace. It feature a story straight out of badly written soap opera romantic novel. In my opinion, it's seem like a badly written remake or reimagining of 1953's From Here to Eternity. I would love for the film to focus more on the realistic story of those soldiers who died trying to protect our country that day, than those make believe characters with an unrealistic over the top love story that has nothing to do with the real events. I know Michael Bay wanted to graphically portray the horrors of war and was not interested in primarily marketing of mixing tragedy with romance aimed for the young adult PG-13 audience, but with the success of 1997's Titanic. Michael Bay pretty much sold out, and went with the studio ideas. Still, there is a Rated R version DVD out there, if you want to see that. The story goes like this, two fighter pilots, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are both under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). Rafe happens to have an Army Nurse girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who he loved, but based on what we see on screen, seem to rather spent time away from her and mistreat her. Rafe go off to fight in RAF outfit for American pilots to fight during the Battle of Britain and presumed killed in action. Meanwhile, Danny, Evelyn and the rest of their fellow pilots and nurses are transferred to Pearl Harbor, as Danny and Evelyn move on. Both fall in love with each other, until Rafe return making it a love triangle. The love triangle is god awful trite and how they solved the rush love story wasn't the greatest ending at all. It had cop out end to the film. It wasn't until ¾ in the film, that 'Pearl Harbor' the movie really became about the Pearl Harbor attacks by the Japanese Empire. I do have to say, the Pearl Harbor attack scenes were very well done, action pack while giving the emotional trauma of that day. Still, there were some historic inaccuracy and major factual misrepresentation of the facts in such things like the Doolittle Raids and how Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr) should be portrayed. Like many historical dramas, Pearl Harbor provoked debate about the artistic license taken by its producers and director. The biggest is the use of fictional replacements for real people. One of the biggest faults is replacing the real pilots, George Welch and Kenneth M. Taylor with the two leads played by Affleck and Hartnett who took to the skies during the Japanese attack and, together, claimed six Japanese aircraft. The pilots could be more realistic in tone, if the film didn't take great liberties on making them look a silly caricature of what romantic movies think military pilots should look like. Not only do they endanger their airplanes, and themselves playing a game of chicken, but they are allow to take citizen on war planes to see sunsets over the harbor and afterwards have sex in the parachute hangar. Plus, they are dyslexic and one is squinty all the time. Excuse me, if I did that. I would be in jail and no way, a pilot! I do have to say, the portrayal of the Japanese were pretty well done. I see no faults in that. All the supporting actors were very good. Mako Iwamatsu and Dan Aykroyd were interesting. I have to say, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the closest thing to FDR coming back alive. Another thing good about the movie was the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, and the song by Faith Hill, 'There You'll be"". In my opinion, there is no way to have a throwback World War II movie like the pre-Saving Private Ryan old days. Yes, the movie is full of war movie clichés, some good, some stale. America patriotism was written all over the film, like we single-handed won the war by ourselves. I didn't mind it, yes it somewhat true. I don't have that much of a quarrel with the idea of framing a standard romance between fictional characters with true historical events like other WWII drama like 1996's English Patient or From Here to Eternity is a fine film set on Oahu during the months leading up to Dec. 7, 1941. Still, it's not a good idea. Overall: It wasn't the worst war movie ever. There are better movies set during the Pearl Harbor attack that better serve the public. Go watch a few documentaries, if not watch 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora! As it turns out, this disaster flick is both bomb and was the da bomb in the box office."

","Pearl Harbor is a tough one for me. On one hand I fall victim to the scenery, the set pieces, the historical relevance and time setting, and Kate Beckinsale - but mostly the first three. Like many history buffs, I love a good WWII set film, and the 1941 environment in beautiful Hawaii is so visually pleasing, it can easily be the focus of your attention as a movie goer.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting, the shotty love story (and although I'm no feminist nor a chauvinist, the story doesn't portray Kate Beckinsale's character in a very positive light as a female), the clichés and the historical inaccuracy and utter absurdity i.e. Dan Aykroyd sitting in some intelligence room just ""not buying"" what he's reading on the decoding machines. At many times it's difficult to sit thru, similar to the complete cheese content of Top Gun.<br/><br/>As far as the actual action shots go (and I use the term action not in reference to the action film genre, but just scenes in which battle action takes place) they are not nearly as poorly done as other films. There is a good amount of live action material so the viewer is not overwhelmed, or should I say underwhelmed, by CGI nonsense. The P-40 or Spitfire scenes are fun and interesting to watch, although not all that accurate, but they still are visually pleasing. Much more true to life than the likes of, say, Red Tails.<br/><br/>In the end, I think the only reason Pearl Harbor squeaks by with a 6 is the setting, the beautiful visuals of the island of Hawaii or the 40's set pieces, and the massive historical relevance of the Pearl Harbor incident.<br/><br/>All of those positives must be actively searched for while wading thru piles of canine excrement in the form of sub-par acting and God-awful clichés (Josh Hartnet's ""I think WWII just started"" is repeatedly mentioned and rightfully so) along with many historical and factual inaccuracies, all of which are easily pointed out by anyone that knows much of anything about history, aviation technology etc.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 solely for the setting and historical story behind all the terribly ""Hollywood stuff""."

","Of the 3+ hours of Pearl Harbor a full 1+ hour is spent not on the attack on Pearl Harbor but on the Doolittle Raid, America's ineffective but highly symbolic revenge raid on Japanese cities. It should be a separate movie, and was obviously added by the studio to keep American audiences from feeling depressed at the end of the Japanese victory on Hawaii. Maybe a good business decision, but it was a poor dramatic decision.<br/><br/>The 1944 movie 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, with Spencer Tracy as Doolittle, already covered this story, although thankfully without trying to mix it with a silly love triangle. In several ways the old movie outdid the new one, mostly because it didn't use some of the terrible techniques that are spoiling so many movies for me these days. The main thing it avoided is the constant use of quick cuts, one camera shot replacing another after only a few seconds, supposedly to increase the sense of excitement. Unfortunately, it detracts from much of the pleasure of watching this kind of movie, the kind of thing I always enjoy, such as prolonged views of the aircraft and the carriers, the views from the air, a chance to look around and see some of the background details that may be completely miscellaneous but which add to the sense of reality, even if they're not exactly what the director wants us to focus on. The audience can also see that the real purpose of a lot of quick cuts is sometimes to hide things from us, to avoid showing a plane really gunning its engine for a while, trying harder and harder to get up to full power, then taxiing and taking off a short runway, for example, or a real view of Tokyo from the air. Pearl Harbor certainly does offer a lot through the use of computer graphics, but even then it does so only in fits and starts, in scenes that flash by too quickly to enjoy. In 30 Seconds Over Tokyo we fly with the crews for several minutes over the wave-tops toward Japan, the engines roaring in our ears, while in Pearl Harbor the trip is done in a couple of quick cuts. <br/><br/>Remember the Bruce Lee movies when martial arts were actually performed in front of the camera and you could see exactly what was happening? Today it's all done through quick cuts and film editing, and you know you're being cheated as you see one snippet of a kick, then another snippet of a back flip, both put together in such a way as to suggest an amazing, continuous action--but it's completely faked.<br/><br/>Please, Hollywood, stop with all the quick cuts.

","I believe this did honour the dead. I understand war veterans were invited for special screenings and were moved by it. Most people who saw this were not personally affected by the tragedy so have little care for the dead unless it is rammed home to them. It's all very well for posters here to fake sympathy (this is programmed into us) but you can't be genuinely sympathetic if you didn't know them personally. Thousands of people die every day. I would also argue it isn't healthy to be too personally affected just because they were working to defend the beloved country. At least here the film brings it home to the viewer who wouldn't have cared otherwise, what actually happened. The gripping attack sequence was a major chunk of the film.<br/><br/>I personally like this style of movie directing. I consider it similar to Paul Verhoeven's work. It doesn't need intellectualising on any great level but is great to watch. There is no need to remind the viewer it is a movie as it is obvious.<br/><br/>If this was made into a more serious work, then the performances would have to change. I understand people's objections, and am surprised the average score is quite high given their obvious concerns but they should remember that this is a movie made for entertainment and not as a historical dramatisation.<br/><br/>I went to see this with a gf who was sceptical about watching it but nothing else really appealed.

"Alex-372","Null","0","0","1 March 2003"," Done before, but has redeeming points
","Pearl Harbor isn't really that bad a movie. Yes, it is far too referential about the Hollywood and WWII clichés. Yes, the most important attack upon the US during WWII is wrapped around a love story and the lifes of two farmboys is a backstory that goes on far too long and doesn't really get to the hart of Pearl Harbor - it would have been better if they'd focused on the political developments and intelligence failures that preceded it. Yes, this movie was written by the same guy (Randall Wallace) who gave us Braveheart and We Were Soldiers (notice how similar wifes/love-interests Madeleine Stowe and Kate Beckinsale look). And yes, there is some painful dialogue (especially Nicholas Farrell as the RAF officer - he looked like he was drowning his distaste for the lines he had to say in a pint of beer).<br/><br/>However, when all is said and done, you're left with a pretty well done yarn, nothing great, three attractive leads. Although with a budget like this, I guess much of the disappointment comes from the producers not paying more attention to the storyline and the script. One problem is that because so many movies have been made about world war 2 over the last half century, it is difficult to avoid the clichés (the conflicted love story, the dead soldier who really isn't, even the stammering guy to whom it falls to announce the Japanese attack, although that _is_ pretty funny - you've seen it all ten times before).<br/><br/>The battle scenes however are very good. But, as this movie is intended to lift spirits, it can't be just about the kicking the US Navy received during Pearl Harbor (like for instance A Bridge Too Far is just about Market Garden). So, the Doolittle Raid is tacked on, taking up the last half hour, allowing Alec Baldwin to reprise his role from Glengarry Glen Ross.<br/><br/>What is also good about this movie is that it shows at least two Japanese Americans working for the US military and also includes the story of Dorie Miller, a Black sailor who without specific training manned his ship's machine gun and shot down 6 Japanese bomber planes (3 of which were officially acknowledged), at a time when the Navy tried to keep Black troops out of active service."

","What endears this film to me is the human aspect of it. Yeah, sure the special effects are great and everything, there's no denying that. SPOILERS You see people being bombed in the movie, you see suffering, you see destruction, you see death, you see pain. You see Danny and Rafe, caring for each other, and how gutted Danny was over the supposed death of Rafe. But when a girl comes between them and Rafe returned from the dead, their friendship came under the ultimate test. Both friends were torn between the other and the girl. During the Japanese attacks, you see how Rafe still worry about the safety of Danny, even though the latter had broken his heart. Rafe took the nobler position however, by acting like a big brother to Danny, relenting over the girl. He even persuaded Danny not to go on the Dolittle mission, trying to protect Danny as he always had when they were kids.<br/><br/>Come the Dolittle bombing, their planes crashed in China. Danny's plane crashed later, and we see Rafe running towards him without a care for his own safety, testament to the bond of brotherly love between the two. When Rafe tried to release Danny from the capture by shooting the Japanese, he ran out of bullets. It was Danny's turn to manifest his love to his buddy, by sacrificing himself - he stood between Rafe and the bullets meant for  him. In the last moments of his life, we see Danny agonizing in pain as Rafe, by this time in tears, tries to relieve him. We see the brotherly love between two friends that does not come often even between real brothers. Truly a touching movie about a friendship with a tragic end, though one I would dream to have."

","REVIEW: Pearl Harbor MOVIE GRADE: *1/2 out of **** BAD MOVIE GRADE: ***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is the most unintelligent action movie I've seen since Armageddon. It is so awful that it gets hilarious at times. Especially when a girl tells a boy, ""I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I'll never be able to look at another sunset without thinking of you"". The movie attempts to do to Pearl Harbor what James Cameron did for Titanic. Titanic seems like Ingmar Bergman compared to this. There are two things I hate most about this junk. First, the movie has a good story (Dorie Miller) in its reach. Just when it's getting interesting, they cut away to a boring love story, probably because they're afraid to put an African American story into full focus in a summer blockbuster. The other thing that I'm most offended about is toning down the carnage to a PG-13. I HATE watered down war movies! That's partly why U-571 was so awful. By toning it down, they are just giving a giant middle finger to all WWII vets everywhere."

","A fundamental question I pose to you...Does every movie have to have a love story attatched to it? I'm a huge movie fan and at times enjoy a good love story, But some movies don't need them. Pearl Harbor is one of those movies. I was in New York City when i saw this movie and while I thought that the action sequences were great, especially the air combat scenes, I found myself going to the restroom or snack bar during the incredibly sappy parts of this film.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin plays a great Admiral Doolittle, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are good in their respective roles and have great interplay.<br/><br/>This film had the distinct opportunity to tell the story of an extremely historic event in the annals of U.S. History, But instead it winds up trying to tell three stories...The event...The two best friends Affleck and Hartnett...And the romance. I have seen many documentaries on Pearl Harbor with interviews of actual survivors and I can't recall one of them that had a love story attatched to them. The people who write, produce & direct these big budget flicks witout fail follow the same formula, and in that formula no matter what the plot of the movie is there is always a love interest.<br/><br/>This could have been a really good movie with much more information about the real event and much more badly needed action footage, but alas it fails because it is trying to please too many people. You cant'please everyone, it's an impossible task. The men that have gone and seen this movie all told me it had too much love story attatched to it. And the women i have spoken to were kind of indifferent to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Make a movie that appeals to the core audience you are shooting for...If it's an action movie then market it as such and leave out the love story because i can tell you we don't need it. If it's a love story you are making then market it as such and the people who are interested in that subject will go and see it. Lets face it even though action movies do not and will not win any oscars they still pay the bills at these studios..That 200 million dollars from an action movie will help finance indies and love stories which in turn will win academy awards.<br/><br/>STOP...STOP following the same old formula...break with the norm...believe me the public will embrace it.<br/><br/>As for this movie, love interest aside it's pretty good. action is good, cinematography is good, acting is good and the scenery is great. Overall i would give it a B-<br/><br/>Don't make the mistake and go into this movie thinking it will be all action or you will be sorely dissappointed."

","All right I know that Pearl Harbor since its release date has been getting nothing but horrible reviews from just about every critic who'd seen it. I personally thought it was an excellent movie. The authenticity of every thing about the film was almost down to a science. Aside from Ben Affleck's 90's style haircut everything from clothing to wall posters were all well placed and everything.<br/><br/>Now we come to the acting. Every one in the film did a great job portraying their charecters and making them seem real. The only real problem I noticed in the acting was Ben Affleck's southern accent. I've got nothing against Ben Affleck, in fact I think he's a very good actor it's just that he'd have done a much better job with his charecter if he'd just not used an accent.<br/><br/>And last but not least, the bombing sequence. This was absolutely the best aspect of the film. The second the first bomb falls, you'll be on the edge of your seat.

This movie bombed even without a Japanese zero in the sky.  The movie is way over-hyped and bogus.  It consists of a fictitious love story, which just happens to take place during a real historical event (Pearl Harbor).  When I saw ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the age of the people in the theater ranged from teenagers up to senior citizens.  Some of the senior citizens were WW2 veterans, and proudly wearing their VFW hats.  However, the age of the people in the theater for ""Pearl Harbor"" was more the teenage to college age crowd. Most of the young ladies in the theater only wanted to see the movie because of prince Ben (VOTE  GOREOOPS, I FORGOT TO VOTE MYSELF) Afflect, and didn't really seem to care about the actual historical event.   Has-been Alec (I'M LEAVING FOR CANADA.NOT..LEAVING FOR CANADA.NOT) Baldwin was another winner in this over-hyped flick.  Of course, Tom Hanks (a real actor) has raised public awareness and $ for WW2 veterans as a result of his film. However, Alec Baldwin is still unpacking, and Ben Afflect is sitting in the drunk tank.  If you want historical knowledge of the real attack on Pearl Harbor, then read a history book or watch the 1970 film ""Tora..Tora..Tora."" If you only want to watch a hollywoodish romance flick, then ""Pearl Harbor"" is for you.  I give this trash two thumbs down!"

"Big S-2","Null","0","0","3 September 2001"," A real mixed bag of a movie
","This film is definitely a real mixed bag of the good, the bad and the downright nauseating. Certainly it is very well made with that `big budget' look, and the actual aerial attack sequences are superbly and realistically done. However, I found the sometimes (obviously deliberate) shaky camera work in the action scenes to be very distracting and headache-inducing. This was clearly intended to give the viewer a feeling of the chaos and confusion that must ensue when you're in an aerial dogfight or at the business end of an air raid, but I simply found it extremely annoying, because all it did was make it difficult to see what was actually going on. Some of the other reviewers on this page have complained about the historical inaccuracies, and while this may be valid criticism up to a point, come on people! This is Hollywood!!! If you want to see a documentary about Pearl Harbour, watch the History Channel or buy `The World At War'!! There is always going to be some degree of `artistic licence' in these big-budget blockbuster movies because they're trying to offer something for as wide an audience as possible in order to speedily recoup at the box office the massive cost of making the thing in the first place.<br/><br/>I did however find it a little long-winded in places, occasionally to the point of tedium. There was little real chemistry between Kate Beckinsale and either of the two male leads. Ben Affleck plays (as usual) Ben Affleck, and the other guy looked like he'd just stepped out of some `boy band' (very anachronistic). In fact I felt that all three leads were poorly cast. My favourite character had to be Earl, played by Tom Sizemore (a greatly underrated performer in my view, who is convincing in any role that he tackles). Alec Baldwin does a pretty good job as Col. Doolittle, despite being forced by the scriptwriters to deliver more than his fair share of sickeningy `patriotic' lines. And I can only agree with the other hack who, like me, was reaching for the puke bucket during some of the supposedly `romantic' moments because of positively vomit-inducing lines like `I think it's my heart that hurts' and `If I had just one night left on earth, I'd want to spend it with you' (who gets paid to write this crap for heaven's sake???!!!). Even my wife, who's normally into the romantic stuff, was cringing in her seat on hearing such dreadful dialogue. I have to disagree with the reviewer who criticises the film-makers for `tokenism' with regard to Cuba Gooding Jr's character. I seem to remember reading somewhere that a black sailor did indeed perform similar heroics during the actual attack, which would make this episode at least partly historically accurate. I also think the other reviewers who criticise the movie-makers for reducing the real-life victims to (and I quote) `worthless bits of digital code' and `flinging them around the screen to die with little respect' are being a bit silly. What were they supposed to do? To make the viewer `care about' each and every one of the 3000-plus victims of the Pearl Harbor attack within the constraints of a 3 hour movie would obviously be impossible, and not to show any anonymous extras being shot / blown up / burned or bodies flying through the air would just be plain ludicrous in the context of such a movie. That's just criticism for the sake of criticism. To summarise, I'd say that this film is nowhere near being in the class of `Saving Private Ryan' and the 3 leads are very wishy-washy to say the least. But despite its obvious flaws, if you haven't yet seen it it's worth checking out to decide for yourself."

","I just saw the movie Pearl Harbor. From the trailers it looked like an interesting war film with a romantic subplot. Neither is it a good war film nor is it a very interesting romance. Even the special effects are somewhat passe by today's standards. The film will probably appeal more to women than men due the presence of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. Kate Beckinsale's performance is adequate particularly during the hospital scene following the attack. She has, however, done much, much better. Some have wishfully said that the film may be a cross between Titanic and Saving Private Ryan. It is a far cry from both. Micheal Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer would be advised to stick with action/adventure films like The Rock and Armageddon. I rated it 6 out of 10."

The way the movie is now, I felt it should have ended after Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war.  There just wasn't enough about the mood of the country or the need for a moral victory in the beginning of the movie that made the last part of the film necessary.

Tora! for a more even-handed and 'historical' account of that fateful day) but what is presented here is weak. As usual, Bay and Bruckheimer are completely out of their element when it comes to HUMAN interaction, especially between the opposite sexes!

"Al_James","5","0","0","24 August 2001"," A disappointment on every scale.
","'Pearl Harbor' is a HUGE let down. In almost every magazine and newspaper that I have seen this film advertised, it has been categorised as a 'War Film With Romance'. I'm sorry, but this film is NOT about War, and to say that it is, makes a mockery of the likes of Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and, more recently Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>First of all, I find it difficult to become engrossed in films that use REAL Historic events as a backdrop for a little cheesy romance. Titanic used the amazing story of the ship itself, and took every chance they could to feed on the audiences emotions. But people cried at the wrong time!! Like when Jack died, instead of when the rescue ship was wading through the corpses of young and old. Some people would argue that Saving Private Ryan did the same. Used the 'one man is worth a million' policy to underline how loyal the Americans can be. But at least Saving Private Ryan looked real. At least there was swearing, and smoking and blood and a distinct lack of eyeliner and concealer, which is more than I can say for Pearl Harbor!<br/><br/>If they're going to make a movie about War, and add a little tacky romance to it, then they at least need to make the movie LOOK real. It was the Second World War okay? Yet nobody smoked (a travesty and historical flaw in itself), the worst curse was 'Hell' or 'Dang', and even in the bombing sequence, there was no blood or chaos. Something that Saving Private Ryan and even Platoon were credited for. Add to that the fact that everyone looked like they'd just shot a cover story for 'The Face' magazine, (apart from Ewen Bremner, who puts in the only good performance of the whole movie) and you have a recipe for unrealistic disaster.<br/><br/>Even as a straight romance movie this flounders. Danny (Josh Hartnett, looking more and more like leading man material with every movie) and Rafe (Affleck, attempting to be A.J. from Armageddon, only in the 1940s) have been buddies since they were children. They've been through thick and thin, they even join the Airforce together. One day Affleck decides that he will join a renowned squadron, based in Britain (depicted as War torn and stiff as a broom handle) and leave his best friend and.....you guessed it, new love behind.<br/><br/>Rafe leaves because it's his 'duty'!! And that's where the fun starts, because his best buddy Danny decides to move in on the woman that Rafe loves. A pretty nurse called Evelyn (played as well as possible with the script in question by Kate Beckinsale).<br/><br/>Luckily for Danny however, he and Evelyn get a message telling them that Rafe has died in heroic and mysterious circumstances. So, instead of mourning him and showing honest remorse for their actions. They have a little drink, a bit of a cry and get on with their lives. AS IF!!!<br/><br/>
The rest is just as stupid **SPOILER APPROACHING** Affleck returns to find that Danny and Evelyn have been getting up to some rude little duties (including a sex in a parachute scene that is a tragic mixture of the Top Gun and the Titanic love scene). As you can imagine, Rafe is none too pleased, but after a day or so, they have a beer and all is forgiven!! And anyway, Rafe gets his own back, because Danny dies and Rafe and Evelyn spend their lives happily ever after.....<br/><br/>This is of course after Pearl Harbor gets bombed. And that is the only part of the movie that deserves any kind of rating. The bombing sequence is exactly as I imagined it. Rapid editing, brilliantly realised CGI planes, boats and sailors. Shattering sound and a mass of colour on screen. It is, without doubt a piece of art all on it's own. It's just a shame however, that there's not much 'reality' in the actual action. I mean there's a few cries of anguish, but it lacks brutality (for the sake of a 12 rating) and for some reason has Cuba Gooding Jr. (tragically forced to play the token Affro-American)running around trying to save everyone, without getting bombed himself.<br/><br/>After the bombing sequence, we get all the American patriotism stuff, and the revenge attack on Japan.**SPOILER** And as I said earlier, Danny dies, leaving Rafe and Evelyn to bring up a family of their own somewhere in the deep South!!<br/><br/>I guess I have the same problem with the romance as I did with Titanic, and that is that it distracts you from the REAL issues. And that is that lots of real people died needlessly in the War, so why would I rather focus on three badly scripted characters in an almost incestuous love triangle?<br/><br/>And I guess I have the same problem with the action as I did with U-571. From a distance it all looks splendid. Rattling gunfire, big yellowy orange explosions. Loud noise and some very, very tasty CGI. But once you really get in there it lacks realism and brutality. I'm not twisted, I' just like to actually become absorbed in how horrible that must have been. And with everyone shouting things as tame as 'Damnit' or 'Sonofabitch', I can't really sympathise.<br/><br/>In short then, Pearl Harbor is terrible. That is unless you like badly scripted romance films that use war as a backdrop!! If you're an avid cinema goer, then watch it. If not, rent something good. Like Hamburger Hill or The Thin Red Line.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is good for one thing, and one thing only. And that is to show that CGI is developing at an astonishing rate, but even THAT bombing sequence isn't worth waiting an hour and forty minutes for. Not so much a 'popcorn munching must', as a 'a popcorn regurgitating rabble'."

With the flights-of-fancy love affairs of the leading lady who settles for the flight officer who happens to survive the 'Top Secret' mission? With the inspiring pearls of wisdom (no pun intended) from Alec Baldwin's air force general character who profoundly proclaims that ""there is no heart braver than that of a volunteer""? With the over-simplified sequence of events leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the stereotypical and lame portrayal of the Japanese who later fear that they ""have awaken a sleeping giant""?<br/><br/>Perhaps it was the fact that I do not feel a deep connection to American patriotism, or the fact that I watched the Pearl Harbor in another country, that I felt the need to make gagging noises during many scenes. Or maybe it was that I thought the movie, for lack of a better term, SUCKED.<br/><br/>There is no point in detailing the flaws, shortcomings, and overall bad aspects of Pearl Harbor, besides the fact that it would be excruciatingly long to read. In my opinion, Hollywood should leave the movie-making of historical events to intelligent persons concerned with the actual event, and just stick to making contrived love stories involving Ben Affleck and the current leading female du jour."

","It seems has if the Bay and Bruck are just trying to make money, without even trying to add any sense of realism or credibility to the film.<br/><br/>How can anyone see this film has being realistic. If you want realism, see Saving Private Ryan or Platoon, not Pearl Harbor. Bay took a fabulous premise and totally diminished all respect that should have been given to the film. A war film SHOULD NOT be fun to watch, it should terrify you, it should make you never want to be mean to another person in your life. Pearl Harbor makes it look like Top Gun. Bay is just not a mature enough film-maker to tackle this subject. <br/><br/>I mean its different when the subject is a big asteroid or a hostage action film, but not when its PEARL HARBOR!!! A film of this nature needs to be handled with respect and dignity. These are none of the qualities of Michael Bay. <br/><br/>I'll admit that I did nearly cry at the trailer, because it depicted the film has being like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. It portrayed the film has being a human drama and being about the cruelty of what men do to one-another.<br/><br/>Oh, how could I forget the love story that takes up half the film. At the beginning and at the end, I cared nothing about the characters, with the exception of FDR and Akroyd's character (The only two good performances in the film). I really like Ben Affleck, Ive enjoyed his work in the New Jersey Trilogy and Bounce, but he just didnt do anything for me here, perhaps because it was the director and scripts fault.<br/><br/>Can you imagine how great this film would have been if Speilberg or Cameron had directed it. It could have been the best film of the year, but instead we get Bay.

","I first hesitated very much to go and see this film, because of all the bad reviews I had read about it. The movie was described as stupid, boring and too long. But the action sequences were said to be great, so I decided at last to go and see it. Boy, am I glad I did! I think it is a great movie, not only for the spectacular action, but for the movie as a whole. The story is much like that of Titanic, a love story for about the first hour and a disaster for the next two hours. So-called ""experts"" have said that the love story of Pearl Harbor had nothing to do with the actual Japanese attack and that the love story was therefore obsolete. But what had the love story between Rose and Jack in Titanic had to do with the sinking of the ship? And what did the love story between Scarlet O'Hara and Rhett Butler had to do with the American Civil War in Gone With The Wind? The Japanese in this movie are not depicted as cruel savages, who have great pleasure in killing Americans, but as people who think what they do is best for their country, and didn't want to go into war in the first place.<br/><br/>This movie has comical moments, spectacular moments, impressive moments and touching moments, in other words, this movie has it all.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, then do not listen to whining movie critics, but run to your local cinema or videostore and rent it, because this is a must-see movie."

","This year, when the summer movies rolled around in May, there was one movie that I was dying to see: Pearl Harbor.  I have enjoyed the work of Ben Affleck and thought that this movie would be the perfect balance of action and romance.  However, I left the theater massively disappointed.  I appreciate the attempt that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made to create a cross-gender classic for the ages, but the result fell flat.  The best thing about the movie was the bombing sequence in the middle.  This section captured my attention fully with its raw power and emotional action.  It was one of the best action sequences in recent history.  The portion of the movie leading up to the bombing was a huge bore.  Could the romance between Rafe and Evelyn be more pathetic and moronic?  I found myself rolling my eyes when Rafe popped himself in the nose with a champagne cork rather than smiling in pleasure.  Because of this movie, I am not as big of a fan as Affleck.  He is good in supporting roles, but he does not have the stature to lead a blockbuster.  The position of his frown seems to be the range of his emotional acting ability.  And what was with the way that he kept wearing his hat cocked to the side?  Did he see it on a WWII documentary and thought that it looked cool?  I was hugely annoyed by the character of Evelyn, whose emotional strife was poorly played by Kate Beckinsdale.  It seemed like she was constantly lying to both of her suitors and trying to play helpless.  The only shining performance was of Josh Hartnett, and even his luscious bangs cannot save this movie.  Nearing the end of the movie, I was wishing that both Rafe and Danny would crash and burn and that Evelyn wouldn't be able to have either of them."

","I know, if all I'm going to do is bash, I should stop writing reviews for this movie. Well, here's one last review for this movie-may the film lose the praise.<br/><br/>My parents are amatuer historians. I think they liked this movie due to it being in WW2. That is no reason to like a movie-that is like a cult saying Manos was the best film just because it had a cult. But Manos is a dumb film, the 4th worst film of all time (well, on my opinion)-and the same goes for this. (But this is better than Manos. Wait-no it isn't.)<br/><br/>Like everyone who hates this is saying, bad dialog (""I'll never ask for anything again?"" You'll have to ask for a better line), stupid humor (while talking about girlfriends, one guy says that he has a girlfriend-that's all he says), and disagreement with history (a. they say ""The Great Dictator was dumb, but it is classic; b. one character knows that it is world war 2-while Japs are STILL BOMBING!) make this worse than most films I've seen. This makes me think more and more that Hollywood has everything in for no reason.<br/><br/>I've got to be going. I'm working on a script involving a conspiracy with Nazis underneath everything. It is going to be called ""Anardili"" and will rely solely on hype to succeed. (If this sounds familiar, remember that I'm working off of this.)"

","Well, I managed to see the film eventually. As a 'Brit' I was truly expecting to loathe the movie. It was slated by the critics (especially by those who reside over my side of the ocean). I saw it twice within ten days.......hmmm......<br/><br/>I found the movie to be an emotional journey. I have to admit that I managed to miss the first 15 minutes of the movie on both viewings. I was touched by the waste of life, the naievety of the people in charge of the Hawaiain islands and by the historical consequences of the United States worst hour.<br/><br/>I went to the first viewing with my wife's stepfather; he flew B25's in Burma during WWII. He was stunned by the flying sequences and he was teary eyed by the conclusion. His opinion was that the flying sequences were stunning. I agree - they were stomach churning.....<br/><br/>I then saw the movie with my wife - she was also moved to tears. The tragic waste of life on the US battleships needed explanation. I suggested that Pearl Harbor signalled the end of the battleship as a real force. The Aircraft Carrier continues to be the strong arm of the navy - it was regrettable that the Japanese recognised it's strength first.<br/><br/>So, what were the movie's strong points?<br/><br/>Firstly, despite the weak storyline, it is a stunning piece of history which needs to be seen, digested and understood by all. Secondly there are some amazing cinematographic moments in this film. The images of the Japanese aircraft flying over the non-combatants at the beginning of the attack were poignant and grotesquely beautiful.<br/><br/>I was totally ignorant about the Doolittle raids before seeing this movie. It squared a circle in my mind. Tragically, the British Bomber Command have yet to receive a campaign medal for their efforts against mainland Germany in WWII. The Doolittle  raids were a testimony to man's ingenuity in adversity.<br/><br/>My advice? Forget the love triangle and watch with awe as the reasons for US foreign policy in the second half of the 20th century unravels before your eyes...."

The first hour and a half were INSANELY BORING.  EVERYONE has to answer every question with a monologue. The characters are uninteresting, boring and I can't even name five people from the lot.  The love triangle was contrived and allowed everyone in the movie to become part of a war cliche.  Everything was tedious about the introduction.  It was like staring at a wall for fourty-five minutes with romatic music in the background.  Even after the attack, it was so tedious because SO LITTLE action happened.

"OldRose","9","0","0","11 August 2001"," Dramatic effects, almost deja-vu, but dialogue suffers...
","The 2001 version of ""Pearl Harbor"" has much in common with another massive-budget film of recent years, ""Titanic"". Not that both involve ships, but both involve superior performances by supporting players while the headline stars fall far below their potential... In this film the recreation of the event itself is nothing short of phenomenal, to the point of momentary lapses and SHOCK... The visual effects defy imagination and, along with cinematography, possibly art direction, sound, and (certainly) the theme song, there are elements here I expect displayed at the next instalment of the Golden Globes, Oscars, BAFTAs, and others.  Among the supporting crew, Academy Award Winner John Voight, Ewen Bremner, Mako, Alec Baldwin, and -- let us not forget, Cuba Gooding Jr., inspire, leading us to laughs, tears, stone cold somber moments, and everything in between. The first, John Voight, was so believable that he could garner an award nomination himself.  <br/><br/>The hoped-for romantic 'enhancement' was not, in and of itself, misplaced, as many media reviews have stated. Rather, it was poorly done and here I would recommend a complete script chapter re-write. In other words, these things DID happen (during that era) and it could have been handled. It wasn't, and the film suffers for it. Our leading three characters are basically 'good' throughout (but not great), apart from various moments during said element. All three, at one point or another, stumble miserably through it, with Josh Hartnett doing the best job at 'damage control'. Ben Affleck, for his part, LOOKS just like someone from the era -- stunningly so -- and thus a major success. He manages the exchanges reasonably well, too, to include non-verbals, but for said element. (Hartnett is a little less convincing, but the difference is marginal.) Both men, at this point, however, lose the edge ENTIRELY on sounding like the 1940s, and the effects on the viewer are nothing short of a jarring back to the present = NOT GOOD. With better editing, Kate Beckinsale could have 'saved the day', so-to-speak, on the romance as this was a chance for her to 'manage' the unplanned balancing act (witness how well it was handled in ""Castaway"", for example), but alas... No.  <br/><br/>I wish to emphasise that said element also had the potential to add to this film and unfortunately takes away instead, from an otherwise nearly-perfect production. What were the writers/ editors thinking...???<br/><br/>A few chewy remarks about money, vis-a-vis reasoning for making decisions with the use of aircraft and naval fleets are more indicative of yesterday's newspaper, and mean that even the directorial staff has forgotten the times. I recommend a dose of old WW2 movies to refresh their memories. This 'snafu' alone, however, would have had no more impact than a slight, indiscernable mistake made by a figure skater at the Olympics, e.g. the judges might have marked a 5.8 rather than 5.9. But along with the jarring effect of the failed element just cited, well...<br/><br/>My rating, however, rests with the sound, visual effects, music, song, cinematography and supporting cast, i.e. all of which and whom TAKE YOU THERE to the event itself and that is what I was looking for. This was also true with ""Titanic"" which could not have been carried without veteran Gloria Stuart retelling 'her' story along with all of James Cameron's creations... For these criteria alone, rating = 5 stars (of 5; but with 1.5 point markdown if I include everything else)."

Although the film hasn't gotten the best reviews, I personally think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my young 13 years. The love story aspect really touched me, and it seemed to me to be the perfect fit to the actual attack storyline.  I didn't find the film to be dragged out or boring because of its 3 hour time span.  I found it to be quite enjoyable, even though the movie didn't end until midnight and I had been up since 7 that morning.  I thought, going in, there was a chance I would fall asleep, and it was totally the opposite.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  It was an amazing movie, and the fact that my favourite actor, Josh Hartnett, was in it made it even better for me.

","I recently read in the San Francisco Guardian newspaper, that ""Pearl Harbor""'s producers, wanted to remake ""Titanic"" by way of ""Saving Private Ryan"", and in it's reference to one of the many harsh reviews this movie received, it called the film ""oscar-baiting"" before it proceeded to destroy the cast.        Now, first off, my review of Pearl Harbor isn't as harsh as some critics reviled it, but this movie, is most definitely no ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it just breathes ""Titanic"". This $135 million monster of a film follows two soldiers named Rafe and Danny (Affleck and Hartnett), best friends since childhood who are now in the air force, just days before one of history's darkest incidents. In a fit of chance, Rafe falls for Evelyn (Kate Beckinsdale), an attractive nurse, but alas, things change and Rafe is out of the picture (for a while), and Danny falls for Evelyn, and the two embark on a romantic affair, complete with powerful visuals of the two necking. Of course, those visuals are all that you see when you consider the more than overbearing romantic subplot between Danny and Evelyn, as well as Rafe. It's so innocuous that you'll desire for the film to be over. At least half the film is the two making love or kissing or what not, that you'll want to put a gun to your head.        The film, is essentially a summer movie because there really isn't much intrigue, you believe that Pearl Harbor is a truly disastrous moment that is gone but not forgotten. The characters, about every one of them, are very one dimensional and that's a no no for many films that desire to be in the best picture category. Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Cuba Gooding Jr. do however make their characters have real depth because they're all based on real people. But their presence in the film isn't huge, because the film focuses on it's lead characters and their RIDICULOUS triangle of love. I believe Bay and Bruckheimer, (of whom many film aficionados have dubbed ""the devil"" and ""the antichrist"" respectively) wanted the red carpet treatment. They want the award shows, the endless coverage, and the numerous praises, but their film, doesn't have what it takes to be rewarded those illustrious chances. They're both terrific filmmakers and make a hell of a team as director and producer, but ""Pearl Harbor"" shows that Michael Bay isn't ready to get serious yet. He was preaching with ""Armageddon"", but ""Pearl Harbor"" is a weakness. Spielberg was in his forties when he helmed ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" (which strangely lost Best Picture) because he was ready for it. Bay hasn't matured as a serious filmmaker yet, and he moved too fast into this film. However, the real power of this film is in the historical incident itself, which Bay orchestrates with a raw intensity. The looks of soldiers as they are being relentlessly shot at and blown up. The explosions are massive fireballs that sink whole battleships sending innocents to their doom, and Bay makes you feel as if you are one of those soldiers. He doesn't portray the japanese as an evil totalarian army, but as soldiers fighting the war, and aware of what the consequences may very well be. Spoilers! One particular image that stands out if the view of endless soldiers carrying themselves through the field covered in burning oil, their faces nothing more than just black masses of people screaming. It's a powerful image, and Bay shows it.     Honestly, I'd say Pearl Harbor is something you can rent, if you haven't seen it in the theaters, you haven't missed anything.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","I realize that any moviegoers shunned ""Pearl Harbor"" because of it's love story intertwined with the historical aspects of war. But most Michael Bay films strive to do that, and so I found it to be a good movie. Well actually, I see it a more of an experience in that to determine how good it is, it takes some contemplation.<br/><br/>I had been anticipating the release of this movie since January 2000. When I was watching, there was a large range of emotions. Happiness, sadness, shock, and a tinge of cynicism at some of the Titanic-esque elements. And yet when it was all over, and the loose ends had been tied up, it was a great movie. Ben Affleck continued his streak as one of my favorite film actors, and Josh Hartnett entered the running (I wasn't terribly impressed with a few of his other films). My only regret is that Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight didn't have bigger parts. <br/><br/>To reiterate my original point, if you were looking for a documentary type portrayal of December 7, 1941, then you will not find it here.

","I saw a preview for ""Pearl Harbor"" about two months before it came out. After watching it and seeing some of the special effects, I knew I had to see it. A couple of months later, I finally went to see it in the theaters, and I thought it was awesome.  (Warning: Possible spoilers ahead) I'll start out with the cons:  There are a few things I didn't care for in this movie.  First of all, I agree with you who say that the romance was bland, etc.; but I don't really care for romance, so my opinion on that doesn't matter.  Second, Ben's and all of the other twenty-something actors' acting were kind-of corny and goofy.  But on the other hand, I have seen people who act like that.  Not everybody in every movie has to act like they are acting.  Some of my freinds behave in such manners.  And they are on Hawaii, where they are (or were) care-free, thinking they were away from the war. Pros:  Of course, the special effects were the best part of the movie.  In my opinion, they more than make up for the lame romance.  I went into the theaters expecting to see some of the best shots I've ever seen, and I got what I wanted.  The effects combined with the unique camera angles (following a bomb as it drops above a ship, watching a squadron of jets fly over kids playing baseball and a women drying clothes, etc.) made the attack scene one of my favorites of all time. When ""Pearl Harbor"" finally comes out on video, I'll probably get the DVD so I can skip to the attack on occasion, but I will be sure to watch the complete film."

","""Pearl Harbor"" is the kind of movie where a man and a woman who have just witnessed countless numbers of people getting shot and blown up can honestly look each other in the eye as they well up, sniffle, and ask in all earnest ""But...what about us?""  It's the kind of movie where secondary characters die by what seems like the thousands, and getting your girlfriend pregnant or getting engaged is as good as a death warrant.  And it's the kind of movie that's so boring you stop caring about anyone in it less than a third of the way through.<br/><br/>Earlier in the year, a movie titled ""Enemy at the Gates"" was released, set in the battle of Stalingrad where a Soviet peasant becomes a hero by sniping Nazi officers, so in retaliation the Nazis send their own expert sniper to draw him into a showdown and crush the propaganda machine he's made of himself.  It featured great standoffs between the two near the beginning and middle, but it soon dissolved into an insipid, uninteresting love triangle between the Soviet sniper, the man who made him famous, and a Russian female freedom fighter.  I didn't really care for it, really, but when compared to ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Enemy at the Gates"" deserves to be seen as one of the best war movies ever made.  The makers of this pile engineered the preview to make it appear as if it was 90% explosions with a love story in there somewhere, but the most uninteresting romances of the past decade take up a good two-thirds of the running time.  By the end of the movie, I wasn't sure if the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor to sink ships or if they just wanted to kill people in love.<br/><br/>A lot has been made of the possibility of Japanese Americans being offended at the movie, but beyond ominous, evil sounding music that plays whenever scowling actors portray Japanese naval officers planning the attack, and at least fifty cries of ""Yeah!  Got those ba****ds!"" screamed throughout the movie, there's nothing to be offended about.<br/><br/>*Plot spoilers ahead, although if you didn't see them all while watching the movie about five minutes in advance, I feel sorry for you*<br/><br/>
On the love triangle, I've loved movies with romance before, but the way this is done is just sloppy.  Affleck makes a pathetic plea to a nurse while getting his immunizations, she falls for him after maybe a minute of resisting, and before you know it they've exchanged lovey-dovey gifts and gone on a date by a ship in port, and they're virtual life partners.  None of the slow buildup or obstacles found in real life relationships, they just fly into each others' arms.  Affleck volunteers to fight in Europe, gets shot down, and word gets back that he's dead.  Three months later, it's taken the nurse about two minutes to fall for his childhood pal, and they're humping like jackrabbits.  Gee, ya' think Affleck is going to turn up alive, come back at a very convenient moment, and it'll all lead to a cliche`d barfight seen a thousand times before in a thousand better movies?  And that they'll reconcile just in time to leap into the Pearl Harbor battle and become heroes, then chosen for a top secret mission where only one comes back?<br/><br/>Running as a parallel story (and I use the term loosely) is Cuba Gooding Jr.'s blank page of a black navy officer, who adds nothing to the story at all and whose character should've been scrapped.  He's given no definition or personality at all, just a suit of skin to wear that the filmmakers threw in so the NAACP wouldn't complain.  I can almost hear them saying ""OK, that's enough of the black guy to satisfy the minorities, now back to the white people!""<br/><br/>Without a plot I couldn't predict or characters I cared about, I hoped that veteran director Michael Bay would use the action scenes to save it.  I have to admit, the moments right before the actual attack on Pearl Harbor are ominous and fearful, and the first ten minutes are first-rate. After that, though, it's like riding a roller coaster for forty minutes. The first time you watch Japanese Zeros strafe fleeing American troops, it's exciting.  The fortieth time it's redundant.  The Doolittle raid on Tokyo, which takes place after the battle the movie's named after, is a pointless addition to an already overextended enterprise, which would've been a lot better off without it.  Arguably the dumbest part of the movie is when they crash land in China, and a few pilots armed with pistols kill what feels like an entire company of Japanese ground troops with rifles.  Must be all that apple pie they eat.<br/><br/>After I could plainly see the director and writer throw in the towel and give up trying to make even a decent movie, I could expect the actors to do no more.  Ben Affleck can be a good actor, but his performance here borders on jaw-droppingly awful.  He squints a lot, with a fake Tennessee accent that fades in and out at random and at times he emotionally inflects his face, but not his voice, giving the impression of somebody having a very emotional time choosing what detergent to use at the laundromat.  Kate Beckinsale is in over her head.  With her woozy, breathless style of overacting, she should be in Diet Coke commercials, not movies.  Josh Hartnett isn't quite as bad, but his character is so laughably underwritten that by the time he's become a Christ-like figure, there's nothing about him to ponder except how someone with such a girly haircut became an American pilot.<br/><br/>A bloated, overdone studio-funded corpse this is.  One of the year's worst movies."

","I finally saw this movie today (July 25) right before it will probably be pulled from the big theaters.  Regardless of what the critics have said, I thought this was an incredible movie and is by far Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bays best.  The movie appears to be very accurate and believable (as opposed to another Bay/Bruckheimer collaboration which was a piece of trash called ""Armageddon"").  Ive heard some say that the whole love story is irrelevant to the film, but I say it is very important to the film. Without it, we just have a bunch of people that we end up not caring about.  If the whole movie stuck with strategy and stayed with the US and Japanese powers rather than the individual characters, then this movie would have been a total flop.  Without caring about the characters, the audience does not get emotionally involved and therefore the ending really means nothing at all. ""Titanic"" would have never been as successful without the fictional characters that the film followed.  And that other WWII movie, you know, ""Saving Private Ryan""...how much of that plot was factual?  This is a great film, just as good as that other WWII movie and is on my DVD to buy list when it is released.  Definitely give this a view if you havent already. Thank you and have a nice day :D"
"Dockelektro","6","0","0","24 July 2001"," This is the end of the ""event"" movie
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Hollywood believes that making a movie is like baking a cake. Like Luc Besson said, ""movies at Hollywood are like the pie machine in Chicken Run: you throw the ingredients, press the buttons and a product comes out on the other end"". The importance of the cinematographer, the writer, the director, the sound director, the actors is totally irrelevant. This system thinks that the bigger, the better. And the difference between success and failure of a movie lies in how much you are willing to spend. The film being treated as a product and not much else, it all depends on how much money you can make out of it. The rest is totally useless.<br/><br/>The problem with Pearl Harbor is exactly that it was born out of a studio system so capitalist and near-sighted as Hollywood. And this time, they didn't made this one just to cash in at the box office. They were aiming to higher goals: box office smashes, a wide array of public and maybe even glory at the oscars. But Michael Bay is no James Cameron, and they were playing with fire when they decided to repeat the smash success of ""Titanic"". The comparisons between these two movies are huge, and, although they don't show on the final product, they are quite visible on the way this movie has been made: the thing they really wanted to do was to recreate the bombing of Pearl Harbor in all its 2.35 widescreen Dolby Digital DTS splendor, and Michael Bay, being the bubblegum popcorn director he always has been was the right choice to do this. But, as they noticed, a film doesn't live on only a bombing sequence, so they decided that they had to create a pretext, luring also the sensitive side of the audience, labeled as ""women"". This is what really gives me the more disgust: this movie was made by the numbers, no art involved, the script filled to the brim with clichés. The film is at all predictable, cold, a product of an industry and not much else. This is what really made me sick throughout.<br/><br/>First part: The way to start every epic movie: the clichéd prologue of the two protagonists when they are still children, having experiences that will influence their lives (see Backdraft and Braveheart, for example). Then we get a love story that takes nearly 5 minutes to start, the essential time (the audience really only wants to see the action). The film rushes slowly to the action sequence, with the always-seen newsreels of war. The sun is always orange, and the cameras are almost always in slow motion. Ben Affleck and a guy I have seen in Trainspotting do also the (very weak) comic relief. But we blink and the movie is already in Hawaii, because we have to get there so that the characters meet their fate, which everyone is predicting. The result of this first part is a handful of clichés which bores everyone who doesn't go to the movies to eat popcorn.<br/><br/>Second Part: The thing everyone has been waiting to see. After all, this is why probably 90% of the audience bought their ticket. The explosions are, of course, massive and huge. Many people die, also in the most gruesome ways. Fire, planes, bullets, water, the 150 million dollars are all there on the screen, in those specially dramatic shots of the bombs falling and the torpedos swimming towards the ships. Many things blow up, but, maybe it's just me, there is such a lack of artistic sense of good taste and suspense that the cinematic event of the summer, which is probably those 45 minutes of bombing leaves the viewer cold. It actually tastes like a fraud. There isn't one single shot I can say that touched me more than the others. Not even that bomb falling, which I see as a different way to show the same thing. The bullets, the explosions, even ""The Rock"" touched me more than all that collection of stunts. The flying bits are good, but at the same time they fall flat: why do we guess from the very beginning that the both of the protagonists will survive? I don't even ask how did they manage to be shot at during all that time and not being killed in the process. I don't even ask how two planes can lift off and escape. Why do the bad guys never kill the main characters? From the beginning, the bombing of Pearl Harbor doesn't strike us because there is no real sense of risk: all the people that die are not the people we met in the first part, and we know that at least the three main characters will make it to the end.<br/><br/>Third part: America always wins. That's maybe the message they show here. The bombing of pearl harbor was a disaster to the american fleet in the pacific, but america always wins, no matter what. And yes, they will strike back. Hey, even the Japanese admit it's a sleeping giant (which makes us think on the reasons they attacked it). In the final part, which we see as another episode and not as a conclusion (really, the movie could continue on and on, the bombing still looks like it was glued in the middle of the absurd love story, just check out that first dialogue between Rafe and Evelyn). The final sequence is one more statement that America always wins, no matter what, and even if they lost a great deal of troops and boats and planes, they will manage to win. Like they say at one given time: ""they lost the battle but they will win the war"".<br/><br/>It's things like these that kill the innocence and the sensibility of a movie. The credits haven't started, I was getting out of the theater. Really, it was a great disappointment, which proves that all the waiting was in vain, and that even if they invest millions in one movie they aren't guaranteed to suceed. It was a flop from the expectation point of view, and it nearly missed at the box office: the film merely payed itself and nothing more. But it isn't an unfair defeat: the film is just too damn pretentious, and aimed for sensible and artistic goals that the director wasn't prepared to reach - hey, Michael, no all is about little lights and sunsets. If we are expecting something great from a director who has filmed none other than brainless patriotic action movies which rely on frame rate to state their points, think it over, baby. I think it's time that Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer think over their strategy and think that maybe smaller is better next time (just check out the 2 french ""Taxi"" movies which made over 16 million viewers in France altogether) - this is the way to do it: give the audience a thing they have never seen, for clichés are starting to lose their appeal. Like they said in Gladiator: ""Win the crowd"". Good luck on your next effort, Michael and Jerry. Be careful with choices and priorities.<br/><br/>
The ""event"" epic movie, of which Titanic was the last example, has fallen dead here, among the explosions."

","I never knew the significance of Pearl Harbor or what it even was.  My birthday is on December 7th and what do you know, I was born at Pearl Harbor!  Can you believe I never knew anything about what happened there? This movie was excellent because it illustrates my birthplace authentically on how it was back then in 1941.  It was interesting to see the devastation it caused and exactly why it was such an extraordinary place after.  I am so proud that I have some kind of history with that place. Affleck and Hartnett did an excellent job playing people you could see the perspective of the attack from, instead of playing your average military stiffs.  Beckinsale did a fantastic job playing a woman torn between innocence and emotional strength.  She really did illustrate how much gratitude is owed to the nurses the day of the attack. Another thing, it was a fantastic setback for the Navy in which my family has a history of joining for the past three generations.  I was glad that they honored they Navy as something that we are eternally in their debt for serving our country. The action scenes were spectacular.  WWII film-making has become revolutionary.  I like how it wasn't 100% accurate.  I like how it didn't have the same gritty realism as Pvt. Ryan did. Arguably, I think the love story was completely necessary or else all you'd have is a lot of sinking ships and crashing kamikazes that wouldn't illustrate history at all.  At least have something normal to back this phenomenal re-enactment up. I recommend this movie to absolutely everyone since it has something you're guaranteed to enjoy."
"chadly86","3","0","0","19 July 2001"," An epic disaster
","Pearl Harbor is a movie that defines an epic structure...the build-up, which many times involves a romance, the event to be viewed, the response, and the happier ending.  That is definitely a broad and hideously worded definition of its structure, but the point is made.  What epics require that Pearl Harbor simply did not deliver on is a reason to stay in your seats for around 3 hours...in other words, epics need good plots, good characterization, and good development.<br/><br/>This film had little good in it.  The acting was sub-par, to say the least. Ben Affleck has had good performances, such as Dogma and Good Will Hunting. He has also had bad ones, such as Armageddon.  This one, though, was the worst I've seen.  Of course, I don't know if anyone could act very well with the screenplay he was given.  Josh Hartnett wasn't much better, but he was evenly more poorly written.  Kate Beckinsale just wasn't at all convincing.<br/><br/>The storyline was awful.  The love-triangle story that emerged was the most melodramatic and unnecessary plot that I have perhaps ever seen.  This film was searching for tears, but it only made me wince with pain.<br/><br/>If those two things weren't bad enough, the handling of supporting actors was worse.  Tom Sizemore, a very capable actor (Check out Bringing out the Dead and Saving Private Ryan.), had too small of a role.  Cuba Gooding, Jr: ditto.  Jon Voight, the best acting performance in the movie, was much under-used.  Alec Baldwin did as good a job as he could have with as poorly written a character as he was given.  Simply put, a movie all should have said no to.<br/><br/>The battle itself was too long and too uninvolved.  Was it me, or did I just see the same thing for 40 minutes?  All I saw was people dying, and all I felt was boredom.  Sure, people dying and things blowing up were what they saw too...but they felt it, they endured it, and they were angered by it. This should be felt by the audience, too (I was actually feeling guilty for not caring that much for the battle as I was watching it.)...and the last thing I was thinking about was enduring more.  I was becoming angry...but not at the attack...while watching this film.<br/><br/>So what were some goods of the film:  Hans Zimmer delivered musically.  He had a subtlety that few musicians have anymore.  He made the Japanese sound ominous but not menacing...appropriate, I think.  Special effects were great...but you have to have something to back it up.  Jon Voight was excellent as FDR.  Why did I not see more scenes with him in it?<br/><br/>The attack on Pearl Harbor was an event that changed America forever.  Many soldiers and civilians died, and all that were there were psychologically never the same.  This movie did not show this at all...and that this wasn't shown makes this movie simply one of the worst failures ever to be displayed on film.<br/><br/>Rating:  3/10"

","One question continuously plagued me while watching Pearl Harbor (hey, you have to have something to think of when 90 minutes of storyline are painfully stretched into a 180-minute film). That question is: Do Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay genuinely feel they're making a grand, majestic and epic take on a tragic disaster? Everything in the film seems to lead on that they do; the grand scale battle scenes, the slo-mo shots of dying and drowning soldiers, the inflated, empty romance and the running time (so....epic moviemaking means making long films, I guess). If this is to be taken seriously, it's a failure far greater than any Bruckbuster before.<br/><br/>It already starts with its basic premise. Someone said 'Pearl Harbor' , someone thought Titanic and that's it. A disaster rapped inside a 'romance'. Now, I'm not the world's greatest Titanic-fan. But the way the romance and disaster elements are combined here and the banality of the romance itself make the uber-corny Titanic seem like Citizen Kane. The romance in Titanic may have been more than a little cliched, but at least it served a purpose: it gave you characters to follow during the intensity of the sinking of the ship. It Pearl Harbor it does not serve any purpose. It seems the people behind it simply thought in modern day a disaster needed a romance. So out goes most of the interesting historical backround on the attack (which saves the movie from most critique on historical accuracy), the remaining bits reduced to some flashy edited 10-second scenes (in which good actors like Dan Akroyd and Colm Feore are criminally underused). Besides the trite romance it's replaced by some of the most redundant, crappy dia- and monologue ever commited to screen. Oh yeah, and there's the Ben Affleck/ Top Gun angle. Also, for no apparent reason whatsoever, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is briefly introduced and gets to pick up a medal. His is an interesting (and true) story, but just why was it included in this film?<br/><br/>Arguably worse than any of its script problems is the battle itself. 40 minutes of completely uninvolving carnage and visual effects. Those effects sure are good, but the sequence in itself neither works as an action sequence, nor as a dramatic representation of the actual events. Note to Michael Bay: lots of explosions (far too many, by the way) do NOT make an action scene. There used to be something like tension because the viewer is taken into the action through characters he or she cares for. Here we get some bangs, a ship sinking and some plane stuff. All cut together is such a way that I doubt anybody knew exactly what was going on, let alone care. The whole scene feels like a 40-minute montage of something like 'America's Greatest Explosions'. Of course, even if it were a satisfying action scene, it would still be terribly patronizing to the real people involved in the attack (as it would reduce their ordeal to mere entertainment). But it would be less patronizing than it is now, because you could have discarded it as mere entertainment. With countless shots of the drowning and dying Bay is clearly establishing what he's going for is something beyond that. He's going for some Saving Private Ryan-style depiction of the horrors of war. But then, he cuts back to the next money shot, thus rendering the foregoing useless. In short; the battle is an incredibly, extraordinary mess.<br/><br/>Isn't there anything good about Pearl Harbor then? Well, apart from those bit-parts (what is Tom Sizemore doing here, anyway?) and some impressive effects, no. Ben Affleck seems bent on replacing Keanu Reeves as rent-a-plank, Josh Hartnett does his best Leonardo DiCaprio impression and Kate Beckinsale looks great (and that's all she does). Furthermore, there's the soft-focus hospital scene (Q: Why not show the real deal? - A: PG-13 rating), the Doolittle raid (Q: It's a Pearl Harbor movie, right? - A: Yes, but the Americans need to win), the utterly senseless prologue, the terrible Hans Zimmer soundtrack and so much more, but you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour wants to be Titanic. It wants to reduce a tragic disaster to an entertainment blockbuster, but show the horrors at the same time. An already questionable starting point, but even worse is it's total failure at being entertaining at any point. Insulting rubbish.<br/><br/>1/10"

","I have just come home from the screening of Pearl Harbor here in good old Buffalo, New York, and I'm hungry for a real movie. What a boring mishmash, a stupefying rehash of everything Bruckheimer and Bay (B & B) have done before. There's even a shot where the pilots strut out of the hangar in the EXACT SAME goofy formation that the oil rigger astronauts used in Armageddon. The 45-minute bombing of Pearl Harbor is slick, but empty. It's video game, digital whoop-di-do time. The main problem is that the screenplay never really develops any characters, so you don't really care about anyone. The deaths at Pearl Harbor are cold and distant. B & B make the mistake of thinking we'd really care about a TV commercial-style action flick with a silly, and I mean SILLY love story around which to hang the well-known plot. Hey Ben Affleck, your 15 minutes are up. Couldn't you have tried to have read ONE line with feeling? Josh Hartnett is the better of the leads, and that's not saying much because the script is so empty-headed. Kate Beckinsale keeps losing her American accent. All the nurses are photographed as if they've stepped out of a retro-ad for hair care products. And why on earth did B & B decide to shoot the chaotic hospital scenes during the bombing as if we were watching 3-D without the glasses. What's with that? Or maybe the footage was damaged and B & B decided to pretend to be arty and figured that all that out-of-focus stuff and humans with light rings around them (halos?) would seem miraculous or mystical. Overall, on a scale of 1 - 10, Pearl Harbor earns a 4. On a scale of 4 Stars, it earns 2. On a letter scale of A+ to F-, it earns a C-. A great movie could have been made about Pearl Harbor and its strategic importance to America, it's history, why our bases were there, its native people and what they thought about white bread Yanks. But no, B & B wanted to have bombs away fun. Well, maybe this film's no total bomb, but its long and boring and at times the love story is laughable. The movie keeps repeating moments, as if, B & B and their screenwriter, Randall Wallace truly had no ideas in their bag of FX tricks. This movie is less about Pearl Harbor and more about B & B's egos. I'm gonna go watch Tora Tora Tora and From Here To Eternity."

","This review contains minor spoilers, but I've tried to avoid specifics. You have been warned.<br/><br/>My theory on Pearl Harbor is that it was altered from the original scriptwriter's vision during the process of ""selling"" it to the studio. The first 100 minutes were fantastic:  Epic scope, a wide cast of characters, balance between drama, romance and humour, foreshadowing of the attack, building of tension etc.  The attack scene was done brilliantly and was tremendously immersive.  However, after the actual attack on Pearl Harbor it was a logical place to end the movie.  (Incidentally, HAD the movie ended there, I would have given it 8 out of 10)<br/><br/>However, from that point the movie degrades down into an awful waste of another hour.  All characters except for 3 are rushed out of the movie, the plot changes course and pace completely (Can anyone say ""Armageddon""), and the realism and immersiveness of the movie is gone.  It appears that the studio simply could not accept a movie which ended with a crushing defeat against the USA, and needed to rescript to put that right.  This blindingly shallow and tedious extra hour destroyed any sense of enjoyment I had taken out of the first half and dropped this movie's rating down to a rotten 4.<br/><br/>*MAJOR SPOILER* One other comment, they would never have put Rafe's status as ""Killed in action"" unless they had found the body/tags.  He should have been ""Missing in action"".<br/><br/>Pros: 1) Interesting and believable love story up to the attack. 2) The chilling triage scene outside the hospital with the lipstick. 3) Special effects and filming in the attack scene. 4) Supporting characters and the use of humour. 5) Real historical quotes popping up in unexpected places.<br/><br/>Cons: 1) The last hour. 2) Blind patriotism.  ""Evil"" Japanese pilots doing strafing runs on innocent women.  ""Good"" American pilots not killing a single person. 3) The last hour.  Aargh. 4) Overdone camera movement made many key scenes unclear. 5) The last hour.

With their eyes and minds fixed on such forerunners as Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, Top Gun and even South Pacific (minus the music), producer Jerry Bruckheimer, writer Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay seem to have aimed little higher than a formula action movie targeted at a younger audience.    <br/><br/>The love triangle between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) is embarrassingly banal, with almost every incident and line of dialogue in the relationship thoroughly predictable. There are numerous other trite and clichéd incidents and characters, but the movie's treatment of African-American Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr), McCawley's spell in the UK with the RAF, the endless ""joshing"" among the pilots, and its female equivalent among the nurses, are all particularly painful. Alec Baldwin's lines as Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle sound especially stilted, though the Internet reveals that some of them are direct quotes from the war hero himself, <br/><br/>The film improves when it gets away from the fictional characters and their relationships. The scenes in Washington involving Jon Voight as President Roosevelt, those showing the Japanese preparation for the attack, and of course the attack itself with all the SFX stops pulled out are absorbing and exciting. For me, the visually best sequence is the Japanese's planes' take-off for the attack. And the worst - how about our heroes' blood donation being dripped into Coke bottles?

This movie was made for the casual movie-goer who doesn't mind a lame brain story and just wants to have a fun day watching a bad action movie. I do not recommend this movie if you want a moving or dramatic account of that fateful day and appreciate quality cinematic experiences. Because Pearl Harbor is definitely not. I really hate the fact that Disney invested so much into this bomb (pun not intended). In short, this movie was a complete and utter waste of good money and time. With the amount of money used this should have been a quality epic. And to think, Michael Bay and Touchstone are cashing in on this atrocity of a movie. A real shame."

","MULTIPLE SPOILERS ALERT<br/><br/>OK, I know it's been out nearly 2 months, but I just saw this at the $2.50 movies LOL.  It is alternately very good and very bad, blatantly ripping off the ""Titanic"" formula, from certain shots (overturning ships, floating bodies) to a tragic love story to a power ballad that was obviously supposed to be the next ""My Heart Goes On,"" but isn't.  The attack footage is gripping and disturbingly beautiful, almost balletic -- war should never, *ever* be allowed to look this pretty onscreen -- cf. Saving Private Ryan or, even better, the HBO flick When Trumpets Fade starring the highly underrated Ron Eldard.  And no movie should ever consist of about 1/3 slo-mo shots.  Mr. Bay seems never to have found an effect he didn't like enough to repeat till it ceases to be effective. <br/><br/>As for the love triangle, the very capable Mr. Hartnett plays the whole movie like he's totally in love with Mr. Affleck -- a shrewd and interesting choice.  Alas, Mr. Affleck is a total stick (the only worse performance in the movie is the absurdly over-the-top turn by Alec Baldwin).  Ms. Beckinsale is excellent -- indeed the whole subplot with the nurses is surprisingly substantive and moving -- but in the climactic scene, she is literally left waiting by the phone.    <br/><br/>Worth seeing, but it could have been great -- especially if the filmmakers had trusted the truth of history: America lost this round, and paid dearly for it.  Turning it into a ""Top Gun"" victory ride undercuts everything about the film that works."

","SPOILERS ******* Boy was I excited to see this movie.  I remember being in the movie theater the last 2 months getting exited because I knew that the Pearl Harbor preview was coming up with the inspiring Hans Zimmer (Thin Red Line) music, it would give me goose bumps every time I saw it. I can't remember the last time I have been so disappointed.    <br/><br/>I am not one to voice my opinion that much, but after reading the first review of Dean Kish noting that ""The biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season begins"" I was irked to say the least. Shrek will be the biggest blockbuster of the season.  Pearl Harbor, without a doubt in my mind, will not.                    <br/><br/>Many of you summed it up correctly by mentioning the ""cardboard"" characters in the movie.  I thought that Ben Affleck was a decent actor before, but he really hits rock bottom in this one folks.  I know there were two trailers I have seen so far for this movie.  The ""guy"" trailer with all the action sequences and the ""girl"" trailer with the love scenes.  Obviously Hollywood has to make this movie appeal to both male and female in order for Mr. Bay to achieve the ""blockbuster"" status he is so clearly looking for. They should have only shown the ""girl"" trailer because it is a much better representation of 90% of the movie.  I felt myself just not caring at all about the characters after the first hour, I was almost happy when Ben Affleck was shot down and presumed dead. That meant I would not have to see him act anymore!               <br/><br/>This was a 2-hour movie stretched to 3 hours.  Did Mr. Bay care more about the love triangle or the attack?  How was the director trying to honor the tragedy that occurred at Pearl Harbor because I did not see it?  If you get the chance, read Roger Ebert's review.  He sums up my feeling when he says that in this movie on December 7th, 1941 the Japanese attacked an American love triangle.  I give it a 1.5 out of 4 just because of the special effects.  The only redeeming value in the movie!!"

One thing is try to avoid making an extensive documentary film like ""Tora! Tora!

","Pearl Harbor boasts a tremendous cast including leads Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale.

","ME SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY:<br/><br/>There a thing people have to understand. When wanting to recreate the battle of Pearl Harbor, for the reason of entertaining, you need money. A lot of money. And those money are bound to come from  people who have them, yes? These people, who lend you the money are bound to wanting to get their money back, yes? So naturally there'll be A LOT of poll-searches done on a project of this magnitude, before the filming begins, yes?<br/><br/>So what do we end up having is a ""Usual"" story, with unusual images. Which is all the ""Pearl Harbor"" is... and that ain't all that bad.<br/><br/>
THE ""PEARL HARBOR"" WALKTHROUGH<br/><br/>The characters are thin, but believable (This is entertainment, people, not ""The late hour"" with Siegmund Freud), and the love-story that goes on for the first hour is okay. It's a warm-up for the inevitable.<br/><br/>
And then: Battle. For 45-minutes of incredibly digital imagery, you get a feeling of how stratigicly brilliant, the Japanese war-machine was. They blow up practically everything, which really is not that surprising to those of you, that know history a little.<br/><br/>So: There's gotta be some sorta happy-end, right? For the americans, yes? So our pilot-boys, though strugling for the same woman, take on a suicide-mission to bomb Tokyo. This bit is a silly add-on, as nothing comepares to the battle at ""The Pearl"".<br/><br/>And then: End Credits.<br/><br/>ME TALKING ABOUT GOOD STUFF.<br/><br/>I like first part of the story. I feel entertained and moved, by all that love, and all that war to set it apart. And naturally I like the battle-scenes, and the thinking: ""This is what it was like""<br/><br/>I like the acting of:<br/><br/>Ben Afflect Dan Akroyd Alec Baldwin<br/><br/>I love the whole quality of sound and image. It's incredible. There's been masters at work here.<br/><br/>ME TALKING ABOUT BAD STUFF:<br/><br/>I don't really like the end-bit. It's too long, and becomes too much of a ""And so on and then and so on"".<br/><br/>I don't like the acting of:<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr.<br/><br/>I don't like the patriotic feel to the last bit either. The whole ""We can do anything c'os we're americans""-thing. But that's just me being dane.<br/><br/>ME RATING THIS FILM AND ENDING THIS HORROR OF A REVIEW:<br/><br/>I give it a 7. It's viewable (In the cinema only), but not deep and full of special messages. You'll like this one, I guarantee. But you won't fall in love with it."

","Hello! I am Akshay V. Kulkarni from India .Recently I have been reading various reviews, articles, and notes on Disney's most expensive film ever `Pearl Harbor'. Well I do not know how many stars the movie exactly deserves, but I simply hated the way the critics are making fun of `Pearl Harbor'. I came to a conclusion that if a 100 critics have reviewed `Pearl Harbor', then 80 consider it to be just ** out of *****.Can anyone explain this as I have seen this happen with most movies. The same thing happened with 'Mulan'.That time 'The Prince of Egypt' was credited more even when 'Mulan's' script was better.And with every movie in the past years ,except 'Toy Story'. That really shut the nasty ones. Don't the people at the executive board of Disney think that something is wrong. A tragedy like Titanic,which was a to be mourned and acclaimed more by the British,was acclaimed more by U.S critics .In Titanic,the love story formed most of the film,and the sinking is barely an hour. Well ....what ...is wrong?or Was it just Twentieth Century Fox. Critics are mentioning that the film makers of Pearl Harbor have forgotten the basis of the tragedy at the end of the film and its history. But the narration shown at the end of the movie, when Rafe and Evelyn are with Danny's son in the open fields is  lot more than enough to make any American proud of what had been achieved in 1942.And that is what Bay and Bruckhimer and Wallace have done.They have made history.They have shown to the younger generation of America ,what great country is their's. The end part of the movie was enough to make any any hard hearted critic change to a soft one. Only god knows what has happened.Absurd.Where is Americas history heading?.Are they not proud of their victories?Have'nt they sat through 3 hr long movies before?was every three hr movie before Pearl Harbor interesting?OR would it have been a huge hit if it were not produced by the Mouse House.Also someone had mentioned that America was not in a position to have a grand funeral for Danny?Why man,HE is a hero,and he deserves it,even though some call it fictitious. And also the response by the audiences in America was heart breaking.A true American,who is proud of what had been achieved in 1941,should see the movie,no matter what the critics say. Remember AMERICA WON!"

This is, unfortunately, a Hollywood-glorified and modified version of facts, desperately bent to try to fit it into the love story, without keeping to accuracy.  However, this doesn't work out, the attack itself is almost a story by itself, only connected to the main (love) story by thin lines, it's more like a movie within a movie. Maybe it's because I don't specially like war movies, but the attack on Pearl Harbor was, apart from some impressive special effects, quite annoying, too much shooting, and somewhat tiresome."

Hey, it's a gigantic extravaganza to inflict the viewers' patriotic minds with visually compelling and unforgettable images. OK, it's entertainingly traumatizing,.. just like Star Wars' enchantment! Planes plummeting through the air and swooping between buildings; planes heading for the USS Arizona (blood-curling just to see its stock of torpedoes, bombs, and explosives!), Japanese bombs wreaking havoc, five battleships demolished, flames engulfing the harbor, thousands of men and women fighting for their lives, and salvage crews lifting the ship's gun turret to find bodies after bodies... a bunch of visual veracities garnished with an unimpressive and corny love-triangle yarn (marketing blitz, perhaps) that whops up a great deal of cheesy dialogue! A love story clearly without resonance and emotional pull! And the presence of undeveloped historical characters dabbed onto scenes to induce some historical credibility! Utterly a lame storyline with events flip-flopping between cinematic bliss and the writer's undeniably enthusiastic execution of romantic hoopla! Pardon me! If this film intends to show that America has lost its innocence with Pearl Harbor, it has failed miserably!

","I have the same 2 problems with this movie that I did with Titanic: unbelievably bad diologue and the tragic disaster brought to life with good special effects. The acting is stiff and wooden; you don't care what happens to the people onscreen. Ben Afflek isn't too bad an actor, but he gets annoying during this movie with the diologue that he spews out. Josh Hartnett (whose hair would've been cut shorter if he really was in the army) is also a capable actor, who sucks at the hands of Randall Wallace, the screenwriter. If any of you people who liked this movie ever see it again, please, please, PLEASE, listen to the diologue. It's so mind numbing that I'm am now stupider after watching this movie. Another problem was the depiction of the event. They didn't make it scary, which is what it should've been depicted as. They showed it as one big, long action sequence. They didn't want you to care about the thousands of people who died at Pearl Harbor. They wanted you to care about how cool the special effects were.<br/><br/>
Another thing wrong with this movie was the depiction of the Japanese, which was as one killing machine. The movie wanted you to cheer whenever the Japanese were called dirty b*stards or whenever one is shot down. I didn't cheer. I know something is wrong with a movie whenever the evil Japanese emperor comes onscreen and I expect him to grow a little curled mustach and put on a top hat. Then he can curl his mustache with his finger and pretend he's Snidely Whiplash.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that a good movie couldn't have been made about the disastrous event. The movie would've been so much better if it focused on actual people. One good thing about the movie were the supporting roles of three actors: Jon Voight, James King and Cuba Gooding Jr., who are effective in the roles that they play (especially Voight as FDR). Sadly, they weren't enough to save this overhyped peice of dung.<br/><br/>In closing, I am now convinced that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay can't make a good movie. I absolutely hate these two men and thy don't deserve to be in the movie business. One good thing that I'm glad that Jerry and Michael didn't do was put Nicholas Cage somewhere in this movie. I like him, but apparently he's sold his soul to these two men as evidenced by him being in every movie that Jerry and Michael make.<br/><br/>By the way, I think this has to be my longest review so far. It's amazing what a bad movie such as Pearl Harbor can inspire a guy to write."

""Nah, gimme four more kabooms there!""), some bad fx (especially one scene where the US fighters being pursued by Zeroes are flying between the camera & a not-too-distant hanger and both planes appear to be about 8 feet long), some bad ""newsreel camera"" shots (per ""...Ryan"") that are so jerky as to be unwatchable, the ""hazy"" camera shots in the hospital (several people where I watched this went to complain to the theater management about the projector being out of focus), too many quick cuts when people are just talking, too many full-facial shots that took up the entire screen (a person can take just so many nasal cavaties), too much of Ben A's ""classic"" smirk which he tries to pass off as a tough-guy attitude, and lastly and sadly, not enough of Cuba Gooding as Dorie Miller, one of the real-life heroes of that day. He was the genuine hero, not the fantasy flyboys (Ben & Josh) around whom the entire 3 hours mistakenly revolved. <br/><br/>This movie may excite some in the audience who drool over anything Ben A appears in, but in the long run it will be put aside on the action-film shelf along with ""Independence Day"" and ""Armageddon"" & will never be in the same class as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""From Here to Eternity"", or ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo""."

"Rammstein-2","5","0","0","15 July 2001"," Ambitious but so-so
","Critics have been eager to berate this film, which is understandable. Filmmakers have to be very careful when taking on a historic event of this magnitude. The reason for the success of ""Titanic"" was that, beyond a somewhat lowbrow script and mushy love story, great care was taken to depict in detail just what the great ship Titanic was all about. The legend of Titanic was treated with respect (if not augmented). ""Pearl Harbor"" lacks a great deal of historic insight and care for details.<br/><br/>There are two major flaws with this film. The first, and most important one, is the love story itself. Dizzy with the immense success of ""Titanic"" amongst the young communities, the makers saw their chance to make big money in a grand love story set in an event of legendary proportions. The story feels really added-on, though, the attack and the ensuing retaliation effort (I will get to THAT part later) suddenly strip the story of its heart and soul. Furthermore, the characters are one-dimensional - despite fine acting by all parties - and one is never really given a chance to connect to them in any way.<br/><br/>The second major flaw is the entire last hour of the film. It seems to be (and probably was) added to the script just to educate the world that the USA always wins, no matter what. The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most astounding military successes of all time is downgraded by the need to emphasize on US greatness. A suicide mission to drop a few pathetic bombs on a factory in Tokyo didn't really deter the Japanese from continuing their massive offensive in South East Asia. It is an unnecessary part, and the movie becomes terribly overlong.<br/><br/>What, then, makes it okay? Well, obviously the attack itself is depicted with incredible force and with a great feeling for drama and action (which Bruckheimer-Bay team is no stranger to), some of the scenes are just awesome. The aerial battles are also very well envisioned - even though no American planes took to the sky during the battle. The acting is pretty good, not bringing a lame script to life like DiCaprio and Winslet did in ""Titanic"", but nonetheless helps keeping it afloat. I also appreciate the fact that the Japanese were not depicted as cruel, insane killers who just attacked for fun. From their perspective, the attack on Pearl Harbor was the only sensible thing to do in order to keep their aggressive expansionist politics intact. I'm not defending it in any way - I'm just stating the facts.<br/><br/>So quite why the critics have to massively downgrade this movie, I don't really understand. It's very far from being the grand historic spectacle it could have been - it is merely entertaining - and it doesn't bring any new light to the actual event. Ultimately, it isn't the kind of film that I will remember with any clarity. It's just fiction. As such, it works pretty well."

Surely by now we're all used to the historical innacuracy thing that seems part and parcel of just about every 21st century American war film, yet whenever there is a hint of non-documented historical fact (see U-571, etc) we seem shocked and appauled. It's no Apocalypse now or Thin Red Line, but it's certainly watchable. Take a cushion, because it IS a monstrously long film, but fitting the whole military history of America from 1916-1945 isn't exactly a small job. The film's casting was slated by more than a few people and while I've never been a massive fan of Affleck, whoever put John Voight's name forward as FDR should have a medal. Ewan 'Spud' Bremner (Trainspotting) should also get an oscar for the fantastic way he pulls off 'being a yank'.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look if you're not expecting too much, and you have PLENTY of spare time..."

","This movie is a perfect (I think) representation of the famous morning of 7th December 1941 on Pearl Harbor. The 40 minutes  of Japanese attack are the greatest minutes of the whole 194 minutes of this movie. The scenery is the best I have seen: a lot of boats, persons and Japanese planes. The story is a mix of Brave Heart, Enemies At The Gates and Titanic. The writer (Randall Wallace) is the same as Brave Heart, great movie. He (Wallace) starts to presents two young friends who dream to became ""warriors"", as he had presented us on Brave Heart(William Wallace, he didn't dream to be, he was pushed to be by the English), then this little boys became men, and ""warriors"" as William Wallace. And now we mix this story with Titanic and Enemies At The Gates, and this two men fall in love with the same woman, as on Enemies At The Gates, the romanticism of this movie make us remember the romanticism of Titanic, one very romantic story in a middle of a human disaster. After the ""great"" Japanese attack, The U. S. government decides to attack Japan. On this American attack we have two heroes, as on Brave Heart (one). The story have it originality, but make us remember a lot other movies.<br/><br/>Finally, I think this movies is a great American movie, but it could be better. Not like Intimacy or Freedom, Pearl Harbor is different, it's easiest to understand the message and it's to entertain us. Intimacy and Freedom are two movies to appreciate like a painting."

","Pearl Harbor almost moved me to tears. It was, however not the trite and predictable love story that acheived this emotional response, but frustration at a wasted oppourtunity. Effectively, this was a very mediocre movie that could have been great.<br/><br/>Why on earth did the movie not deliver what was suggested by the title - an insight into an event which turned WW2. When the political and historic aspects of this movie should have been the major focus, we were instead forced to endure a romance inserted for all the mothers and 13yr old girls who would attend, in order to widen the movies 'appeal'. There were even the occasional glimpses of interesting footage - such as the cryptographers struggling to break the Japanese codes, which highlighted just how boring the love-theme was. Instead of the building of tension and suspicion in Washington, along with a feeling of calm and safety in Pearl Harbor itself, that would have far more effectively led up to the bombing, the first part of the movie was an almost complete waste of time.<br/><br/>The second part, the bombing and immidiate response, was actually pretty good, as most people have agreed (apart from the ridiculoulsy heroic antics of our clean-cut, all-american heroes). whether or not it makes up the price of admission, as has been claimed, is up to the individual. I think it would have, had the movie ended there. But it didn't. The final part made me very angrey. Since one of the boys have to die, in order for our heroine to live happily ever after with the man she loves, without ungraciously dumping the father of her child, off they head on a raid that was possibly the stupidest thing I have ever seen. apparently, this raid of 16 American planes turned the war, because it proved how brave Americans could be. Throughout the movie, it was made clear that, while some attempts were made not to cast the Japanese as satan, America would rise up in bravery and justice for the side of good. This leaves almost no mention of how america was happy to allow millions of deaths in Europe, before 'heroically' rising up in their own defence. Also left entirely untouched is the entire issue of Americas' use of the ATOMIC BOMB!!! For the movie to portray all American actions as completely justified and 'right' is frankly nausiating. I left the cinema fuming.<br/><br/>Note: If you don't care about society, history or politics at all; if you really, really like seeing things blown up; or if you want to see a predictable romance between stereotypical characters that always look ready for a magazine cover; this is the film for you."

","When I see a movie that I somewhat don't appreciate, I can easily sit and search any little flaw to rack the movie down with. So I'll try not to.<br/><br/>PEARL HARBOR doesn't put away the grease. But that's not really a secret. As usual in Hollywood Blockbusters the movie is parted in three different parts. Part one invites us to a lovestory between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale and their friends, especially Affleck's life-long-buddy (Josh Hartnett). The lovers have one last night before Affleck has to go off to war. However he gets shot down and is reported dead. A new love story comes to life when Hartnett comforts Beckinsale. Naturally, their romance doesn't end the story. Of course, Affleck isn't dead. He returns and his longtime friend becomes an enemy. The same old story, that is. The lovestory isn't pale but it's rather predictable and I'm afraid to say the concept isn't immortal.<br/><br/>In part two Japan bombs Pearl Harbor. The five minutes right before the actual bombing is perhaps the only really impressive thing in the whole movie. It lays a layer of suspense over America and nobody expects anything. Slowly the worries and the ""wait a minute""-feeling increase before it takes everybody with surprise. After that it's basicly an hour of war, with Affleck/Harnett and the boys confused and surprised by the attack. Cuba Gooding Jr also appears with a nice, but strangely vapid character here. It is a very well-made scenario with many big booms and powerful effects. The kind of things that doesn't need any greater thinking to enjoy. It's the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>The third part is all about USA's big revenge against Japan. The two friends, the supporting-actors and some other pilots, are trained by a naval officer (Alec Baldwin) to execute a top secret plan; bombing Tokyo. This part is held up by Baldwin, but gets boring at many times, especially at the end when the group crash in the middle of Japanese troops.<br/><br/>This part contains some of the most overflowing USA-cheers I've ever seen. Especially Baldwin's character talks loudly about his brave American men and teach the pilots how to say ""I'm an American"" in Chineese. As the patriot he is, he would rather die than be prisoned by the Japanese.<br/><br/>I think PEARL HARBOR has potential. But the script simply has too much clichés. I mean, do people in movies still say ""I'm so cold"" before they die? The movie has some great editing and special effects, some half-vapid but OK music and the three hours pass very fast. The acting is without any bigger surprises.<br/><br/>Jon Voight does the best job as the American president. He is a very talanted actor and he really makes a powerful and believable job. Though I sympathized mostly with the character Goose. His line ""I have a girlfriend"" really got a laugh out of me.<br/><br/>Overall I'm generous and give this movie a 6/10, and that's even though the lack of new ideas and the large number of clichés"

","Every bomb hits the target, every explosion results in a huge fireball, and every bullet finds it's target, regardless of how it was delivered or lined up.<br/><br/>It was really difficult to see an actual historical event turned into a Hollywood action film with all its preposterous battle hoopla.  I've seen interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors who say that the movie is pretty accurate.  This rather amazes me.  Either they have forgotten the details of the event, or they may not have actually been there.  My father was there. The battleships were tied together with walkways between them and to the dock.  There was no way that Japanese planes were going to fly between the ships, below the deck level, the length of the ships, but they did this repeatedly in the movie.  Dive bombers did half immelmanns to attack.  I doubt this was ever done in actual combat.  Bombs fell straight down, a physical impossibility when delivered from a moving airplane. Wasn't it amazing how all those guys who went through flight training together were always assigned to the same duty stations?  Pearl Harbor had such potential, with todays technology, but in the hands of an adolescent director, the result was quite pathetic.<br/><br/>Alec Balwin's portrayal of the phenomenonly heroic Jimmie Doolittle was overly theatrical and moronic.  There was audible laughter in the theater during his major ""speech.""  Anyone who would cast him as an American patriot is an idiot.<br/><br/>I am willing to ""check my brain at the door"" to enjoy ""Animal House"", or even ""The Animal,"" but don't ask me to do this to view an historical drama."

","The fact that *anybody* can find this movie even mildly entertaining totally escapes me. I had a fairly open mind when I went to see it, although I did expect a sickening display of American patriotism. And I did of course get that in bucketloads. That's not the problem though. The problem is simply put: this film is the worst film I've ever paid money to see (well, I'll make an exception for Dungeons & Dragons).<br/><br/>For the first two hours I couldn't help moaning, groaning and looking at everything BUT what was happening on the screen. The only things that were mildly amusing were the HORRENDOUS dialogue, and the almost equally bad acting. This film shattered all my illusions of Ben Affleck as a decent actor. However, I saw 'Chasing Amy' just a couple of days ago (an EXCELLENT film by the way), and he does a really good role there. This leads me to the conclusion that it's not the actors' abilities that are lacking in this film - it's just that the film is so badly written - so flat and boring - that they don't have anything to play with (like the horrendous performance award winning Jeremy Irons does in Dungeons & Dragons). Not even Anthony Hopkins would've looked good in Pearl Harbor. And God knows what on earth Cuba Gooding Jr. is doing in there. I suspect only to include the mandatory even-black-people-can-be-good-people-bit all Hollywood films have these days (we know this Hollywood - stop being so insecure).<br/><br/>I simply cannot believe that the script in this film was written by the same person that wrote the script for Braveheart (Randall Wallace). Although Braveheart has elements of sentimentality, I love that film. I think the commercial forces of Hollywood pulled Wallace's writing abilities down in cliche Hell. Talking about cliches - I won't even try to put you through the misery of telling you about the pathetic love story. It's the most horribly cliched I've ever seen.<br/><br/>A problem with the film is also how totally one-dimensional and barbaric the Japanese are portrayed. I find the scene in which the Japanese plan the attack on Pearl Harbor almost shocking. They stand around a pond with some guy standing in the middle of it pointing at little models of warships with a wooden stick. ""This is how we're gonna attack"". This brings up the question: Do the Americans think that they are the only country in the world with military installations? And of course, the Japanese admiral in charge of the attack fleet that is actually portrayed as a somewhat sympathethic, is only in there for the purpose of delivering this line ""I fear we have woken a sleeping giant"". An American audience will of course appreciate this a lot more when it's coming from a semi-nice guy. Everybody knows the US armed forces are the most powerful in the world. So where does all this insecurity that calls for the rubbing of the military ego at every turn come from?<br/><br/>And whereas the Pearl Harbor attack shows a lot of suffering on the American's behalf, the attack towards the end of the film on Tokyo where apparently the Japanese casualties were ten times higher than the American's at Pearl Harbor, doesn't show ANY Japanese people being blown to bits. What's going on here? Is it so hard to accept that America has inflicted a lot of pain on the people of the world? Do they have to HIDE the fact that they are killing people as well just to make themselves look even more heroic?<br/><br/>I will of course admit that the effects are spectacular, but the attack itself is fabulously unexciting because of your state of mind at that point in the film. If the attack was put into the film one and a half hour earlier, it would be spectacular entertainment (the aerial combat over Britain is pretty good just because it's so early in the film the story hasn't gotten to you yet), but you're just not ready for it when you've been bored out of your mind for two hours. Also the last fourty-five minutes (raid over Japan) are pretty interesting, but it's just too late.<br/><br/>This film could've been good if only it focused on what the title suggests it's about instead of the most pathetic excuse for a love story you're ever likely to see. Not even the music is decent.<br/><br/>However, I'll give it 3 out of 10 simply because it has very good effects and some pretty nice scenic (albeit very cliched) photography at times.<br/><br/>As a last comment, I remember how the audience in the movie theatre reacted with standing ovations when the White House was blown to pieces in ID4. Hollywood is actually making the rest of the world loathe the American mentality. They should start rethinking their strategy before it's too late"

They are likely the same ""man on the street"" people that Jay Leno interviews who don't know the name of our current president, yet know all the words to every Limp Bizkit and Backstreet Boys song.<br/><br/>That, along with the fact that this movie ever got made is a sad indicator of where the collective IQ of our nation is heading.<br/><br/>Maybe worst of all, this movie is a colossal insult to the brave WWII generation who actually faced real fears and dangers, who actually had to fight in battles and die to build and preserve our country and did it all without an exploitative Hans Zimmer score or a cheesy Faith Hill song to back them up."
"saintpauliboy","6","0","0","5 July 2001"," Not a great movie, yet with merit
","I'll get to the point.<br/><br/>Things that were good about this movie include the marvelous battle scenes (though the whole ""jiggly camera"" thing is getting a bit overdone), the cinematography, the acting (pretty good overall), especially considering that the leads were cast more for their appearance than anything.  Don't get me wrong - they don't stink...they just aren't at the top of the list in terms of bards of the stage.<br/><br/>The single worst thing about this film was the script (not even the most marvelous acting can overcome silly, corny dialogue).  At one point Jimmy Doolitle (Alec Baldwin) was commenting on the American spirit, and I was expecting Grandma to walk up to him with an apple pie, and for the local high school band to march across the air craft carrier deck playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", batons flying.<br/><br/>Yes, the storyline was convoluted and unlikely.  And yes, it included some significant historical inaccuracies - though not quite as many as lots of war movies.   Still, the mere fact that it's generating an increased interest in WWII - and the incalcuable sacrifices made by so many during the war - gives it some inherent value.   How else will Mall Rats ever even conceive how grateful they should be to live in this country?  Granted, this movie alone won't do it.  Yet it perhaps may help."

","I find this film one of the most difficult ones to comment. It has so many good points and so many bad points that you can think it's either a good or a bad film.<br/><br/>But, to avoid that complexity, I'll try to recall them and write them down here, and let you construct your own conclusion. Of course, you have to keep in mind at every moment that this is the most expensive film ever made so far. So these are the points.<br/><br/>1) The music. I place it at the first place because it is in my opinion the worst thing in the movie. This film needed a soundtrack by John Williams, for example. He would never have used that ""minor seventh"" chord for almost all the scenes (including both love and war scenes), which makes the film so emotionally flat. In Gladiator we have a good example of what music can do to a film (not to mention Star Wars...).<br/><br/>2) The script. Pearl Harbor has a really poor script, based on a simple and original idea but poorly developed. In Saving Private Ryan we have a simple and original idea brilliantly developed. The film is so predictable that 1 hour before its ending I already knew it (I think that even before that...). It's a paradox in a film which is based in a fact that's basically one of the biggest surprises in history. Well, you could say ""but history is already known"", and you would be right, but the film isn't already known until you watch it. In Titanic I really was surprised when the ship collided...!<br/><br/>3) The look. This film succeeds in creating another world for us. We feel transported to another time, with plenty of details, and that's something remarkable. The nurses look like fashion models, and Evelyn puts lipstick on her lips in every scene, but I'm not really sure if things were that way in 1941.<br/><br/>4) The special effects. Pearl Harbor has one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The war scenes are so real that they can override all the bad points we could find. A lot of CGI has been used, but it's well done and looks real. As a result there is the best recreation ever made of what the Pearl Harbor attack could be. As in Saving Private Ryan, we find ourselves inside the battle and understand what those people should feel.<br/><br/>5) The message. I know that films don't necessarily need a message, but this one needed one. And it really has one, but with a wrong envelope. In Saving Private Ryan, the old man at the cemetery asks his family if he is a good person. He has no physical injuries, but his soul is badly damaged, and desperately asks for a redemption to rip that black ghost away from him. We call this CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and there's nothing of this in Pearl Harbor. Rafe and Danny kill a lot of people and pass through extreme situations, Evelyn lives the worst nightmare in her life, and after all of that we don't see any change in them. Most war films from the past (being most of them propaganda films) are the same way. That's NOT real, and doesn't help at all to send a message as we don't identify with the characters.<br/><br/>You can make your own conclusions. This is mine: Film industry has lost its aim, which used to be art. They live for the moment, and don't care for anything but money. Nowadays a lot of good special effects are the perfect passport to success. All the other elements are chosen by its impact on masses rather than by its artistic value. And the artistic value is what really makes great films adored by masses, but in a long term.<br/><br/>If you are curious about my rating to this film, here it is: 6-7/10."

","Unfortunately ""Pearl Harbor"" has to be the most cringe-inducing load of ""God bless America"" twaddle to come out since ""Independence Day"". I must admit that I wasn't expecting a war movie of the impact or sincerity of ""Saving Private Ryan"" but ""Pearl Harbor"" far exceeded my expectations of mediocrity. The script was acheingly bad, the acting wooden (mind you they didn't have a huge amount to work with) and the underlying Stars and Stripes flag waving was quite frankly sickening. Sure, the action sequences were impressive but produced more of a feeling of watching a computer game.<br/><br/>It really is a shame because as a historical event, Pearl Harbor has the scope to produce a riveting movie. ""Tora Tora Tora!"" remains the best adaptation of this infamous day in the Second World War, whereas ""Pearl Harbor"" comes across as an overly long, and quite frankly embarassingly patriotic pile of rubbish. I am sure many people will jump up and down and say that this wasn't meant to be a jarringly realistic portrayal but at the same time all the filmatic elements of ""Pearl Harbor"" are just plain bad.

The same can be said of Titanic, but that was a highly acclaimed film.<br/><br/>What truly made this movie bad was the fact that it was muddled.  In all truth you could have made two (or possibly three) movies out of this one movie.  Now I'm not saying that the length of 3 hours was the problem, but that what we saw could have been six or seven hours of film easily. Cutting out some of the froth around this film could have given the directors a chance to flesh out the events more so than they did.  I think even WW2 Vets will admit that although the film provided a decent portrait of what happened there, it still did not capture the heart of whole event.<br/><br/>Titanic had a great eye for detail, and it really tugged at the heart strings, but in Pearl Harbor I did not feel for the plight of these brave and unsuspecting soldiers, not because I did not understand what they went through, but because no one who developed the film took the time to get you to care.<br/><br/>If you really want to see a film that captures the heart of WW2 go rent Saving Private Ryan.

","I must let you know, as someone who appreciates history and research, that there is more to the substance of the plots in the film than most would like to admit.  Not wanting to reveal anything in this critique, let it suffice to say that most history books aren't as accurate and truthful as we would like to believe.  Many parties on both sides of the conflict would certainly take issue with the innuendo in the film, not for it's fallacy, but for it's basis in fact. Relational situations, such as those put forward in the film did occur, as many of our fathers and grandfathers can confirm.  And to comment on the casting, consider all of the photos you have seen of WWII veterans....handsome boys, weren't they? So don't think it so unrealistic that the cast is composed of chiseled visages with frames to match - soldiers don't need uniforms to be attractive. As for the nurses in the film, when you're lonely or scared, any woman looks like a pin-up girl, even if she is a bit short or plumb or lacking in the intelligence department!<br/><br/>So enjoy the film for what it is, an endearing rendition of a tragic event, as seen through the eyes of men and women who did exist (though perhaps with a bit more gore, and a bit less glamour), who did live and love and lose - for love of duty and country.  Remember, one main purpose for producing a film (besides making money), is to tell a story so we, the audience can see a bit of ourselves, and relate to the events described.  On that score, Pearl Harbor succeeds. I highly recommend this movie for a wide range of audiences, and applaud the screenwriter and director for their discretion with certain scenes which could have been ruined had they been depicted in the more-typical (modern) ""Hollywood style""."

They'd have shown me that war is a terrible terrible thing and not some corking big adventure as these sick comics of the 1970s seemed to make out. This film is better than Tora!Tora!Tora! and From Here To Eternity (and the beach scenes in Pearl Harbor bring the latter film to mind). It has a good story and it portrays war for the horror it is. If we are going to make films about war they should be anti-war films. Tora!Tora!Tora! did not concentrate enough on the terrible loss of life at Pearl Harbor and the attack in that film is just a lot of exploding ships. This film shows that people died terrible deaths or were horribly injured. There is one scene where two guys are painting the side of a ship. A torpedo slams into the side of the ship and they are just obliterated in the explosion. That and other scenes hit home very hard. The scenes showing the Curtiss P-40s being destroyed on the tarmac are horrific as is the scene during the Battle of Britain section of the story where the nose is completely shot off a Heinkel 111. The battle scenes aim at horror and don't glorify destruction unlike the war films of the 60s and 70s. They had genuine Mitsubishi A6M Zeros in this film and didn't use the replicas converted from North American Harvards which were used in Tora!Tora!Tora! (although the Aichi D3A2 Vals and the Nakajima B5N2 Kates were the same Harvard and Vultee BT-13 based replicas which were used in Tora) but why did they have to paint them green? Zeroes were not painted green until later in the war. The ones that took part in the attack were painted light gray and they were that colour in Tora!Tora!Tora! The biplane seen at the start of the film is a Boeing Stearman. This part of the film is set in 1923 and the Boeing Stearman did not appear until the late 1930s although I appreciate that hiring a plane that would have been more appropriate for that period like a Curtiss Jenny would only have added to the cost of an already expensive film. Alec Baldwin does well as Jimmy Doolittle and it's hard to credit that the actor playing Admiral Yamamoto is the same actor as played the eskimo in The Island at the Top of the World. Kate Beckinsale does very well and should get the Bob Hoskins award (joke) for most convincing American accent by a British actor or actress. Jon Voight gives the best and most convincing portrayal of FDR that I have seen. An excellent film which deserves to do better than it has so far. It deserves to do as well as Titanic, to which it has been compared. Let's face it, there are similarities. A love story set against a 20th century event and a leading lady called Kate!"

","Rubbish. I can't tell you how sick I am of movies trying to glorify America's part in a conflict or a war. For forty minutes (it felt like more) we see the bombs fall over Pearl Harbor -- sometimes even in slow motion -- and how much time is spent on the bomb that ended the war? The bomb that probably killed and injured more people than any *bombing* in history. Well, I actually can't tell you -- as any other human being, I have to blink every now and then.<br/><br/>
Please, script writers and moviemakers in the USA, do not try to glorify you own country if another country gets discredited in the process. In American movies, the bad guys are always from Russia, Germany or Japan. I have seen quite a lot of movies from these countries, especially Japan, and they plots are always deep and stimulating. The Hollywood recipe for a good movie includes action and nudity, and a story that a five-year-old would understand."

","SPOILER-RATING: Nothing really... just something about the structure of the film.<br/><br/>To me Pearl Harbor was a big disappointment. I still wonder how Michael Bay was able to make a 1,5 hour script 3 hours long. In the beginning of the movie there's about an hour of building a relationship with the main characters, and that's basically good (still, an hour?) but the characters still remain so hollow. If you're making a big action flick, why mess the movie with pointless love drama? And Pearl Harbor wasn't even a warmovie, so there was no need for romance. So those looking for hard action shouldn't bother seeing Pearl Harbor. And those looking for romance... you ain't gonna find it in this movie, sorry. I'd give it 2/5... but that's just me."
"DennisT","8","0","0","25 June 2001"," Thought this movie was pretty good unlike other comments.
","My family consisting of mature adults and a young adult enjoyed the story. I get the impression that some of the negative comments about this story are written by young people with zero understanding of life in the 40's to 60's. Young men really did believe it was the right thing to do - even thought they didn't really want to- to go and defend freedom for all.<br/><br/>
Although the the Love story appeared to be a takeoff on Titanic it is a common format and gave us a look at the lives of people entering the war at that time.  I believe the characters were accurate of the ""flyboy"" type person. The story of Pearl Harbor was the backdrop.  But the action of the war scenes did overpower the love story somewhat.<br/><br/>The Col. Jimmy Doolittle raid was not an ""avenging act"" but was to show the Japanese that we would not sit still for that kind behavior. Not said in the movie the the lack of cultural understanding by either side. The Japanese thought we would be intimidated, demoralized and not fight back.  This raid showed a different view. That's what Roosevelt wanted.  This was a morale booster to get the Americans to do a hard thing - fight a war (see ""Saving Private Ryan"" to see how hard.)<br/><br/>A similar movie (not about Pearl Harbor)that I saw on rerun was ""Racing with the Moon"" (1984) with Sean Penn.

","What is all the criticism of this film about?  It plays out perfectly.  You can't be too harsh on this film since it was written by Randall Wallace who wrote 'Braveheart' and we all know how much people love that film.  The performances by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are solid and heartfelt.  Jon Voight was amazing as FDR and I truly believe he could get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  'Pearl Harbor' plays out perfectly.  The first part is the romance angle, the second part is the attack and its aftermath and the third part is the U.S. retaliation against Japan.  I think the reason a lot of people didn't like this film is because of the jealousy towards the superiority of the American military and fighting spirit which is the best in the world.  At least it is in the opinion of this Canadian.  The U.S. came back from terrible odds to, for the most part, win World War II.  My only complaint is the editing which I thought was poorly timed.  But it's Michael Bay who is technically inclined but academically mediocre.  James Cameron or Steven Spielberg would have been better choices to direct this."

","Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) play childhood buds whom grow up to become top gun  pilots. Before Rafe ships out for Great Britain to help in the battle against Hitler, he meets and falls in love with a  nurse named Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). When they receive word that the Germans shot down Rafe's plane, they console each other in ways that go beyond the limits of  friendship. Now, I will go ahead and tell you that the love story in this movie plays out like a daytime soap opera. Therefore, unless you see the deceased person in the box as he or she is being lowered in the hole, you shouldn't assume that he or she is dead. What am I getting at? Just when Danny and Evelyn are getting hot and heavy and looking at each other with japanimation eyes, Rafe comes back from the dead like Lazarus. While the love story develops, the Japanese are fast at work planning their attack. Then without warning the battle starts.<br/><br/>Before seeing this film, I hoped and prayed that it wouldn't get the same script treatment as Titanic did. I can tell you that my prayers weren't answered. Apparently, Hollywood doesn't believe that stories of historical significance can hold their own when it comes to film making. The movie is called `Pearl Harbor' and it's three hours long but of those three hours, the soap opera...I mean the love story.... takes up and hour and forty-five minutes of it. Every once in a while, Michael Bay, the director, decides  he needs to remind his audience that no, they aren't in the wrong theatre, this is Pearl Harbor and throws in old war footage or government officials discussing the European fisticuffs . I hate to say it, but the love story is very bland and I am willing to bet money that right now, on one of the daytime soaps, this storyline exist. If Bay and Bruckheimer thinks this story held more attention than the actual war story, then they are seriously wrong. I found the short snippets involving the Japanese and U.S. factions more interesting than the love story. Not to mention that the love story really didn't go anywhere. Personally I wanted to learn more about the officials that were trying to get into the head of the Japanese admirals and captains, yet it was only touched on. Like Titanic, the historical aspect of Pearl Harbor is put on the back burner for a very over done soap.<br/><br/>I will say this much, once the hour and forty-five minutes pass, and we're given a break from the love story, this movie takes off in a big way.  I really appreciated the way Bay created a sense of ignorance before the attack started.. I use the word ignorance not in a bad way, but to show that the Americans had no idea the Japanese were going to attack. He used scenes with kids playing baseball, women enjoying afternoon naps, men poking fun at each other. Even the pictures of the Hawaiian landscape are romantic to look at to soon be muttered with the Japanese air fleet. The bombing scenes take on a life of their own which goes to show that Bay and Bruckheimer know how to blow stuff up and keep you glued to your seat. I think they achieved something very important in this film in that they made the audience feel as though they were on The U.S.S. Arizona. They did this with a sound roster that will give any theatre sound system quite a work out. They also allow you to see the film from the point of view of the weapons ( I know that sounds weird but see the movie and you will understand). Once the fighting is over and the Japanese forces retreat, you are swept into the infirmaries. I appreciated the way Michael bay used the shakey camera technique to give the sense of urgency that went on in the infirmary. Some voices were very loud whereas others were muffled and died away like the dying soldiers. To be honest, it almost look like horror movie footage.<br/><br/>
As for the acting, to be honest, I didn't have a problem with anyone. It was good ensemble acting. I will say that Jon Voight leads the pack with a great job as President Roosevelt. This movie should do wonders for the careers of Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett.<br/><br/>So my ultimate opinion of the movie is this: if you can stand the love story going on forever and a day then you will enjoy this movie. If you have the taste for some kick butt war scenes then this movie is definitely for you. Overall it's a good movie. I just wish they would have spent more time on the events leading up to the war rather than the love triangle that muffled it."

","Like alot of other comments I've read here, I was skeptical when my wife and I went to see this film. I had heard alot of negative reviews and of course friends who had friends who had seen it and not liked it. After reading some comments in here I decided to see it for myself. Being an avid movie goer I knew I could give this film a fair evaluation. It was a truly GOOD movie. Ben Affleck, who has the nicest teeth in film, was very good, as was Kate Beckinsdale, Josh Hartnett, something for the the preteen girls to ooh and aah about. The supporting cast was quite effective also. There was no great character development here, just some interlaced scenes to try and help us feel something for the main characters. All in all, it worked. Lets face it, this is summer entertainment, not a David Lean epic. There were plenty of incredible special effects, and the bombing sequences were amazing (definite Oscar work). Micheal Bay, probably the slickest film-maker out there, has made a very patriotic, let's beat the Japs asses, lets all fight the good fight, let's get one for the gipper, movie. But pleeeaaassssee, let's be rational here. Why does Hollywood insist on trying to make us believe that WW2 didn't actually start until the Americans joined and that they were the only ones that made a difference. I always thought WW2 started with the invasion of Poland and then Belgium, 3 years earlier. When Ben Affleck's British commander said that if all Americans were like him (Ben) god help whoever picks a fight with them. I almost vomitted when I heard that line. Sure there were Americans flying alongside the British during the Blitz, but this seemed to me just another way to show the Americans, even though they were not officially part of it, single handedly driving the Huns back. I enjoyed this film alot. I will buy it on DVD when it comes out, I will not, however, buy into the America is our saviour crap. P.S. How can you watch a sunrise on a beach faceing west?

I'm only fourteen and now I want to find any information I can on it. I never even liked history before and I knew absolutely nothing on Pearl Harbor and hardly anything on World War II. So how can the movie be so bad when it got me interested in what happened. Now I go out and spend about 40 dollars to buy a huge book on Pearl Harbor that I finish in about a week or two. The movie got to me and I don't see how it can be considered a bad movie. It seemed so real. I felt like the characters were actually going through it and that I was kind of there too.

I think the movie gives them their due and I have seen few WW2 movies OR documentaries that have even tried.   I'd also like to take a bit of an issue with the criticism of the filmakers' calculated efforts to provide a return on their investment. I am far from a defender of either Disney or capitalism in general (more of a wary partaker of the products and an enthusiastic critic of both ), but if you are going to make an epic you should spend the big bucks.  If you spend the big bucks you've got to try and make them back or those with the bucks won't let you near them again.  Simple as that.

"bluestreak5","7","0","0","26 May 2001"," Worthy of the hype
","Billed as one of the blockbusters of the summer, Pearl Harbor provided three hours of entertainment with a few special nuggets and relatively few gaffes.  Although audiences will probably remember this film for its epic battle sequences, it was the emotions and the thought-provoking situations that made this movie a success.  This film fulfills the World War II combat film genre without resorting to many of its clichés.  The film may not be 100% historically accurate, but it gives a good example of the kinds of things that did happen.  Ben Affleck delivers a spell-binding performance as the film's hero.  He keeps it real by bringing out the character's weaknesses in addition to his strengths.   The plot kept the film moving, so the three hours literally flew by.  However, the love-triangle scenario gets too predictable at the end, and at times you wonder if the characters feel the same emotions of the tragedy of war that the audience is feeling.  The dialogue seemed a bit contrived in places, and a couple of lines seem to be lifted straight from previous World War II combat films.  The narrator at the end of the film is entirely unnecessary.  Rather than using the more effective technique of letting the audience decide for themselves what to take away from the film, the narrator tries to tell the audience what to think and fails by overdramatizing everything and sounding like a history lecturer.  One thing this movie did not contain was a prejudice toward the Japanese.  For the most part, the treatment was very even-handed by showing the Japanese pilots preparing for the attack and giving some of Japan's reasoning behind the attack.  The little prejudice that is shown should be taken as an accurate portrayal of the times rather than the bias of the filmmakers.  Overall, this movie definitely lives up to the hype.  The epic battle scenes and the moving post-battle scenes are worth the price of admission themselves."

Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett star as Rafe and Danny; boyhood friends caught up in the Japanese bombing of the American port and caught in a love tryst with British nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).<br/><br/>Doesn't sound enough to fill three hours does it?<br/><br/>And the truth is that's where the problem lies. The first half is taken up by stereotypical characters muttering ridiculous clichés and tub-thumping American patriotism. At times it seems so bad you expect John Motson to pop up telling us not to worry because Hollywood pictures are movies of two halves'.<br/><br/>And if he did then he wouldn't be too far from the truth because after the clichés are done and dusted and the dreary Faith Hill led soundtrack has had its moment, we have a fully-fledged hour long plus re-enactment of the bombing.<br/><br/>The CGI effects just about manage to hold together the film. The aircraft are indistinguishable from the real thing and the scenes with the planes skimming over the baseball field and through the valley are spine tinglers with the bomb's eye view' shot through the USS Arizona a visual treat also.<br/><br/>As for the rest though the acting is poor although the wafer thin script doesn't help. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character has no discernible reason for being in the film other than the fact that it makes it slightly longer. The scene with two American pilots (guess who) taking on the entire Japanese attack force above Pearl Harbour is ridiculous and the final 45 minutes simply an unnecessary extra to give us a seemingly worthy ending.<br/><br/>And if that's not enough why on earth is Ben Affleck's character called Rafe'? Does no-one in a Hollywood film have a normal name?<br/><br/>If you managed to haul yourself through Titanic, then this will probably be right up your alley, but the depressing soundtrack, weak script and flag waving we love America' attitude really does push the boundaries of taste.<br/><br/>5/10"

Never has a filmed based on an actual event in our history been so distorted in the presentations of it's facts.  The film seems more interested in a rather awkward love triangle than what most people came to see, the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The characterizations of Doolittle, Halsey, and even FDR are misrepresented and falsehoods abound.  As one who truly believes fiction holds no candle to history, it is stunning to believe that such an interesting event as the bombing of Pearl Harbor can be turned into a bland gargled three hour mess. Beckinsdale after escaping the horrifying acting in a thailand prison looks lost and confused and often uncomfortable.  Affleck needs to spend more time with Kevin Smith to remind himself that when you sign on for a movie, you need to act and not just show up.  Alec Baldwin needs to start watching movies with great actors such as Robert DeNiro to prove that there is no need to completely go over the top when it comes to his performances and that being subtle and diminutive is a gift that actors possess but hey at least he is the most talented of the Baldwin brothers, which isn't saying much. And to our adrenaline pumping combo of Bruckheimer and Bay, you two will never be Cameron and shouldn't aspire to be.  Find yourself an editor or maybe some modesty before you make your next film.  Your direction is not larger than life and shouldn't be.  With the amazing amount of omitted facts you left out it is amazing you had time to dramatize history and write your own.

","What can I say. The trailer for this movie looks so good. The first time I saw it I said,""This is gonna be great."" Then I started to think that sometimes the trailer is better than the movie. Well, that is the case here. I enjoyed the movie when the Pearl Harbor attack happend but I did not enjoy the love story that involved the main characters. Micheal Bay is an excellent director when it comes to action. He is not however a director of human nature or romance. I hate to compare him to James Cameron but James Cameron works on so many different levels of filmaking. He is able to ad artistic quality to his films as well as making a pure action film. Micheal Bay is just a good action director. I don't mean he's bad. I just mean he is good with action and should just stick with it. Don't do love stories. Anyway, See Pearl Harbor for it's action and as a homage to our men who were there. I myself will keep watching the trailer over and over again because to me....it is just so much better."

","Contains spoilers ""Pearl Harbor"" is the story of an awkward love triangle between Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale)and two best friends:Danny(Josh Hartnett)and Rafe(Ben Affleck).Evelyn is courting Rafe but when he volunteers to be a pilot for the British,Danny and Evelyn go to Pearl Harbor.These two are wrongly led to believe that Rafe has died in flight.They are there for each other and when comforting each other they fall in love.Then,most unexpectedly Rafe returns to Pearl Harbor and is shocked to find them together.Throughout the action scenes on the attack the audience are kept on edge,here,the special effects are exceptionally good.Although this film will not teach you much about the attack at Pearl Harbor it is a very enjoyable film yet it has a tragic ending. WATCH OUT FOR THIS AT NEXT YEAR'S OSCARS!"

","Some movies are so bad they're funny. Pearl Harbor isn't one of them: it's so bad it's... interesting. I spent most of this very long film thinking about the various ways in which it was awful. Michael Bay seems to be the Jade Fox of directors - he obviously owns a copy of How To Make A Classic Movie but he's only looked at the pictures, not the text. Films like Armageddon are forgivable because they're just bubblegum, but Pearl Harbor really, really wants to be a sweeping wartime romance (or epic romantic war story, or whatever) in the classic mode and it really, really, *really* isn't. A few things that stand out as particularly dreadful: the hamfisted History 101 newsreels, the RAF guy's awe at just how heroic Ben Affleck is, the perfunctory and staggeringly patronising treatment of Cuba Gooding's character, the whole fourth act (a cruel blow to those of us who had assumed there were only three). Actually the Japanese assault is very well done - the special effects are superb and the whole thing degenerates into an obscene massacre, as presumably it did in real life, but then Bay ruins everything with the tearful music and the slo-mo and the blurry bits and the obligatory dead likeable supporting character and the whole blasted fourth act which is there only because (a) you can't have a movie end with the US on its knees and (b) you can only resolve a Hollywood love triangle by killing one of the protagonists and none of them is dead yet. Did I mention the nauseating patriotism? Maybe if you're American it's okay, but Kate Beckinsale's voiceover at the end is truly horrible."

","Warning: minor spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>Oh dear. What could have been a momentous slice of celluloid given the budgetary considerations has emerged as an entire travesty that is offensive not only to those people who paid to take their seats in a cinema but those who fought and died in this climactic conflict.<br/><br/>To be fair, this film is never a historical account of the attack on Pearl Harbour, in the same way that James Cameron's Titanic was never a blow by blow account of the sinking of the big ship. They are both films dedicated to love triangles set against an epic backdrop. However, on viewing both, it seems that Michael Bay took the most insulting cringeworthy elements of Cameron's blockbuster and ignored some of the genuine moments of invention.<br/><br/>When patrons begin to filter out of the cinema BEFORE the big bangs start going off, you know something is terribly wrong. When patrons are laughing at moments when the sacrifice of sailors and pilots should be appreciated, you know something is terribly wrong. In fact, from the mawkish and awkward prologue, you can feel yourself shrinking into your seat.<br/><br/>The first bone of contention is the clutch of truly dreadful performances. Josh Hartnett is trying so hard to be goofy and endearing but never gets out of first gear, Ben Affleck is almost strangled by his thicker than syrup Southern good ol' boy accent and Kate Beckinsale (trying to replicate Kate Winslet) is all lips pouts and no depth. She is the pivotal axis in the love triangle dynamic and comes across as a  rather cheap and easy minx rather than a passionate woman torn between two ridiculously macho lovers. Tom Sizemore looks frankly embarrassed as the stereotypical chief engineer, Alec Baldwin chews scenery for all he's worth as the stereotypical commander and Cuba Gooding Jr. is cast adrift as a stereotypical put-upon black sailor. In fact, Jon Voigt is perhaps the film's saving grace with a quite exquisite performance as FDR, complete with prosthetic double chin and stately mannerisms. Yet, even he can't hide his awkwardness with some truly atrocious lines fed him by the script.<br/><br/>Ah, the script. Randall Wallace has mighty penance to pay if he's to convince most people that Bravehart wasn't a flash in the pan. Admittedly he tries to be a little creative by staging the attack where you might not expect it (if you're already dead, that is) but this leaves a gaping hole with 75 minutes still remaining. Everything is just so cliched: characters stand and spout sickening platitudes, feelings are rendered entirely superficial and there's so much cheesiness you want to choke. Some of which could have been remedied by director Michael Bay. Except he just makes it worse.<br/><br/>Still not heeding the lessons of Armageddon, Bay resorts to all the same film school ""Ain't that cool, like, wow"" techniques that nearly sunk his space project. The over use of slow-motion (which makes an already overlong film even longer) and his hero-shot framing (check out the pilots walking out in slow-mo for their final mission: an exact copy of Armageddon) detract from any emotional resonance the film aspires to have. It's just all gloss.<br/><br/>Some of Bay directorial flourishes are just plain insulting. Where Rafe and Danny take to the air against the Mitsubishi Zeros, it's a paean to Top Gun which even takes in the ""playing chicken"" scenario. Zeros were far more sturdily built than the American P-40's and did not blow up after taking a few shells in the tail piece. Similarly, a Zero would not be blown to pieces by small arms fire from 6 men in an aircraft tower (you know the scene I'm talking about: if not, you're lucky). <br/><br/>The depiction of any race other than Americans is plain infuriating. I saw the film with several Japanese people, keen to see the version over here which will differ from the print sent to their country. However, it's difficult to see how the Japanese will not be offended by any version of this tripe. Planning meeting were not conducted outside with plastic battleships in paddling pools. Pilots were not ordered on kamikaze missions at Pearl Harbour which renders the entire Japanese pre-flight sequence historically inaccurate. And the subtitles are far removed from what the characters are actually saying. Poor Mako and Cary-Hiroyuki Togawa, two fine Japanese actors who are abused in this way. The British are unjustly belittled too. Only one British character is present and, as an RAF officer, the script compells him to thank the American volunteer for single-handedly saving the British homeland in the Battle of Britain. (BTW, no one ever referred to that particular conflict as that in 1941, only from 1943.) And of course, the only comic relief has to be found in someone who has a stammer<br/><br/>Homages to other films are so palpable it's sickening. The build-up (Titanic), attack (Tora! Tora! Tora!), American response (Top Gun) and end sequence (the godawful BAT-21) are so shamelessly ripped-off you'd think there would be lawsuits flying around for defamation.<br/><br/>However, one of Bay's directorial motifs remains. Action scenes are shot with so much camera shake and so ruthlessly edited as to make them unwatchable. Follow the Bad Boys to The Rock to Armageddon to here and you'll know what I mean. This renders the scenes in the hospital quite painful as one can only see the director's artifice instead of bringing home the suffering of the wounded and dying.<br/><br/>All in all, I beg you not to see this movie and give Jerry Bruckheimer any more money to keep making drivel like this. I despise this film not merely for its faults but for its pan-Americanism which leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth."

","There are some mesmerizing scenes in this movie, such as when two boyscouts taking care of their natural needs spy the fleet of zeros gliding grimly by or when a band of nurses in their haste to save their patients lives cut their slings and let their damaged limbs just fall and crash painfully down...

This seems to show the human element involved on that ""Day of Infamy"" artistically and poignantly, whereas the thin layer of the Titanic Love Story Redeux (only this time, the two men are friends!!) stands apart as a shallow and transparent farce in contrast.  And our two mavericks, Ben and Josh, hooping and hollering while the survivors below cheer them on do little to inspire any reverence for the real battle of that day, the battle of sheer survival. I was hoping we'd see the frantic rescue of a few of the crewmen in the USS Arizona's tower, but apparently there was not that kind of time to spare in this three hour, sprawling decadance.  And why not spend a little more time on the Arizona's sinking.  These men who still breathed for several hours before their ship became their tomb are never even really seen.  As for the workings of the love triangle,Ben Affleck's character, if he survived in occupied France thanks to the kindness of strangers, could have relied on them to post a coded letter or two, methinks."

","Pearl Harbor is a film that I wouldn't even subject to my worst enemy as a form of revenge(I have never been a proponent of cruel and unusual punishment). Hmm, where do I begin............ah yes: The dialogue was laughably trite, the cast overacted with the zeal usually expected only from an impersonator of William Shatner, the love plot was truly pointless (another sickening attempt by Jerry Bruckheimer to trick less informed moviegoers into thinking that it is not only an action film, but a good romance as well), and the plot was filled with inexcusable historical inaccuracies (it is beyond my comprehension as to how the part where FDR walks could survive on the cutting room floor, seeing as to the fact that he had been crippled by polio for the previous 25 years). It is a truly sad thing when film is cheapened as an art form. It is a travesty when filmmakers knowingly release garbage targeted towards the less educated portion of population, allowing normally insufficient acting to be overshadowed by BIG EXPLOSIONS. SO WHAT. I must admit, the attack scenes of the film were truly impressive from an visceral and technical standpoint. SUCH A SHAME THAT I HAD TO BE SUBJECTED TO SUCH TRIPE FOR THE PREVIOUS HOUR, AS WELL AS THE HOUR AFTERWARDS. Also, is it just me, or is it hard to believe that 90 percent of soldiers and almost all nurses are truly attractive people (If only that were how it is in real life, but it isn't). Another blunder is the complete and utter dearth of hawaiian natives in Pearl Harbor. In fact, I don't remember seeing one. However, it seems foolish to draw attention to such miniscule details when nearly every other part of this film is greatly flawed.<br/><br/>In summation, good films are hard to find and therefore, attention should be payed to them, instead of to films like this one. Memento is a far superior film, in a perfect world people would choose to see that instead of this. Unfortunately, this film is destined to manipulate millions of mindless viewers, and I am sure that I will get angry responses by a few of them for this review. But if the truth illustrated in this review reaches even one filmgoer, then I feel that I have not written in vain."

","After reading all the excoriating reviews, I did not have high hopes for ""Pearl Harbor"", Michael Bay's epic-romantic restaging of the battle that brought America into World War II.  I was expecting corn, bathos, high-gloss trash.  And I got all of that, except for the trash part.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised by how much this picture held my interest and engaged my emotions.  <br/><br/>Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are two young hotshot flyboys for the U.S. Marines.  At the dawn of the war, they are living the would-be hero's life; while the Brits slug it out with the Nazis, the American army sits happily idle.  Rafe is sent overseas to join an elite American-British unit, and while he's facing peril in the air, Danny is becoming maybe too close to Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), Rafe's WAC lover.  The two friends are on a collision course...but just as things are coming to a head, Japanese zeroes buzz into the Hawaiian sky and begin raining death down on Pearl Harbor.  All differences must be put aside, personal slights forgotten. It's all about America now, and a huge mission is mounted to show Japan that the U.S. is not about to go gently into that good night.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is three hours long, and does drag at certain key junctures, but the thing that surprised me was how completely engaging the first hour of the picture was.  I was expecting to spend the entire romantic prelude to the battle twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the bombs to drop.  Instead, I found myself really caring for these young people and anxious to see how things would turn out for them.  I give full credit for this to Affleck, Beckinsale, and Hartnett, who deliver honest, straightforward, unpretentious performances, the kind of serve-the-story acting that makes a film like this work.  <br/><br/>Once the attack on the harbor begins, however, this becomes Michael Bay's picture, and he gives us some of the most impressive battle sequences I've seen in a while.  Naturally, an air battle is a different beast than the frenzied ground combat of ""Saving Private Ryan"", just as Bay is a different animal than Spielberg.  ""Pearl Harbor""'s war scenes are polished, much prettier than ""Ryan"".  Still, the violence hits you like a punch in the gut; even with the PG-13 rating, Bay does not seem to be holding back.  The special effects are some of the best I've seen, surpassing ""Titanic"" in their realism and scope.  The sound is appropriately devastating, and John Schwartzman outdoes himself with his grand, sweeping cinematography (marred only by the ugly soft-focus images he uses in the hospital-aftermath sequences).<br/><br/>The film does begin to drag somewhat in its final hour, as a stentorian commander (Alec Baldwin) prepares to lead his men on a retaliatory strike on Japan.  I knew the film had some problems when I figured out how it was going to end, learned I was wrong...and thought my ending was better, more dramatically satisfying.  Still, the film does send you out on a proud-to-be-an-American note, and for a Memorial Day weekend release, I assume that's what they were going for.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is by no means a classic.  Indeed, it seems that everything I really liked about the film was countered by something that stuck in my craw.  Jon Voight does wonderful work as FDR...that is almost sabotaged by silly-putty makeup.  The inclusion of the character of Dorrie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black ship's cook who finally got a chance to fight for his country during the attack, was a nice one...but marred by Wallace's blatantly foreshadowing dialogue.  It's  a tricky film in that regard.  You want to love it unconditionally, but the discerning viewer in you keeps holding you back.<br/><br/>Still, unlike many critics, I feel that the good here largely outweighs the bad.  ""Pearl Harbor"" may not be a spot-on retelling of history, but it gives enough of the facts that I believe many kids will be encouraged to seek out books and films that can give them the REAL story.  I think that Michael Bay would be quite proud of that.  I think it's something to be proud of, too."

It was very well made and the the actors did a great job playing their part, plus some of them were pretty cute(Josh Hartnett).

","I have just returned from seeing Pearl Harbor, and as an 'indie' filmmaker, I feel that I am qualified to critique this film from a director's point of view.  The film critics who have bashed this movie are way over the top with their criticisms.  Yes, Randall Wallace's script has more romantic cliches than a Doris Day film festival; and yes, the love story took away from what should have been more focus on Japanese preparation before the actual sneak attack; and yes, the film could have been cut down to two hours and fifteen minutes and still have been very good; but I was not offended by the sometimes dumb dialogue.  The corny lines were not as numerous as I had expected.  Making a film like Pearl Harbor in the manner that Michael Bay did can take the life and breath out of anyone who is a director.  I am sure he had plenty of help.  For that reason, I was very impressed by the look of the film.  From a cinemagraphic point of view, it was beautiful.  The battle scenes were first-rate.  For the men and women who actually went through the attack on Pearl Harbor, I applaud them for their courage of enduring that horror.  I was very impressed with the special effects.  I look for flaws in CGI's and could hardly find any.<br/><br/>   Two actors in the film who went unheralded during the pre-movie hype should be commended for their superb performances.  Jon Voight played FDR so well, it was scary.  His short screen time made a huge impact.  The very reliable Mako, a veteran actor, did a great job as the 'hard-as-steel' Admiral Yamamoto.  Though Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett gave satisfactory performances, if they had more realistic lines to say during the love triangle scenes, their performances would have been more credible.  I understand why Randall Wallace wanted the Cuba Gooding, Jr. character in the film, but it easily could have been taken out, and it would have not affected the story.  For that matter, the love story could have been taken out and replaced by the real story of sailors trapped in a ship underwater for weeks after the attack, perishing around Christmas.  That would have made the movie more credible, then it might be worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Picture at the 2002 Academy Awards.  As it is, it will clean up the technical awards come Oscar time.<br/><br/>   Pearl Harbor is a film that accomplishes one thing - it entertains. Could it have been better?  Sure.  But most people do not have a clue the amount of heart and soul that goes into making a Hollywood epic.  Despite the script, the man power and creativity by the people who are 'above-the-line' makes this movie worth seeing.  I guarantee you, no matter what your opinion of this film is or will be, Pearl Harbor will not be forgotten for a long time to come."

The ship-sinking scenes reeked of ""Titanic,"" and the scenes of nurses and corpsman trying to stop patients from bleeding were poor imitations of ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Not to mention the depiction of the Japanese war planners, which made them appear to be the Hollywood stereotypical ""mysterious oriental"", straight out of ""Tora Tora Tora"" and other such films.

Can't anybody make a steady shot these days?

","It was okay. It had its moments, but there is infinite room for improvement. To begin with (spoilers ahead), the title seems to indicate that the attack on Pearl Harbour is the focus of the movie. Then you go to see it, and apparently the movie can't decide if its focus is the attack or the love triangle between the main characters. This would have been a much better movie if it had just one plot instead of three. It spends an hour and a half giving you the love triangle in spades, with the occasional (VERY occasional--often less than two-minute) visits to Japan. Then it spends an hour on the attack, which is the most well-done part of the movie, as it ought to be. Then the last half hour depicts the planning and execution of the Doolittle Raid. But it constantly cuts back to that love triangle, often annoyingly so. It's like the movie is saying, ""Okay, let's watch the Japanese plan their attack. Oh, there's our lovebirds! This is more interesting. Let's watch this for a while.""<br/><br/>There were a lot more possibilities. They could have had, say, two sailors on the Arizona, and intertwined their personal lives with the possibility of a sneak attack. That would have given the film some continuity at least, and some great drama could have come of the loss of almost 1,200 shipmates on the Arizona. And they could have done a lot more with Cuba Gooding Jr.! He's a marvelous actor, and it's a shame he had such a small part.<br/><br/>Oh, and don't even get me started on the modern warships that inundate this film. Spruance-class destroyers and Nimitz-class aircraft carriers in 1941? I Don't Think So. Try not to notice the steam catapults on the flight deck when Doolittle takes off from the Hornet, willya? I'd like to think that in every historical film, there's a different point of view that can explain how accurate or inaccurate it seems. No such point of view exists in this case.<br/><br/>But, as I say, the movie does have its moments. The effects are great, and the depiction of the true grit of war is the best since ""Saving Private Ryan."" As I watched men being blown all over the harbour, I thought, ""I really don't need to see this."" But then I said to myself, ""Self, you're just watching this in a movie theater. How do you think it felt for the guys who were ACTUALLY THERE?"" And for perhaps the first time in film history, we see the real heroism of the medical corps, something that I've never seen treated in detail.

","Every summer, we expect one of the awaited blockbusters to be a turkey. Be it The Avengers of M:I-2, it helps maintain the balance. However, with Pearl Harbor something has gone seriously wrong.<br/><br/>The opening sequences are a reasonably engaging mix of humour and romance, but it soon becomes clear that director Bay is quite content with the sheer shallowness of his leading characters to build his action framework over them. Big mistake. The total lack of sympathy that Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett evoke means that you really don't care if any of them get blown to bits.<br/><br/>These are all reasonably standard summer blockbuster mistakes. In the characterisation department it always appears that the scriptwriter has been out making the tea. But what really grates is its sheer, irritating patriotism. The Americans are seen as a saintly race who it seems were attacked totally out of the blue by the Japanese, who according to the film are just plain evil. Every time we see them, the sinister movie pipes up and we see them rubbing their hands together with glee as they plot the attack. It is truly insulting. The rest of the film is unceasing flag-waving and propaganda, with the basic message that the war was won solely because of the Americans. And that whole, trivial Nuclear Holocaust thingy is not-so subtly deleted from the narrative, in order to ensure that the Americans come out looking like the good guys and the sole saviours of the free world. It is quite frankly laughable.<br/><br/>The effects are the thing, of course, and for a moment you actually believe that you haven't wasted your ticket fare. But even that becomes very samey after a while and you realise that you have been sat there for one and a half hours, your left buttock is about to drop off, and you're still only halfway through."

I'll be stunned if someone other than Michael Bay, in the next 9 1/2 years, creates a more grossly unbelievable, cliched, distorted, mutilitated, butchered piece of...well, you get the idea. Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer(sp?) have succeeded at one thing: they have trivialized perhaps the most important pereptia of the century. They have surrendered millions of dollars to create the most racially stereotypical, the most irrevocably inaccurate, the most disgusting biased piece of trash I have yet to spend $8.50 on. What saddens me more than having seen this, this, this sacrilege, is to see that this film(if you can call it that) has garnered a vote higher than 3.0 on IMDB. I just do not understand how movies of this undeniably horrid level of quality can be made anymore in America. We haven't evolved a bit, have we? In times like this, the stupidity of the American public really comes to light. And if you can't resist the hype, if you can't possibly stop yourself from seeing Pearl Harbor, remind yourself repeatedly through the film: this is NOT what film-making is! This is NOT art! This is capitalism. This is commercialism. This is Hollywood."

","Really, to be totally fair, I should see this movie again, taking a notepad with me so I can note all that's wrong with it.  But as it stands, maybe I'll be able to stay under the 1,000 word limit.<br/><br/>I suppose if you had no idea what Pearl Harbor and World War II were all about and weren't aware of the mediocre at best talent of Michael Bay,, and you like silly love stories, you might think this movie is pretty good.  I guess I don't inherently have a problem with setting a silly love story against the backdrop of such a serious topic.  Even after seeing the movie, I still don't really have a big problem with it.  Even some ""classic"" Pearl Harbor films include silly love stories (From Here to Eternity, In Harms Way).  The problem with this one is that it's so BADLY written.  Randall Wallace and Bay should be ashamed of themselves.  The kind of simple, silly and chemistry-free dialogue written between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsdale is the kind you'll find in classic films of the 40's.  It was effective then, but it doesn't work today, not even in a period piece. The dialogue written for the love story in Titanic ain't Shakespeare, but for the most part, you're not sitting there groaning every time one of the characters opens their mouth like you are in this film. <br/><br/>
I'm no expert on World War II and Pearl Harbor, far from it.  However, I have seen many classic and current films on the subject, and have a friend who IS an expert, so I think I know my fair share.  Of course Bay is going to take liberties in making his film, every filmmaker does.  Apparently, the Japanese fighter planes were not the same color in the movie as they were in real life.  Things like that aren't going to bother me so much, but when only two planes were able to get off the ground during the actual assault, and those two planes are piloted by our Heroes in Pearl Harbor, that bothers me.  It bothers me that Bay has his Japanese fighter planes flying over a baseball game that's going on at 8 in the morning because he thinks it's a good looking shot.  I'm sure there are plenty of other glaring liberties taken by Bay in this film, but I'll leave them to the experts to point out.<br/><br/>However, I do have one more fact related complaint about the film, that being Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character.  Here we have, without a doubt, one of the most worthless characters in film history.  Before I saw the movie, I thought that the character was just going to be a token black character added to make the film appeal to a broader demographic.  I figured, since black men were pretty much limited to the kitchen on Naval ships in those days, that the character we see on the machine gun torrents in the trailers is fictional.  Well, here's a news flash, he was a REAL person, we find out at the end, who received an award for his ""brave"" service!  I certainly hope that Cuba had more scenes that were left on the cutting room floor for some reason, because if he agreed to do this silly, insignificant part in the film based on what I saw of him, I'm really disappointed.  What an embarrassment to Gooding and his entire race.  Bay should be ashamed for the way this REAL character is handled in the film (all three minutes of his screen time).<br/><br/>Everyone likes to get emotionally involved in a film, and I'm no different. I'll admit, I found the trailer moving.  I thought for sure I'd at least get a little weepy-eyed at some point of Pearl Harbor.  As it turns out, Bay fails again.  This film has instantly made my ""Top Five Most Manipulative Films"" list.  It's embarrassing the length that Bay goes to, especially at the end, to try to get you to cry.  A film like Saving Private Ryan can move you just by it's sheer horror and the nonverbal acting of it's characters. Wallace and Bay just POUR it on, though, in this film to the point where you're drowning.  SPOILER AHEAD SPOILER AHEAD<br/><br/>The manner in which Josh Hartnett's character dies is really badly written. It almost seems like they thought that Hartnett's plane going down wasn't heroic enough.  He had to save his best buddy one more time after a VERY awkward confrontation with a Japanese patrol on the China coast in order to cement his status as a hero.  Again, this is just bay trying to POUR on the sentimentality.  Someone should have told him that the EVENTS THAT ACTUALLY TRANSPIRED between 12/41 and 4/42 provide more than enough sentiment by themselves.  END SPOILER<br/><br/>I didn't hate this movie.  At the very least, my interest in the subject is higher than it's ever been, and I'm sure that the film will inspire a wave of new found interest in the subject by a new generation.  So Bay does deserve some credit for that, but not too much.  A better film about Pearl Harbor would have raised awareness, too.  I'm just really disappointed that they took such a great and important subject and turned up with these results.  I thought the actors, for the most part, did the best they could with the script.  Alec Baldwin, in particular, was quite good as Dolittle. Some of his really silly lines will ultimately be memorable because he did such a good job of delivering them.  The bombing of Pearl Harbor was, of course, the best part of the film, though it went on too long.  Someone needed to tell Bay that just because the sinking of the Titanic lasted 45 minutes (screen time) doesn't mean that the bombing of Pearl Harbor had to last that long.<br/><br/>Bay's biggest problem is that he's just no good at telling stories. Everytime I thought I was going to be moved, he cut.  Every time he had a good idea or scene or camera angle going, he cut.  Then, he sticks with scenes and ideas that go nowhere (like the train scene near the beginning). Who cares?<br/><br/>A lot of the problems I have with a film can be overlooked if it's a silly, fun film like The Mummy Returns.  That crew is allowed to defy the laws of physics and reality in general, because it's a fantasy film.  I grant the makers of Pearl Harbor no such leeway.  No matter how entertaining some parts of it may have been, I can't overlook the glaring problems that a film about such a serious topic is so bogged with.<br/><br/>Grade:  C-"

","""Pearl Harbor"" baffles me.  Some of the performances were very good, while others were bordering on simply bad.  The film itself was beautiful, yet the lines were hard to stomach, to say the least.  But this is the most baffling part of all: given all its faults, ""Pearl Harbor"" is addictive.  I've seen it twice and I want to again.<br/><br/>Here's a brief synopsis of the great performances: Josh Harnett, Ben Affleck, Tom Sizemore, Kate Beckinsale, and Ewen Bremmer.  Josh was not only adorable, but he good enough to not let the lines drag down his performance, with the exception of ""I think World War Two just started"".  Ben Affleck was good because he wasn't made out to be perfect.  The scene where he busts his nose twice in one day was a very well played out scene.  Tom Sizemore actually has a hand up in this category because I consider him the definitive actor when it comes to war movies, especially WWII.  Kate Beckinsale was so beautiful and so poingnant that she it could arguably be said that she's a candidate for the new leading lady of Hollywood. Finally, Ewwn Bremmer.  Honestly, I had not seen him before this movie, but he was just so charming.  The scene where he's struggling to say ""The Japs are here"" was so painfully ironic that I gotta give him props.<br/><br/>
I'm too nice to mention names, but if you're smart you'll realize that those who didn't make the great list weren't so great, and that includes some big names.<br/><br/>Basically, if you pay attention to statistics, this movie is not so good.

","Warning: Contains some minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I expected this movie to be worth seeing and waited for it since the first trailers were shown nearly year ago. It was a major disappointment and made me leave the cinema in annoyance.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie (until the attack starts) is a very good romance. It reminds me of Casablanca (No blasphemy intended), a story of young men and women, and how their lives are affected and turned and destroyed by the war.<br/><br/>The second part (the attack on Pearl Harbor) is a very good anti-war-movie. It shows the absolut horror of war, i.e. the anonymous dying of people in sinking ships or gunfire without the least chance, the organized killing and destruction of live. You are left with two thoughts in mind: ""Poor B*****ds "" & ""Dear god, do not ever let this happen again"". And this is the purpose of movies about war.<br/><br/>The rest is TRASH. It is PATHETIC and mostly A LIE.<br/><br/>Again, Hollywood uses and turns history just as they want to and just as the box-office needs it, just as in ""The Patriot"" and ""U 571"". You may say, ""Hey it's just a movie"", but the Problem is, Pearl Harbor is not ""just a movie"". It is History. And even more, it is an important point in history to which some respect is in order.<br/><br/>
None of the historic indications and evidence about the knowledge of the american government (read the history factbooks) about the attack at pearl was brought up. (Has anybody wondered why the most valuable aircraft carriers weren't at Pearl?)<br/><br/>Of course, Ben Affleck saves England from the German bombers (unregarding the fact that only SEVEN american Pilots were flying over England and that in 1941 the battle over London was already won [mostly by british pilots, yup]) then cuts down a couple of Japanese over Pearl and later follows Doolittle over Tokyo (unregarding the fact that those missions were flown by pilots of different parts of the american forces, navy and army)<br/><br/>When FDR struggles himself out of the wheelchair to show his generals that nothing is impossible it is laughable pathetic and the majority of the audience (those who had not left the cinema by now) enjoyed the sight with a belly-laugh.<br/><br/>And one last point: Wars aren't fought by steel-hearted heroes following fearless leaders. They are fought by frightened young men who are fighting for their lives because they have no other choice."

","This movie turned to seriousness of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor into one big joke.  The movie wasn't about Pearl Harbor at all, it was a dopey, cliche love story SET IN Pearl Harbor.  I was expecting to see a gripping war story and instead saw a three hour melodrama with a very expensive fireworks display thrown in.  I did enjoy watching the special effects, but that alone can't make a movie good.<br/><br/>I think that the standard for the current generation of WWII movies should definitely be ""Saving Private Ryan.""  That was an excellent movie.  The opening sequence was unbelievable, and it set the tone for the entire film. They didn't taint the storyline by throwing in a stupid love plot to sell tickets to 16 year olds, this movie was deadly serious.  Then came ""Enemy at the Gates.""  Not bad, unfortunately there was a love sub plot, but it was just that, a sub plot.  Then comes Pearl Harbor, where the (factual) battle is the sub-plot, and the true focus is this absolutely dopey (fictitious) love story.<br/><br/>SORT-OF SPOILER ahead, but it was shown in the trailer on tv:<br/><br/>Like I said, I did like the battle sequence, but even that got silly fast. First off, I expected more from Cuba Gooding Jr's role.  His role was basically a cameo, an afterthought.  All he did was appear for about five minutes, just enough to gain the audience's approval,  and then assume the role of hero as he shoots a plane down from his sinking ship.  He was there for the sole purpose of putting him in the trailers to sell more tickets.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD:<br/><br/>Secondly, they had to portray Ben Affleck and his best friend as superheroes, the only two pilots who could cause any damage at all to the Japanese.  They make it to a nearby airfield, and there's only a few planes that are ready to fly, how 'bout that?  It gets better.  Then, the first guy (a nameless pilot) gets into a plane, tries to take off, and gets shot to pieces on his takeoff roll.  Of course!  We can't have some schmoe cramping Ben Affleck's style, right?  Next, our heroes mount their steeds, and wow! They made it off the ground to fight the Zeroes!  Then the Japanese pilots instantly go brain dead, and Ben and company start picking them off as if they were shooting at hang gliders.  And then it gets even better!  Ben and his friend each have three zeroes on their tail, and they can't shake them! Oh no!  So what do they do?  They pull the same whacky hi-jinx that they did at the beginning of the film, and play chicken!  Ben and his friend come barreling toward each other, all the while the enemy fighters are courteous enough not to fire a single shot at them, and at the last possible second, our heroes turn away from each other and the zeroes are all destroyed in a massive midair pile-up!  At this point, I literally covered my mouth and began to laugh uncontrollably.  It was contagious, as my girlfriend saw me and she, too started to laugh.  That dogfight scene was so silly, I was beside myself.  If that film had even the slightest shred of seriousness in it, at that point it went down in flames along with the six zeroes that crashed into each other.  The only thing I could think of was, ""C'mon Luke, it'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back at home!"" (a ""Star Wars"" quote for those of you who don't recognize it)<br/><br/>OK, YOU CAN LOOK AGAIN, END OF SPOILERS.<br/><br/>So to sum up, I'd say rent the film on video or DVD, fast-forward till the battle scene, watch that part, and return it.  This movie made a mockery of Pearl Harbor, it used that terrible attack as nothing more than a backdrop for a ridiculous love story and an excuse to spend millions of dollars on special effects.  If you want to see the REAL Pearl Harbor movie, it's at most video stores.  It's called, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"""

","Pearl Harbor.  The Day that Will Live in Infamy.  The movie that would live in infamy, I hoped.<br/><br/>So much for that one.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is really two movies in one- the attack that took place on December 7, 1941, and a love story.  Most everyone knows the basic story of the first plot: the Japanese made a surprise attack on a U.S. naval base in Hawaii, thus drawing America into World War II.  At least, that's the simplistic version.  Sadly enough, most everyone knows the basic story of the second plot as well, as it is a giant, mind-numbing cliché.<br/><br/>But beneath the explosions and the tragedy and the boredom, there is something else.  Pearl Harbor is not just a cinematic disappointment, but a demonstration of just how little thought can go into plot when all of the effort is directed at special effects.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor was not without its strengths.  The most notable, of course, is the action footage during the attack.  The visual effects are stunning, and on a technical level, this film deserved the hype it was given.  The scenes taking place directly after the attack are poignant and extremely effective. Director Michael Bay and writer Randall Wallace produced some very powerful images here, and these images conveyed the despair and tragedy of the attack.<br/><br/>The acting was also very good, although the characters were so lacking in development there wasn't much the actors could do with them.  Ben Affleck was forced to fall back on a variation of his character in Armageddon, but it's a character he plays well, so there is little to complain about if you like Ben Affleck.   Josh Hartnett fares somewhat better, if only because he has few expectations to live up to (although, based on his performance in this and  The Virgin Suicides, I think he is a fine actor.)  Kate Beckinsdale does a good job playing an extremely poorly written role, but she's given very little to do besides look gorgeous.  The supporting cast holds their own nicely as well, particularly Jon Voight as Roosevelt.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted in his minor role as Dorie Miller, not because of the size of the role but the awkward way it was worked into the story.   But the cast can act.  Shame they don't have more to work with.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the weakest point of Pearl Harbor was the writing.  The love story was predictable, cliched, and filled with tacky dialogue.   I knew the ending the minute I saw the main characters- not a good sign.<br/><br/>Then there is the believability factor.  The Rafe-Evelyn romance is given nearly an hour of the movie.  Danny and Evelyn have less than five minutes of screen time as a couple (and not talking about Rafe).  Five minutes.  I am not joking- I timed it.  This makes any following aspects of the love triangle much less believable.<br/><br/>The side plot of Dorie Miller was frustrating as well.  So much potential there a man denied his dream for three years finally gets what he was asking for, and probably would do anything to return it.  Instead, it's reduced to almost a token plot, as if the writer and director felt that this was something that was politically correct to acknowledge.  Sadly, Pearl Harbor might have been better off without it- or focusing far more attention on it.<br/><br/>Lastly, Pearl Harbor could have easily been shorter.  Three hours and three minutes, and I looked at my watch at least three times.  There was a lot that could have been edited out, and the movie would have fared better for it.<br/><br/>The Ugly<br/><br/>Believability, bad writing these things are annoying, but Pearl Harbor would not have struck such a deep chord with me if these were its only two flaws.  Like Titanic, I could have dismissed it easily, without any real sense of lingering disappointment and anger.  But there are two crucial errors that fatally damage Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>The first is historical accuracy.  Pearl Harbor is touted as a movie about, well, Pearl Harbor.  The attack is fairly well documented.  And yes, two pilots did get into the air and meet the Japanese that way.  And yes, it was only two.  An incredible achievement.  However, their names were not Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker.  This story does more than portray history inaccurately- it takes the achievement and bravery of the pilots who did fly at Pearl Harbor and expropriates it for two fictional characters.  And the fact that Rafe and Danny made it into the air does nothing to improve the movie except to give Michael Bay more chances to blow things up.<br/><br/>The second error is the character of Evelyn.  Evelyn is far more than the writers allowed us to think she is- and what she is is not complementary. She is presented as God's gift- sweet, beautiful, kind, responsible- but in truth she is manipulative and thoughtless, and very self-centered.  An interesting dilemma if Randall Wallace had chosen to acknowledge what he had created.<br/><br/>All in all, Pearl Harbor is not a total loss, but certainly not a winner. What's frustrating is that it could have been so much more.  I'd give it 5 out 10."

","Possible plot points below.<br/><br/>**Before I begin, I'd like to address a comment made by Jason Zepp, of Ft. Wayne, IN., in his May 25th commentary.  Jason, we were NOT at war with the Japanese when they attacked Pearl Harbor.  We were, up until the day before the attack, involved in negotiations with them to form a ""peace alliance"" in case we had to go to war against Germany.  Therefore, we had NOT declared war on them and they had NOT declared war on us.  That being the case, I would argue that strafing the unarmed men floating in the water was a cowardly act, and not excusable as a ""reality of war.""**<br/><br/>     This movie was terrible.  Don't get me wrong, the CGI people should get well-deserved pats-on-the-back, but man were their efforts wasted.  I've seen too many comparisons between this ""movie"" and the film, Titanic.  I suppose I can see why one might want to try to do that, prior to seeing this dreck, but not after.  There is no comparison...other than, perhaps, the date of their respective opening weekends.  The love story that, I suppose, is to draw us into the movie is so transparent, it's laughable.  The filmakers forgot the most important rule in using a love story to draw the audience into the disaster/tragedy/war/etc.  That rule states that the characters you have spent the last 100 minutes getting to know (although they didn't even get that part right) MUST BE PRESENT AT THE DISASTER/TRAGEDY/WAR/ETC.!!!!!!!!!  Jack and Rose were ON THE SHIP.  William Wallace was AT THE BATTLE OF STERLING.  Tom Hanks's character was PART OF THE NORMANDY LANDING FORCE.  Harrison Ford was ON AIR FORCE ONE.  I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get the point.  Too bad Bruckheimer and Bay did not.  That being said, I repeat that the special effects were impressive, but the attack itself was totally uncoordinated and choppy.  I recommend skipping this farce and renting ""Tora!  Tora!  Tora!"" instead.<br/><br/>p.s.  My stomach still hurts from all the laughing I did when I heard that they were going to release ""changed"" versions of this movie for its release in Japan and Germany.  Please."

","Wow, just an average summer flick with a great advertising push.  Pearl Harbor never gets off the ground until the action sequences which are impressive.  The attempted love story is poorly written, poorly directed, and filled with cardboard charactors.  The only actors in the movie I liked were Gooding Jr, Baldwin, and Tom Sizemore as the sargent, unfortunatly none of them get to spend much time on screen.  The main charactors are cliche speaking cut-outs that you almost hope will die during the attack if for no other reason than they are so uninteresting.<br/><br/>To really understand the attack from both sides rent Tora, Tora, Tora, if you like special effects check this out.  But summer movie dollars can be spent better elsewhere."

","The script for Pearl Harbor is bad.  Really bad.  The characters' dialogue barely comes close to believable, speaking mostly in cliche and soundbites. The plot is full of every war movie plot device you've probably seen before (since this movie is about a subject that has been covered many times before, that's almost excusable).  The only characters worth caring about were the lame secondary ones, and the love story is totally worthless. <br/><br/>But, as an action movie, ""Pearl Harbor"" delivers breathtaking sequences that will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  The attack on Pearl Harbor itself was quite exciting.  Michael Bay's break-neck directing style works better on these scenes than on the rest of the film. Overall, ""Pearl Harbor"" wasn't a total waste of time (although it could've stood to be an hour shorter).  It was no ""Tora Tora Tora,"" but not too bad a movie."

","Warning: mild spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>First (I truly have to let this out of my chest):<br/><br/>As a non-american viewer, I felt actually insulted (even if I am not japanese) by some parts of this movie. The patriotism clichés (a torn flag floating in the water, the speeches by an englishman telling the north american that the U.S. could take any country in the world with such men, et cetera) are terrible for a summer blockbuster (at least, ID4 acknowledged the campiness in the President's speech). But the truly terrible part is the depiction of the japanese army. Every soldier or higher ranking man is ugly, short, with terrible hair, etc., while the north american soldiers are perfectly dressed, cute, handsome, etc. Still, since Hollywood made this movie, it is only logical that the North Americans must look their best against an ugly, almost deformed enemy. <br/><br/>The real problem I see with this movie is that we are presented with Titanic Redux. Throw in a love story with a nice looking guy and girl, plenty of drama, a love triangle, and you have the teen market cornered. Add lots of bullets, and you will surely get men and boys. Then, historical accuracy, and (maybe) you will get the biggest audience possible. Sadly, this movie bombs almost as hard as the torpedos at Pearl Harbour on that fateful day.<br/><br/>First, the love story. It is too long, too boring, too clichéd. It even has its ""I am the King of the World"" scene (where Danny and the girl go flying). The audience I saw the movie with actually started making noises in protest... and I saw a couple leaving *before* the fighting scenes. They couldn't take it anymore (and neither could I).<br/><br/>The love triangle. So predictable, it was boring. It was never gripping enough as to be an integral part of the plot, anyway.<br/><br/>The war scenes. Simply incredible. Terrific. Awesome. Not quite ""Saving Private Ryan"", but close. Very, very close. Not so gory, not so realistic, but perfectly executed. I can hardly think of anything that could be done to make these precious few minutes better. <br/><br/>Historical accuracy: dunno. I'd have to check on that. Still, with so few references to actual events, it is not a movie you'd go to learn about the facts that made Japan attack the US (at the beginning of the film, it is explained that the fuel embargo was the reason for the attack. It seems a very flimsy reason to attack, but that's what was said).<br/><br/>
So, what to do with this sad piece of film? Well, the war scenes are so good, I had to raise my final rating from 4 to 7 stars. Think about it. But there could be something that would save the movie. Get a good film editor, cut the love scenes (cut some 2 hours, actually), leave the fight scenes, and film the entire drama behind Pearl Harbor. The real things that happened before and after December 7. Make the film shorter by some 45 minutes, and you will have a knockout of a movie.<br/><br/>As it is, oh well. I guess I'll have to wait and see Atlantis, so I can say I watched a great movie this summer."

","I almost didn't go to see this movie.  Reviews have been wishy-washy at best, and Roger Ebert's usually insightful comments raised a laugh but certainly lowered expectations...he gave this film a grim 1 1/2 stars.  I don't think that's fair.<br/><br/>Last night I sat in an almost-full theatre, and for three hours all of the people around me were glued to the screen.  There were some laughs (my husband and I chuckled heartily at the movie cliches and the ""put your hand over your heart"" squeeky-clean patriotism), a few gasps, and more than a few tears.  The young woman sitting next to me was reduced to hiccupy sobs at least four times in the film, and watched the bombing scene with her hand to her mouth.  She was not alone.<br/><br/>This movie is entertaining.  In that sense, it's a good movie.  It's not a great movie.  It will not bring historical enlightenment, it has no surprises or unexpected plot twists, it's not profound, and it follows the Hollywood formula.  I guess some folks expected more than just entertainment from a movie with a super-sized budget, talented actors, and a historic event loaded with potential.  But if you ignore what it COULD be, and look at what it is, you get a decent movie with wide appeal that's certainly worth more than 1 1/2 stars.  <br/><br/>My teenage daughter is going to see it next weekend with her friends, and I'm sure they will all like this film.  (They're too young to have seen ""From Here to Eternity"" or ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" so will miss the obvious--and for some, unfavorable--comparisons.)  I've written to my parents, who live in Hawaii and who don't go to movies much, that they'd like this one and should see it.  That's 3-generations worth of appeal.  It's a great date flick:  The girls can feel all warm and fuzzy over the romance, and the guys will like the action.  It's ""Titanic"" with bombs.<br/><br/>My advice?  Read the wishy-washy reviews, if you want.  Read Roger Ebert's for a laugh, if you want.  But don't be too discouraged.  Don't expect too much, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  I had an enjoyable and entertaining three hours for the cost of a movie ticket, and reckon that's worth a firm thumbs up for a summer blockbuster."

This was a cheezy love story first and foremost with the backdrop of December 7th 1941. Yes, the special effects were excellent but they can not save a bad film. The only really good acting is this effort came from Kate Beckinsale. All the big name stars seemed to be going through the motions and in many cases were totally unbelievable in their roles. A usually steady Alec Baldwin and John Voit were average at best. All that money down the drain. Folks, if you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, see Tora, Tora, Tora. It strives for accuracy and also depicts the Japanese side and what they were thinking at the time. On the other hand, if you like a shallow love story, I suppose Pearl Harbor delivers. Too bad it did not do this tragic event in our history  justice. I can only hope that it helped make young people aware of why they have the freedoms they seem to take for granted today."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Oh come on, Pearl Harbor was never going to comfortably sit next to World War II classics such as A Bridge Too Far or even The Great Escape. Lets look at the facts: Producer, Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay are masters of clichéd, cheesy flicks such as The Rock and Top Gun. Between them, they are responsible for one of the most hilarious films of all time, Armageddon. Whereas we want to believe in Father Christmas, Jerry and Michael actually believe that Bruce Willis can save the world, Ben Affleck can act and that big is always better - face it, Pearl Harbor was doomed from the start.<br/><br/>As America basks in peaceful isolationism, Europe is at war. The faceless, cold and Dr Fumanchu-like Japanese - as Touchstone Pictures would have you believe, are determined to protect their empire against imminent American interventionism at any cost. And so the racial stereotyping ensues. However.<br/><br/>
World War Two plays second fiddle to the Sunset Beach-esque love triangle that slowly and uninspiringly dominates the narrative. Rafe McCrawley (Ben Affleck) falls for military nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), and they couldn't be happier until he volunteers to go to England and help fight the war. Tragedy strikes and Rafe is killed in action (or so we're lead to believe). Evelyn finds comfort in the arms of his best mate Danny (Josh Hartnett) and guess what, they fall hopelessly in love. But here's the best bit, Rafe isn't dead! No surprises there then and so follows the tale of betrayal, love, jealousy and a really crap musical score.<br/><br/>
Oh yes, silly me, I almost forgot to mention that hour in the middle of the film dedicated to dizzying explosions and spectacular ship sinking, courtesy of the 'evil' squadrons of Japanese warplanes launching a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Although this altered the course of world history, it amazingly leaves our three main characters, plus Cuba Gooding Jr (who clearly just popped over from the set of Men Of Honour to ad lib) and some muddy little ship's dawg, totally unscathed, lucky them eh? Unlucky for us though...<br/><br/>The crazy thing about this huge budget flop is that everything is basically slung together in a very choppy fashion, almost as if the editors were so bored and wanted to make lasties at the local. Whilst the visual effects are phenomenal, I'm afraid that I'm of the 'if you've seen one explosion you've seen 'em all' school. And hence for the best part of an hour, I had to sit through Technicolor flames and strung-out ship sinking, lots of extras hanging onto each other for dear life etc and too be honest it all got a bit boring. However, top marks for Affleck and Hartnett taking to the skies in their Hawaiian shirts to wup-some-Japanese-ass, such heroics, so predictable; oh just one more shot of the victory boys and their flapping Hawaiian attire in the propeller wind, puhleeese?<br/><br/>The film is hellish and whilst the Pearl Harbor bombing may be based on fact the romance is purely fiction, yet dominates the entire narrative. Errr logic? Why not call it Love In War or Three Get Friendly In Hawaii? But hey, why spoil a good story with facts.<br/><br/>Major moan of the day, why couldn't the budget include a bribe for the actors to at least look like they remotely like each? Instead, there is a total lack of chemistry all round. It's like watching a movie where the actors clearly don't want to be there or worse still, were utterly mis-cast. Kate Beckinsale is cold and very dull in her role which I couldn't help but think Nicole Kidman could have pulled off and Affleck sucks, as usual. Even John Voight's FDR is cringe worthy and as for Alec 'tubster' Baldwin's aviation legend Jimmy Doolittle, you've got to be having a laugh. Alec would much rather have been munching pies.<br/><br/>The saviour-of-the-movie award goes to Josh Hartnett. Young, bright and talented he steals the show with his tremendous presence and slightly better lines than Affleck. Plus, he's bloody gorgeous! Warning, if you're going to shed a tear, it'll be over this fella.<br/><br/>As a war movie it fails miserably, as a love story it's boring and predictable but as a comedy-laced cheese fest, it rocks! Like Titanic, Pearl Harbor will probably fall victim to its own crapness and hype. It could have been a lot better and when I thought about it rationally, there was probably no money for a decent script writer, so a crap one wrote the entire script on the back of a postage stamp with a felt tip pen, and I reckon my cat could have done it better."

It saps the buildup toward the Japanese attack of any mounting sense of dread, manages to make four love stories unbelievable (including Ben and Josh's -- hey, folks, ""best buddies"" is a love story whether you like it or not), makes the full-on attack pretty tensionless, and insults the first decorated black soldier by pinning it on him while he's still alive.  Jon Voight is pretty good as FDR, I'll say that, but even his makeup in his first scene is bad enough to be pretty distracting (it smooths out later).<br/><br/>My buddies wanted to see it for the action, and we all came away disappointed.  The cinematography is mostly expert, though the decision to use a flawed lens in a key hospital sequence was, well, flawed.

You might contrast the Pearl Harbor attack with the D-Day scene in Saving Private Ryan.  Spielberg effectively recreates the chaos of battle, yet you're able to understand the movement of the characters and the obstacles they must face.  By NOT USING MUSIC to artificially heighten emotions, he created a much more powerful experience.<br/><br/>I don't consider this movie to be about Pearl Harbor in any historical sense; it's a video game with P40s as X-wings, jammed in with force-fed emotionalism."

","Too often, movies predicted to be block-busters end up fizzling. Too often, Hollywood takes a historical event, makes a fictitious film based on it, and ruins both the event and the film. Happily, neither problem occurred with ""Pearl Harbor."" This is a film well worth a theater viewing, and not just for the special effects (which it has in plenty). It's long (about 3 hours), so be prepared, but unlike most long films I have seen, it does not drag. You wouldn't think an event as well known to us as Pearl Harbor would keep you on the edge of your seat, but at least for me, it did. I really felt like I was watching the actual attack on Pearl Harbor during the battle sequence. There are a few slightly graphic, bloody scenes in the hospital during and after the attack that perhaps we could have done without, but there wasn't too much gore -- nothing like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Patriot.""<br/><br/>I found the acting to be reasonably good. Kate Beckinsale has been a favorite of mine since her surprising performance in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" and she did an excellent job in ""Pearl Harbor"" as well. Ben Affleck turned in a good performance also, as did most of the supporting cast. There is of course the typical Hollywood love story in the film, but they managed to do it gracefully enough that it did not seem *too* trite (though it was a bit annoying at times). The directing was outstanding, the script was good, and the music was excellent. ""Pearl Harbor"" won't go down in history as the greatest movie ever made, but it's the best film I've seen so far this year, and it was good enough that I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out -- which means it was good enough to watch several times, since otherwise I would not wish to own it.<br/><br/>My score: 8/10"

","I saw only two hours worth, and by that time, I didn't care how it came out--neither the war nor that sappy romance.  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor (what most people would assume this film is about) was compelling, but all tension and horror was obliterated by the constant cutting away from history, in order to dwell upon that incredibly bad Hardy Boys response by Our Heroes.  <br/><br/>Two touching moments, before I made my escape (I left right after that Date Which Will Live In Infamy):  Cuba Gooding's brief moment with the dying captain of his ship; and the nurses facing the influx of an overwhelming number of casualties.   The former was so unexpected, so brief and had so much humanity in it; and the latter would be a worthy subject for a film of its own, but instead was obscured by artsy ""blurred"" cinematography, to suggest confusion in lieu of dramatizing it."

For those that weren`t there, I recommend reading ""Remembering Pearl Harbor"" edited by Robert S. La Forte and Ronald E. Marcello beforehand if possible. The book is strictly true accounts of those that were there at the time of the attack.  There you will read of the true horror of men dying in boiling seas of oil, their skin and limbs coming off like a boiled chicken, there you will read of the Japanese pilots flying over grinning and waving at the Americans as they killed them. It`s only just a movie and a visually striking movie when it comes to the combat scenes but as history it is unfortunatly probably the only history young people will be exposed to so for that reason alone I recommend it highly. Go see it!

I never bought Affleck as a 40's flier or a romantic for a second, and the special effects were overdone.   They look like they were intended to fit into a video game coming to a store near you.  I doubt any fliers flew down along streets between buildings during the Pearl Harbor attack.

","Well, after 3 hours i could not believe how dismayed I was. Apart from 40 minutes of a great bombing scene I can honestly say the rest was cliche.<br/><br/>By the way, anyone see any similar traits to Top-Gun? Let me list them. 1 - T.G- Maverick did his fly-by the tower and got chewed out by his superior. P.H - same thing happens except the pilots play chicken.<br/><br/>2- Maverick had a signature move by braking his jet and then he uses it in battle and defeats the enemy. Well so to does the ""chicken"" game which gets used.<br/><br/>3 - A character called Goose appears in both movies.<br/><br/>4 - A shallow romance plot (just to appeal to those old romantics out there and serves nothing else)<br/><br/>5 - All the ritualistic hand signal/salute on the aircraft carriers.<br/><br/>
I'll stop there. The romance scenes were over done to death. The old train departing gag with the man inside and female outside parting, for mabye the last time. (I wish it did..pewk)<br/><br/>American patriotism...over done...as if the soldiers swimming in the water would be cheering when they saw their fellow pilots shoot down an enemy zero. I would be swimming for my life with 8-10 warships ablaze and sinking around me and most likely be oblivious to what is happening in the sky. Also no mention of Australia....not a shred..which is very strange because USA did base themselves at Australia as the Japanese firmed their grip after taking Singapore. Again just like ""Saving Private Ryan"" - denies acknowledgement of other countries who also lost thousands of troops. Cliche American flag shot..been there seen that.<br/><br/>And the movie was about Pearl Harbour. It could have finished with the bombing and focussed on the tragedy. But nope the USA had to get revenge in some phoney suicide mission. We all knew how the war ended with Hiroshima and japan signing a treaty why place in that corny other stuff.<br/><br/>Someone told me this movie was like the Titanic...I wish i had listened as I would have skipped it.

The thing that really ticked me off about this film was the predictability of a very standard, cheesy romance. Why did Ben Afflecks character get everything? The girl? The glory? True Danny gave the ultimate sacrifice in the end, but I believe he deserved the girl. Afflecks character was obviously used to gettng everything he ever wanted in life. And if he didn't, his character would sulk or whine about it like a four year old. Or he would give some ridiculous speech on why he should get it or why he deserved it.He and Beckensale's characters fall madly in love with each other the first night being together. Very stupid. Danny was the guy I was rooting for. He had a bad childhood and had a much harder life. Life's not fair it's true, but do films always have to have the same standard romance between the perfect male and perfect female? Danny should have lived and Affleck's character should have stayed dead."

The love story in the beginning switched between sweet and cliche. Parts of the beginning I really liked and other parts I was like ""come on!"" I cannot say I cried and that may be because I couldn't really like any of the people. Danny and Rafe needed more depth. The main problem with the movie was preditabilty. I guessed everything which was going to happen before it did (and I don't mean that Pearl Harbor gets bombed). I think that the movie was actually quite respectful towards the Japanese, and one really sad part of the movie was part of a Japanese soldier's letter to his father. The 40 minutes of the actual bombing was amazing. I sat there in the movie theatre biting my pinky finger off with my eyes glued to the screen. It was really terrible watching so many people die. I often find that I am more interested in the extras than the main players in a film. I was just horrified by how many people died in that one attack. It was truely eye opening.

","Those of you expecting an overlong epic with lots of talk and little action are in for a big surprise.  The critics hated it, lots of comments here have bagged it out severly, but I'm not sure why. I guess if you hate Ben Aflick then sure - You're not gonna like the movie at all. This movie IS Ben Affleck. There sure was a lot more here than seeing Pearl go down. We have a cross to the Battle of Britain, then the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. Honestly, it didn't seem like three hours at all.  The hardest thing when you leave the cinema is trying to figure out why Japan did this in the first place. They had their oil cut off, and pretty well everything else from the U.S. but this did nothing to restore those trade links. The idea of a defensive ring doesn't hold much water. Even if they had taken out the carrier force, the U.S. would have gotten by with a couple from Atlantic Fleet until 1943 when new carriers were completed. The U.S. only committed 20% of their effect to the Pacific from the start - meaning they knew on 12/7/41 that Japan were going down. Oh, and I'd love to see the Box Office stats for this movie in Japan. Do you think anyone will bother seeing their grandparents commit the biggest screw up in history?"

","Admittedly it must be hard for a director to condense a vital historical occurence into three hours, and in a format that will be interesting and appealing to a large audience. Pearl Harbor is visually stunning but the supporting story is a bit contrived. The actual invasion is handled brilliantly. The special effects and direction make it real and painful and painful to watch in some parts. The movie dealt with both sides, Japanese and American, with respect and sensitivity, not casting any ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys.<br/><br/>But the supporting story reminds me of those war and romance movies from the 40's. It lacked substance and reality. The dialogue in some areas was fake and shallow and didn't match up to the grittiness of the invasion scenes. This had a lot of impact on the way I viewed the movie. The acting was a treat and Ben Affleck is always interesting to watch. But I was very impressed with the rest of the cast especially Josh Hartnett. Unfortunately he wasn't given to much of a chance to show off his range but he's worth keeping an eye out for. While it is a watchable movie, it doesn't really provide an underlying statement. I didn't walk away from it that deeply in thought about the futililty of war and the shame of losing so many men. I went into it expecting a patriotic american retelling of the story and that's what I found. It's a good movie but definitely not ""a best ever""."

","Sigh. Yet again, the American blockbuster machine massacres history and entertainment. And yet again it is with the subtlety of  a brick to the head. Every hero shot and `memorable moment' are spelt out explicitly and along with the patriotic speeches, come fast and furious. Pick one of the many and shed a tear. The director apparently doesn't give his audience enough credit to be able to recognize a heroic moment by the action itself. He must resort to trailer-made tricks such as stirring music, slow motion shots and that steely-eyed stone jawed look that suggests the actor is in an arm wrestle instead of a terrifying fight for his life. In our world, not all acts of heroism are in slow-motion and blurred. Sometimes Japanese people (or any given enemy) laugh. Not every sentence a person says is laden with a message/moral. We sometimes discuss the trivial and in doing so, show our humanity. And not every hero has a touching and poignant death scene, expressing their best wishes. (For a stunning contrast, compare these points to something like Saving Private Ryan, or even better, a British movie) On top of this, much of the true drama of that day is merely brushed over, such as the fate of the flight of B-17s and the heroism of the crew of the Nevada in their efforts to save her. The fate of a dog is however a guaranteed heart-jerker.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled, this isn't the fitting tribute to the brave fighters on both sides of the war.

"starlit-sky","2","0","0","17 June 2001"," Where are the Kamikazes?
","Finally, highly awaited and overly promoted Pearl Harbor opened at theaters across the world. like to review this movie 1) on itself and 2) in comparison to Michael Bay's other movie, Armageddon, and I have two major critiques coming out of each review.<br/><br/>1) Firstly, I was so surprised that there was NOT even one scene of a kamikaze diving into a battle ship despite the fact that kamikaze attacks are the most important element of Pearl Harbor story. So why were there NO kamikaze scenes? We all have seen historical movies where the history is told inaccurately due to lack of knowledge or events twisted on purpose but never had I seen a movie where the most important element is disregarded all together with no plausible reason. How can you make a Pearl Harbor movie without Kamikazes?<br/><br/>2) My second critique is based upon the incredible similarities between Pearl Harbor and Armageddon. Here are the ones I have noticed: 1) In both movies, the first hour and 20 minutes is filled with comical incidents and easy-laughter type of jokes. Remember The Armageddon where Bruce Willis' crew was being tested for their space mission? Do you remember the funny incidents that take place during these tests? In Pearl Harbour, it is exactly the same; funny things happen when the pilots are tested for -not for space mission but this time for- war. In both movies, we see that the first half of the story is senseless comedy which somehow spoils the wholeness of the movie to the point of making it look like two separate movies. Some may argue that it is a artistic achievement to combine two parts but I think if they are so separate in nature they should not be combined at all because that makes the whole picture look incongruous. If you are going to make a comedy, you should continue with the same pace and told the story from that point of view. If you are going to make a serious war movie then you should be very careful with the degree of comedy involved. 2) In both movies, a guy is leaving a girl behind for his duty. In fact, it is the same guy, Ben Affleck. He was leaving Liv Tyler behind in Armageddon promising to come back where he does exactly the same in Pearl Harbor. There were romantic scenes before he left for the mission; in Pearl Harbor, again, there is romance all though this time scenes were less sensual. 3) In both movies, there was a aftermath which was filled with tragedy. In Armageddon, Bruce Willis had to stay and sacrifice his own life whereas in Pearl Harbor Ben Affleck's friend gets killed in fight with Japanese and Ben Affleck returns as the sole survivor in both movies.<br/><br/>Briefly, I think Pearl Harbor is suffering from a lack of story. It is simply filled with easy comedy, romance and special effects which are told in such an expected and in such an average way, it takes away the whole excitement. A good movie needs more than that."

However as sperate films in themselves they lack so much.<br/><br/>The love story is not engaging enough. I found myself at the start when the female lead was explaining how she met Affleck I wandering what I had missed. Had I walked in late or something, I was thrown into an already developed relationship and felt lost. The characters in the start of this film get some poor lines to use and the film never sucks you in. I know my girlfreind loved the love story angle just as much as I loved the war scene but she agrees she felt like she was not part of it all. And that is where it fails. The film fails to 'suck us in'. In ""Titanic"" we see the lovers before they meet, when they meet, when they have fun, when they fall apart and then finally then end. In this film we jump straight into when they are having fun, have them fall apart and then the end fails to give us any sence of conclusion. And this goes for three hours!!!!<br/><br/>The war angle too has its problems! For starters the battles near the start are kinda cool but they are woven into a monologue by Affleck about writing to his girl - boring! Everyone needed a release from the intense love angle trying to be portrayed and some aciton was needed. The we get to the Japanese who in relaity were very barbarrack, patriotic people! The Japanese Admiral says towards the end ""I fear all we have done is awoken a sleeping giant"". What a load of tripe, the reality was the Japanese thought they were going to take over all of Asia and America. As for the films justification of why the 3rd wave was not sent against Pearl is also full of it. The reality is so much more complex and believeable. And of course you must cut most of Alecs and Johns speeches so the American ""we are so great"" is no longer there. However the actually bombing was awesome! I could feel the tingle in my throat as the planes flew in! This was what made the movie and made it bearable to watch!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>So all in all what is it? two hours of an uninteresting, unengaging soppy love story mixed with just over an hour of historically inacurate, Americanised war scenes. But it is all saved by one thing, the bombing of Pearl Harbour itself. This is proof you can save any film by bombing the absolute heck out of something"

"Kirasjeri","1","0","0","26 May 2001"," DISNEY'S PC WHITEWASH OF HISTORY - U.S. STARTED the WAR!
","""Pearl Harbor"" has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a cloying love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago, and thirty minutes of combat scenes. Beyond that, we get History so whitewashed by Disney it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two. It is not a terrible movie, but it is big disappointment, and sure to anger veterans for its PC ""history"".<br/><br/>In 1970, the excellent Pearl Harbor film, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", did not have the benefit of digital special effects. ""Pearl Harbor"" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. <br/><br/>Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, whitewashing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.<br/><br/>We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did ""Pearl Harbor"" ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.<br/><br/>To Disney, there was no need to ""offend"" the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from ""Pearl Harbor"".<br/><br/>Historical events are treated oddly. Sometimes very accurately, sometimes distorted, sometimes fictionalized. An example is the Doolittle raid. Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent bombing of Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of the planes was named ""The Ruptured Duck"" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"". As the B-25's bombed Japan captured Americans, and Filipinos, were being subjected to Japanese atrocities and murders. Ignored by Disney, of course.<br/><br/>The acting is no more than adequate given the script limitations.<br/><br/>
We have a banal romance mixed together with whitewashed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make ""Pearl Harbor"" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts. Hopefully though, the film will introduce World War II to the masses so ignorant of History thanks to public education failures."

","*Possible Spoiler* I saw Pearl Harbor this weekend and I have to say that it is an excellent film in every aspect of the word, the beginnging could easily have been made to feel like something to stop the film opening with the battle sequence but it doesn't. The start of the film, the first hour-hour and a half all go into building up the characters so that we care and feel for them later on in the film. The build up to the attack which runs in small segments are moody and give an impression of the sheer scale of the actual attack and how much stock Japan put into it. The attack it's self is a piece of movie magic, once the first torpedo is launched you'll try your hardest not to blink incase you miss something, take an action sequence from The Matrix which typically last 5 minutes, length it to 35 mins and increase the scale massivly to include tens of battleships, airstrips, and planes and you've got the best action sequence featured in a movie to date. The action doesn't stop during the attack and you can't help but get upset and marvel at the sheer scale of attack and the damage done in it. Theres also an intriguing love story line running at the same time. The end is were the film comes apart, it feels like an afterthought because Hollywood couldn't make a film that didn't end without them getting the upper hand. **** out of *****"

","This was a wasted opportunity to make a meaningful film about one of America's greatest tragedies.  This was Hollywood at its worst.<br/><br/>The acting was so bad, the story took great liberties with the true historical facts, and the lack of military accuracy was almost funny.<br/><br/>So, two stud Army fighter pilots are so good that one of them flies for the RAF (without having to resign his U.S. Army commission), they both manage to shoot down Japanese planes during the Pearl Harbor attack and still have time to help out at the hospital and help rescue Sailors trapped in ships. On top of that, these two fighter pilots are personally requested by Jimmy Doolittle to fly bombers against Japan several months later.  Totally unbelievable!<br/><br/>The most ridiculous moment was the shot of the Japanese tail gunner waving to the kids to take cover.  Give me a break!<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Doolittle?  The same ""I'm going to leave the USA if Bush is elected"" Alec Baldwin playing Medal of Honor hero General Jimmy Doolittle?  For shame!  Doolittle must be rolling in his grave.  Baldwin really hams it up in this one.  He should read up on Doolittle to learn a little bit about what it takes to be an American.<br/><br/>The love story was weak, the acting was cliche, and while the special effects were stunning, the accuracy of what a WWII plane can and can not do was poorly depicted.  As was the constant shots of modern carrier task forces to depict the Japanese fleet.  With that much money spent on special effects you'd think that they would at least have the attention to detail to avoid using stock shots of modern-day ships.<br/><br/>The ""technical advisors"" for this movie should hang their heads in shame."

","As a history buff, I tend to be extra critical of movies on major historical topics.  If really great, they are highly cherished.  If not so hot, then I feel uncomfortable.  I regret that I am lukewarm to cool about the supposed blockbuster, ""Pearl Harbor""<br/><br/>     I suppose it depends on what you want to see.  If you want the attack on Pearl Harbor depicted with ""Star Wars"" special effects hype, then you are in for another Adrenalin rush.  But somehow, the depiction just doesn't seem quite right.  An example?  Yes, the US did manage to get a few planes off the ground during the raid and some dogfights and Japanese casualties occurred.  But nothing I have read about the raid indicates that rival pilots chased each other around the facilities on Hickam Field.<br/><br/>    Other aspects of the film?  The romantic involvement of the two pilots (falling in love with the same girl, yet somehow managing to remain friends in the end) is not totally unbelievable, but would have been rare in the cultural milieu of the early '40's.  Also, the movie, which not only builds up to Pearl Harbor, dramatizes the Raid and then moves on to Jimmy Doolittle's bold venture, is very long.<br/><br/>    It is very appropriate, in year 2001, for the American film industry to celebrate the 60th. anniversary of Pearl Harbor. But, as a depiction of this momentous event, the movie doesn't hold a candle to ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" which really was a serious and highly successful attempt to depict history."

","Bloated and boring, Pearl Harbor is a collection of war-movie clichés in search of an epic.  Director Michael Bay (Armageddon and The Rock) allows this sappy romantic drama disguised as an action film drag on for three finger-drumming hours.  While the actual, extended battle scenes are technically dazzling  full of diving fighter bombers and exploding warships  the story and dialogue that surround and accompany them are as hackneyed as that of any daytime soap opera.<br/><br/>Pearl lollygags forever setting up a pre-December 7, 1941, love triangle among three fictional characters: Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett), flyboys who grew up best buds in rural Tennessee, and Evelyn (Beckinsale), a military nurse.  She falls in love with the cocky Rafe first, but he volunteers for service over in England and is reported dead.  She then finds comfort in Danny's arms when both men are stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.  As they laze about on the beach, Evelyn asks, `Do you ever wonder if this war is going to catch up with us?'  Cue the bombers.<br/><br/>Rafe returns, of course, just in time for the aerial attack that would spur America's entry into WWII.  He and Danny do what they can (`Just get me into a damn plane,' Rafe yells), but Pearl at least has the grace not to tamper with history, acknowledging that Japan's surprise raid left 2,400 Americans dead and destroyed half of our Pacific fleet.<br/><br/>Affleck, strappingly handsome, comes across here as a movie star playing a movie star playing a character.  Harnett and Beckinsale fare better but only because they don't have to be quite as noble in every single scene. Gooding, portraying `Dorie' Miller, a real-life Navy mess attendant who courageously manned an antiaircraft gun during the raid, is solid, but his character feels awkwardly wedged into the main story."

","Let me start out by saying that I loved this movie.  I went into it expecting something and walked out having seen what I expected.  How many times can you make that claim?<br/><br/>I went into this movie with the idea that it would be Titanic meets Private Ryan meets Armageddon, and I was right.  It's all of the above.  The sweeping love story, the intense battle and a visual style that I can only describe as beautiful.  This is what Gone with the Wind would have looked like if there had been MTV.  It's a classic tale of young love set against the backdrop of one of the most painful events in American history. <br/><br/>Some people are no doubt going to disagree with me.  They're going to take the above paragraph and use the exact wording to point out its flaws. That's what makes this country so wonderful, we can disagree.

For me, a war story IS a love story, if not for some hot nurse, then for the country the soldiers are fighting for. <br/><br/>I'm telling you, this is no Gladiator, by any means - not everyone is going to see it for the epic it is.  There's a stigma attached to films that Jerry Bruckheimer makes.  There's a stigma attached to the movies Michael Bay makes.  And there are people who will dislike Pearl Harbor for those very two reasons - possibly without having even seen it. <br/><br/>All I can really say, the point that I can try to get across, is that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I liked it for the action.  I liked it for the love story.  And most of all, I liked it for the way it made me feel as an American.  For me, movies like this have to tug on your strings a little, and this one tugged mine, just like The Patriot and Private Ryan did.<br/><br/>Go see this movie.  Ignore what the critics have said.

You can almost see the producers gathering around saying, ""well Titanic and Saving Private Ryan were hits, so let's combine them and make Pearl Harbor"".  The love story is weak bordering on insultingly weak.  Also many of the supporting characters are paper-thinly developed.  For instance, why was Cuba Gooding in this movie? Did anyone care about his character?  It would have been better if they just abandoned the love story and focused on the war.  For instance, they could have focused on the bonds of friendship developed in war or the loss of innocence in war.

American pilots were not as good as shown in the film during the fights between Germany and England. On contrary they were an easy booty for the experienced German fighters. The reason of this desaster is, that American filmmakers are not able to show the truth on WW2, because a nation, that has the most of the casualties related to his time at war, can not be able to make a realistic film based on the true history.

","The previews for Pearl Harbor were misleading.  Even the title of the film is deceptive.  I initially thought the film would be about the events that took place at Pearl Harbor in 1941.  But, no.  It's really a sappy, poorly written love story that happens to have in the middle an exciting 40 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The film does not deserve its title and is an insult to veterans everywhere.  The depiction of the actual attack is well done, but the rest of the film is not worth even a matinee ticket."

","Pearl Harbor is probably one of the best films to come along so far in 2001. As I looked last night awaiting the early reviews of this long awaited epic film they were exactly what I was expecting so see.  The critics bashed Pearl Harbor from beginning to end on just about every level except for its ""precise re-enactment"" of that fateful December 7th, 1941 attack.  Now as I remember about 3 years ago or so a film by the name of Titanic came along, and as I remember suffered the same critical bashing upon its initial release, but as the film gained popularity these moans turned to praise. For nearly a year now we had heard of Pearl Harbor and just like everyone else would be if you had heard of something this far in advance your expectations would be extremely high.  Critics bashed Pearl Harbor for its lack of character development and screenplay faults.  Now of course you're probably not going to get the quality of a screenplay from a film of this scale and magnitude that the critics want because it's on such a grand scale.  To try and focus on only one thing with this kind of summer blockbuster movie would bore the audience to death.  Pearl Harbor has just enough of everything to keep the movie flowing nicely, and just when you think that it gets to slow, the attack sequence is presented.  The nearly 40 minute attack is quite possibly the most impressive use of digital effects ever seen.  It's almost impossible to detect the digital planes from the real ones.  You can really see where they spent the money during the attack. And if this film doesn't win some kind of award for cinematography then something is seriously wrong in this country.  All in all Pearl Harbor is probably going to be the best film to come out over the summer that is if Planet of the Apes and a few other films turn out to be as good as I hope they are.  So I ask you to go in with a non-biased mind and sit through this modern day epic and if you come out of the theater without some kind of feeling of renewed patriotism then something is wrong, GO BACK AND SEE IT AGAIN!!!!  AND PLEASE ALL CRITICS DON'T BASH PEARL HARBOR FOR BEING OVER DONE WITH AMERICAN PATRIOTISM BECAUSE THAT'S THE IDEA!!!!!  When was the last time that this country did something that we all could be proud of, do you remember?? Didn't think so, this is something that should definitely should be celebrated and embraced for what it is not for what people wanted it to be."

The other 2 and 1/2 hours which centers on love triangle between Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale is dull, totally ridiculous and quite difficult to sit through.  Two young women sitting behind me were frequently doubled over with laughter.  Though the characters frequently cry and laugh and kiss, I felt completely disconnected from them.

","Pearl Harbor is one of the worst films I have seen in years. The men who died at Pearl Harbor deserve a far better tribute than this piece of blockbuster trash. It amazes me that an event that is so packed with plot-potential could manage to be made into a movie that lacks one entirely.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's lousy history (warning: some SPOILERS - not much the trailer doesn't already give away)<br/><br/>a) The attack happened at 8am. Yet kids are shown playing baseball in the yard, people are going to church, seems like everyone on the island is awake in a great norman-rockwell-esque shot with the Japanese planes flying in. Meanwhile, the soldiers are all asleep.<br/><br/>b) It mentions we can't crack Japanese code. Not true - the US had cracked the code completely - which is why a message was sent to Pearl Harbor warning of imminent attack. (The movie does get right that the message arrived 4 hours too late)<br/><br/>c) The order of attack is all wrong - the movie shows them attacking ships first, then hospitals and nurses, then the airfields.  The japanese attacked the airfields first, then the ships. Japanese NEVER attacked the hospitals.<br/><br/>d) They were able to get to the ammunition/planes. In fact, the planes and ammunition were all locked up - and the planes lined up in clear view because the Army was following sabotage protocol. One of the bigger dramas of the ACTUAL attack was that the troops couldn't get to the guns/etc because they were all locked up.<br/><br/>e) One of the things this movie fails to even mention is the fact that most of the ships were on leave for the weekend - so many of the sailors were on the island when the attack happened. The exception is the Arizona - which was the ship on active duty rotation. The majority of the casualties were of those who died when this ship was bombed. The movie makes it look like every ship was full of people. (though, there were certainly folks on each of the ships)<br/><br/>If you want your history from hollywood, at least do yourself the favor or watching Tora! Tora!

","Allright, so I watch the trailer and I think it is going to be POSSIBLY even better than American Beauty.  I look at it and say ""Well geez, that is going to be one spectacular film"" and so, I get two of my closest friends and I go to the movies!  So, I sit there for the 3 hours 5 minutes, and enjoy the film, right?  Well, yes, I am a 13 year old female that basically saw the film only because the two main characters are incredibly good looking; I feel that probably many other females did the same as I.  The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away it was great, I got teary eyed, the special effects were great... and so I decided to see it another time.  I enjoyed it even more the second time, and then I bought the soundtrack.  You are probably thinking that I mislead you by the summary at the top ""fraudulent"" or that I don't know what it means, but let me continue.  So, I am overly touched by this film and I cried and all when ????? died.  Then, I went home and discussed it with my brother.  I guess that I didn't realize that the main reason I did like it was BECAUSE of the love story, which wasn't even based on a true story which totally takes away from this being a ""realistic, historical film"" or whatever.  I mean, the film was basically a love story that got ""interesting"" around the comings of the whole attack on Pearl Harbor.  I didn't go to it to see a love story, I wanted to see a historical film on a subject in which my history teacher lectured about, something that I found interesting.  The whole battle scene lasted 40 minutes, but then it basically went back to the love story.  That's basically forty minutes about what the movie is presented to be (about the bombing).  I did enjoy the whole Doolittle's raid part.  Though, although Ben and Josh are gorgeous, they aren't great actors, which was kind of a reason I turned out to not enjoy the film after hours of really thinking about it.  Probably the greatest actor, who played an incredible role, was that Jon Voight, the one who played F.D.R.  he put on an incredible performance and hopefully he will be in line for some academy awards.  So, if you know what happended at Pearl Harbor, you really don't need to see this movie.  I give it a 4/10."
"axis82","Null","0","0","25 May 2001"," This movie is sad.....and I don't mean the story is sad, the whole thing.
","Thats right, this is a sad excuse for a movie.   I just saw the first show in my city and let me tell you I am embarrassed to be part of my generation. Apparently one of the most important events in world history is not interesting enough for a movie, we need a third rate love story to rope in my fellow 15-20 year old movie goers.  This a pathetic attempt to ride the wave of pride stirred up by Saving Private Ryan while at the same time making it dumb enough for 15 year old girls to cry and see 4 times (thats 8 hours of you life wasted, since 2/3 of this movie is doo-doo). The dialougu in this movie is terrible in every sense, I think I laughed at every line Alec Baldwin said.  For that matter 90% of the lines I laughed at, the only actors in this movie worth anything are John Voight and Cuba Gooding Jr., both are on screen for a grand total of 20 minutes. The redeeming factor of this movie is the part that is actually about Peral Harbor, about 40 minutes in the middle.  It is visually astounding and while not quite as heart wrenching as Saving Private Ryan it does accuratley point out the hopelessness and desperation of the service men and women as they try valiantly survive. Even this is flawed, namely when all historical credibility and emotion goes out the window when our two heroes get in planes and get involved in an action sequence like something out of Independence Day.  This made me angry that they ruined what was a very well staged and involving sequence for lame ""watch the impossible fireworks and bang-bang"" time. Also instead of laying out the raid in a coherent manner the filmakers instead it seems decided to just show parts they though would be ""cool"", a torpedo here, and explosion there, people dying there.  You never get a feeling of whats going on.  Another thing that bothered me is how we were suppose to be totally appaled by the Japenese strafing the sailors in the water, it was war and they were active enemies.  It is no worse than what we did in Desert Storm when we attacked the fleeing Iraq army. In conclusion the script is laughable, I can't believe the same man that wrote Braveheart penned this.  Braveheart wasn't pure history but it was involving and had human edge, it held together and was exciting.  The biggest difference is that you didn't realize Braveheart was 3 hours long, I sure realized this was! This is a huge scam, you're basic summer movie crap sandwiched around a truly important and tragic event trying to give it cinematic credibility. The film didn't have to take this low road, Saving Private Ryan didn't budge an inch and made plenty of money, which seems to be all that matters. Apparently $140 million on a 2 hour movie just about Pearl Harbor wasn't as appealing to Hollywood as 40 minutes of Pearl Harbor in a 3 hour movie mostly ripped off from a hundred others."

The last part of the film became plain brain numbing stupidity and should have been cut short.  Overall, don't take Pearl Harbor as a history lesson, take it as popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>And to Michael Bay, stop trying to be too ambitious, the movie becomes over saturated.  This is WAY too much like James Cameron's Titanic, I'm not going to describe how, see it for yourself.  This is no surprise, as Bay is a wannabe Cameron.  Randall Wallace could have come up with a better script instead of this poor effort.

","Some reviewers have commented that far too many people have berated this film by need of adhering to the overall majority view.  Funny how they dismiss the many who saw this soulless trash on opening day, seated beside couples who would have welcomed a little bit of romantic melodrama but who ultimately cringed, laughed (during highly 'serious' moments) and yielded a fairly high ""Oh, C'mon!"" response to a lot of what was supposed to be touching. I am-or was-neither hateful of Michael Bay nor a supporter of his work. All his films offer technically adept escapist action but when attempting anything beyond that, the man fails miserably. Did it not bother any of the fans of this tripe that not one single sentimental line of hollow dialogue could be uttered without the prompting of Hans Zimmer's beautiful but way overused score? I never thought I'd sit through a film scored by him wishing the music would just stop. Never mind historical inaccuracies, never mind the tacked-on Doolittle raid to end the film on an inappropriately positive note, this is simply a BAD movie. Some of us were forced to go home in a near trance wondering if the last three hours were indeed as wretched as they seemed. Then, to our relief, we learned of the horrible reviews across the board, which did NOT CREATE our opinions; they only informed us, the common moviegoer, that we were not crazy. Regardless of the shoddy script, the overuse of the music is the best evidence I can give as to how deeply felt the filmmakers were, forcing the audience to feel angry here, weep there, stand up and salute NOW! I suspect that neither Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer have ever in their lives felt any of the emotions so bluntly rendered in this pathetic excuse for an historical epic.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! Did anyone actually feel moved by Jon Voight (easily the best performance in the film) standing up in his wheelchair to illustrate to his administration that nothing is ever impossible? The then polio-stricken FDR, if ever so adamant in addressing others, might have found another, more plausible and therefore more touching way of making a point. And believe me, that's only the tip of the iceberg that ultimately doomed the Titanic-an also maudlin but far superior film. Though James Cameron has never been a terrible witty writer, his screenplays at least have integrity amid all the action.<br/><br/>The flock, as some have put it, is not the consequence of an influence instilled in us by critics, it is the result of this much-anticipated film proving to be one of the very worst of the year.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you believed Armageddon was robbed on Oscar night, then by all means, Pearl Harbor is for you."

Bend the truth for dramatic license, by all means. But please oh please remember to look up the word dramatic in a dictionary.<br/><br/>What are we left with? Well, a sort of Bermuda Love Triangle in which all sense of drama and plot are lost without trace. Predictable and strenuous to watch. A fraternal bond between two pilots inevitably broken when Pilot A is believed KIA (in his valiant one-man attempt to help our poor RAF boys win the Battle of Britain - where oh where would we have been without Ben Affleck?), Kate Beckinsale's bomb bay inevitably ends up loaded with her own Little Boy, by which time we know that Pilot B will die (heroically) and Ben Affleck will inevitably walk off into the sunset with a family Pilot B made earlier.<br/><br/>All boring enough in and of itself.<br/><br/>To this recipe though, we have to add enough patriotism to fuel several World War Twos, along with some questionable elements which don't sit comfortably at all. The movie highlights the sheer strategic folly of the then US Government, but in doing so it must make reasonably intelligent people wonder whether the intelligence people really were that much in the dark. It's easy to see where the blame is being laid, but where is the real guilt, I wonder? Then there is the portrayal of race relations in the US Navy which doesn't entirely ring true for America in the 40s, at least two decades in advance of Martin Luther King's struggle for equality. Things that make you go hm.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a scene or two which depicts the whole campaign from the Japanese point of view, which are handled relatively sensibly and sensitively, even. However, within the context of all the sugar-coated stars n stripes and love candies, it only serves to highlight the sheer banality of this $139m bomb. Surely there is something of more substance to be said about the 3000 lives that were lost in this episode of history?<br/><br/>What next?<br/><br/>Perhaps a sweet-tooth romantic slushy epic, scored with stirring patriotic themes, and bearing the simple evocative and emotionally powerful title: Hiroshima.

There's plenty of eye candy in this film, that's for sure.<br/><br/>As for the dialogue: Sure, it's dumb, and as flat and canned as Coke that's been out too long--but it's no worse than ""Titanic,"" which everybody hailed as some kind of masterpiece and which no one seemed to notice had cliches spouting everywhere and a love story I found as cheesy and unconvincing as the one in ""Pearl Harbor.""  And even dumber lines.<br/><br/>That said, I do admit, grudgingly, that ""Titanic"" is the better film. ""Pearl Harbor"" tries to combine ""Titanic"" with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and comes up instead with a big hollow cheese puff of a movie.  Which has its enjoyable points, but is hardly something to be savored or remembered. Swallow it whole in one big gulp and don't think too much about it afterwards.  Do think, however, about the real Pearl Harbor story, the one in the history books--it merits a lot closer examination than the Hollywood version."

"ViciousBoothie","3","0","0","5 June 2001"," What a great film!(Contains Spoilers!)
","(Contains Spoilers!)<br/><br/>What a great film...if you want to show off what a 140 million dollar budget and a good special effects crew can get you. As far as its quality as a movie, it was a big, steaming pile of crap!<br/><br/>Let me break it down for you in basic terms. The soap opera storyline was insanely boring, stale, and fairly predictable, and the characters were flat. The actors brought nothing dynamic to their characters, either. The exception was the always-great Cuba Gooding, Jr., who was very underused. However, considering that African-Americans weren't allowed to play very major roles in the military during WWII, it is understandable. The special effects during the battle, however, were amazing, I will give them credit for that.<br/><br/>I imagine there was some sort of meeting between Bruckheimer and Bay about their next movie after Armageddon. They probably thought for all of five minutes, decided that to make more money, they need bullets and bombs, and quickly settled for WWII, and, more specifically, Pearl Harbor. Then there was the question of how to appeal to the widest demographic. Since bombs and bullets pretty much covered the guys, they probably threw a love story in there for the women, and an African American character for African-Americans. Was Dorie Miller an important part? Of course, but did they give him as much coverage as the two main characters, or, for that matter, as much as he deserved? No, which suggests to me that they threw him in there for the demographic, as his part was far from fully developed.<br/><br/>Does it stack up to ""Saving Private Ryan?"" Hell no, and to suggest it is ridiculous. The characters in ""Ryan"" are more three-dimensional, and the actors were better as well. ""Ryan"" shows that you can make a damn good three hour war movie that doesn't need to pander to the masses and still be commercially successful. The action in ""Ryan,"" while not as expensive, was much more realistic. ""Pearl Harbor"" fell prey to the ""Episode One"" syndrome, in that they overdid the special effects to the point where they were far from realistic. On top of it, ""Pearl Harbor"" was rated PG-13, as opposed to ""Ryan,"" which was rated R, showing that it didn't pull any punches with its graphic nature. Blame it on Disney, the ""family-friendly"" studio who probably didn't want ""blood"" and ""gore"" attached to their project, or, ""realism."" The PG-13 rating once again suggests that they wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible and skip that pesky under 17, R-rated policy to grab as many teenagers as possible.<br/><br/>And how bad was the story itself? Aside from what the trailers and teasers gave away, it was very predictable. As soon as Evelyn told Rafe she would give her heart to Danny, but still love him, you knew that Danny was going to die and Rafe was going to live. How? Well, first of all, Ben Affleck is the main character, and Josh Hartnett is the supporting character. Ben Affleck is considered the bigger sex symbol, so to appease the majority of women, he, of course, gets the girl. It's typical sappy love story crap. Of course, in this movie, as opposed to a love story, it doesn't fit. It is also hard to believe that with the seemingly hundreds of planes in Pearl Harbor, only two were scrambled, and because it's what people like to see, both are piloted by the heroes. I'm not an expert in Pearl Harbor history, so it may have been true that only two made it.<br/><br/>So, the final verdict? Bruckheimer and Bay made this movie for the money, and have lost their artistic integrity as far as I am concerned, as well as my respect. The problem was that they spent way too much money on the special effects, and not enough on the story. On top of it, they seemed to have forgotten that they were dealing with a historic event, and they do not have the right to change events to make the movie more entertaining for the masses.<br/><br/>Final Verdict - 4/10."

That information would never have gotten to them because the ships were in radio silence. 3)Guided missile cruisers didn't exist then, however enough of them got bombed (Final countdown anyone). 4)Japanese ambassadors were waiting to see the president on Dec. 7th, the movie does not show this which takes away from the message they were delivering. 5)What ever happened to that flight of B-17's that they were expecting?  In real life the B-17's showed up during the second wave and most were shot down by american guns.  And one problem that I have with what actually happened at pearl harbor and they showed in the movie: All nurses getting purple hearts.  The purple heart is for wounds received in combat.  Not all nurses were hurt but, they still received purple hearts. There were still a few I missed but, can't think of right now."

","The film ""Pearl Harbor"" is a mockery of one of the most horrific days in the history of the United States.<br/><br/>Poor acting framed the most pathetic screenplay I've seen in years. The only part of this movie that's worth seeing are the historically inacurate, yet visually beautiful, CG shots from ILM. Absolutely gorgeous. Everything else, the acting, the screenplay, and the the slow-motion, go America, soft focus, Armageddon shots, are all crap.<br/><br/>The whole world knows what happened on that day. In every country, in every history classroom, everyone the world over is taught of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into WWII. It was a tragic event that affected the planet as a whole. Did Michael Bay and his goons actually think they could fool us?<br/><br/>I'm insulted. I'm offended.<br/><br/>The ordeal of watching is slop reveal itself one frame at a time on the screen before was a punishment that robbed me of eight dollars, three hours of my life, and my dignity.<br/><br/>But did this movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor begin and end with the bombing of Pearl Harbor? No.<br/><br/>It began with a simple enough, somewhat romantic, get-to-know-the-characters kind of shpiel, but then that shpiel dragged on, and on, and on. Suddenly, one historical inaccuracy after another broke up the romantic, hour long intro, spotted with poor humor and neat little historical facts (""Do you own that $25,000 figher out there?"" - ooh, this movie is so cool because they did some research and found out that planes cost 25 grand).<br/><br/>Then, for almost no reason other than wanting oil, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor because, get this, it's close. Not because of the fleet that's there or anything, just because it's close.<br/><br/>In the film Tora Tora Tora, Japan planned and planned and planned, each member of the task force studying up on each and every ship that the United States held in the harbor. In ""Pearl Harbor"", Japan planned for a couple days and pretty much went ahead after their higher officers thought it was pretty much a good idea.<br/><br/>And even after the bombing was over (and, again, thoroughly inaccurate), the movie didn't stop. Like a train full of manure, it needs a lot of track to come to a stop. This movie went on.<br/><br/>All of the charaters we've so far come to know and dislike, are all still living without a scratch, having literally walked through the thick of the bombing. Everyone's given awards, lots of ceremonies, and then WHAMMO, we're heading to Japan to kick their ass.<br/><br/>Please, people. I could go on, but I don't want to. The sun's out, it's a nice day, and I don't want to ruin it with any more talk of the worst film to hit theaters since Battlefield Earth. Spare yourselves, and read a book about the bombing if you absolutely have to get your WWII fix. Otherwise, just live life pretending that this movie never happened."

","This film is long.  About at the point it reaches its climax you realise just how long - as it gets there halfway through the movie.  The second half of the film is just filler, with the dolittle raid and large heaps of love interest footage.  Beckinsale is excellent as the young nurse and one corner of the love triangle - the male leads thump their chests convincingly but failed to stand out.<br/><br/>The main reason to see this movie is undoubtedly the CGI sequences during the Pearl Harbor raid itself - which, apart from the odd err.. historical inaccuracy, are very well done.<br/><br/>I had expected the usual hollywood disregard for real history, and I wasn't disappointed.  As with the recent Sub movie (where the Americans claimed credit for a british mission [sigh]), this movie gives the impression that the Americans played a significant part in the Battle of Britain.  At one stage (supposedly early 1941) Afflecks character joins up with Eagle Squadron in Britain.  In fact the Battle of Britain was all but over by that stage, merely long distance bombing runs rather than dogfighting.  Not only that, but of the 3000 airmen involved, only 7 were American, a few dozen Canadians and 150 Polish.

","With all of the money spent on ""Pearl Harbor,"" it leaves the audience wondering why the filmmakers couldn't have spent a few extra dollars to hire a decent screenwriter.  The dialogue was sappy, full of clichÃ©s, and worst of all, boring.  This being said, its not surprising that the most magical, touching, and exciting parts of the movie came when the thinly drawn characters said nothing at all.<br/><br/>As for all of those people so concerned with the film's historical accuracy - forget about it.  This movie doesn't come anywhere near realistic.  From the first glitzy shot of a wheat field in Tennessee a la the English Patient; to the triumphant pilots marching into their planes a la Armageddon (not coincidentally, also produced by Bay and Bruckheimer); to Ben Affleck waving an American flag and emerging as the hero, this film was clearly made to look and feel like a summer blockbuster rather than a war biopic.<br/><br/>
Forgetting about plot or characters for a minute, Bay and Bruckheimer did what they do best - shot an exciting, expensive action movie (starring an exciting, expensive Hollywood star).  The special effects and action scenes served their purpose, with the audience on the edge of their seats while planes flew overhead and battleships blew up for a good forty minutes. Other than the ineffective, nauseating, shaky camera shots, and blurred shots of the victims in the aftermath, the direction was decent.  However, ""all that"" (as described by Beckinsale in the film) was over after an hour and a half of the over three-hour movie, leaving us wondering what could possibly be left of this story.<br/><br/>This is where the film takes its most downward turn, as we discover that there truly is nothing else to be said (especially with that mundane dialogue).  The second half of the movie could've been a whole other movie, while screenwriter Randall Wallace tried to cram in all that he could into the already too long three-hour film.  Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett were all fine choices for their characters (even though Beckinsale looked a little too similar to Liv Tyler in Armageddon), but were not given much to work with.  I was more convinced of their love by Affleck gazing into Beckinsale's eyes than I was when they actually spoke.  Furthermore, their romance is turned into even bigger schmaltz when it becomes an ill-fated (and ill-scripted) triangle between Rafe (Affleck), Evelyn (Beckinsale), and Rafe's best friend, Danny (Hartnett).<br/><br/>One more thing: if you're going to make a self-aware summer blockbuster, please don't base it on an important historical event.  You might even try writing an original screenplay next time."

The depiction of the carnage, the feeling of outrage, the desire to ""get them back"" is well portrayed by the pilots, the officers in charge and President Roosevelt. The preparations for the Doolittle raid are documented better than any movie since ""30 Seconds over Tokyo"". Actually, this is the only other movie that addresses this heroic raid. The ""other"" Pearl Harbor movie, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" , was more documentary than movie and you were hard pressed to feel any emotion for any of the characters. Like ""Titanic"", everyone knows what happens how so you set this movie apart? A love story usually works. It certainly did with ""Titanic"". Rose and Jack were wonderful characters and you cared what happened to them. But the Rafe-Danny-Evelyn triangle is too contrived and just doesn't cut it. So to wrap this up, as a 50 something, whose father was a WW II Marine and who grew up with the outrage of the sneak attack, I think this was a worthy effort. I recommend this movie to everyone.

","Pearl howler worth sinking ><br/><br/>Stunning special effects, but dull dialogue lacking subtlety Pearl Harbor Cert 12, 180 mins<br/><br/>Disney was ominously reluctant to show Pearl Harbor to the critics. Now we can see why. It's ludicrously, uproariously awful - so bad that a packed audience at its first British screening last night laughed at most of the would-be serious moments. Yes, there are 40 minutes of exciting special effects when the Japanese finally attack, but the rest of the movie doesn't begin to justify its three hours, three minutes of screen time<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is from the folks who brought you that monument to mindlessness, Armageddon. This is even dumber . No one expects subtlety or human interest from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay. You are more likely to get massive explosions and a quasi-mystical belief in the cleansing nature of extreme violence. But the £135m Pearl Harbor is quite staggeringly cynical, a shameless attempt to repeat the success of a quite different blockbuster, Titanic. For the first hour and a half before the special effects kick in, it's prettily photographed but utterly banal romantic fiction, with two childhood friends turned fighter-pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) falling for the same nurse (Kate Beckinsale). Ben leaves for England to join the Battle of Britain and goes missing, presumed dead, by everyone except the audience. Then he returns on cue, just in time to experience the carnage at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 when the Japanese navy notoriously attacked America's Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawiai.<br/><br/>Whereupon Franklin D Roosevelt (Jon Voight) rallies the nation, and Ben and Josh avenge their dead colleagues in a daring bombing raid over Tokyo, the importance of which is mightily exaggerated in order to end the movie on a positive, war-winning note, without reference to such minor unpleasantnesses as Nagasaki or Hiroshima. Notable by its absence is any attempt to discover why America was so unprepared. There is no hint that the American authorities had prior knowledge of the Japanese bombing raid, although evidence has recently come to light which suggests they did, and negligently ignored it. But let historians attack the movie in their own way. This film isn't really about the Second World War, or love, or indeed any aspect of reality. It's about copying the successful bits in other movies. When the Japanese planes swoop down on the American navy, they are just like Luke and Han Solo attacking Darth Vader in Star Wars. The sinking of an American warship is shot in a way that creates echoes of Titanic. When the Japanese shoot at Americans underwater, you know that the director has been studying Spielberg's equivalent shots in Saving Private Ryan. Randall Wallace's screenplay is equally secondhand and far more third-rate. It plunders most of the known clichés from other war films, and gives the leading actors little to do except look glamorous . This they duly do, but not even Kate Beckinsale can breathe life into her dialogue, which requires her to be little more than pretty and dull. The most striking performance is given by Jon Voight although the filmmakers treat him with such obsequious reverence that the last half-hour degenerates into the same gung-ho patriotism that made so many critics queasy about Bruckheimer's first militaristic hit, Top Gun. It wasn't the jingoism that upset me about the film, however. It was its affectless approach to violence. Whereas Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan used modern special effects to recreate what it must have felt like to be in the Normandy landings, Messrs Bay and Bruckheimer seem concerned only to capture the adrenaline rush of bombing defenceless American servicemen. Spielberg's approach was deeply felt and humane. The second approach reduces war to spectacle, carnage to a computer game. Maybe this won't concern American audiences out for a cheap thrill at their local multiplex; but it concerned me. At least Titanic had some pretensions to a moral message, about the folly of a hubristic pride in technology. Pearl Harbor the movie is itself a product of that same hubristic pride, the idea that superior special effects can distract audiences from a woeful screenplay and a cast whose main achievement is to speak the unbelievably crass dialogue with a straight face. I can only hope the public can see through the hype and treat this film with the contempt it deserves. There is nothing in these movie-makers' heads except the urge to make a fast buck. And the crucial question to bear in mind when watching this movie is: Does it honour the memory of those who died at Pearl Harbor? Or does it give audiences a perverted thrill from watching them die?"

All 45 thousand tons of battleship USS ARIZONA seem to leap out of the water as she explodes from a Japanese bomb deep in the entrails of her ammunition magazine.  Even better, and far sadder, is the slow, excrutiating death of battleship USS OKLAHOMA, as she gracefully, achingly capsizes.  The water around OKLAHOMA is strewn with the bodies of dozens of drowned sailors just as the battleship's oversized holiday flag slowly unfurls just below the surface of the water.  Navy welders work furiously to cut holes into the thick armor of the capsized battleship and rescue trapped crewmembers inside, only to speed the death of some by venting air out of flooding compartments.  Welders manage to open holes just large enough so that drowning sailors can thrust their hands into the open for a few seconds, grasp welders' hands, and then succumb back into the flooded darkness.<br/><br/>The best, I thought, were the hospital sequences depicting military nurses who just simply wanted to run off in hysterics, but grimly took on the task of sorting out mounting casualties for treatment.  The hospital scenes were so chaotic, and the resolution of the nurses and doctors so intense, they reminded me of the Omaha beach sequence of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br/><br/>
Well done, Michael Bay.  I hope to see this one again."

","So, where to start?  Firstly, let me be fair: this is not a bad film.  It is however symptomatic of a period in Hollywood film-making where historically based subjects are being dealt without the care that they deserve.  The fact remains that films like Saving Private Ryan (which I generally thought was excellent), U-571 (appalling, dreadful and insulting) and now Pearl Harbour misrepresent almost all of the parties involved in the events that they describe.<br/><br/>Certainly, an amount of story-telling is required, but so many incredible acts of bravery have come out of World War Two that the need to invent more beggars belief.  I am doing a history degree and my grandparents fought for Britain and the Allies in the Second World War.  I understand that the film is being toned down for German and Japanese audiences, for the sake of me retching in the aisle, could the editors consider toning down some of the America-saves-the-day heroics and marginalisation of the European effort for our sakes?<br/><br/>As for the likes of Braveheart and The Patriot, don't even get me started. Needless to say they were so historically inaccurate as to be slanderous.<br/><br/>OK, toys are back in the pram, I have had my little moan.  As for the film, the special effects were awesome, but the love story was unconvincing - Kate Beckinsale just came across as a Slapper, the dialogue floated between corny and wooden, and some of the acting was distinctly average - though Voight as Roosevelt deserves special mention.<br/><br/>If you are American, go and see it and feel proud, noble and invulnerable. If you are not, then have a look if you want but I, for one, came out with nothing but a sense of shame that comes from knowing that millions of school children are going to believe that that is how war actually happened."

","I wasn't going to see this movie at first because I had heard how a majority of people didn't like it, but my brother and a friend wanted to see it, so I went along. I am glad I did.<br/><br/>First, I'll say what I didn't like about the film 1. Too much time was spent on the love story. They should have spent less time on the romance and more time on character development 2. Not Enough Cuba. Cuba Gooding Jr. only has 4 scenes (I think), and he should have had more 3. Not historically accurate. I don't need movies based on actual events to be 100% accurate, but they have to be fairly realistic. This movie many inaccuracies and it simplifies the events leading to, and following, the attack 4. Some corny dialogue. While I didn't feel this was nearly as bad as everyone else says, it's definitely there 5. The weird lenses in the infirmary scenes. Rumor has it that these were used to make the gore less graphic so the film could be sure of getting a PG-13 rating. I found them annoying, and the fact that the makers of this film want to show us the attack, but shield us from seeing the aftermath is pretty bad.<br/><br/>Now the good 1. The love story isn't all bad. I just wish they spent less time on it, and that there was better dialogue to express the characters' feelings 2. The audio and visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen 3. There is a lot of emotion and human drama in the last two hours. If the last hour of Titanic got to you, then the bombing sequence will not disappoint you 4. The last two hours of this film are intense. This is one of the most intense movies I've ever seen (next to Saving Private Ryan).<br/><br/>

","Pearl Harbour is the second major ""summer movie""(after moulin rouge) here in NZ(where it is winter). I saw it at an advance screening where it was shown on all 12 screens at the local multiplex,(starting time delayed by 30 mins).<br/><br/>Pearl Harbour was, for the most part what I expected. Average love story, based around the beginnings of the war for america, climaxing in the bombing of Pearl Harbour, with what I thought (may be considered a slight spoiler) an unnecessary afternote causing what was a bad ending to an otherwise good movie.<br/><br/>There is quite a large cast in Pearl Harbour, with the main characters of Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsale taking centre stage with the love triangle which drives along through the movie.<br/><br/>I love Bruckheimer productions, as they are generally fun, action packed movies however Pearl Hrbour is slightly different, being based on fact. I saw a startiling resemblance to Armageddon, however, as the story set up is quite similar,this is both good and bad. Good: respectfully tackles a true life event Bad: as with Armageddon goes on too long<br/><br/>The length was the only real problem in this blockbuster. I could get passed the flag waving and historical simplifications(what else would you expect from such a movie?). But the length and ending caused my opinion of the movie to change ('slight spoiler' the film makers could not just leave it as america being defeated at Pearl Harbour could they?)<br/><br/>Anyway, for blockbuster entertainment about a sad historical event the movie is quite good, and despite what critics say, worth seeing. **** out of *****"

","Don't miss this movie because you heard that the history is inaccurate, or that the love story is poorly told, or that the characters are cardboard. These opinions may or may not be yours (they're not mine), but nevertheless, ""Pearl Harbor"" should be seen because of the impressive attack sequence.<br/><br/>I've heard that some of the veterans of Pearl Harbor who have seen this movie thought the attack appeared a bit over-the-top, which is probably true, but it does do an excellent job of conveying the sadness, helplessness, and confusion of the event, of seeing all the destruction and wounds inflicted and lives lost, in particular the drowning of all those people trapped within the Arizona.  What an emotionally intense sequence, and I can only imagine how much more magnified these emotions were of the people who were actually there.<br/><br/>The love story was so-so; you do empathize with the characters.  But, it doesn't really relate to the actual attack or serve any grand purpose in relation to the war.  Rather, the relationships were explored only as book-ends (beginning and end), and that's probably why it doesn't seem to work very well.  That, and I felt that the triangle was a bit... twisted.<br/><br/>So, check out ""Pearl Harbor"" for the actual event itself.  For the attack sequence alone, this movie is worth watching.  You do get a love story on the side, which you may or may not enjoy, plus some extra patriotism (for Americans) with the Doolittle Raid retaliatory airstrike thrown in there, as well as a nice portrayal of the great President Roosevelt."

The impact is greater on the characters that had been developed, but even the suffering of the many nameless ones still affect the viewer.<br/><br/>I did not think the movie dragged at any time, and I easily sat through the three hours.

","I just saw Pearl Harbor and I have to say that I was extremely disappointed in what I saw!  Though I have to admit that the special effects in the battle scene were stunning, it did little to compensate for the great disrespect it gave to the battle at Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is one of those topics which deserves reverent care when the storyline is drawn up.  For example, in the film Saving Private Ryan, all attempts are made to present war and the battle on D-Day in a realistic, true-to-history way without all the flowery Hollywood glamour all-too-often seen in war films.  Where the film Pearl Harbor went wrong was when it presented a grave battle in American history as an interruption to a cheesy romance.<br/><br/>I love Ben Affleck and Cuba Gooding Jr. and all the other cameo actors, and under another director, they would have probably given award-winning performances.  But it is hard to get past a script laden with cliche lines which make you nausious by the 2 hour mark.<br/><br/>I rated this film as a 3 on the IMDB voting scale.  It would have been a 1 if not for the amazing effects during the battle scenes.  In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time for any real movie lover, and especially for those into war films like myself.  This is just another American John Wayne interpretation of history."

","First of all I would like to congrat you on a great Website, I have been using it for years and it has just got better by the day.<br/><br/>Well now for the bad news....The film! I will try to keep it nice and short and to the point, not like the film director.<br/><br/>I watched the trailer last year with my wife and we both agreed that this was going to be a really good film. After the hype and build up it eventually arrived. I was a little disapointed that it was aimed at being a love story but my wife was pretty chuffed.<br/><br/>We paid our five pound fifty and we sat down ready to witness the marvel of the year. Little did I know that I would be sitting there for a good hour until the action started.<br/><br/>The film starts with the traditional build up and get to know the characters etc... but this seemed to enjoy stretching the whole thing out. I could of accepted a love story as I always get my way with the choice of films so it was about time my wife got a treat and watched a great love story. The only problem is that the hour long intro was totally pathetic and unbelieveable. It is not often I catch myself staring at the ceiling waiting for a film to finish, and then to look over and see my wife doing the same. We both looked at each other and both wished that the film would just get on with it.<br/><br/>Then came the part where the film title had a meaning ie ""Pearl Harbour"", this was where the film remembered what it was about and got on with the story. To be honest you could of just arrived at this point and still felt like you had watched a complete movie.<br/><br/>I then gripped my seat ready for a jaw drop, but it didnt! I wont say the effects were bad, in fact they were very good. My problem was that they were nothing new, there was no new ground breaking FX's being displayed here at all. Surely this was a perfect opportunity to display the next generation of FX's? I have unfortunately got very bored with the same old CGI FX's and I strongly welcome a good jaw drop, but not here I am afraid.<br/><br/>Please dont get me wrong though, the attack was by far the best bit of the film and it was a pleasure to finally get to the point after an hour of watching paint dry.<br/><br/>The planes attacked, the nurses helped the injured and the two heroes got into the air to ""save the day (ish)"". Oh, and I think Cuba Goddard Jnr was in the film too!? (What a waste of a talent)<br/><br/>Well after being entertained at the attack something strange happened, I seemed to have blinked then magically moved to another cinema and found myself watching a sequel to the film ""Pearl Harbour"".<br/><br/>Somehow after the attack, the film then decided to gloss around the reality of the event and just fast forward to the bit where the yanks try to revenge the attack. There was little aftermath, no lesson learning, very little mourning and no summary of what had just happened. The film just seemed to completely start up again where it should of finished and begin telling a completely different story. It was just incredible to witness this strange technique in film making.<br/><br/>Well it ended with the Yanks having a little pointless go back at the japs before coming to a close. Naturally after all that had happened the film just had to finish with the cliche explanation commentry using a womans voice, very cheesy.<br/><br/>In summary:<br/><br/>1. Very stretched out love story that didnt work. 2. The Yanks getting a pasting by the Japs. 3. A very stretched and misplaced ending trying to make you feel like the Yanks did okay after all. 4. Very cheeseball and predictable end to the ""Love triangle"".<br/><br/>My rating: 3/10 for the middle bit, nothing for the rest.<br/><br/>Lesson learnt: Never waste such a great and memorable topic ever again. For half the price the story of Pearl Harbour could of been told more honestly, factually and with much much more feeling. Big bucks do not make a good film as shown here, but it is just such a pity that this chance was wasted. What I dont understand is that when all these movie business people sit around the table, well surely one of them must see that it is badly constructed, scripted and directed, but why is nothing said to stop them making this expensive mistake?<br/><br/>Top tip: Save your money and go and see something else!"

","I've read all of these reviews saying how Pearl Harbor didn't pay tribute to our war vets, and how the romance is sappy, the script is pathetic, etc... but I must say that I still enjoyed the film.  It all depends on what you are looking for.  I came into this movie not expecting a film like SavingPR, or Glory, or any other great war movie; I was expecting a summer blockbuster and that is exactly what I got.  Sure, the bombing in between the romance was kind of akward, and they should have ended it after Pearl Harbor and not have gone into the Doolittle raid (and spared us 45 min), but I was glad to get out of the heat for 3 hours.  The acting was pretty good; Ben Affleck pulled off the cocky fighter well, and Kate Beckinsale was fair as the nurse Evelyn, even if she did cry every other scene.  Josh Hartnett, I thought, was amazing as Danny Walker, and did his best w/the dialouge he was given. I wouldn't be surprised at all if he becomes a major star.  I agree w/the one review however, that said how everyone kept talking about how heroic the characters were.  I got sick of hearing how great they were, too.<br/><br/>Ahhh what the heck, c'mon people.

It is a solid picture, certainly, but I could feel it being pulled in so many different directions that it was unable to become a war movie, or a love story, or a story of the triumph of the human spirit, all of which it attempted to be. You've basically seen all the effects before (some were taken almost verbatim from ""Saving Private Ryan"") and I felt that the love story, while good, needed to be something else. Either it needed to *be* the whole film, with the war as a background, or it needed to be left to the wayside entirely and instead concentrate on the tactics and emotions of war.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie is worth a look, but I don't think it deserves the hype it's been getting.

","Kate Beckinsale was a good choice for the romantic lead as we've already seen Affleck and Charlize Theron together in Reindeer Games and him with Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce and both of those were just in the OK category. Here, having a fresh face allows us to better accept her innocence and Affleck as a leading man not just going through the motions.<br/><br/>Jon Voight as President Roosevelt and Alec Baldwin as Colonel Doolittle gave strong supporting performances. Baldwin demonstrated patriotism for a bombing mission for which President Roosevelt personally presented him The Congressional Medal of Honor. Voight gives us an Oscar caliber performance. We've all heard the words `this day will live in infamy', and in this film, Roosevelt shows compassion and leadership that were required for America to be the free country it remains today.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the film is knowing that Evelyn's has a big secret that will be revealed at the appropriate time in another persons life .The entire romantic aspect of the film was more than a little contrived, too convenient and in general, hard to accept.<br/><br/>There are however, some things the film has going for it that more than make up for its weaknesses.

","This movie was as well written as it was grandly performed!  I'm being sarcastic.  The actors were about as emotionally into the film as the props. Ben was a major source of ""ear-sore"" from the beginning, to his very predictable reappearance in the third quarter of the movie.  Hartnett's character, ""Danny"" was played out pretty well, but the love-triangle was as predictable as Rafe's reappearance, and nearly as annoying.  But, what sane girl is going to say she minded looking at Josh Hartnett for three hours! he played his part and did a better job than most of the other cast, considering the corny writing he had to deal with.  <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale played her part, but that was about it.  The writers definitely set her apart from the other nurses in order to make her a lead character.  She had a level head, almost a ""motherly-figure"" to her companion nurses.  Once again, we ALL could have lived without the sappy, ongoing love story.  The Writers and directors should have spent more time detailing the history, and less time worrying about Evelyn's ""boy trouble"".<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more action.  I was impressed, however, with how long the Bombing SEEMED to take.  There was no emotion attached to the deaths we viewed during the bombing, a major downfall of the movie.  All of the main characters narrowly escaped being killed, while many extras ""lost their lives"".<br/><br/>I really could have done without the Doolittle scene.  It made the movie seem even more long and drawn out.

","If you name your movie Pearl Harbor and advertise it(as the studio has,and as have the actors in press junkets,and behind the scenes looks on such shows as ET and E!News Daily)as being ABOUT Pearl Harbor,you should have more than about 50 minutes of a three hour movie in which you are actually at Pearl Harbor. The first hour,with the love story,was cliche to be sure,but not THAT bad. But it was almost like watching an entire movie before we even get to the events at Pearl Harbor. The battle sequence is superbly orchestrated,but I was disappointed that aside from Cuba Gooding,his captain and Cuba's mess attendant friend on the Arizona,no attention was payed to the men who actually lost their lives that day. By that I mean that not much attention was paid to them as humans. Instead,we get faceless men being blown away and dying without ever getting to know them and thus the loss seems to be diluted on film. As a person who is fascinated by Pearl Harbor and the horrible events of that day,it was sad to see such short shrift paid to the men who gave their lives. Also,the single most cataclysmic event of that day,the bombing and sinking of the Arizona,gets a big build-up,with the torpedo's-eye view of the bombing,but when the ship convulses as if breaking in half from the inside after the main battery goes up,the camera goes away and never comes back! The film is book-ended with shots of the Arizona memorial,yet we are not made to feel much about the loss. Instead we are thrust right back into the relationship of the two friends as they man their planes and down some enemy bombers. Then,after the attack,we get them going on the mission to bomb Tokyo. This film is really about them and should have been called Rafe and Danny. Don't get me wrong,I'm not hungry to see men die and suffer,but if you name your film Pearl Harbor,and especially in the wake of realistic films like Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line,I'm expecting a little more of the history and yes,the horror of war. Young people who know little of the events of Dec. 7,1941 may come away from this film thinking of it as a romantic time interrupted by a big battle,instead of the tragedy that it was,and that would be a shame. Perhaps I shouldn't carp so much,but when I see Michael Bay interviewed,saying that he stopped filming once,because one of the extras was laughing,and he berated him in front of the whole crew,asking,""Do you think Pearl Harbor was funny!??!"",and comments on how much they reverenced the veterans and advisers,I would think that they'd put more emphasis on that day and not the romance."

","Some pre-opening weekend hype-mongers dubbed ""Pearl Harbor"" 'Titanic'-meets-'Saving Private Ryan.' I'd be lying if I said it wasn't entertaining. But the action sequences aren't anything close to the complex, calculated sinking luxury liner in Cameron's film or the beginning and ending battle sequences of Spielberg's.  Director Michael Bay does nothing groundbreaking here. He shows a lot of improvement since the sloppy ""Armageddon,"" but he still depends too much on special effects and not enough on editing. An example is what could have been the film's money shot--that bomb's-eye-view shot everyone saw in the trailer, resulting in the Arizona being destroyed. The armor-piercing shell drops all the way down into the lower deck, coming to a rest on a million pounds of gunpowder (it's true). According to eyewitnesses, the explosion all but ripped the ship in two pieces, shooting it straight up in the air about twenty feet. Bay does the explosion in one brief, wide shot that doesn't even look real.<br/><br/>Bay tries to one-up Cameron by hiring an Oscar winner, Randall Wallace(`Braveheart') to write his script. But ""Pearl Harbor"" still feels like it was written by committee, in some Santa Monica Boulevard board room. This is due no doubt to the project not originating with Wallace. He was hired to give a story to Bay's vision. I can imagine the shopping list Bay handed to Wallace: `Write whatever you want, but it has to have these scenes, these shots, in it. And another thing, make it PG-13! Oh and remember, it has to appeal to women AND 14-year-old boys"" and so on and so forth. So I don't hold Wallace responsible for the just-average film that ended up on movie screens. A man's got to work, after all. One thing Bay didn't ask, apparently, was to keep it a reasonable length. I could excuse the over three-hour length if the story had moved along a little better.<br/><br/>Bay did get his PG-13 so you're never afraid you're going to see something gruesome. No pun intended, but this factor seriously cripples the movie. Sure there's blood, but the hospital scenes never get more intense than a given episode of ""ER."" The scene in which Evelyn has to go outside and mark the status of the wounded in lipstick is another missed opportunity. Looking at the dirtied, limping crowd I couldn't see how any one of them was more critically wounded than the other. All I saw was a bunch of men covered with oil, in which case they don't need a nurse, they need a fire hose. There were more disturbing images in Bay's ""The Rock,"" and that movie is practically a comedy! By the time a truly disturbing image comes along, of a net being hoisted out of the water filled with bloody corpses, it seems out of place and overly grisly. <br/><br/>I truly wish this project had been entrusted to someone like John McTiernan, Roger Donaldson, Wolfgang Petersen, Ed Zwick, Joe Johnston, Oliver Stone (well maybe not), Philip Kaufman--anyone who's willing to do something meaningful with this material and not just have Summer blockbuster tunnel vision. Unfortunately, hiring Bay was the only way to justify what staging the two-hour attack would surely cost. Say what you will about the man as a director, but he hasn't had a dud yet. A short career of nothing but box office hits.<br/><br/>I would have much rather seen a complex story that dealt more with the attack itself and who knew what, the inside story, something like Donaldson's ""Thirteen Days."" I don't need that many special effects. Really, I don't. Save your money. Just give me an engaging, interesting story (think ""Hunt for Red October'). With ""Pearl Harbor"" you get this cumbersome back and forth thing: love story, Japanese planning attack, love story, Naval Intelligence meeting about possibility of an attack, love story, etcetera, etcetera. None of it crosses paths until, and not even then really, the attack itself. After seeing this, I now want to read up more on the actual events. The film makes no serious attempt to explain who knew what and when. All you really come away with, if the film represents the extent of your knowledge of the attack, is that Naval intelligence saw all the signs that an attack was possible, but basically ignored them.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be surprised to see this get nominated for an Academy Award or two. It's just good enough to leave it open for some technical awards like visual effects, sound, editing, things of that nature. But they couldn't possibly nominate this for Best Picture. Could they? Well, consider this. By this time last year two BP nominees, including ""Gladiator,"" the eventual winner, had already been released. And what has there been this year? Exactly.

","`Pearl Harbor' Sink or Swim<br/><br/>The film `Pearl Harbor,' opening Friday across the United States, will stir up more controversy than did the film the 1970 film `Tora! Tora! Tora!'. The 1970 film was far less biased than the new Touchstone Pictures film; it showed the attack from both the American and Japanese sides. The new film emphasizes a love story throughout the film between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) and two Army Air Corps pilots, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett). The film gives us 40 minutes of special effects action.<br/><br/>The problem studios run into when either period pieces and/or culturally sensitive films are made is getting `it' right.  `It' is historical events in the proper sequence, correct historical figures, dates, and the like. In the case of films involving different cultures, depicting the characters of a particular culture is a sensitive undertaking due to stereotyping and personal biases.<br/><br/>I grew up in Hawaii and clearly remember `Tora! Tora! Tora!' being filmed. The sight of fake Imperial Japanese Naval aircraft flying over Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base raised concerns and no doubt many memories from almost 30 years ago. The concerns at the time were not for the safety of island residents expecting another Pearl Harbor attack, but that the local island residents and tourists population which was majority Asian would not take offense to such a film being made. Concerns were put to rest when it was learned that the film would show both sides viewpoints in the attack, the film having American and Japanese screenwriters and directors accomplished this.<br/><br/>`Pearl Harbor' is an American film, made for hard-core biased American audiences. The film is not meant to be even handed in its judgment of the Japanese actions before, during, and after the attack. Unlike the 1970 film, which was generally well balanced representing both sides, `Pearl Harbor' stereotypes all Japanese as being enemies of the United States. The studio has already felt the backlash from Asian American civil rights organizations; the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) has voiced its alarm over the potential hatred and actions that may come from this film.<br/><br/>We will see in the next couple of weeks how the studios handle any fallout that may occur as a result of the film. Touchstone Pictures parent company Disney is releasing the film in slightly different versions in Japan and Germany, emphasizing romance over battle. This was a very expensive film to make; one source of potential loss of revenue may be in the Asian film marketplace, where typically American action films do well. One interesting item is that if the film is not seen as an insult to Japanese people in the Asian marketplace, then it may be seen as a patriotic film in the sense that Japan kicked the stuffing out of the United States and that the romance in the film is secondary. This idea may play well in Japan, but for Japanese and Japanese Americans residing here in the United States this film may lead to a renewal of stereotyping and hatred.  Lets hope that one biased film doesn't rehash a 60-year old wound."

","why, oh why did jerry bruckheimer and michael bay re-make titanic?  the parallels are startling, from the love triangle (even going as far as the not-quite-well-known british actress playing american) set against a national tragedy, to the talented actors wasted on a dismal script.  and, like titanic, the film succeeds in its endeavor to make teenage girls care more about the strikingly handsome actors and their petty problems than the thousands of lives lost.  some fans of the film may think i'm being overly harsh, and perhaps they are right.  the film is visually stunning (if over-edited at times), although the action shots are sometimes cliched (planes going between buildings in an alley reeks of the star wars trilogy). the effects are spectacular, although i'm not sure the bruckheimer/bay philosophy of ""bigger, faster, louder, more"" is always appropriate, especially for a sequence that lasts upwards of 30 minutes.  i got tired just watching it.  however, the love story was incredibly contrived.  kate beckinsale's character, evelyn is completely transparent and has no personality to speak of; the only background we get on rafe and danny is a 5-minute sequence at the beginning of the film where we see danny's WWI veteran father physically abuse him, and rafe ""come to his rescue"".  other than that, they are cliched stereotypes: rafe (ben affleck), the cocky pilot (with an apparent learning disability to make him appear more realistic--an unresolved plot element which is mentioned at two points in the film and never again), and danny (josh hartnett), the soft-spoken shy guy who depends on rafe to boost his self-confidence.  what we have is a love triangle that isn't really a triangle--danny doesn't get involved with evelyn until after rafe's ""death,"" and after rafe comes back, neither one of them actually have much to do with her (except, of course, getting in a fist-fight and lamenting their love for the same woman--no matter that rafe had only known evelyn 4 weeks when he went off to england, and danny and evelyn had only had one real date--in modern hollywood, this is what passes for love). and speaking of that fist-fight, did it strike anyone else as odd that rafe and danny jump in the same car and escape, and in the very next scene, they are on the beach together as if nothing had happened?  in any case, the love triangle should have been resolved during or directly after the pearl harbor bombing so that we could skip the last hour altogether.  don't get me wrong, i actually enjoyed the doolittle's raid section, i just think it should have been its own movie. historically speaking, the film was correct in dates and large events, but there were a number of small inaccuracies.  some of them have to do with modern equipment being visible on some of the ships in the harbor, and not many civilians would notice these.  others, like attending the charlie chaplin film ""the great dictator,"" which evelyn and danny find each other at in october of 1941 are possible, but not very plausible (the film was released in 1940 and i'm not sure how likely it would be to still be in theaters).  the biggest anachronism comes from danny during the bombing when he says ""i think world war II just started.""  at this point in history, the war was not being referred to as WWII yet.  that name came later, at least in the united states.  also, the japanese admiral speaks of ""getting in the war"" when they had BEEN in the war for nearly 10 years.<br/><br/>having not lived through world war II, i can't comment on the portrayal of the actual bombing or the japanese, but if michael bay was trying for the most PC script possible, i think he succeeded.  sure, the american pilots call them ""dirty japs,"" but i have a feeling this is one of the mildest names that would have been used for the people who bombed our harbor and killed thousands of american naval officers.  i believe that most of them would have had quite a few more choice phrases for the japanese. with all the gore, mass death and haunting images of the wounded, i am amazed that this film squeaked by with a PG-13 rating.  i can't imagine a realistic war film without an R rating, but then pearl harbor falls far short of realistic.  it does not challenge the viewer visually or intellectually, and the actors try to make up for a horrible script, filled with what seems like every war cliche ever invented, but in the end, even they cannot save this film."

The plot is trivial compared to the actual events, and the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.  I've never heard a script so full of cliches in any film before.  I like Ben Affleck as an actor in films like Chasing Amy and Dogma, but he doesn't have the presence to carry a film like this. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale make the best of the terrible script, and overall the acting is fine if not great. The film is not emotionally involving as the characters are severely underdeveloped stereotypes, so I ended up not really caring what happened to any of them.  It is also completely predictable.  While watching it, I had the nagging feeling that I'd seen it all somewhere before, only better. It does have its good points however, as the actual war scenes are very well filmed and more involving than the rest of the film. It's a shame that they spent so much time and money on what amounts to slightly more than a third of the film that they left the script to the last minute. This film had the potential to be great - well-known historical events, big budget to achieve this and a decent cast - all let down by an awful script."

Granted, the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor scene was well done (if you leave out the fact that the only two planes to make it in the air, of course, belong to our heroes).  And while I liked the Cuba Gooding Jr. Character walk-through part it was obvious that the creators said...hmm, we need some authentic hero story from the raid to counter-balance the tripe we're trying to unload with the two main heroes.  The best part of the scene was not the pyro-technics, nor the horror of the men as they died (both of which, I might add, were done infinitely better in Saving Private Ryan, a movie this one tried to compare itself with, yet without coming close to the true emotion and pain of it's predecessor), but the hospital scenes which showed the most true emotion and acting in the movie.  Outside of this, the rest of the movie was a melodramatic, walk-through, cheesey-dialogued, self-important piece of Hollywood trite romance at it's worst.  I have enjoyed Bay's films in the past because while they tend to have these paint-by-numbers romances in them, the films aren't overwhelmed by them.  He has undertaken the task of putting Pearl Harbor back ""on the map"" of American History, only to drive it off a cliff 3 hours too late.  There's too many good World War Two movies out there to have to watch this junk.  Try ""The Big Red One"" or ""Stalag 17"" before spending hard earned money just so other atrocities like this one will be made in Hollywood."

It's like a chronic liar that lies when it is not necessary, telling the listener more about the liar than the facts addressed. The acting was feckless, pacing slow and superficial. Technically it was a ""wow!"" but, who could care about these people? And besides, in 1941 a black sailor would not have likely been given medical care by a white nurse. Sorry, in 1941 the military was segregated! The black sailors would have been the last to be treated. Didn't everybody smoke cigarettes in 1941?

Maybe the romance was avoidable for such a film, but it had such a 'forties' feel (with the band music, etc) that you can't complain.  The action was brilliant, with great camera angles imitating Japanese planes.  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor made you forget all the bad things every one has said about it.  Maybe the Tokyo bombing afterwards extended the film's length a little too much, however, the ending where Walker dies was necessary, if a little expected.  In addition, the three main leads (especially Affleck and Hartnett) have enough charisma to keep the film going.

Yet, how could the most expensive movie in cinema history manage to take a tragedy like Pearl Harbor and turn it into a cold, prosaic, limp story?<br/><br/>The plot can be summed up in a brief sentence. Two best buddies fall in love with the same woman, go to war, Pearl Harbor gets bombed, one friend gets killed and they live happily ever after Nothing more!  It takes three hours for Michael Bay to tell a story that Mills & Boon's would shun with disgust. Bay tells his tale with all the grace of an overlong car advert, replete with slow motion shots and over saturated lighting (did they polish the negative of this film with Mr. Sheen?)<br/><br/>So what do you get for your money? Well, there is the actual bombing which is impressive, but never exciting. How can it be when you don't care about the fate of any of the characters. Bay attempts to throw you into the action, but you feel absolutely no attachment to the events depicted, you sit back and watch the money thrown against the screen. Unlike Saving Private Ryan, where the first thing the audience is thrust into is full out war, Pearl Harbor waits almost two hour until the events ensue. By this point you're so fed up with the movie you just want all of the protagonists to explode along with the bombs. The Stars and Stripes shine with all their might and never lose their patina as shrapnel flies all over the place. In fact, Ben Affleck's hair never loses its gleam as all hell breaks lose. This is war Hollywood style!<br/><br/>It's true to say Pearl Harbor has no heart. It's a testimony to how Hollywood has managed to turn the simple art of filmmaking into a commodity. Having seen how Titanic succeeded in making money out of an actual tragedy, Jerry Bruckheimer took all the ingredients of that film (including love story, long-length and a British actress playing the all American girl) and rehashed it. Ultimately, all the failures of the former are epitomised here, apart from this is worse because the novelty has gone. This film is like the new range of DKNY sunglasses: it exists to make money. For God's sake, look how they've re-edited the film for Japanese and German markets. If this film really had any thing say about the atrocities of December 7th 1941, it would never shy away from profoundly expressing the horror of war. Instead, it knows by blocking out these lucrative foreign markets it stands to never recoup its money. Alas, this is all it boils down to.<br/><br/>What's hurtful are Evelyn's (Kate Beckinsdale) final lines `America suffered and grew stronger through trial we overcame.' Do the words Hiroshima or Nagasaki mean anything to Bay and Bruckheimer? The carnage of America is completely forgotten. But I guess to the people watching the film in some fleabag cinema in Ohio, this is irrelevant. They want to be reminded of what a great nation of people they are; not how they vaporised a civilian population. Enjoy guy's just hand over the cash, sit back and let them tarnish all historical accuracy."

","Pearl Harbor I thought was a good movie. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody.

The director does an outstanding job of depicting the terror of the situation, without resorting to ""severed limbs"" tactics.  I was especially impressed with the use of the ""halo-like haze"" in the hospital scenes.  One gets the impression that, under such extreme circumstances, that may well have been just how the doctors and nurses saw it. He also pays excellent attention to details of that fateful morning.  Ben Affleck is okay, but the real star is Josh Hartnett.  His affable character and boyish shyness make him the hero of the story as much or more than his courageous deeds.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays the best (albeit a small) part as a young black soldier, fiercely and lovingly loyal to his country and his commander in what were for blacks in the 1940s Navy very difficult circumstances.  His poignant words of comfort to his dying Captain, and again later at the flag-draped casket, are some of the most memorable scenes of the film.  As I said, this movie should be required viewing for anyone between 13 and 35 (I'm 36), lest we forget (or worse yet, ignore) the horrible, bloody cost of the freedom we enjoy.

I'm going to give you food for thought, maybe you'll ponder it over during the 3 hour tour-de-Bay/Bruckheimer epic, or while you're writing death threats to all of us that didn't like the film.<br/><br/>Was this movie made with a PG-13 rating because A) with minimal gore and language, the makers could more accurately depict the horrific attack, or B) a lower rating means higher box office gross? <br/><br/>Were the hospital scenes shot with soft-focus lenses A) for artistic purposes or B) because a hard focus would be too realistic, thus giving the film an R-rating, thus decreasing its box office gross?<br/><br/>Was the historical tragedy used as a backdrop for a love triangle because A) thats the story director Michael Bay just had to tell at $145 million line of credit or B) Titanic did the same thing and made about a half billion.<br/><br/>
I can't do much to slam on the films leads. At least not in the clever questionnaire style. I enjoyed Ben Affleck's character about as much as I did in Reindeer Games. Up until now, I thought Josh Hartnet had a promising career. And Kake who? Excuse me, wasn't there another British Kate forcing out an American accent in that other boat-sinking spectacle of a movie? Hm?<br/><br/>The makers of this should have just dropped the other shoe and hired James Cameron as a screenwriter. At least his scripts have integrity.<br/><br/>I know Randal Wallace, who DID write this script, had help developing the shotty dialogue, so I don't blame him for the ""I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you"" and so on. I'm sure these slappy dappy lines SOUND good when you're in ninth grade, but they crash faster than shot down Japanese fighters when put on the screen.<br/><br/>I do blame Wallace for the ludicrous situations he places his characters in. Air Force trainers and trainees do NOT play chicken right infront of their commanding officers. The two pilots that flew in the attack on Pearl Harbor were NOT in the Doolittle Raid.<br/><br/>By the way, the raid had about a twenty minute build up and 30 second payoff, and even for slick summer action flicks, there's gotta be a bigger ending. <br/><br/>I'm not saying it was a bad movie (although it was) I'm just pointing out that it's not a film based on real people or real situations. At the heart of this picture, there's only two very distinct sounds. The first is Bay and Bruckheimer high-fiving each other, which translates to KA-CHING to the Disney company. The second is that flushing sound you hear when you realize your $8 are really gone."

","It seems incredible that one of the most pivotal events in American history is used as a vehicle for a conventional love triangle story with half an hour of 'amazing' special effects.  To see this on Armeggedon or Top Gun, both fiction, is one thing.  To see this on a film relating to a real event I think dishonours the war dead, and this is before you take into account the slur that yet another piece of revisionist script portrays.  It was bad enough that Hollywood chose to do it in films about the British (e.g. U-571) but it is amazing that even its own country's history is not safe.  If the US filmgoing audience think this is a suitable vehicle for a pyrotecnic blockbuster extravaganza, I give up."

","Excellent action replay of the actual attack but I thought the film was trying to be all things to all men, and that's never easy:<br/><br/>1. The romance angle would have made a good film by itself<br/><br/>2. The historical details were not as accurate as they could have been  - wasn't the liner 'Queen Mary' used as a troop ship in WW2 and painted all in grey ?  And the time when Rafe flew with the RAF in the Eagle Squadron was said to be 1941, but the type of combat action shown was typical of the Battle of Britain period in summer 1940. The Luftwaffe had given up daylight bombing raids over Britain by 1941 in favour of night attacks, i.e. 'The Blitz'. In any case its main activity in 1941 was supporting the German invasion of Russia.<br/><br/>3. The account of the Japanese planning of the attack and the American code breakers attempting to fathom out what was going on is another aspect that could well have made a good story in its own right.<br/><br/>But I think the way the critics have panned Kate Beckinsale's American accent is very unfair. It did not strike me as implausible, certainly no worse than the efforts of US actors to speak in English accents."

","I've found that the movies to roar on to the big screen lately have lacked a bit of originallity.  Pearl Harbor, needless to say, is just another moneymaking piece of trash that is no more exciting then Tuesdays with Morey.  If you took Cameron's stupid script for ""Titanic"", changed the names, the location, and the disaster, you've got ""Pearl Harbor"".  A two hour drawn out love story backed by a one hour disaster backed by three more minutes of useless info to take place of credits.  It's like Micheal Bay decided to feed his brain to Hannibal while Bruckheimer spent a load of money on movie that could have been directed by Renny Harlin.  In a nutshell. Spend your hard-earned money on good movies like Shrek or even Moulin Rouge, but do not waste your time with this worthless Hollywood creation."

","Pearl Harbor was superbly marketed, almost everyone knew about this movie, i went in the theatre, i was really excited, but when the movie started, 20 minutes into it i got bored, the romance should have been atleast serious, no spark between Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck, this looked like a slap-stick comedy.  Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't even have a major role, i have no idea what he was doing there.  The romance failed to topple over Enemy of the Gates romance, the battles failed to top over Saving Private Ryan. Micheal Bay is too paranoid, and during some romance scenes he just cuts into a war build-up.  Acting is horrible.  Could be the worst movie of the year.  Doesn't even deserve a rating.

","Just saw the movie today and enjoyed it. The special effects were a little over done and seemed like a video game in some scenes. However, I hangar with several of the Tora pilots from the Houston area that had their Jap replica aircraft barged to Pearl Harbor, and later flown to the Lexington and the Battle ship Texas. Will Bonefas who at 67 years of age, had his Val replica repainted in a wax based paint to resemble the silver and black color scheme of the attacking aircraft. Flying for 6 or 7 weeks took place at Pearl and also included Steve Hinton flying the P40. One of the replicas actually crashed while filming. The 72 year old pilot was shakened but survived! Later, Will flew to Corpus Christi Texas to a repainted carrier Lexington that was turned into a jap carrier and the later into the Hornet. There was some veteran opposition due to this carrier flying the Jap flag. The B25 and tora planes were actually launched off the static carrier. A final set was flown at the battleship Texas which was also repainted to resemble the Arizona and the Iowa. These aircraft were modified in 1969 for the film Tora Tora Tora and were WW2 AT6 advanced trainers and BT13 trainers with extended fuselages and modified tail feathers. Very few enemy aircraft exist today. Take time when the movie concludes and observe all of the credits. It is amazing how many fine folks participated in this movie. And of course, take a look at the pilot credits. These type of details help the realism and probably add to the 140 million price tag. And what would the rest of us pilots give to fly in this movie?"

","As the granddaughter of a Pearl Harbor survivor, I had high expectations of this movie when I first saw the trailer. From the point of initially hearing about it to actually seeing it, I read many reviews, none of which were too flattering. Too expensive. Too many explosives. Not enough plot. An unconvincing love story. I went to see it anyway, not sure what to expect anymore other than a long (3 hour) movie. I sat. I watched. And I have to say - all those negative reviews were incredibly unwarranted. The money spent was well worth it. The romance, although criticized as being sort of in the way, was not ""unconvincing"" and made the movie better. It was realistic and touching. Historically, it seemed fairly accurate but not very in-depth. Overall, I thought the movie was very good and does not deserve all of the negative reviews. Some, yes, but not all. I highly recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind sitting in the theater for 3 hours. (Hey, if you did it for Titanic, you can do it for this. And this is worth it...) I'm not a movie critic and so maybe I'm not able to sit and criticize it. As your average moviegoer, I actually enjoyed this movie. Unlike the critics, I thought the characters weren't boring and the movie wasn't just an excuse to rake in the box office profits. I don't know the exact points to look for in defining a ""good"" movie but as a member of the general public, I thought it was, in fact, good. I would consider this to be a worthy tribute to the actual Pearl Harbor. I commend Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. They did a good job on it."

","I saw Pearl Harbor the weekend it opened.  I think it was an awesome movie that everyone should see.  It portrayed the attack on Pearl very well, as confirmed by several veterans of WWII.  It opened my eyes to the horror and reality of it in a way not many movies have done.<br/><br/>And now the down side:  Normally I am a real ""chick flick"" lover and appreciate a good love story, but not in this one.

","This is a good movie surrounding the days preceding Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo that occurred in April of 1942. The love that Rafe, Billy, and Evelyn share is especially nice, you don't have to be a fan of love stories to like it. The special effects are good, using technology of today to show several fighter scenes during the Pearl Harbor attack. But if you are someone who knows the events of the attack, or the Doolittle raid, you will be a little disappointed in the movies accuracy. But it is definitely worth watching; just see it with an open mind, and understand that it was meant to be a fictional account, and that the Director had no intention to be accurate concerning the attack on Pearl Harbor, nor did he try. Enjoy the movie, and take along a tissue or handkerchief, you'll need it."

Pearl Harbor is a movie without a heart, it never gets you and Bay & co. try to do that in as many ways as you could think. If you like Mr. Bay cinematographic style you will be able to see all the stuff he was doing in his previous works altogether.

","It's not that Pearl harbor is a bad movie. In fact many parts of it were quite enjoyable. My dissatisfaction comes from the fact that this is obviously an attempt at a summer movie rather than an Oscar candidate. If I was a World War II vet (or any vet for that matter) or a Pearl Harbor survivor, I honestly think I'd be extremely ticked off.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor was a profound event in American History. The attack basically awakened America from its Great Depression and launched us into WWII and eventually the atomic age/cold war/etc. I get goose bumps every time I listen to FDR's famous speech. And yet this movie spends more time trying to entertain than providing the real drama of the tragedies of war. They show the Arizona exploding but don't follow it all the way down, I did not feel the sorrow in the aftermath scenes that I did in Saving Private Ryan, when this was an ultimately more tragic event in that we were the losers. If they wanted real drama drop 30 minutes of the love story and focus 30 more minutes on the tragedy of war.<br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan this isn't. This is WWII meets Armaggedon. It's a very well done Summer Movie. However anything dealing with Pearl Harbor deserves better than a summer movie listing. 7-10"

","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>I didn't expect much coming from Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. Don't get me wrong, I own quite a few of their movies. But, as in those movies, it was extremely similar: (Armageddon - Ben Affleck goes into space and she loses her father) (Pearl Harbor - Ben Affleck goes to England, is thought dead, she gets pregnant by his best friend, Ben comes back, and she loses his best friend). Now, I love Ben Affleck. I think he's turned out some pretty good performances. <br/><br/>I was impressed with the majority of the cast. Explain something to me though, why is Cuba Gooding,Jr. doing so many period peices? Jon Voight was great as Roosevelt,Mako as always was great, Kate Beckensale was good as Evelyn, and I was pleasantly surprised with Dan Ackroyd. I had no idea he was in this movie. William Fitchner was excellent as young Danny's father. You may recognize him from Armageddon. Again, seeming to refer to Bruckheimer's ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" theory. Find a pretty girl, throw her into a tumultuous love story, lots of explosions, and a happy ending.<br/><br/>My father was in WW2, and for him this movie was pretty much dead on, once it got to the fight scenes. He was an aircraft engineer, and was at Pearl after all the fighting. He saw the carnage first hand. Said that was how it looked in the aftermath, so at least they got something right.<br/><br/>In a way, Im glad this movie was made, as much as Im dogging it. It was a good film, I didnt check my watch once (although I did get up to go to the bathroom). My son will hopefully never know war, but I want him to know what the U.S. went through as a country to get to where we are today. The closeset Ive ever come to war was when my older brother was sent to Desert Shield/Storm. That didnt really seem like a war to me, though. I was able to watch it on CNN. I feel M*A*S*H was more of a war to me. Sad, isnt it? A television show that was on when I was a child seemed more real to me than an acutal war that happened when I was 16. <br/><br/>I just hope that we never have to face world war 3, since we would all be demolished. We would never know what hit us. <br/><br/>Thank you to all the people who kept America free, after this sleeping giant had been awoken. Especially you, dad."

","Lots of good scenes when they actually get into the bombing and the Japanese point of view was also done fairly well.  The horribly sappy love story really shot the film down.  The character Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) and the other nurse were not portrayed very well, women in the 40's didn't act like that.  To improve the movie they should have completely ditched the love story along with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and stuck used the story of Doris 'Dorie' Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who was the most interesting and of the characters presented and one of the few who was a real person. Overall I'd say you might as well pass on this one it wasn't really worth seeing."

This film was very aesthetically pleasing; the special effects were outstanding and the sets were intricate and believable.  However, the actors were poorly cast and the screenplay was wordy and contrived.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck, who at the release of this film completed the requirements for graduation of the School of Overacting (Founding Member Richard Crenna), is too whiny and slack-jawed to handle the role of leading man in this picture. I wanted him to die (SPOILER) and was disappointed when he didn't.  Josh Hartnett was believable at best, but his performance suffered from Affleck's lack of believability.  Kate Beckinsale was also mediocre, although I did enjoy the fugue-like scenes during the inital attack.<br/><br/>This movie tried to be too much and was very crowded, even though it was three hours long.  The Cuba Gooding aside was completely superfluous. Although I enjoyed his character, the subplot added little.  The best performance hands-down was that of Jon Voight as FDR.  The heavily made-up Voight turned in a stunningly accurate portrayal of a great leader. <br/><br/>Rent this movie or get it on pay-per-view, but only if you have 3 hours to waste.

","In the opening of `Pearl Harbor', we find two boyhood friends - Rafe Mcawley and Danny Walker, playing at a farm. We learn that Danny's father is a war veteran turned abusive father and Rafe is Danny's best friend, loyally looking out for him and assuming the role as an older brother. The audience is jetted towards the future, months before the attack of Pearl Harbor - where the two buddies, Rafe played by Ben Affleck and Danny played by Josh Hartnett, much older and excellent pilots, are training. Rafe meets Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyn Johnson during an eye test. Although, using Danny's help, he cheats because of his dyslexia, she passes him. The two instantly fall in love and play back and forth until Evelyn finally surrenders and the two are whisked into cheesy, dragging romance. Beckinsale and Affleck have no chemistry and I, personally, did not connect or care about the two. However, they did do the best with the sappy and unrealistic lines that were written for them - and their bliss does provide a clear contrast and foreshadowing of the horror to come. Beckinsale was nothing extraordinary, but she does surprise the audience later in the film - her character becoming more profound and heroic. <br/><br/>Rafe abandons Evelyn and Danny when he volunteers to fly with the highly respected `Eagle Squadron' with the British where he will go to war - and I'm afraid that I can't spoil what happens thereon. Any way, a love triangle between Danny, Rafe and Evelyn takes shape. While Affleck and Beckinsale were not very believable or intriguing, Hartnett and Beckinsale played off each other very well and were extremely funny and touching. Some of the supporting roles are not very original and they added little to the to the movie. But after the film picks up a little, we go on a realistic thrill ride throughout the attack of Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle brigade.<br/><br/>Despite the critc's harsh and unfair bashing of `Pearl Harbor', I found it an incredible experience. Perhaps the critics have lost sight of what a movie is made for - the audience. The director, Michael Bay, seemed very impatient in the beginning of the movie, however I felt he made up for this with his powerful and heart-stopping depiction of the actual attack and brigade. Although the love triangle is what holds the movie together and perhaps makes it a little more interesting and develops the characters, the movie really is about war and being an American and it focuses mainly on the relationship between Danny and Rafe, which is very compelling - as well as entertaining. You will be proud to be an American, despite our mistakes, when you walk out of the theatre - trust me. Jon Voight had Roosevelt down to a T. Cuba Gooding Jr. also delivered a wonderful performance as an actual cook at Pearl Harbor. However, I felt his story was overshadowed a little and deserved more time. Alec Baldwin took a lot from this movie - his performance was laughable and I found it very hard to believe that he was at all sincere as Doolittle - an actual general who led men to revenge after the attack. However, overall - Josh Hartnett stole the spotlight, giving his greatest performance by far. Although he was not an unknown actor prior to this, hopefully this film will be a great step up in his career... he was very captivating on screen and in my opinion he was the star of the film, not Affleck. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend you see this movie - it really will blow you away, don't expect too much in the beginning except for some pretty good comedy - but don't worry, it will get better. Michael Bay did an amazing job depicting the war scenes... the movie is barely `R'- you'll see what I mean. So, what are you waiting for? Yeah, it's no masterpiece, but it makes up for its faults and it did get its message across very successfully - this is one to see at the theatre, certainly a crowd pleaser. I only wish that Bay was a little less impatient and had tried to make this film a masterpiece and spent a little more time developing the characters and perfecting them. But what can you do, he accomplished a pretty hard task very well."

Astonishingly shallow would more correctly describe it.  Other than a 45 minute reliving of the dramatic attack on Pearl Harbor that managed to capture the horror to a decent extent, the remaining 135 minutes of the movie is a love story that grasps your heart about as much as seeing Donald Duck drooling over Daisy Duck. SPOILER ALERT After Ben Affleck's character, Rafe, ""dies"" at war it is made incredibly obvious that Evelyn will fall in love with Danny that you can pretty much hear the director yelling it out.  In what was a sure death for anybody else on this planet it turns out that Rafe, with his surprisingly modern look and hair style, indeed survived and has come back to claim his woman.  The remainder of this love story is boring and predictable, and the producers should apologize to anyone led to believe this movie was predominantly about the actual conflict between the Americans and the Japanese and attack itself on Pearl Harbor, when in fact it is more of a two-star love story.  Shame on the producers for going so softly on what really happened in fear of offending the Japanese and Japanese-Americans.

","If this movie was about a fictional attack by some anonymous rogue nation, then I would say the movie was entertaining and leave it at that. But the subject matter is about one of the most important events in the history of the United States and it demands better treatment. To explain the attack in terms of the oil embargo alone without an explanation as to why the United States placed the embargo is really ludicrous. The embargo was placed because the Japanese had invaded China, committed barbarous atrocities against the Chinese people and were determined to occupy Indo-China and all of Asia. The United States would have lifted the embargo if the Japanese had withdrawn from China and left Indo-China alone. Also, the movie left out the main inhabitants of the island of Oahu, namely the people native to Hawaii. Where were they? The love story did not require 130 minutes of the 170 minute running time. The attack scenes were done very well but seem empty when history is distorted as it was in this film."

","On May 30th I went to see Pearl Harbor. I had read many reviews.I have learned  years ago not to pay attention to what reviewers or self styled reviewers have to say about a film. I know that the ""perfect"" film has never been made, and never will.<br/><br/>I watched the first part of the story unfold and was reminded of the ""love stories"" that were so much a part of the war films made during the WWII years. Of course that was before the meaning of love was changed to mean only a sexual encounter, and that romance was removed from many persons vocabulary.<br/><br/>I Was five years old when Pearl Harbor was attacked. I remember exactly where I was when the annoucement was made. My world as I knew it began to change. And the world around me made a very sudden change.<br/><br/>I wonder how many young people today really know that the world they live in, is a result of what began on Dec. 7th?<br/><br/>As the movie reached the portion where the ""attack too place"" I felt my pulse began to go a little faster. The attack was excellently produced and over the length of time it was on the screen, I had the feeling that I was there. The noise, the confusion, the anger, the loss of life was made very very real by the makers of the film. And the heartbreak!<br/><br/>After returning from Pearl Harbor last October, and having visited the Arizona Memorial, I read a book titled ""Descent into Darkness. Written by a Navy Diver who was part of the diving teams who went into the complete blackness of the water, and helped search for survivors on the Arizona and other ships. While watching the frustrating scene where the sailors hand comes through the hole in the steel and could not be saved, reminded me of the book. When Commander Raymer (navy diver) entered the Arizona he found that many of the sailors had been decapitated from the force of the explosion, slamming them against the steel bulkheads (walls)<br/><br/>The ending of this fine film was of course based on a historical fact. It clearly showed the next step that was taken to show the Japanese that they indeed had ""wakened a sleeping giant"".<br/><br/>We (my wife and I) are going to see the film again, and buy the  DVD when it is available."

","It's obvious that when Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heard about the record breaking gross for TITANIC, they put heads together and said, ""let's make our own 20th century tragic disaster film.""  Thus in early 1998 Bruckheimer and Bay announced the planning on making the film PEARL HARBOR. The original cast included Cameron Diaz and Gene Hackman, but through time the actors became Kate Beckinsdale and Jon Voight.  But it would be expected that there would be big explosions and special effects for this film.  And this film does have big explosions and special effects. But first let's get to the plot (which some would critize that there really isn't one).  Ben Affleck plays Kentucky native Rafe McCawley (with a bad Southern accent) and Josh Hartnett is his long time best friend Danny Walker.  Rafe falls in love with volunteer nurse Evelyn Johnson (the ravishing beautiful Kate Beckinsdale), and Rafe tells Evelyn that he is going over to England to help the English fight against the Nazi's, since this is in early 1941.  Rafe's plane is hit while flying causing his plane to crash and Danny and Evelyn to think he's dead.  So to put the past behind, Evelyn falls in love with Danny, and realizes that Danny is more ""fun"" to be with.  Then Rafe comes back stateside and shocks both Danny and Evelyn, and did I forget to mention that this is in Hawaii and it's December 6th 1941?  Anyways, just when Rafe and Danny's friendship is about to come to a end, dozens of Japanesse airplanes fly into Hawaii and begin attacking Pearl Harbor, thus making it a frighting and unforgettable scenes to watch.<br/><br/>There is good news and bad news about this film.  The good news, the attack of Pearl Harbor is frighting, spectacular, exciting, and unforgettable.  The bad news, in this 3 hour plus film, it takes 90 minutes for the film to get to the attack.  So it's another obvious factor, Bay is trying to pull the romantic factor from TITANIC to make the character's three dimensional.  But there's a difference, Leonardo DiCapprio and Kate Winslet had chemistry, Affleck, Beckinsdale and Hartnett don't.  That makes the first nintey minutes of PEARL HARBOR very very s-l-o-w and unintresting. You just want everyone to die just so it can get to the attack, since the characters are so cliche.  And the supporting characters are no better for both the men (the guy who tries to get a girl in bed, the one who stutters, the one who wonders why can't he get a girl) and the women (the flirt, the brain, the obese one, etc.)  Then the film shows scenes of airplane flying in the clouds during a sunset that looks like something from Bruckheimer's other flying film, TOP GUN (which also was another boring romance film). I was just waiting to hear Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" being played in the soundtrack. Then it happens.  The attack.  The Japanesse planes fly in looking like something from one of the STAR WARS films.  They fly over a valley, over a woman hanging clothes on a line, and by a baseball field where kids are playing a early morning game.  The first torpedo is dropped, as the sailors wonder was is heading towards them, and BOOM!!! All hell breaks loose.  For the next seventy minutes is very horrific scenes of sailors getting shot, blown up, or even drowned.  This is when the movie works, it's just as intense as the sinking of TITANIC and just has frighting as the attack of Normady in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film's pacing went from 10 mph to 100 mph!!!  Then, the attack is over and the film drops back to 15 mph, brining the sappy love story back into the spotlight, and making the audience groan. I did enjoy the acts of PEARL HARBOR II and III, but part I should have been cut, massively.  Bay figured that people want a three hour romantic epic, and yes we do, but we also want intresting characters!! I really didn't care much of the acting by the actors who played fictional characters (but Kate Beckinsdale was so pretty to look at that I would rather be with her and die at Pearl Harbor than to be on the sinking Titanic with Kate Wislet).  It's the actors who play the factual characters that are good: Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Dorie Miller, a colored sailor who fought back at the Japanesse during the attack; Jon Voight as the respectable President Roosevelt who will not let America fall down to the Japanesse; and Alec Baldwin as the crusty and brave Col. Doolittle who led the defense attack at Tokyo because of Pearl Harbor. I did also highly enjoy the score by Academy winner Hans Zimmer.  The score to this film is more romantic and whimiscal, unlike his dramatic scores like from THE ROCK, CRIMSON TIDE, and GLADIATOR, so it was a very nice different change.  And Randall Wallace does succeed and fail with the script, he succeeds during and after the attack, he fails during the first 90 minutes. But compared to the other summer films (MUMMY RETURNS, SHREK, and KNIGHT'S TALE) PEARL HARBOR is the best summer film, so far.  I know it's not saying much since so far this is a very disappointing summer, but I did enjoy it more than the others.  It's not a classic that Touchstone Pictures is pushing it to be, and it's no TITANIC that Bruckheimer and Bay are trying to make it be.  But it is entertaining and enjoyable, and is worth watching.

","Actually, I liked this one better than James Cameron's ""Titanic,"" but only liked it. It's the kind of movie that, like popcorn, is okay while your eating it, but doesn't leave you very full.<br/><br/>The film's centerpiece, the attack on Pearl Harbor, is a special effects gold mine that generally comes off fairly well, although some of the stuff, like Japanese planes flying on their sides in between buildings, was a little silly looking.  And every vehicle that was hit did NOT explode like a gasoline tanker truck.  Following bombs down from a ""bomb's eye view"" also seemed a little silly.<br/><br/>But in general, the scene went well.<br/><br/>What went less well was the rest of the movie.  For me, the love triangle around which the film was built came off as largely what it was, simply a vehicle to carry the story along to the Cameron/Spielberg style ""big scene."" For me, the problem was not the idea, but the execution.<br/><br/>All three of the protagonists gave rather lifeless performances.<br/><br/>Ben Afleck has done better work other places and always seems to me more suited to bad guy roles than he is to playing the hero. It's part of the problem with modern movies, though.  There seem to be no Jimmy Stewarts or Henry Fondas or James Cagneys around, no larger than life personalities who can take these mediocre characters and lift them up. Josh Harnett was even weaker and other than being good looking, I simply didn't get what the girl saw in him.<br/><br/>Kate Beckensale, who I have liked in many roles in the past, including ""Brokedown Palace,"" ""Last Days of Disco,"" and her British work, fails here in my view, underplaying most of her big scenes.  Maybe it's the fact that she was a cardboard character, the Army nurse with no backstory to build upon, but she simply missed here, with the exception of her scene during the battle, where she got it together to some extent, but not completely.  I expected better work from her.<br/><br/>But the acting was universally flat among the three of them, and that usually points a finger at a director. Like Cameron, Spielberg and DeMille before them, big picture, spectacle directors usually aren't all that good at getting things out of actors and Bay seems to be in that mold -- better at blowing things up than whittling things down to their emotional cores.<br/><br/>I give it a good, solid ""B"".  It's entertaining, but not enlightening.  I still feel a lot more for Henry Fonda's character in ""Mr. Roberts.""  We never see him die, never see a shot fired in the whole movie, but he comes off as much more of a war hero than anyone in ""Pearl Harbor."""

I sat through the first hour with friends, several of whom said they were going to leave (but didn't) and we weren't the only ones snorting into our popcorn with disbelief or guffawing at quite incredibly banal lines. How Kate Beckinsale got mixed up in this I don't know, she is a very highly educated woman (even if her father was a Seventies sitcom star)- the money I suppose, that is usually it. When she said some really awful line I half expected her to turn to the camera and give a knowing wink at times.<br/><br/>That said, I have to give it to ILM, the attack scenes are brilliant, especially the shot following the bomb down, if cartoonish and I'm not sure it was possible to fly planes that close to the ground or close together without wind shear causing upsets, but no matter for that section of the film I was transfixed.<br/><br/>The film is very easy on the Japanese who were a fascist military dictatorship who did after all attack without declaring war and whilst still talking peace.<br/><br/>Some gripes, the whole cinema here laughed when (over a siren sounding the all clear not the alert) the newsreel spoke of Hitler's Luftwaffe bombing 'downtown London' (it just sounds very odd to British ears), Roosevelt's cabinet members talked of giving aid to Russia before it was in the war (the US did give the UK help before it joined the war but made us pay handsomely for it) and I just couldn't get Ewen Bremner's 'Trainspotting' role out of my mind when seeing him in this. This was the first and probably last raid there ever was on US citizens in what was very nearly US territory, but I think US audiences should remember London had raids like this almost daily in 1940/41 and continuing for years after (the last German bomb to fall on London was in March 1945!).<br/><br/>If you go to this with the right attitude of healthy scepticism and an ear for irony (not something our American counsins are always good at)you'll probably have a good time. If not, for European audiences it is far too cloyingly sentimental. Voight will probably get Best Supporting Oscar for Roosevelt though.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoiler*<br/><br/>

","This film deals with the sudden Japanese attack on a triangular love affair that wasted the first hour of film.  After seeing the people watching the planes come in to Pearl, Cuba Gooding doing an excellent Dorie Miller, the Oklahoma slowly going bottom up and taking many brave sailors with her, and the bomb landing in the main stack of the Arizona, there's not much left of this yawner to contemplate.  If you want to watch an exciting and historically accurate film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, then see Tora, Tora, Tora which has enough action in it that the attack sequences lasted almost as long as the actual attack did, December 7, 1941. The love interest is maudlin, and shallow and unnecessary.  It took up absolutely too much of the film, but was simplistic enough to appeal to the mindless bubble-gum crowd (as their reviews so overtly suggest). It is too bad that the people who put this turkey together don't have the talent to do a film that goes over the heads of the 16-17 age group to adults.  But then, maybe not enough adults go to the movies to make cerebral films profitable."
"jmoney-2","3","0","0","2 June 2001"," A spectacular calamity -- and I'm not talking about the attack!
","About thirty minutes into the new movie Pearl Harbor I realized that I'd been rolling my eyes so much that they actually started to hurt. But as time went on, the eye-rolling and the groaning gave way to laughter and smiles as I began to revel in sheer amazement that so many people could spend so much money to produce something so stupefyingly awful. <br/><br/>Make no mistake, Pearl Harbor is a bad movie. But at the same time, I would be hard pressed to discourage anyone from seeing it. To do so would deprive them of the rare opportunity to take in a spectacular calamity -- and I'm not talking about the Japanese sneak attack. <br/><br/>Film students would be wise to see the film so as to learn what not to do. The script is so wrought with cliches and bad dialogue, it stands as a lesson in how not to write a screenplay. Drama students should see the movie to learn how not to act on screen. <br/><br/>The one thing you won't learn much about, is World War II.<br/><br/>
The movie is less concerned with Japanese troop movements and preparations than it is with a fictional love triangle between two best-buddy fighter pilots and the cute nurse they both love.<br/><br/>
Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, respectively, two Tennessee farm boys-turned hot shot aces. Early scenes of the boys in training are highly reminiscent of another Jerry Bruckheimer-produced picture -- Top Gun (one of their fellow pilots is even named, Goose).<br/><br/>
Affleck's performance is very hammy. Putting on a silly Southern accent, Affleck's Rafe comes across as more of a caricature than a character. Hartnett, on the other hand, is so devoid of personality and charisma that his character barely registers at all. As the American nurse, Evelyn, British actress Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous in the period costumes, and she's the only one of the three who doesn't embarrass herself.<br/><br/>
The love story is so full of corn, I began to wonder if the filmmakers had to pay royalties to the Orville Redenbacher company. There's more corn here than in the whole state of Iowa.<br/><br/>
Of course, the romance is only there to fill time until we get to the other main reason to see the picture -- the attack sequence, which is visually spectacular. Director Michael Bay once again shows his only real talent is knowing how to blow stuff up (there's a shot where the camera follows a bomb as it hurtles toward the deck of the USS Arizona; it's very cool). <br/><br/>But as great as the sequence looks, it lacks power. It's like watching a video game. Only extras and bit players bite the dust -- there's no emotional connection to the horror we're witnessing. There's also very little blood and carnage; the nameless, faceless sailors just disappear in balls of fire as the bombs hit their targets.  None of it feels real. When the film cuts to Evelyn at the base hospital, Bay intentionally makes the image blurry so we're spared very graphic shots of the wounded.<br/><br/>
As good a showman as Bay is, he's also sloppy at times. There's a shot of a B-29 that's supposed to be flying, but from the angle of the aircraft, it's clear that the plane is merely sitting on a runway with its propellers spinning.<br/><br/>
After the Pearl Harbor sequence, the movie attempts an appropriate third act resolution by tacking on the true-life story of Doolittle's Raiders, who made a daring bombing run over Tokyo that boosted American morale and provided a little revenge. Once again our fictional flyboys are conveniently placed in the middle of the action. But the movie takes a turn for the worse with Alec Baldwin's ludicrously over-the-top performance as Col. Doolittle, the leader of the raid. It's as if Baldwin thinks he's doing a Saturday Night Live sketch -- he's a parody of himself.<br/><br/>
The other prominent historical figure on display is Franklin Roosevelt, played very nicely by Jon Voight. The make-up job, by effects wizard Stan Winston, is stunning. Voight is made to look so much like FDR, it's scary.<br/><br/>
But what's really scary is the movie's dumbing down of American history. At one point, we get a look inside the cockpit of one of the Japanese fighter planes, and we see a photo of the battleship Arizona, placed there so the pilot can recognize his target. But beneath the photo, the ship's name is written out -- in English!. It's just one example of how little respect the movie has for its audience."

","It may seem unfair for one to review this movie without having seen it but the typical Hollywood hype has caused virtually all of us to have ""experienced"" this trashy film before it was even released.  As an historian, I admit to being a harsh critic when it comes to making a movie about a real historic event.  Tora Tora Tora was an excellent re-creation of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, but this movie is grossly inaccurate.  I find it amusing to read reviews of this movie.  It was loved by younger viewers (aka the MTV/Brittney Spears generation)for its special effects but older viewers have trashed it for its silly dialogues and predictable love triangle.  But what turned me off months before the movie was released to general audiences was the fact that Ben Affleck plays an American fighter pilot who gets into the air that day to take on hundreds of Japanese planes.  How absurd!!!!!!!  It is a well-documented fact that only two American fighter pilots, lieutenants Welsh and Taylor, managed to get into the air on December 7 and in their outclassed P-40s, managed to combine to shoot down seven Japanese planes.  Taylor was wounded in his arm by .30mm slugs from a Zero.  It is sacreligious to have any actor portray a fictional fighter pilot in such a well-documented event.  Garbage as usual."

","""Pearl Harbor"" is worth seeing, no matter what you may have heard.  There is a love story which takes up a major portion of beginning of the film but there is enough history in it to keep your interest.  <br/><br/>The historical details of the film are good for the most part, however there are some major problems here and there.  The first one I noticed was the uniforms of the U.S.  This uniform used for this film was wrong.  There had been some changes to it in the late 1930's when the army air corp was beginning its transition to becoming the USAF in the late 40's.  The second major problem was the ability of Ben Affleck's character of Rafe, being able to go to England and fight in the RAF's Eagle squadron as an activity duty U.S. officer in 1940.  This could not happen as the U.S. and nearly 50 other countries had signed a neutrality treaty before World War I.  This practice was strictly prohibited.  The third significant problem was the character of Admiral Kimmal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  He was not concerned with the Pearl being attacked and in fact, NO ONE was concerned at all.  At that time in history, it was considered far too difficult to take two carrier groups over 4000 nautical miles and hit Pearl.  The fourth major problem was the character of Jappannese Admiral Yammamoto.  He was portrayed as just a leader and almost seemed an after thought.  In fact, he was the most brilliant stratagist and one of the best leaders the Japannese had.  His planning of his attack on Pearl was painstakingly detailed and planned. There were also some minor problem, but ones that could not have been avoided, such as the visible features on the Japannese carriers that are only seen on our Nimitz Class carriers.  <br/><br/>The biggiest problem  I had with the film was the love story.  They spent way too much time on it and it detracted, severely from the story of Pearl Harbor.  They should have cut nearly 45 minutes of the love story and concentrated more on the planning of the attack on Pearl and Dolittle's raid on Japan.  This would have made the film much better and would have given more feeling and/or meaning to the film.  It appeared to me that Bay and company failed to realize that Pearl Harbor really ""means"" something to Americans, especially to the Vets.  <br/><br/>Overall, worth your while (7 out of 10)."
"Sailor Leila","1","0","0","2 June 2001"," *What* a goddamn stinker!
","The trailer for ""Pearl Harbor"" left me in virtually no doubt that I would love it, weep over it, etc. The opening scene of the movie did nothing to prove me wrong - it's a brilliantly scored, brilliantly shot scene between the two ""brothers"" who will (unfortunately) become Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck, and a fight with a father who served in World War I, where he saw plenty he wished he hadn't. It's like warning about the movie, really... I didn't take the hint.<br/><br/>The scene left me in no doubt that before the movie was out, I'd have shed many a tear. But when a movie is *so* bad in its first hour or so that you begin wishing the Japs would just *drop the bomb, for god's sake!*, it means one of two things: 1) I have ADD; or 2) Alert, we have a stinker here.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is ""Jerry Bruckheimer: The Clip Show"". It's two movies in one, with enough good moments to fit on one hand, in which anyone with slight movie knowledge (and let's face it, the guy only does blockbusters) can recognise such movies as ""Crimson Tide"", ""Armageddon"", ""Top Gun"", and ""The Rock"". What are the good moments? Alright, I'll list them:<br/><br/>The first scene: loved it. It was a nice turnaround when the kid called the father ""German,"" and the fact that no more violence intervened made it absolutely clear how he felt about that word.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr.: The best actor in the movie by far, in two of his (not many more) scenes with the captain of his ship. First, he is told the ship is proud of him, and it bounces off his face wonderfully. Then, as the captain dies, he is placed in full command of the ship, but he tells the captain before the last breath ""Everyone's where they should be - you trained us great."" Loved it. Also, Cuba's face when firing the gun. I swear, against Hartnett and Affleck and anyone else, Hollywood needs more actors like Cuba Gooding Jr. who aren't afraid to expose some real emotion onscreen.<br/><br/>Most of the hospital stuff - very raw, very real. The key moment is when Kate Beckinsale forces herself to take control, and grabs a nervous doctor and says *so* firmly it almost got those tears from me, ""Doctor- look at me - what do you need?""<br/><br/>Okay, technically all those won't fit on my hand, but that's about all there is folks. I know I can be really brutal on this movie because if you're taking issue with my words, you'll go and see the movie just to prove me wrong. I wish I had the strength to not go to Summer movies, but y'know, we just have to.<br/><br/>So ""Pearl Harbor"" absolutely stinks in my opinion. In parts it flows like a really bad soap opera (complete with Patrick Duffy style character resurrections), in parts like a simple compilation of the best of Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>Most striking of all is that in contrast to all the criticism of Hollywood being too ""American"" regarding historical movies, in this effort, the Americans are presented as a self-pitying, stupid, stuttering, nerve-jangling useless bunch of preppies. All, surely, to build that suspense for the bombing scenes (I'm sure I wasn't the only one who smiled when realisation dawned that *Action's finally approaching!* -- believe me, you *want* the Americans to lay down and die after the first hour). The love story is laughable, the score is mostly good but headachingly repetitive sampling chunks of ""The Thin Red Line"" and Bruckheimer's other hits, the actors are... well, simply put, the actors are no Tom Cruises or Gene Hackmans or Sean Connery. Bruckheimer has to realise that he has a package that doesn't yield to tinkering. Leave the serious stuff to Spielberg, keep the story, sure, but fill it with decent actors as usual. *Please*!<br/><br/>As to the battle scenes, if that's why you're going - don't bother. I read one magazine saying ""you've never seen anything like it"" - well, that's a lie, it's all been seen before. The only unique shot is the one you've seen, the POV shot from the bomb going down on Pearl Harbor. Everything else is like a video game. This is *not* the zenith of CGI, that won't happen until a good director uses them to realise a good script. If you can, resist seeing this movie. I'm so pleased that the average user rating on this site is lower than I expected it to be. It shows there's sense in the world. We deserve better than this."

","Michael Bay is a filmmaker whose ineptitude knows no bounds.  It's really astounding to me that a guy of such limited ability gets these huge budgets and choice summertime opening weekends.<br/><br/>With ""Pearl Harbor"", he has once again employed his standard bag of tricks - lots of noise and plenty of special effects in place of any substance, jingoistic patriotism in place of any meaning.  Of course, this is what a vast portion of the movie-going public loves, so I guess his budgets shouldn't be surprising at all.<br/><br/>To call this movie a comic-book version of the early days of World War II would be insulting to the comic book medium.  The intent is for ""Pearl Harbor"" to be a ""Titanic""-style tragic love story.  The flaw with this plan is that it's built on characters whose only distinguishing characteristics are their names.  I never got a chance to care about which of the two flyboys the nurse would choose - the phrase ""love triangle"" applied to the movie is accurate in that it's two-dimensional like a triangle, inaccurate in that I didn't ever get a sense of the characters being in love.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of the film is, of course, the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor.  Bay's staging of the event has at least one merit: it reminds us of the brilliance of Steven Spielberg's D-Day invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" by being so limp in comparison.  Where Spielberg was able to introduce method and meaning to the madness of his battle scenes, Bay merely gives us dozens upon dozens of explosions, and shot after shot of Japanese planes firing their torpedos.  What could have and should have been a memorable, virtuoso Hollywood battle scene instead winds up playing like it was put together with stock footage.<br/><br/>Blame for the picture's stupidity can't rest entirely on Bay's shoulders, of course.  The writer, Randall Wallace, must take his lumps as well.  Not only is every twist and turn of the plot as predictable as the sun rising in the east, the dialogue is as bad as in any movie you'll see this year.  When the invasion begins, one character brilliantly explains, ""I think World War II just started.""  I wish I had the space to go into detail about how and why that line is one of the most idiotic lines in any film ever, but I shall spare you that particular rant.  Desperately trying to show that the Japanese are not just the stock villains of War-era movie serials, he gives us the sad and wise Japanese admiral with fortune-cookie dialogue such as ""A truly brilliant man would find a way to avoid war"" and ""I fear we have done nothing more than awaken a sleeping giant"" (which serves the dual purpose of making the Japanese Admiral sad and wise and also reminds the audience that the USA is going to go kick some Japanese booty and get revenge!).<br/><br/>It makes me kind of sad how many people are going to swallow this tripe, go back for seconds and thirds and rave about what a great movie it is.  My advice?  For less than the price of a matinee admission to ""Pearl Harbor"" you can go to your local video store, rent ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" and get much better films covering the same events."

Some spoilers may have occurred during writing.**<br/><br/>At one point or another, in talking about a movie, we've all either heard or said that the romantic sub-plot seemed tacked on.  Never before has a romance been so obviously tacked on as it was with this film.  Just to give an idea as to how cheesy the romance is; there is actually a scene where Ben Affleck's character is on a train, leaving for England, and Kate Beckinsale's character is running alongside the train saying goodbye.<br/><br/>Now to say that the dialogue and the story is sappy and insulting is redundant.  Anyone can write a bad script.  But with this film, even the cinematography is cheesy.  Note to Michael Bay: Just because you can move the camera, doesn't mean you should.  Even the simplest of scenes, containing nothing more than ""meaningful"" exchanges between characters, are made up of sweeping camera angles that just give your heart strings a nice tug.<br/><br/>As for the title of this review; when you have a scene in your movie where, for dramatic purposes, a wheelchair bound character (FDR) stands up, you are doing nothing more than begging critics to dump on your movie.  Roland Emmerich followed up his really bad disaster movie (Godzilla) with a really bad historical epic (The Patriot).  Now Michael Bay is following suit with his contributions to both genres (Armageddon & Pearl Harbor).  So I'm sure we can expect really bad children's movies coming from both of them soon.<br/><br/>The fact that directors who show a little proficiency in directing action sequences feel the need to direct the rest of a movie is beyond me.

","First off, I have to say, this was a GREAT movie! It was very entertaining and the special effects were amazing!!! It had a great plot but I felt it strayed away from the topic at hand, the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I didn't expect the time span to be so large. I thought it'd start a little before the bombing then stop after it. But as I watched it seemed to make sense why they did it. Before the bombing the movie showed some info about the times, what was going on in the world, and what was going on in the minds of both America and Japan. Which I think was good because it gave more understanding of the bombing to people who don't know much about it. It also gave some more info to those of us who already know about it. But making the movie a love story was purely a move to get more viewers. I'm not saying that it was a bad idea, I'm just saying that it became more of the main plot of the movie over the bombing. It did make for a good plot though. And Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are really hot so... Plus, their looks matched their parts. Seriously, Ben Affleck looks more like his charactor, more sure of himself, a little older, etc. While Josh Harnett looks more naive, shy, and humble. Plus Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) wasn't as annoying as I thought she would be. All in all, this was a very entertaining movie which I highly recommend!"

","Some complain that this is just a romance with the bombing of Pearl Harbor as the backdrop, but I disagree. The romance fits in perfectly because any given soldier would probably have had a girl waiting for him back home (hence, the 1950's baby boom). It would almost be unrealistic to focus on individual WWII soldiers without a romance of some sort. I suppose that the film makers could have focused on the historical event without being too personal, but in so doing they would be leaving out an essential element of war, that the men and women who fight and die are real people like the rest of us."

","Having the romance angle is fine, such times do indeed take a toll on relationships.  But one of the most pivital times of the modern era seems to take a backseat to this exagerated and predictable love triangle.   When you had tears in your eyes, and I did, you also feel like you are being manipulated rather than feeling empathy for someone you have come to care about, to think of as real.  The agony of war is not due to the extreme soap operas of the beautiful people that it creates, but the swath it cuts through every day ordinary folks, who feel the loss of their loved ones just as much. I would have liked to see much more focus on the shuffleing of power in the governments of both sides and the intel-crypto rooms of both sides etc. Regarding the Computer Graphics, its good.  It still has a generated feel in some of the panaromic battle scenes, but the smaller shots where they are mixing real life and CG etc are really well done.

I had the impression that the film was about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. SILLY ME!!!! Actually, in a three hour film, anything remotely relavant to Pearl Harbor lasts about 35 minutes. There's an hour and a half of sophomoric love triangle between Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who is'nt hard to look at!) and Josh Hartnett with the ""who will live to get the girl!!!"" angle (she can't have both!!) coupled with 20 minutes of childhood memories which I guess fell into the category of character development and about thirty minutes (the best minutes of the film) about Doolittle's raid on Tokyo. Bruckheimer must have been asleep while directing this film and after 10 minutes of love interest schlock, you should be too. Affleck looked as if he'd been bitten by a Tsetse fly and Jon Voight was almost nightmarish in his portrayal of FDR. I know Cuba Gooding Jr. was cast in the film for a reason, but since his role consisted of a boxing match and machine gunning a couple of Zero's, you wonder why he took the role. Oh yeah, did you catch the phrase ""totally"" which was used twice in the film, a la ""Valley Girls???"" Geez, I thought this was the 1940's!!! This film was so bad that even the wardrobes looked sloppy, uniforms that were ill fitting, hair styles that were sometimes questionable and hey, the SOUNDTRACK!!! (or lack of it!!) This would have been a perfect time to showcase the fantastic music of the 1940's and have it come alive for younger viewers that had never heard that music, but the soundtrack was conspicuous by it's abscence!! Almost like they did'nt want to pay the royalties for anything authentic, I think I heard about eight bars of Cole Porter and the rest sounded like 1941 Muzak!! I DID like the special effects and hats off the FX crew for their STUNNING performance!!! Quite a visual experience. In closing, there was a real missed opportunity here to entertain and inform, but instead we were offered ""Days of Our Lives"" mated up with ""McHale's Navy!"" Any historical perspective was avoided and I understand Disney is re editing the film for Japanese audiences to soften any suggestion that Imperial Japan was an aggressor in that era. At the rate our educational system is failing to give children a firm anchor in history, it's doubly sad that this film fell so short of the mark. In addition, I was hoping our World War II veterans and particulary Pearl Harbor veterans would have been more directly honored in the film. They ARE the Greatest Generation!! Well, I guess I'll just sit back and wait for the next attempt and hope Disney has nothing to do with it!! (Walt WOULD'NT be happy!!)"

","In one word, it's a very thin movie.  It follows the story of two best friends and a girl who becomes their love interest.  This movie tries to touch too many people's lives.  It felt like a soap opera stretched three hours with a lot of explosives and computer graphics.....  The movie seemed like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious.  It's neither.  I remember a scene where a ship was sinking and a sailor say he can't swim, and audience laughs.  There was one line by a Japanese pilot explaining why he is ready to throw his life.  What about the black cook, who never shot a gun before until the chaos of the bombing pushed him to become extra courageous?  The captain of the boat says one line to him the whole life, and when he is about to die, the black cook talks to him and comes to his coffin after the bombing as if the captain was his best friend. What was up with all the ""unnecessary"" shots of the girl in Hawaiian background?  The Japanese admiral's lines were so biased....towards US. Unbelievable.  Just very thin, very hollow, Hollywood movie.  Typical Bruckheimer movie.  Unnecessarily long.  Nothing close to an epic movie. It's pretty much a dumb movie.  Don't waste three hours of your life on this....  Waste only two hours in other movies.  :)"

","Combine 3 parts Casablanca, 2 parts From Here to Eternity, a dash of Tora! Tora! Tora!, a pinch of Dr. Strangelove, and Tom Seizemore as a Sargeant for color.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's film seems to be an amalgamation of a number of other films, notably Casablanca, Tora! and Eternity.  It lacks the poignancy of each of those films, instead filling 2 hours and 20 minutes of time with cliche-ridden and sappy dialogue, boring visuals and characters who are either flat and boring, or oversized caricatures of real figures.  The remaining 40 minutes of the attack which gives the film its title is visually boring and sterile, failing to elicit any of the intense feelings one would normally associate with the ""dastardly"" attack by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.  Instead, the audience is assaulted by machine gun chatter, ricochets, large explosions and CGI effects.  But the attack lacks the human factor, failing to make the connection felt with the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan. Instead, the audience feels numb as row after row of extras are mowed down like so many Star Trek red shirts, while the main characters standing beside them stand unscathed and unshaken.<br/><br/>Even the real figures in the film are exaggerated beyond belief, to cliche status.  Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Doris Miller feels tacked on to the film, Admiral Husban Kimmel is shown as a Sun-Tzu-esque figure, rather than the unimaginative line officer history has shown him to be, and Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR is almost laughably over the top, particularly in a scene reminiscent of Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove.  Worse still is the portrayal of the Japanese in the film, further insulted by the conglomeration of a number of Admirals into Mako's Admiral Yamamoto.<br/><br/>The film is also rife with historical exaggerations and inaccuracies, particularly in dealing with the RAF Eagle Squadrons and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo.<br/><br/>All in all, an unsatisfying waste of three hours better spent at the video store renting this film's predecessors."

","The major problem with Pearl Harbor is that Bruckheimer and Bay used the same formula as Titanic.  Big mistake!  First of all, Titanic was a disaster flick interwoven with a love story.  A big ship sinking would basically appeal to the general movie-going public.  Throw in a romance for extra measure-BOOM!  You got a hit!  <br/><br/>With Pearl Harbor, Bruckheimer and Bay made a movie about love and centered it around war.  Then they went after two different audiences: teenagers particularly girls-thus the weak and tired love triangle, and adults-mainly veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>It didn't work because they focused too much on the love story where you only see 35 minutes of Pearl Harbor getting bombed.  This movie shouldn't have been 3 hours and 20 minutes long.  You spend 2 hours just waiting to see the bombing, which was supposed to be the selling point, judging from the trailer and the title.<br/><br/>Now what they should have done was make Pearl Harbor about Pearl Harbor. The movie should have focused on the events that led up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the actual bombing itself, and the results from it.  Love could've played a small supporting role. <br/><br/>Because of this, the small (and I do mean small) focus on Dorrie Miller (adequately played by Cuba Gooding, Jr.) just seemed totally irrelevant.  As an African-American man, I applaud Bruckheimer and Bay for at least acknowledging that the brothas were actually there, which Saving Private Ryan conveniently forgot to do!  But the plot contrivance with the love story and the bombing just made Cuba seem out of place.  By the end of the movie, you're wondering why they even bothered putting the brotha in there.<br/><br/>And the love story itself... totally lacked realism and compassion.  I would even go so far as to say that Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn was reduced to a common whore, having gotten herself in between two best friends.<br/><br/>Overall, Pearl Harbor was a disappointment!<br/><br/>What works for one movie won't work for another!<br/><br/>Peace!"

","Contains Spoilers Dazzling, exciting, and powerful.  Words that can describe the exciting battle scenes portrayed in Pearl Harbor.  But are they the same words you would mix in with a love story?  Displayed before audiences on May 25th, was another case of Hollywood's journey to take a historical disaster and make it into a love story.  Not a bad idea, but we've seen this before.  Does anyone remember 1997's record breaking Titanic?  Not to bash Pearl Harbor, this was a very exciting movie.  I guess when I think of making Pearl Harbor into a movie, I think of Saving Private Ryan or A Thin Red Line.  War movie or love story, the action was spectacular.  Some of the best battle scenes caught on film.  When you can take a journey on a Japanese bomb as it falls out of the sky and watch the crew of a destroyer scatter on deck to avoid the ultimate demise.  With the mixture of big budget special effects and live action, the battle scenes are anything short of pure entertainment. This small review cannot begin to describe the proportions of this cinematic epic battle.  That is something you must see for yourself.<br/><br/>As for a love story, that's what most of this film was meant to be.  The typical story of boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy heads off to war, boy believed dead, girl falls for best friend.  The love story only gets interesting when Rafe McCawley, brilliantly portrayed by Ben Affleck, returns from the dead to be with his love.  It just so happens at this point that the Japanese decide to invade Pearl Harbor.  The casting of this film did bring out two new fresh faces to the spotlight, Josh Harnett and Kate Beckinsale.  Harnett put out a very solid performance, but I think it's his pretty boy looks that will score him more roles.  As for playing a girl torn between two lovers, Beckinsale pulled off the task nicely.  The rest of the cast was well set, with a lot of familiar faces that can draw crowds and drive up the budget.  As an additional note, Dan Aykroyd's cameo appearance as a military code breaker was very well done.<br/><br/>At two hours and fifteen minutes, Michael Bay decided that the movie could not be over and he spawned a whole new adventure for our heroes.  At this point in a film most viewers are ready for a happy ending.  Take Titanic for instance. When the ship sank the movie was basically over.  In this case, and with the average running time of films today, there was plenty of room for more action.  This is an element that the audiences will have to decide if they enjoyed or not.  Overall the film was pretty good.  I can't see Pearl Harbor running up a tally of six hundred million, but it should not have a problem making the 140 million-dollar budget back.  When the film is eventually released on video, as long people are still buying videocassettes, the girls can have the first cassette filled with hot stars and plenty of dramatic steamy love scenes for all tearjerker fans alike. The boys can then enjoy the second cassette littered with epic and titanic size battle scenes."

","I did not enjoy Pearl Harbor at all.  The pacing of the movie between the action and romance did not mesh.  A sign of this would be the soundtrack of the movie where it cues to every moment as being anti-climatic.  The characters dressed the part but never embodied themselves to that history in time.  I didn't care to see what happened to them either way.  The action was your standard Bruckheimer fare - loud, big, and lots of it.  But the problem was that the characters and plot were so badly developed that you just can't wait for the sappy cartoon romance to end and let the movie cut to the next action sequence.  For a better Pearl Harbor movie, I recommend ""Tora! Tora!"" or better yet, the Spielberg classic ""1941""."
"Sabich","6","0","0","30 May 2001"," American history in Michael Bay's hands? Not pretty.
","Pearl Harbor.  The mere mention of those words arouse a lot of emotions in most Americans.  Patriotism, for one.  Anger, maybe.  And yet somehow this movie manages to trivialize the whole business. SPOILERS The name of the movie suggests that it should be a bold, sweeping view of the Japanese sneak attack on the American naval base, and its effects on America, Japan, and the world as we know it.  That is not the movie that I watched.  This movie concerns only the effect on a rather dull love triangle, with a few snippets of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Jon Voight acting presidential for good measure.<br/><br/>The movie begins with shots of two small boys, and we know that they will grow up to be Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett; we have seen the trailers, after all.  And indeed they do, they grow into the hunky, mach, back slapping pilots that we see ten minutes later, all grown up.  Their names are Rafe and Danny, and they are best friends.  Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), later is sent to Britain to fight the Nazis.  He is reported dead, and that's when Danny becomes romantically involved with Evelyn.  The conflict really starts to heat up when Rafe comes back, not only alive, but monumentally p***ed-off that his best buddy moved in on his girlfriend.<br/><br/>This love triangle business is okay, but its not really what we came to the theater for, and its not long before we are checking our watches, saying ""Hey, aren't there supposed to be some explosions in this movie?""  Indeed there are, and this is what Michael Bay is really good at giving us.  It doesn't dissappoint, visiting familiar Bay territory: shouting, shooting, slow motion shots of men dying while the orchestra plays solemnly in the background.<br/><br/>My problem with the movie is this: it doesn't give us a single character that we remotely care about.  Rafe and Danny are both slightly annoying, the love story with Evelyn unconvincing.  I've seen better love triangles on Jerry Springer.  Whoever wrote the script has a knack for writing memorably cheesy dialogue (""I've given my whole heart to Danny,"" Evelyn says sweetly, ""but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you."").  When the attack finally came, it was too late for the film; the Japanese were bombing the snot out of them and I just didn't care.  And the action sequence, while somewhat exciting, was a little too violence glorifying for me.  When Rafe and Danny lead separate Japanese planes on a crash course for each other, that was when I held up my hands in surrender. That kind of stuff is okay for The Rock or Armageddon, but this is American History, for crying out loud!  Show a little respect!<br/><br/>The whole time I watched the movie, I was wondering what the veterans who were sitting just behind me thought of the movie.  The hot shot pilots shooting off smart-alecky lines, the flirty nurses looking alluring while jabbing syringes into peoples hindquarters...this is the greatest generation?  Please.  This is a joke."

","I am going on the record early on just so you do not think I like everything Michael Bay has directed.  It was a very mensa-mensa movie.  About thirty minutes of the movie was really good (i.e. the attack).  But even here it failed to achieve the emotional intensity of the beginning of Saving Private Ryan.  The rest was a rip-off of the old movie (insert any name of any 1940s war movie--I pick Test Pilot).  In addition, the love story might've been interesting but was so poorly written that I did not even care about the characters, with the exception of Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Dan Aykroyd who were both on the screen way too little.  Michael Bay's place is with Action movies with humor--not heavy pieces like this, which would have been more reverentially directed by a director of higher caliber, Spielberg for example."

","It's been a while since I have had a less enjoyable time at a movie. Pearl Harbor is over three hours long, but it seems more like five! We start with a Top Gun introduction then move into establishing the romance aspect which feels extremely forced and is filled with cliches. This goes on (and on) with nothing original and anyone who has seen a few movies can predict every step of this relationship. When we finally do get to some battle scenes they are well done and interesting camera work, if your still awake at this point. The action scenes do a good job of depicting the chaos that I can imagine must have been going on. After the attack is over and you think it's just about done, the story manages to keep dragging on. The acting is very uninspiring and Cuba Gooding Jr. is completely wasted. This is probably the fourth movie I've seen centering around the attack on Pearl Harbor and by far the weakest one. The battle scenes save this movie from a worse rating. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4."
"gimpyviper","1","0","0","30 May 2001"," Cheesy Predictable Cliched and Over Bloated... GOOD Special FX!
","Michael Bay needs to remember that he's only good at Eye Candy and can't do emotional drama worth a dime. Then again with Randall Wallace writing... who can blame him. The movie is filled with an extremely predictable plot with overly used twists and turns and highly cliched lines. To sum it up, I could write the script/plot out for you on a cocktail napkin.<br/><br/>Then there's dilemma, how do you end a movie about Pearl Harbor. Can't exactly have the Japanese bomb the fleet and roll the credits. Can't show the bombing of Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, especially if you're Disney. Almost 4 years of history lie between Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima with many choices. In my opinion they picked the write event but they drew it out so much it could have filled another movie. Mainly do to the unnecessary love story. <br/><br/>The saving grace of this film... the 45 minute bombing scene. D-Day scene from Saving Private Ryan made soldiers cry. The bombing scene from Pearl Harbor will make sailors (and other service men and women)cry. Some of the technical aspects of the scene were wrong, but only military servicemen or historians will notice. <br/><br/>All in all, don't see this movie if you can't stomach cheese in a movie. Cause this one is full of it. Aside from the 45 minute Pearl Harbor bombing and the 5-15 minutes of so of the Doolittle raid, the rest of the movie is basically... boring."

There is no thinking necessary to view this film. Oh, but wait, there's really cool special effects and stuff. Cool dude! Right on!<br/><br/>It's funny, actually sad, if you think about it. The phrase ""Art imitates life"" seems to ring true in this day and age. Most mainstream movies Hollywood has put out in the past few years have all been the same thoughtless, mind-numbing garbage filled with really wild and spectacular effects leaving the audience muttering one word reactions such as ""Wow, oooohhh, aaahhh, cool"" as they leave the theatre. <br/><br/>Bruckheimer and Bay are probably the worst team of producer/director in Hollywood right now to put out these kinds of movies. All they know how to do is visual extravaganzas that leave very little to the imagination. But, hey, that would require some sort of thought process. <br/><br/>This movie will end up making millions, already has due to its hype, and I'm sure quite a few people will really like it, which will leave Bruckheimer and Bay raring to go on their next thought free spectacular. As dumb as their movies are, they sure aren't. They know what America wants. They've tapped into today's way of life turning it into ""art"" and are making their millions. <br/><br/>No surprises here folks. No thinking either.

It wasn't poor, the film just seemed to drag in spots.  A few quicker flashbacks rather than the first 45 minutes developing the story might've made the film a bit tighter and not so long.

"Monkey-37","4","0","0","29 May 2001"," Watchable, but has some problems
","***MAJOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Although this picture invites comparison to Titanic, there will be no best picture nod for Pearl Harbor.  Titanic was a love story within the backdrop of a sinking ship.  It transcended all prior Titanic movies and disaster films.  Pearl harbor, on the other hand, takes three historical events (the American's participation in the RAF pre-war, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid) and glues it together with a weak love story.<br/><br/>Here are some bullets of why the movie could have been better:<br/><br/>The female lead is a cardboard character.  We never learn anything about her except that she is quick to fall in love and is a bit 'easy' for a 40's girl.  The only reason that the men seem to fall in love with her is that she is good looking.  From the beginning she is given to the viewers as a ""nurse"" and we don't get much more background on her character.  It makes it hard to relate to the love story when we barely understand why either man would be interested in her, and we don't understand her at all.  Moreso, it is also difficult to get involved with her story line later in the film when she finally gets some screen time that isn't just eye-candy.<br/><br/>The love triangle doesn't really work from a dramatic standpoint.  I mean there is no tension associated with it.  For the whole Doolittle raid, I could have cared less who got killed and who came back.  I figured it would be one of them that died, but didn't really care which one.  It was not clear why the ""nurse"" would choose either of them over the other.  I had no stake in either relationship and thus there was no dramatic tension.  Do we care who she ends up with?  Did it matter which one?  Nope.  It all just seems a bit strange to me, she was willing to take whichever survived. Weird.<br/><br/>A minor point, but I thought about it during the film during the excessively *LONG* setup for the battle (the calm before the storm I guess).  Heck if you are going to spend millions to make a film look historically accurate, then spend some money on some body makeup.  Fact: soldiers (including the nurses) in the '40s stationed in Hawaii would have had serious tans. Tanning was considered healthy and the correlation with skin cancer had not yet been established. From what we see of these characters they spend a lot of time barely dressed on the beach, but they are as white as a sheet of paper.<br/><br/>Our two pilots, last we see them, are in the air shooting down zeros.  Yahoo this if fun!  Next thing you know, they are in the hospital, ""how can we help"".  As viewers, we totally loose the continuity of the film.  I'm asking myself, uhhh... where did they come from? What happend to all their buddies at the airfield? Next thing you know they are helping with the Arizona (for about 15 second) and then they are back at the hospital.  This was lame.  It detracted and distracted from the film.  Sure it provided a mechanism to show some melodramic scenes, but wouldn't a few secondary characters have been better to fill out this part of the story without causing it to be so choppy?<br/><br/>Cuba.  Ok, I love Cuba, but he is a token in this movie.  His story line is totally contrived.  For an actor that can add so much energy to a film, he is a token character with a pitiful add-on story.  Unfortunately, his story doesn't fit with the rest of the narrative.  When we all meet him and learn that all he wanted to do was to shoot a gun, we all know what is coming. Strange thing, in a blurt of exposition, we learn about why he wanted to join the Navy.  Funny that we got that background on him with as little screen time as he had and we didn't even get that much background on the cardboard nurse.  Hmmm.  Guess this was a guy's flick so why bother with the women.  Perhaps if this was an ensemble cast that followed several story lines, then Cuba's role would work.  However, instread, we get the love story, with Cuba tacked on.  Waste of talent and a waste of time.<br/><br/>A long long long build up to the bombing scene.  We get the long build up of the ""life as usual"" on Hawaii.  See how unsuspecting they were.  In case you didn't get it the first time, we will show you two other times that they have nothing to do at the hospital.  Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful.  And then the battle starts to commence, the Japanese start to move in, and we get the ""calm before the storm"" scenes.  People walking about unawares that all hell is about to break loose.  Boy that took a long time.  I was happy when the first torpedo finally hit!<br/><br/>The Doolittle raid.  Ok, for those that say this is a love story like Titanic, explain the need for this raid to the dramatic structure of the film.  It would have been a much better film if the Pearl Harbor bombing had been written to showcase the resolution of the love triangle.  However, during the bombing, the love story is essentially on hold.  Our boys just run around, oops now they're in a plane, no a hospital, no a boat, and then all of the sudden its over.  Ok, now we are back to the love story, hmmm... what should we do.  Ok, how about the Doolittle raid?  Frankly by this point I was checking my watch.  This whole raid could have been cut from the screenplay.  I know that many of you will argue that the Doolittle raid puts the film in historical perspective.  But that is not really what the movie is about... its about the love story.  This is the biggest problem with the film, no dramatic direction, no dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Who cared when Betty died?  Show of hands?  Me neither.  A) it was predictable.  B) she joined the army to meet boys, what an interesting character, not!<br/><br/>How PC can you get?  Heck, I liked the Japanese general... he seemed like a nice guy.  Anybody that is complaining about anit-Japanese sentiment hasn't seen the film - it takes long strides not to villify the Japanese. And Cuba's role, though it hinted (just barely) at racism, didn't really have any meat - heck he seemed like he had a pretty good deal going.  There were undertones of some sort of race related something, but no real story there.  If you are going to make a statement - make it!  Don't just tip toe around the subject.  Heck, there was more about the Brit/Yank discrimination in the RAF than any sort of black/white thing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, from a directorial standpoint, this movie also draws comparisons to Armageddon.  It suffers from many of the same problems.  It tends to meander and loose direction and has no dramatic tension to pull the viewer from scene to scene.  Armageddon didn't have that either.  However, suffice it to say that it is a much more solid screenplay than Armageddon.<br/><br/>Ok, now, after telling all of you why the film could have been better, I will say that it was basically watchable.  There was enough of a story and enough of a historical interested that I was entertained.  If I were you, I would go see it, but I bet you won't see it twice.<br/><br/>I can't see rating it higher than a 5, unless you are pretty gullible for the melodramtic, predictable, Hollywood, and hackneyed.  Its movies like these that makes me believe that I could make a living writing screenplays instead of reviews."

","I was excited and eagerly anticipating the release of this film.  So eager that the day it came out I went out and got tickets right after work for a late showing.  However, I came into this movie with the wrong mindset.  I came in anticipating this to be a huge modern version of ""Tora Tora Tora"" but with a story involved.  Instead what I feel that I got was 3 hours of love story/Hollywood.  From all the previews and specials on TV I was under the impression this movie was completely about the Battle of Pearl Harbor. I think the way this movie played out, the Battle did not even need to be in the movie, as far as I'm concerned it was as 'bout as relevent to the movie as a car chase scene would be to any action movie.  I understand that without the story involved all you really have is a documentary with special effects.  However I feel that the story took too much center stage.  Many have compared this movie to Titanic and they do fall into the category of a story written around a historical tragedy.  However I feel that in ""Titanic"" the story led up to the sinking and worked around the sinking.  In the case of ""Pearl Harbor"", the battle came and went with the story still going on and I don't feel it changed any of the characters outlooks, opinions, or attitudes for that matter.  I'm sorry but if I were to go through such a tragic ordeal, the last thing I would be thinking about is who loves who more.  I think this movie gave us more love story and only touching on the historical events that led up to and prior to the attack.  Basically this movie was about 2 pilots and a nurse they both love, I feel that as much emphasis as they gave to this part of the movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor could have merely been something one of them read in a newspaper.  I am not going to give this movie a thumbs down, because the actual battle scene was outstanding minus the part about the 2 stars and their dogfight scenes. Check your history, I do think that only 2 planes actually made it off the ground but I don't think they came off an airfield nor did they do hot dog stunts either.  Take a moment to remember those that have died and those who have survived to give you the freedom you have today."

The women in the film were so '40's that I went out and bought some brand new red lipstick and thigh-highs with garters. The dialogue sucked major ass. Some of my favorite ass sucking lines came from Alec Baldwin. My favorite line is probably when Mr. Baldwin asked his troops if they knew what Top Secret meant and  the answer came from the very dull flyboy, Ben Afflect, and it was something like, it means that your family will soon be learning of your gallant effort in a telegraph. Blah, blah, blah. If I knew the exact lines, you would be saying to yourself, that really isn't good, but I can't remember and so you've gotten that lame attempt instead. However, it probably had as much heart as the real lines. You'd think that when you spend $45 Million an hour on a film that takes three hours to tell that you could at least find a writer, but apparently I am mistaken and have decided to write s@#$ scripts and submit them to the Jerry Bruckheimer's in Hollywood right away. However, I keep coming back to the big shoot 'em up in Pearl Harbor and I say oh, yeah ... that really WAS money well spent. I mean, if you aren't going to spend it on ending war or poverty, why not on a pretty picture. Right? So, if you are dying to see it, make sure that you see it on the big screen or don't bother seeing it at all."

","This is a movie filled with not quites...<br/><br/>Not quite enough historical accuracy: There were far too many times where the movie played loose with the facts.<br/><br/>Not quite enough maturity: This film plays like so many other Bay movies. So much flash and so little substance. Far too many film tricks, and not enough story.<br/><br/>Not quite good enough actors: Affleck is a fine man, but he doesn't have the gravitas to pull off this role. The same goes for Hartnett and<br/><br/>Beckinsale.<br/><br/>Not quite good enough writing: Voight is fine, but has nothing to do as FDR, and the FDR scenes appear grafted on to add weight to a flimsy movie. Cuba Gooding Jr. is fine as Dorie Miller, but has only a tenuous connection to the main characters. The Asian actors are all great, but their scenes border on silly, and try to present a ""pc"" view of the Japanese military.<br/><br/>Not quite good enough music: All great films have great music. This film does not have great music. It is entirely forgettable.<br/><br/>Not quite enough movie: This movie is extremely padded, and the final third again appears grafted on.<br/><br/>This could have been a great film. However, too many areas just weren't developed properly. It's sad, but expected. Mr. Bay should stick to flashy action films and leave the high-powered war dramas to the professionals."

","Lots of special effects but as to historical accuracy, forget it. If you want historical accuracy, get a video of ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"" Because I was an 11 year old living just west of Honolulu where my Dad was stationed at the time of the attack, I have vivid memories of Pearl Harbor. My father was on duty on Ford Island at the time so when I raced out to our front porch when I heard all the planes and saw bombs falling on Ford Island, I was very fearful that something would happen to my Dad. Fortunately, he only suffered a strained back from jumping from the top of a hanger just before it was hit by a bomb. But I had a front row seat. So I saw this movie more out of nostalgia but it so distorted everything it lacked any nostalgiac value. Moreover I got bored. The romance had nothing really to do with Pearl Harbor and shouldn't have been part of the movie. And I could not understand why if this was a film about Pearl Harbor, why did it have to go on and on after Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Basically the movie does not square with my recollection of what happened nor with most historical accounts. <br/><br/>Alec Baldwin was badly miscast as Jimmy Doolittle. He not only did not resemble Doolittle in the slightest, he did not match him in character or dialog. And he was not the only one. I was not impressed with Affleck or Cuba Gooding. <br/><br/>If you like special effects, maybe it is worth seeing, but don't accept what you see as what actually happened."

","Pearl Harbor was a disappointment for many reasons.  First, it is a 3-hour movie and it takes 2 hours to get to the 20 minute Pearl Harbor scene.  This movie didn't even focus on the horror of Pearl Harbor...it focused on the cliche love story. The love story was weak with many horrible lines such as ""It is cold here. My only source of warmth is thinking of you.""  Oh, c'mon. Get more creative than that! There are too many movies with the ""I look at the sunset and think of you"" stuff. This movie should have focused on Pearl Harbor.  It got way too ""Titanic-Like"" with taking a real life situation and drowning it in an overdone love story.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't need a love story to get an emotional response from its audience.  The special effects are great and the only reason to watch the movie.  Otherwise, I feel horrible that the survivors of Pearl Harbor have to be given this movie to remember their acts of courage and bravery for our country."

","This movie has a lot of action at certain points in the picture.  It also has what is supposed to be a love story.  However, it falls short of accurately depicting the historical events the movie revolves around.  Not only does Mr. Bay the put fictitious people in situations where there were a very limited number of actual participants, but he also twists history to allow them to be there in the first place.  At no time during the 3 hours this film dragged on did I become attached to any of the main characters.  I could never believe in who they were of what they were doing.  The plot gets pretty predictable towards the last hour.  In my opinion this movie should be viewed for entertainment purposes only. If you want to see a good (and fairly accurate) docudrama about the attack of Pearl Harbor, see Tora! Tora! Tora!  If you are looking for lots of stuff blowing up with little regard to the real horror that war is and a sappy, paper thin love story, then see this movie."

","I must admit I wasn't as blown away by Pearl Harbor as I was when I saw Pte. Ryan, or even Battle of Midway aeons ago (ok, so I'm showing my age). As far as Great War Movies, this one is unfortunately low on the 1st-tier in my books, and that is mainly for the action sequences, which I knew Bruckheimer and Bay would not disappoint on. The first thing that really hit me about this movie was Red's character. I was scratching my head for the first 15-20 minutes or so after he was introduced, and then it hit me: Spud!!!! From Trainspotting!!!! My question about Red is this--in this day and age of sickening, pandering, PC-ness, is some newly-formed (if it doesn't already exist) American Society for Stutters going to protest? On to the leads. Rafe (Affleck) and Danny (Hartnett) really smack you hard in the face with the whole Maverick-Goose parallels early on. I half-expected Doolittle (Baldwin) to say ""You two CHARACTERS are going to Top Gun!"" when he had them in his office in the early scenes. And I figured Rafe was royally screwed upon arrival in England when I saw his plane had a French flag on the tail. And don't any French give me slack for that remark--at least the English didn't lay down and let the Nazis waltz right through their land. I gotta say that Danny was put in a bad spot with Evelyn (Beckinsdale) after Rafe's ""death,"" but damn, claiming his best friend's girl???? There's gotta be a line somewhere...... Speaking of Evelyn, I didn't really care for her in the movie. Even the girl sitting next to me during the movie started to get fed up with her. The scenes in the base hospital when everything started to hit the fan were good, though, and calm under fire was personified through her rather well. The action scenes were great. I even ducked some flying debris a couple of times. All I can say about the USS Arizona explosion is ""wow"". After ""Armageddon,"" Jerry B. and Mike Bay set the bar for themselves pretty high, and they met the standard exceedingly well. The explosions, the recreation of WW2 planes/ships/cars/equipment, the frenetic pace of action, and the wild camera angles are all poetry in motion. If only there was more...... Look beyond the pure action, though. The symbolism is apt. I just knew that the revolving door at the hotel HAD to stand for something, and if you look closely, there's a lot of circular motion throughout the movie, and sure enough, the movie ends with the very same scene it began with. Just what could it stand for? ""The more things change, the more they stay the same""? Well, pray we never have to go back to a global conflict. ""What goes around, comes around""? In the case of the Japanese, that would apply, and in the case of America, perceived superiority followed by a massive humbling followed by rise to prominence yet again. Sure, sounds good to me. I don't know, perhaps I'm overanalyzing, but the whole circles thing started the wheels in my head. Anyway, to sum up, it was a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one. What does it matter anyway? We all know it'll go on and make $100s of millions (maybe not in Tokyo, but having lost some family members to them during WW2, there is no love lost on my part). Oh, and one more note, Jon Voight as FDR-- brilliant likeness, well-played. I just want to know--did FDR really pull off that standing up scene when discussing options after the attack?"

","I'm the daughter of a WWII vet, a computer geek, a history buff, and a cinephile. Parts of PH appealed to me, and others annoyed me mightily.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is not the seminal film on the events on 12/7/41-- that would be Tora, Tora, Tora. It's not the best love triangle story with a war backdrop-- that would be Casablanca. It's not even the best film about WWII and relationships set in Hawaii-- that would be From Here to Eternity.<br/><br/>What it is is a pretty good entertainment film that gets (most of) the history it bothered to include right, has some wonderful images, some truly stupid dialog, and some nice looking people. It made great use of technology. The costuming was well done. The cinematography, for the most part, was extraordinary. (The blurred shots during the hospital scenes were classic Bruckheimer, but bordered on the absurd.) The action scens harked back to an earlier time, pre Saving Private Ryan, when an uninterrupted half hour of super-realistic gore was thought to be overwhelming to the audience.<br/><br/>But it certainly didn't teach anyone anything about why the Japanese felt they had to attack us in the first place. It took three steps toward making Admiral Yamamoto and the Japanese troops seem intelligent and human, but then dropped the ball completely. It took 4 steps toward discussing the arrogance and mismanagement in the American military that made Pearl ripe for that kind of attack, and dropped the ball again. The story of Doris Miller aside, it completely ignored the rampant racism in the US military in the 30's and 40's. It didn't even suggest the complex racial and ethnic issues in Hawaii. It canonized FDR, who may have been one of our greatest leaders, but was hardly a candidate for sainthood.<br/><br/>Incidentally, for all of you who are screaming about the grafting of a love story on to the history of 12/7, do the research. The working title of this film was ""Tennessee"" and was supposed to be about the spirit of patriotism and volunteers.... It became ""Pearl Harbor"" later.<br/><br/>I didn't regret the time or money spent on seeing this film---it was appealing enough to me on many levels to overcome it's shortcomings on other levels-- but understand and be happy with what it is you're going to see.... This is no more a documentary about WWII than Zhivago was a documentary about the Russian Revolutions. And, I gotta tell you, it is far better than Gladiator, and that won last year's Oscar."

","When Saving Private Ryan came out, everyone said how the first scene of the movie actually took you to the beaches of Normandy on D-day. That it definitely did, which makes it a superb movie. Now, that same amazing way a director can bring their audience inside the movie has been done again.<br/><br/>    Pearl Harbor, a true American tragedy where over 300,000 American lives were lost. For over and hour, director Michael Bay takes you to the heart of the attack on Pearl Harbor. You feel the chaos, agony, loss, hurt, pain, grief, and the struggle between life and death. This is truly the best part of the movie, along with great historic footage they cut into the movie.<br/><br/>     The plot surrounding the three main characters though was something that could have been better. It is very reminiscent from director Michael Bay's two other films, Armageddon and The Rock. Pearl Harbor and both those two other movies all take the same plot twist; the beautiful young girl waits for her boyfriend while he is off saving the world. Proof? Armageddon, Liv Tyler waits for both her father, Bruce Willis, and boyfriend, Ben Affleck. Both are on a mission from Nassau to destroy asteroids headed for earth. The Rock, Nicolas Cage's pregnant girlfriend waits for him to come home from dismantling highly toxic air bombs that could change Los Angles from the city of angles to the city of corpses. Pearl Harbor is very similar to this, but that's as much as I'm telling you. The difference I see though from Bay's earlier films is that the heroine of Pearl Harbor, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) is a very strong women, unlike the female roles in both Armageddon and The Rock. She is able to hold her own all the way through the movie, she is a simply remarkable character, this has much to do with the writing, not the direction.      The friendship between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) was a wonderful thing. Many movies today seem not to develop characters enough. They leave many relationships empty and worthless, but this one was far from it.      Like what was said before though, the love story could have been better, and if wasn't for that, the movie wouldn't have been so long. The supporting cast I can't say enough about. Jon Voight, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dan Akroyd, and Alec Baldwin all are amazing, and some of the best scenes in the movie include them.      Over all, Pearl Harbor was an absolutely amazing film. Just about anyone can love this film, almost everyone can get something out of it. If your the underdog, the best friend, the lover, you will walk away from this film with almost every emotion in your heart."

The love story is soooo flaky. The only part i like about the romance is when Evelyn's recount how she met Rafe to her fellow nurses while riding to NYC. That's the only thing enjoyable and remotely memorable in the entire movie.<br/><br/>The worst part must be the reunion of the 2 lovers, Evelyn & Rafe. There was no real emotions, it was like, the two saw each other, stand there for a few seconds, then Rafe calmly said to Evelyn, 'Hi i am still alive, come sit over there and we will do some catching up!'<br/><br/>Where's the HUG? where's the raw emotions, the real joy, sadness, sweetness of finding back one's long lost love? maybe its just bad acting.<br/><br/>Wallace is a credible writer, but this time round, he just lost it! maybe he tried to squeeze too many things into one single movie.<br/><br/>
And the much-hyped battle sequence, i really didn't feel sorry for the dead. it was just bomb bomb bomb. i wasn't that impressed. Maybe that's what one would call special effects over-exposure. its no more thrilling now that i get to see cutting edge special effects on every single movie, too saturated. it just isn't enough anymore for a movie to depend on special effects.<br/><br/>Ultimately its the story-telling Hollywood.

","I was about to write a terrible review of this film, but on further reflection I thought otherwise.  The movie, as it turns out, was better than I thought it was going to be.  With Bruckhiemer at the helm, I totally thought the events of Dec 7, 1941 would be mangled into some kind of quasi American victory, complete with flag waving and people shouting, ""follow me, men!""<br/><br/>For the most part, I feel as though Pearl Harbor accurately depicted the sound thrashing the Americans received on that day.<br/><br/>But I agree with most of the people here that the love story was pretty weak....possibly even lame.<br/><br/>Also, the final third of the movie could have been deleted.  I just saw no point to it.  It simply should have ended at Pearl Harbor.  I don't think Bruckhiemer could have slept at night without showing the Americans scoring some kind of victory.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the naration at the end seems to indicate that the Doolittle raid on Tokyo is the turning point of the war.  I think this just takes away from, and belittles the true turning point - the incredible Battle of Midway.  I guess the Doolittle raid was easier to tack on the end than would Midway.<br/><br/>The one thing I wish this film had more of was the Japanese perspective. Although the film did touch on it a couple times, I wish we could have seen more planning of the attack.  Or perhaps some of the private thoughts of the Japanese Admiralty and the regular soldiers as they sailed across the sea to attack the ""sleeping giant"".  Were they brimming with confidence, nervous, or down-right scared as I would be?<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was fair considering the script they had to read from. John Voit was pretty good as FDR and I particularly enjoyed Dan Aykroyds character.<br/><br/>I guess this is a case of viewer beware.  Don't go there expecting the Pacific version of Private Ryan.

","Lets forget for a second, which is very easy to do in this movie, that the name of the film is Pearl Harbor. Let us forget for a moment that the horror of he attack scenes, something done very well, does not depict the reality of what happened. In other words, let us just look at this film for a moment as if it were a fantastical story created out of the minds of the people who worked on it. In that context this movie is not horrible.<br/><br/>Saving Graces- What this movie truly has to draw on are a few things. First and foremost the special effects which are just dazzling. The team of Bay and Bruck did a wonderful job of creating reality on the screen and doing, if only for a moment, what every great WAR movie does and that is bring the action and the horror right to you. Secondly, the score and cinematography, which never gets a lot of attention since no one goes to the movies for that, is magnificant. It looks like old America, smells like old America, and at least sounds like an epic even if it doesn't exactly live up to that. Thirdly, Ben Affleck leads the list of a few wonderful acting jobs done on this film. Affleck, for the first time, looks like the leading man he is so often proclaimed as. At no time during his on screen perfromance did I beginning looking for Matt Damon or Bruce Willis to come and save him from being the focal point of the scene. He was everything a leading man must be, sensitive enough to appeal to the women and ""kick-a%*"" enough for the men. John Voight as a perfect FDR and Dan Akroyd as a fictional Japanese decoder are wonderful in the movie and everytime they go off screen you are hoping it won't be too long until they are back on.<br/><br/>Not worth the money- Where this movie falls short, however, is in expressing a story, other than the invasion, that people actually care about. The love triangle is absurd and so uninvolving by the end no on cares who ends up with who. Kate Beckinsale, keep calling her Blanchett wich she most definetely not, plays the love torn nurse who, through a turn of events I will not reveal, falls in love with two childhood friends Rafe (Afflek) and Danny (Hartnett). Beckinsale is aweful and fails to show even the slightest bit of creative maturity when forced into scenes calling for her to be distraught. Hartnett, as opposed  to Affleck, is a bore everytime he is on the screen and plays his part with about as much emotion as Al Gore on Valium. Though neither actor are given the break of having good lines, I still cannot get over the fact that the same man who wrote Braveheart penned this nightmare of a script, still neither showed the ability to carry even the most rudimentary emotions over the screen. In the most dramatic parts of the movie both of these characters react as if their nephews roomates cousins grilriends dog died of old age at 22 years old. There is no emotion, and the worst is Beckinsale who many times is caught dried eyed as she convulses from uncontrollable anguish. Not only is the acting horrible, the love story absurd, but it becomes an even greater blow to the movie when you realize that 80%, and I do mean 80% or more of this 31/2 movie is devoted to that same love story. It is absolutely amazing that SOOO much time could be spent on this story and by the end the characters remained severely underdeveloped and the audience apathetic to their eventual outcome.<br/><br/>The real shame of this movie, and I didn't even touch on the end part which is actually too badly done to even be funny, is the fact that this movie not only could have been but SHOULD have been so much better. This wasn't named ""Hawaiian Love"" but it was named Pearl Harbor. Real men, real heroes, real people lived and died on that faithful day and because of that this movie is an insult. My grandfather was stationed in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and was lucky enough, three days before the attack, to put to sea. He returned two days after the attack, helped rebuild a fleet and bury men, and sometimes, on nights when maybe he had had a few to many beers, spoke of the tapping he had heard from the men trapped within the Arizona. This was not a movie that should or could have afforded misrepresentations of the truth, silly ""two pilots vs. twenty, no problem"" battle scenes, and most importantly, the idea that the amazing events of not only that day but the months that preceded it were not enough of a story to draw on. Having heard the tension and sorrow in my grandfathers voice as he told the stories of the friends he lost that day it is hard for me to care whether or not 12-14 year old girls need to see Josh Harnett without a shirt on to max out the dollars. This was a movie that SHOULD have focused on Pearl Harbor instead of treating it as an afterthought. Could you have included everyday reality of the people who lived the Pear Harbor experience, maybe even a less contrived love story? Most certainly, but only as a sattelite to the main story. In the end what this did was bring to the cinemas a $150 million extravaganza, with wonderful effects and huge explosions, that does not even attempt to honor the men who died there. How embarrassing."

But I don't have to pay $8 to go to the local library and check out a book on Pearl Harbor and spend the next 2 weeks reading about it. It's for free. But it's also rather boring, too. Most historical books - hell, history itself - is boring.<br/><br/>
So I go to see films and see fiction interwoven into the fabric of reality - which of course is what the 2001 ""Pearl Harbor"" is.<br/><br/>Hey, this movie is Hollywoodized - don't kid yourself. Facts about this raid are ""dumbed"" down for the overwight, hot-dog eating American audience. But who cares, right? If you want to read or see about what *really* happened in 1941, rent ""Tora Tora Tora"" in all of its bland, black-and-white boringness.<br/><br/>But if you want to go see a rip-roaring ""fun"" movie - leave behind your history book and just have fun. Let me repeat myself.<br/><br/>""Just. Have. Fun!""<br/><br/>There is a love story. Something about two guys chasing after the same woman. One of the men goes to Hawaii. The other to Britain to help our cousins stave off those dastardly Nazis. One of the two gets shot down, he's believe to be dead, yadda yadda yadda, something something, they do it in some hanging parachutes and then... the ""real"" reason we paid what we did to see this flick: the attack.<br/><br/>You know, you gotta tip your hat to the Japanese military when you realize the sheer scope of the attack (hundreds of planes - broken up between high-altitude bombers, fighters and torpedo planes) and the damage they wrought (2,000-plus dead and more than a dozen ships hit in less than 2 hours).<br/><br/>The entire attack - more than 30 minutes long but it seems like 10 minutes - is amazing. A few critics said the fx was worse than those seen on Titanic - I disagree. The aerial combat was breathtaking. The bombing and raking of Americans in the water was done extremely well. I found myself ducking from the bullets spat from the diving Zeros, much like I did during the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan."" And some of my favorite war footage didn't occur over the skies of Hawaii, but rather over Britain, when British and the American ""Eagle Squadron"" jumped from lumbering Nazi bombers near the British coast. Great footage - puts anything seen in ""Memphis Belle"" to shame in a hurry.<br/><br/>OK, there were some cheesy points: two American fighters manage - ala Star Wars - to out-fly, out-gun and out-fx 7 Japanese Zeros, which of course was great to watch but totally bogus in real life. Sorry, when the odds in aerial combat are 3-1, the 1 will lose everytime. But that scene was balanced with Cuba Gooding's shootdown from the deck of a stricken ship of a diving torpedo bomber - great effects.<br/><br/>Once the battle is completed, there is somewhat of a letdown, and it seems too long of a pause from when the bombs finish dropping over Oahu and when Doolittle's bombers drop American bombs on Tokyo. Still, this raid has seldom been touched by Hollywood, and it was refreshing to see.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes from the whole movie were, of course, the ones shown on the previews months ago - tiny snippets of Americana throughout the Hawaiian Islands rudely brought up cold by these menacing - and yet beautiful - Japanese planes. A woman with wet clothes from a clothesline; boy scouts on a tromp through the hills; a baseball game. Beautiful, mesmerizing, and yes, menacing.<br/><br/>My only regret - and something I was anticipated and was disappointed when it didn't occur - is that Bay failed to show snippes of Japanese everyday life in and around Tokyo suddenly ground to a halt as the B-25's roared overhead. There was one scene of several Japanese women looking up and running, as the bombers - getting kissed by ak-ak fire and smoke - can be seen in the corner of the screen at the top of a hill.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a great summer movie that *will* entertain you. C'mon folks - that's all movies can do. Not teach our kids history. They get school for that. And it's not to tell how things happened back then. The History Channel and our grandfathers are for that. This movie tells a good story. That' what you get for your $8 bucks.<br/><br/>Enjoy it."

","Like a bomb, Pearl Harbor had a lot of potential. From the first movie trailer to the endless promotion, it kept building and building to that moment where it can break loose and explode into a fantastic movie, lighting up the big screen. But when that moment came, it merely let loose some crackles that fireworks would make and not the explosion it was very capable of.<br/><br/>The movie begins in Tennessee, 1923. Friends Danny (Josh Hartnett, although this is a younger version of Danny first seen) and Rafe (Ben Affleck, with the same situation) are best friends and aspiring pilots. When the years pass, they've acquired their dream and are now pilots for the military. Soon, Rafe, by order of General Dolittle (Alec Baldwin), is shipped to fight in England, much to the distress of army nurse and Rafe's girlfriend Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). But in America, Danny, Evelyn, and other army members are shipped to safety in Pearl Harbor (resulting in dramatic irony for us, since we know exactly how ""safe"" Pearl Harbor really is). Rafe's plane crashes during a fight, resulting in news to Danny, Evelyn, and other friends that Rafe is dead. But after a few months of grieving, Evelyn and Danny develop a love for each other, only to find out later that Rafe is actually alive and coming back to Pearl Harbor, making their romance a part of a love triangle.<br/><br/>Cinematically, this movie was brilliant. The war sequence far into the movie was very compelling and awesome to watch. And one scene I thought was a little overlooked amongst all the publicity was the scenes in the hospital prior to the Pearl Harbor bombing. The blurriness and shaking seen was a great way to show the stress in that hospital. <br/><br/>The acting was great too. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett really showed us the strength of their acting muscles. Kate Beckinsale also made a very good first impression on me and I hope she'll get some more projects in the future. My personal favorite was Cuba Gooding Jr. as real military hero Dori Miller, a cook who took on fighting the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack.<br/><br/>However, the dialogue was something that really bothered me in this movie. It had so many cliche'd lines, especially in exchanges of love. I'm not saying that in order to have a good script, you need great, dramatic, poetic lines. I mean, not every screenwriter is a poet or a classic author. It's just that where corny lines were placed, a much better line could've been used. One big example is when Evelyn and Danny are about to make love behind some curtains. Danny is over Evelyn, and you can almost feel their passion. It seems like it's going to be so romantic. But then, Danny speaks his sentence of love, romance, and passion...""My heart's pounding."" That's it. See what I mean? That was one of many scenes where the dialogue's potential was totally wasted.<br/><br/>This movie could've been spectacular. And it was good. Great, even. Better than I had begun to think, what with new views of the movie surfacing. But it could've been so much more, and that's the only thing that disappointed me.<br/><br/>7/10, B-"

","All right, I'll admit the critics had a point about the needlessly long build-up to the attack on Pearl, and the love story was a bit dull at times, BUT... it was worth it just to experience the emotion of watching Pearl Harbor go up in flames for the second time in history. This would have been a perfect movie if the pre-attack bit was about half as long; 45 minutes.  At 1 1/2 hours I found myself looking at my watch frequently waiting for the bombs to drop. Once they started dropping though the fastest 50 minutes of my life zipped by, and at the end of it all you feel like one or two of the bombs landed next to you.  This wasn't a movie everyone got up and clapped at the end of; you couldn't.  The only thing you could do was sit there in stunned silence while your emotions settled again. This is a movie that had to wait until 60 years after the event to be made; any sooner and we may well have gotten caught up in the emotions and run over to drop another bomb on Japan."
"ugadawgguy","8","0","0","29 May 2001"," A thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster -- but one whose ambition exceeds its worth
","""Pearl Harbor"" is a movie that should be seen in the theatre.  From the $140 million-plus-budgeted explosions and lavish sets to the endless barrage of movie-script one-liners (often encroaching on cliche territory), this is a film tailor-made for the summer-movie crowd.  And who better to direct such a prepackaged blockbuster than Michael Bay, a man whose resume (Armageddon, The Rock) speaks for itself?  I've got to admit it, the man knows how to blow things up, and he knows how to entertain the average American moviegoer.<br/><br/>But that, unfortunately, is also the downfall of this movie.  ""Pearl Harbor,"" in the hands of someone more proficient with human emotion, subtletly, and cinematic nuance, could conceivably have rivaled ""Saving Private Ryan"" in of subject matter and significance.  Instead, while remaining generally quite faithful to history, Bay steers ""Pearl Harbor"" in the direction of big-budget action.  The ""tenderness"" and emotion he attempts to tack onto his visual, action-oriented film are the main casualties of Bay's directorial style.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie unwinds as expected, with tensions mounting and anticipation for the now-infamous attack on Pearl Harbor building.  Even in this, though, Bay goes the extra mile to plainly ""foreshadow"" Japan's plans, and the results often induce eye-rolling (""This is the hospital, and as you can see, no one's ever in here,"" a nurse informs a group of newcomers to the base.).<br/><br/>Also in the early goings of the film, we are introduced to the principals in a textbook war-movie love triangle, played here by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale.  As you've likely read by now, the trio is physically attractive, natural in 1940s costume, and fun to watch.  They are also, however, placed in some ridiculously unnatural environments meant to showcase the period's innocence, and their dialogue borders on verbal saccharine at times.<br/><br/>Not a single actor in this film is given the freedom (or screen time) to stretch him- or herself, and the result is a collection of characters who develop little and basically move from episode to episode of W.W. II action. Again, in the hands of a more human-oriented director, perhaps some true emotion could push through the scenery and effects, but in this film, none of the actors is capable of breaking Bay's grasp on the wheel steering this film.<br/><br/>But in the center of this film, the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor allows the actors to take a backseat to Bay and let him do what he does best: frenetic action sequences, showcasing improbable feats and incredible explosions.  This extended action sequence should, in my opinion find its place among the best in war cinema, and the film is worth seeing for this reason alone.  Bay made it a point to meticulously recreate the real-life bombing as accurately as possible -- and if what I was in this film was accurate, then I understand some of the emotions Americans must have felt in 1941.  It is THIS emotion that is most significant when discussing this movie -- not the canned ""feelings"" that Bay and his cast struggle to provide.<br/><br/>In the end, the film does drag a bit.  And the third act in this drama, while entertaining, does appear to have been tacked on for the sake of furthering a love story whose relevance is almost erased by the movie's ""main event.""  But on the whole, ""Pearl Harbor"" is, indeed, a summer-movie spectacle, and it does rekindle the viewer's contemplation of wartime America.  So, while I could only offer the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, I will still recommend it to anyone able to make the trip to a theatre to experience it."

","I wish they decided from the beginning what they wanted the movie to be, a love story set in WWII or a war movie with a love story sub-plot. If they could have just gone one way or the other, I think you would have had a great movie. There was no depth to the movie at all because of this. All we knew about any of the characters and the plot was very little - Japan is going to attack because the US stopped oil shipments, the US parked all the battleships in a row (how about telling why our carriers were not there), the two fly boys are friends and only want to fly and they both fall in love with nurse who fell in love with both of them. Thats it. I would rather have learned more about Cuba Gooding's character, or more about Doolittle, or more of the history behind the attack, more behind the US attempts to decipher the codes, more of anything!!! I could not feel for anything because I had no reason to feel. I think I will just buy the video, and edit out the love story and just watch the battles."

","If you thought Armageddon was cheesy, wait until you see this trash.  They really should have cut everything around the fight scene and just shown that.  As a movie in it's whole, the film sucked hard.  The plot was pathetically boring, and the love story was very very bad.  It wasn't a decent love story like in Titanic, it was a miserably boring and uninvolving story about two people you don't care about.<br/><br/>See this film in a theater at your own risk.  Hundreds of critics can't be wrong."

","""Pearl Harbor"" is a great movie-- I was surprised.  Even at 3 hours I didn't have to bring a pillow... though I didn't drink anything during.  PH did not seem like 3 hours.  Randall Wallace's story is effective and engaging even with parts of it being predictable-- aside from the actual bombing of PH. Michael Bay masters the technical aspects of the movie and does well with the human element.  The story revolving around best friends Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) being love with the same woman, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale)is simple and it works.  Ben Affleck is a great leading man.  Josh Hartnett is awesome-- he is going to be a huge star.  Rafe and Danny are like brothers, and their bond is both touching and inspiring.  This keeps the movie grounded.  Beckinsale has a weaker role (more of a plot device), and does well by it.  It's also fabulous to see Alec Baldwin in a strong performance as Col. Doolittle.<br/><br/>Michael Bay and Randall Wallace do a fabulous job of telling a story of courage, loss, and the rites of passage for a nation.  Kenneth Turan of the LA Times described ""Pearl Harbor"" as a parable of the loss of innocence for a nation.  I believe that he is accurate.  ""Pearl Harbor"" is not William Wordsworth... What it does very well is convey a tremendous sense of loss (the cost of war) and the triumph of the human spirit.  It's great to see a big budget Hollywood movie that  looks great, and still remembers what moves, touches, and inspires.  And that is NOT just ""great sounding bulls**t""."
"fattymagee","Null","0","0","29 May 2001"," Without a good screenplay, special effects are all that is left.
","The makers of this movie obviously spent little time, money, and effort on the screenplay of this movie. The story was predictable, tired, and very cheesy. If you go to this movie, bring plenty of crackers and wine - you will need it to go with all that cheese.<br/><br/>The special effects were great. The actual battle on Pearl Harbor was vivid and intense. But by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, this movie had already bored me to tears.<br/><br/>Another drawback to this movie is its one-sidedness. It was definitely made for Americans and it was NOT historically correct. For example, the Japanese were depicted as heartless, stone-faced villains. When the Japanese attacked, hundreds of Americans are shown dying, being ripped apart, suffering, bleeding, etc. But when the Americans attacked anyone in this movie, it showed them blowing up empty buildings and industrial areas. It was as if to say the Americans never killed any civilians during these battles which is not true.<br/><br/>I hated this movie. I can't believe Hollywood keeps feeding us these stupid story lines and we keep eating them up. This film doesn't even deserve a ""thumbs down"". A thumb amputation might be appropriate."
"Mr. OpEd","Null","0","0","25 May 2001"," Well Done!
","Pearl Harbor does a lot right. It's romantic, corny, moving, jaw-dropping, and likably long. <br/><br/>The young cast does extremely well, handling the heavy lifting of occasionally squishy dialog with aplomb. Kate Beckinsale does another of her amazing American accents and has a pretty-as-pie face of freckles. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett ooze Norman Rockwell goodness and patriotic heroism, even as they, as fictional characters, accomplish what real-life pilots did at Pearl and over Tokyo. The supporting cast as pilots, nurses, and others  squeeze out the kind of believable characters one expects of Golden Age films. <br/><br/>They're helped, as you'll see, by photography, sets, and costumes that capture the era beautifully (as my wife says, ""That nurse sure looked like a Petty girl). They will be nominated for Oscars. As will at least one actor: Jon Voight as  FDR.<br/><br/>Michael Bay almost steps into Spielbergian schmaltz from time to time, but never makes the emotional mistakes Spielberg can't help but make. This is his best big-bucks feature. The after-the-attack scenes of carnage of care are particularly moving.<br/><br/>Faults? Hans Zimmer's score is serviceable, but no more (the ""torpedo"" theme, as I call it, being an example). And his love theme sounds like John Barry throwing spaghetti at a wall (OK, not as good). Zimmer can  do heroic themes, but I didn't find them here. <br/><br/>While Pearl Harbor is not quite as good as From Here to Eternity in terms of story nor as Tora Tora Tora in terms of history (its 1970 effects hold their own against those of 2001's Pearl Harbor), I recommend it without reservation. I may even see it again.<br/><br/>PS: The Japanese are not treated dishonorably in my opinion."

I decided to see it anyway just for the battle sequences.  Possibly my opinion of the movie was improved by my own low expectations (much as I was disappointed in ""Gladiator"" because of high expectations), but I think the movie is good on its own terms.<br/><br/>It combines good action, excellent special effects, and a so-so story with one of the defining moments in world history and comes out a winner.  While its grip with history is often merely tenuous, it is an exposure to more history than the average American knows, to our shame.  I think that's reason enough to see the movie.<br/><br/>Is it Best Picture caliber?  No, but neither was ""Gladiator"" and look what happened to it."
"ke4roh","7","0","0","29 May 2001"," Good overview
","Don't expect a documentary - This is the Cliff Notes version with an embellishment (love story) to make it interesting.  From what I know of history, the film portrayed the big points well.  For example, there was radar at Pearl Harbor before the bombing, and they did see something coming, but they didn't know what to make of it - since radar was new.  The 45 minutes of bombing about which Ebert complained served to convey the devastation and helplessness of the Americans - and the aftermath, if anything, was prettied up a bit for the movie but still very convincing."

","First of all, I have found that different generations find this movie way different!  I am 25 years old, so I am going to comment on the way that I saw the movie.  I had learned of Pearl Harbor in high school and somewhat in college, as most of us have, but after seeing the movie I have a much better understanding as to what actually happened.  This movie was an awesome history lesson, unfortunatley some important things were left out, I'm sure for political reasons, but I revisited what really happened that day. And it was so sad!<br/><br/>I have heard a lot of bad reviews about the story line and how it was a horrible love story, blah blah blah.  Well all I can say is that if it wasn't for the love story, say for instance in Titanic (my favorite movie of all time!), we would have went to watch a ship sink, how much fun is that? Same thing, if there is no story we are going to watch the Japanese kicking our butts.<br/><br/>I loved the writing, editing, casting, acting, and the special effects.

It goes along with Braveheart and The Patriot's type of story where it took a historical moment in time and added a story around it.<br/><br/>Voight played a great FDR, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now, if those of you out there are looking for an accurate depiction of what happened in Pearl Harbor and beyond, don't expect it in this movie.  Go rent Tora! Tora! Tora! for Pearl Harbor...then rent Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo for the attack on Tokyo with the bombers.

","Okay, first off let me say that Bay and Bruckheimer are an unstoppable duo. Together, they create some of the most memorable movies to date, and Pearl Harbor will be among those movies. The overall presentation of the movie was fantastic. With stylish camera angles and some very slick CG, the movie looked great. The acting was top-notch. Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsdale all played the leads very well, and Voight was brilliant as Roosevelt. As far as the writing goes, the love story was a nice touch, but it seems to be a trend nowadays to attach romance to historical events, Titanic anyone? But I will say the love triangle scenario in this movie was far more interesting than Titanic's. The second act of the movie, the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, seemed rather familiar to me. Was this a remake of the 1970 classic ""Tora!Tora!Tora!"" ? I mean a lot of the scenes seemed like updated versions of ""Tora!""...others were direct rip-offs, even some of the dialogue was taken directly from ""Tora!"" Aside from that little observation, the movie is very much worth watching. Whether you're a sucker for romance comedies, Greek tragedies, or all-out action flicks this movie has something for everyone. Just witnessing Affleck's color-changing face trick is worth the price of admission."

","While I certainly can't fault the special effects or pyrotechnics in the movie, it never seems to capture a sense of urgency.  In short, the movie comes across as surreal, unengaging, and the characters remain shallow and undeveloped.  The portrayal of americans as bumbling, lascivious drunks and playboys almost makes you want to root for the Japanese, who viewed the attack as a necessity to preserve their way of life, and to keep the Empire from crumbling.  During the dogfighting scenes, you find yourself wondering who is shooting at whom, and when a plane finally explodes, you are left with a feeling of indifference.  After watching this film, I felt as if I should have done something else for 3 hours, such as perhaps watch two other movies instead."

"robotsareevil","3","0","0","29 May 2001"," Pearl Harbor: Sink or Swim
","The latest film out from Jerry Bruckheimer, Pearl Harbor, marks Hollywood's latest entry in the Extended Play Club. Running just over 3 hours in length (not including the credits), Pearl Harbor sets out to accomplish one simple task: to bring the totality of the events of December 7th, 1941 to heart and mind. This, is what it sets out to do. What they actually accomplished was something quite different. <br/><br/>Pearl Harbor produced many emotions in me, not least of which was the emotional response to the destruction of the Japanese attack on the U.S. Naval base, and the finality and reality of death. However, the one true feeling that this movie spawned was bewilderment. <br/><br/>In setting out to create a specific plot that would add some focus to the broader story of the attack and beginning of U.S. involvement in the war is a romance, featuring our films three main stars. Yes, that's right, I said three. Our blockbuster face, as you must by now know, is that of Ben Affleck who plays pilot Rafe McCawley. Co-Starring as his life-long best friend Danny Walker is the not-as-well-known Josh Hartnett. Hartnett has appeared in a few films (Town and Country, The Faculty), but this surely intended to serve as his star power engine. And the love of these two character's young lives, Evelyn Johnson, is played by Kate Beckinsdale (Brokedown Palace, Much Ado About Nothing). These young stars strive through most of the movie to do their best at confusing the intentions of the film and the audience in general. <br/><br/>The fact is that while there is this impending doom reminiscent of ""Titanic,"" insofar as that you KNOW that the Japanese are going to attack, the production team does its best to make you forget about that. Their attempts, of course, fail miserably. The thing they succeed in doing is creating a paradox of sorts. While you know what's going to happen, there is this constant feeling that you don't really know anything at all. The romance that develops between these three characters is so twisted and confused that by the time the attack rolls around you're so out of sorts you're wondering if maybe the American's will win the fight this time.<br/><br/>I feel pressured somehow to recommend that you see this film for yourself. I say that because I don't really trust the reviews of anybody other than myself, and can't require that any other person does the same. But at the same time I cannot in good conscience say that it is a good film. It is ""alright."" <br/><br/>Many historians have criticized `Pearl Harbor' for inaccuracies, and while watching it you certainly can understand why. It is a blockbuster for Blockbuster's sake. It is no ""Saving Private Ryan."" It's not even a ""Titanic."" <br/><br/>This is not the best movie I've seen in a long time. This isn't even the best movie I've seen this week. ""Pearl Harbor"" leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>The one thing that I can say about ""Pearl Harbor"" is that it gives you everything your expecting when you get there, and it does them as well as you'd expect. The attack sequence is what I was awaiting when I got there, and I got what I was waiting for. It was the superfluous psycho-romance that surrounds and penetrates the attack that really drives this tirade today.<br/><br/>Great Effects. Generally Good Acting. Good Directing. But was the screenwriter smoking crack? <br/><br/>Grade: C (60%)"

","This was a good movie with some real wit and not a bad love storty. She's too gorgeous not to fall in love with.  I enjoyed the film. The battle scene was something else, almost too frightening.  It was corny at times but it's a stupid war movie about something that everyone and their brother knows all about.  The audience I watched it with laughted, cried and appeared to enjoy the money they spent to watch it. The critics seem more concerned about how much money was spent and the fact that the film did not have some great moral lessons or story, like Gladiator or Titanic.  One has actually used the love story from Titanic as some form of standard for what makes for a good story. Go figure! I gave it a Nine and hope it makes lots of money."

","""Pearl Harbor"" is an overlong, directionless wanna-be epic that ultimately strikes out on all counts.  It could have been a good war movie, or a decent romance, but putting the two together with ham-handed dialogue that could have been written by a tenth grade English class simply makes this a movie that shines in its mediocrity.<br/><br/>The battle sequence itself is technically impressive.  From the moment the Japanese take off from their aircraft carriers, moviegoers are treated with 45 minutes of explosions, mayhem and death.  Of course, ""Pearl Harbor"" dehumanizes the battle itself quite spectacularly; you're left feeling like you've just been inside a video game that lacks the humanity that made the battle sequences in ""Saving Private Ryan"" so powerful.  War isn't hell so much in ""Pearl Harbor"" as it is big and loud.  And fun--perhaps too much fun.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, to get there, you have to sit through the interminable, plodding backstory.  It is simply amazing how screenwriter Randall Wallace and director Michael Bay are able to expand twenty minutes of soap opera rubbish into an hour and a half.  There are enough predictable plot twists, campy dialogue, and shameless sappiness to cut out the superfluous ""war"" parts and make this into a crappy romance flick.<br/><br/>The acting isn't much better.  Ben Affleck can be so much better than this, but he seems not to make much of an action hero (this doesn't bode well for the next Tom Clancy movie).  His delivery is wooden, his character unconvincing, and his performance below-average.  Josh Hartnett, by contrast, does a respectable job, considering the material he's been given to work with.  Kate Beckinsale does a good job of playing her character as cheesily as it's written.  Unfortunately, she squanders the few chances she gets to try and break out a little.<br/><br/>The supporting cast doesn't do much to help things along, either.  In particular, Cuba Gooding, Jr. presents a bit of a conundrum.  One can't help but feel that his character is inserted in the film as a throwaway to modern politically-correct sentiments (as indicated by the use of ""cook"" as an epithet).  His character, Dorie Miller, was one of the few truly outstanding heroes to come out of the battle, and deserved far more screen time--and story--than he got.  The rest, especially Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd, are characters that do little or nothing to help the central love story and, as a result, are relegated to the background.<br/><br/>In the end, you'll leave ""Pearl Harbor"" feeling rather ambivalent.  Part of you will have thrilled to the excitement of the second half of the movie. The rest of you will wonder why you had to be bored to tears in order to get there."

","At first, I did not plan to see this movie.  However, I ended up watching it on opening day.  My expectations weren't low, even though I've been hurt by numerous Bruckheimer-produced failures before (Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds, and worst of all, Armageddon).  I went in with a LINE of people, filing quietly into a theater that was simply packed.  However, even the mounds of hype didn't help me to enjoy this movie.  It did not save me when the gaudy camera angles began, the sappy music flooded my ears, and the sh*t-script started spouting itself at my brain. My argument is not necessarily against the actors (who can't help who directs them, nor can they be blamed for the terrifyingly disgusting script), but it is against the script.  The dialogue is, in a word, crappy. Frequent one-liners do NOT make a movie good, ever.  The main target of the script seemed to make a love story (in a triangle, no doubt).  The movie shouldn't have been named Pearl Harbor.  Because of the disgusting plot, it should have been something like ""Love Harbor"" or ""Disneyfied Crap"".  The latter embodies the movie very well, in that the movie was a Disneyed up recreation of overly patriotic views on something real. That isn't to say that the incidents that occurred surrounding the event weren't interesting.  As a matter of fact, history is compelling and complex enough, filled with wonderful characters and story elements, that it doesn't need a poorly-written love triangle to motivate it.  Whoever had their hands in writing the screenplay should cut them off, and spare us the annoying drivel that we see too often in Bruckheimer/Disney films. Not only did this movie try to make up boring stuff to fill in the gaps between explosions, but it also attempted to alter history.  Why are the Japanese so cold and emotionless?  Who knows?  The only halfway sympathetic one was the admiral.  In truth, the Japanese were supposed to give warning to the Americans prior to the assault, and were not aware that they were attacking unprepared targets.  Yet, the movie refuses to acknowledge this, even going so far as to have a commanding officer gloating about surprising the sleeping Americans. In an attempt to be patriotic, Pearl Harbor also made the Americans heartless b****rds.  No one cares, of course, because we all live in America and want to see ourselves winning all the time.  That doesn't mean that it isn't horribly wrong.  In the movie, we let the racial slurs fly and blow up Japanese just to blow them up.  Never mind the fact that Ben Affleck's character had his as* kicked by the Germans less than an hour in... On, the topic of the explosions, I'm forced to say that I am not impressed.  The explosions were actually pretty good, but there were far too few of them.  Nothing cool happens until about two thirds of the way through, and then it ends before you want it to.  The finale of the film, which does involve explosions, was dull and boring, and by that time I didn't care enough anyway.  I was sleepy.  And I WASN'T sleepy before the movie had started. The direction was pure Bay.  That's not a horrible thing in and of itself, but it was like Bay to the Nth here, and THAT is a bad thing.  Every second it was different angle, and each one was either in a contrasting color tone to the previous one, panning quickly, or shaking terribly.  Not to mention the hospital scenes involving what looked like a digitally-added blur effect.  Who thought of that?  It was friggin' retarded.  It was poorly-placed and didn't mix well with the rabid intercuts everywhere.  And let's not forget the jittery ""Cops""-esque following shots.  I was surprised whenever I saw a smooth shot of ANYTHING in that theater.  Movies are cool, and experimental direction is cool, but only when it doesn't result in me nearly having seizures.  The movie was so nauseating, I could barely sit through it with opened eyes.  I wanted to vomit, and not just because of the poor performances. The movie is best summed up with the ending, in which Beckinsale's character has to give a voiceover explanation of what you just spent three hours watching.  Not only was the character giving the voiceover completely out of place in doing so, but if the movie had actually done its job of expressing anything you'd care about, the voiceover wouldn't be needed. It just seems like Bruckheimer and crew didn't care at all about this film.  Instead of telling you a story that you care about, they're trying to tell you that they believe in what they made.  Even then, it was a half-effort.  Thanks for wasting nine of my dollars, guys.  I didn't appreciate it.  Then again, after looking at the script, I probably wouldn't have cared either. Don't watch this movie.  Unless you're a total friggin' cretin, you won't enjoy it."

","After reading the critics comments about this movie, I almost didn't go to see it. Thank goodness, I have stopped counting on critics to determine my viewing. This movie was wonderfully done. It shows the age of innocence when the men who went to war still believed in the greatness of America and exemplified the dreams and hopes of the country.<br/><br/>One of the complaints I heard was that the movie sounded too much like a 1940's movie. Yes, there was a reason for that. Perhaps because it took place during the 1940s and they wanted us to remember how life was back then.<br/><br/>Of the interviews given by survivors of the attack, nearly all had declared how true to life this movie was. That they could remember the sounds of the bombs as they exploded, the screams and cries of the sailors who were far from ready to embark on a war, let alone have their very ships blown out from beneath them.<br/><br/>The language, the actions, the hopes and expectations were authentically reflected in this movie. I can see this will become a classic in the coming years. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan showed the abject horror of the Second World War. Pearl Harbor gave us a glimpse of the innocence and, perhaps the overt optimism, which was felt during this time. If anyone criticizes this movie for being too formulaic, perhaps they need to see the movies of the fifties and sixties made about WWII, From Here to Eternity, South Pacific and others. I feel this will be a classic."

","When I first heard of ""Pearl Harbor"" I couldn't wait to go and see it. I finally got a chance to see it on Memorial Day. The movie was full of an on going romance that that could have been left out. The romance part of this movie was worse than a day time soap opera. The battle scene's in this movie were good but nothing special. I mean during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor the main characters seem to escape death everytime they are shot at. Then Danny and Rafe are able to outrun Japanese planes and get to 2 fighter planes. They take off and kill 7 Japanese pilots. They get awarded metals and fly a Top Secret mission. Evelen (Rafe's ex-girlfriend who had sex Danny after Danny had been presumed dead) is able to  convince a Major she saved to let her be in the command post where she could receive infomation about Danny and Rafe.If that is not enough there is a slant to this movie. They made the Japanese feel sorry about what they did right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. For those of you who dont know history that is not posssible for them to feel bad. I realy cant say anymore about this movie because it fried my brain (anyone who is not tired or who had enough energy to walk after this movie is not human). I really do want think any more about this movie. Take my advice and don't see it. You wont miss out on anything.

","There may be crucial SPOILERS mentioned....<br/><br/>Wow. i just saw Pearl Harbor, the so-called ""big time"" movie of the summer.  If you ask me, it was a ""big"" waste of time. I  fell asleep in the beginning of the movie, something i have never done before.  Fortunately for me, the movie gets better as it progresses. As i was watching the beginning third of the movie, i wasn't sure that i was watching the right movie. it seemed to me as more of a chick flick than an action-packed movie, So there's this girl is with this guy, then he leaves and supposedly dies, so she goes with his best friend.  then the first guy comes back and feels totally betrayed. Total chick flick stuff if you ask me. While half awake, i notice that the movie is starting to get a bit like what i expected.  The bombing at Pearl Harbor.  One part I particularly liked was the sound of the Japanese torpedoes in the water. I could replay over and over that scene.  I think more blood could have been shown, more reality but then this was Pg-13 so i wasn't too disappointed. <br/><br/>The bombing of Pearl Harbor is over, so i thought "" ok, time to leave"". However, the movie continued to play, and we discover that Evelyn, the girl, is pregnant with Danny's child.  So she's going to stick with him instead of Rafe.  Ok, Rafe somewhat understands, he and Danny are going on this ""top-secret"" mission.  and they leave Evelyn behind in Hawaii. From that moment, i just knew Rafe was going to die.  I mean, how are they supposed to resolve this love triangle is someone doesn't die? I kind of thought this was like Armageddon, where out of the two guys, one can die, and one can live, the one who dies is dying to protect the other.  And i thought that Rafe would die, and Danny would live since Rafe was such a big brother character to Danny.  And i was wrong and surprised.  Instead, Danny gets shot by the Japanese when they landed in China after bombing Japan ( the top secret mission).  Personally i like it when movies don't turn out the way you want them to because then the movie doesn't seem like a waste of six bucks.  Whats the point of seeing a movie when you already can guess the ending? The ending..i thought that the ending was very satisfying.  It was kind of like the ""happy ever after"" yet not so sappy.  I especially liked it when Rafe took Danny Jr., ( Danny's son) flying with him.  It was very cute."

But I still gave this movie a 10 because the battle scene made up for the beginning love story. I think this movie didn't have to be a 3 hours+ movie. Also, I think they should of got a different director and script for the love story part because it would be a better movie with a better director who could handle a love story.

","*My congratulations to Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, I could not resist using this.<br/><br/>Just how good or bad PEARL HARBOR is taken to be will depend on how many films the moviegoer has seen and therefore how large their internal database of war movie cliches is; in other words the more is definitely not the merrier here. Even films that are only set during the WW II era are at risk to be plagiarized, as a plot device of THE CIDER HOUSE RULES shows up. Yet no matter how many they throw into PEARL, it never seems to get interesting. Summer movies are expected to be dumb, but boring? Anyone following Randall Wallace's career should not find this too surprising as BRAVEHEART (with much input from Gibson I suspect) is looking more like the exception from the man who once wrote for the tv show ""Hunter."" And anyone familiar with Michael Bay's oeuvre should know better than to expect him to realize or care how much work the script needed. He has far more respect for bomb trajectories than story or character development.<br/><br/>What is surprising is that for Jerry Bruckheimer film, it is surprisingly miscast. With characters so uninspiringly written, getting actors that could bring something to the part was essential. Instead, we get the WB Goes to War of choices. Ben Affleck continues to make the case for not being cast as the lead in action roles (REINDEER GAMES and ARMAGEDDON too quickly forgotten, with him taking over the Jack Ryan role yet to come. Yikes!). Compounding this, they cast Josh Hartnett so as not to overshadow him. No worries there as Hartnett seems to be channeling Clint Eastwood, right down to the squint. As to their object of mutual affection, Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress but doesn't have the pep or spark that inspires love triangles.<br/><br/>Just how good this film could have been is evident in the fact that the very same visuals that are wasted on a screenplay that could have been bested by simply shuffling together an old ""Love Boat"" script with one from ""The A Team"" were cut together to make one of the best coming attraction trailers of the last ten years. Using Hans Zimmer's THIN RED LINE score (""The Village"" for those who want to run out and find it), it suggested in under four minutes the scope, humanity, pathos and majesty this story demands that are not to be found in the bloated three hours of the actual film.<br/><br/>The only real redeeming aspect of this otherwise mind-numbingly boring film is luckily for the filmmakers the raison d'etre the vast majority of ticket buyers are showing up for - the bombing of Pearl Harbor sequence. Clocking in at 35 minutes, it will for some audience members be worth the admission. Torpedoes slam into hulls, bombs crash through decks and all manner of pyrotechnic mayhem is unleashed in a torrent of flying debris. It never approaches the intensity of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or the scale of THE PHANTOM MENACE, but works on it's own level. Very few shots have the cartoony feel that so much CGI effects impart, the truly sad exception being the explosion of the Battleship Arizona. Great explosion... and unrealistic as hell. Nothing matches the grandeur of the ""money shot"" from the trailer, the one that follows the bomb from the plane all the way to the deck.<br/><br/>The only problem with this maelstrom is that it has no sense of geography or scale. One never knows where the different locations are in relation to one another and the entire fleet seems to be sitting in one place. Once the attack commences, it seems that same nine planes are unleashing the munitions while the other 270 are off elsewhere, taking pictures perhaps. Not to mention the chronology of events becomes hazy, the first wave indistinguishable from the second. There's a reason most films that deal with large scale assaults, like MIDWAY, use a lot of subtitles to identify the players and locations.<br/><br/>There's an old joke about Deadheads that goes one day at a Greatful Dead concert they ran out of drugs and one Deadhead turns to the other and says ""Wow, man, the band really sucks."" So goes the joke, so goes PEARL HARBOR. Every year or so a film manages to become through both design and happy accident the beneficiary of want-to-see hype. In PEARL HARBOR's case the usual wave of interest that such hype produces has become a tsunami because of an alignment of unique factors, most notably the absence of any other event films this summer that appeal to such a broad range of sex and ages. What does any of this have to do with how good a film PEARL HARBOR is? Nothing, but it will explain why two days after seeing it very little will be memorable and why years down the road battle sequences aside the movie will then seem pretty lame. In other words, ""Wow, dude, the movie really sucks."""

"kirkster42","Null","0","0","28 May 2001"," What a cheesy piece of celluloid!
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Where do I start?  I was quite disappointed with Pearl Harbor having looked forward to its release for several months.  I thought for sure that the writer of Braveheart could construct a deep and emotional account of such a crucial event in American history.  And there was no way that Bay/Bruckheimer could completely commercialize the traumatic attack.  But boy was I wrong.  This film could have been so good but instead it is so mediocre.  While it did have some redeeming qualities, for the most part it was piss-poor.  And here's why: PROBLEMS -- 1. Silly/Cheesy Dialogue: far too many sappy lines (Ex. ""It's your nose that hurts."" ""No, I think it's my heart."") And F.D.R. rising from his wheelchair to inspire his advisors, give me a break.  2. Editing Was Too Fast: many of the transitions were unintentionally jumpy.  It made me feel like some information had been left out. (Ex. Affleck telling Beckinsale that ""this is the best night of my life.""  This made no sense to me because I didn't see anything so great about it.  It seemed to me that Bay had to cut out some important action because the film was already three hours long.)  3. Too Predictable: I mean, who didn't know that Affleck was still alive and would be coming back to find his best friend with his girl (who is also pregnant).  4. Ridiculous Characters: the stuttering marine was funny for about a split second, the rest of the time it was stupid.  And it is entirely implausible that James King's character would fall for him, it's just silly.  I could go on and on but I guess I'll stop here.  In conclusion, the first half of the film and bits and pieces of the middle and end are entirely rubbish.  A pure waste of time.  While the middle portion and the actual attack is engaging and entertaining, I'm not sure if it makes up for the other garbage.  Why include the love story?  Why not depict the actual events leading up to the attack and maybe include some real stories from survivors?  Look at Saving Private Ryan.  The film didn't need a love story.  It focused on the emotions of war and the comradery developed when soldiers are thrown into battle.  When I left Ryan I felt the upmost respect for anyone who has served their country and risked their life for freedom.  But Pearl Harbor evoked no emotions except, ""Wow, these dogfights are cool."" or ""Well, it does have great special effects.""  I left the theater wondering if PH did justice to the 1,100 men and women who lost their lives in Hawaii, or if it simply provided Bay/Bruckheimer with an opportunity to make a lot of money by blowing things up."

","'Pearl Harbor' is just the latest example of how Hollywood can screw up a potentially great film. Contains spoilers. The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a tragedy of mass proportions and that's just what the movie should have been about. The tragedy. In typical American-Hollywood fashion, they take the film too far (and I'm not complaining about the three hour length. A good film will keep me in the chair all day), to the point where the Americans get revenge. Going into the Doolittle Operation was unnecessary. It just goes to show that Hollywood types believe the silly notion that American moviegoers have to feel good at the end of a movie. That's not true. All films don't have to do that. Jon Voight was excellent as President Roosevelt. The relationship triangle between the two male leads and the female lead was poorly done and confusing. It's a bad love story when you don't know who she really loves. And even worse, in the end, she really doesn't choose. ... coming back from the dead is a bad movie cliche. I've never seen that one before. Yeah, right. Cuba Gooding Jr. is an excellent actor, but his character isn't developed at all. He wins a boxing match. He saves somebody. A lot of people were saving others in the film. Was being the first black man to do something the reason? I would have liked to have known more about the Japanese, too. The men in charge of the attack seemed remorseful, but the reasons they gave for the attack seemed insufficient. Overall, I'd say this movie was below average. It will make a lot of money because it's a topic that touches a lot of Americans."

","Do we really need a three hour exploration of a love triangle with a Pearl Harbour background?  Thats what this movie is - do not be decieved by the trailers - this is not ""Saving Pearl Harbour"". It is the same as every single other big blockbuster.  You basically have two seperate movies - one with a hackneyed, cliched, ""I've seen this about a million times"" love triangle between two young friends and the woman they love, and the other a kick-ass action sequence which accurately portrays the complete and utter surprise the Japanese caught the Americans in.  The lines in the first hour and a half are SO CHEESY - but not GOOD cheese.  I can't believe Ben Affleck did not crack up saying his lines, they are that bad. ""I may be going to die, but thinking of you is what will keep me alive.  I can't die - I've only just met you.""  That is the caliber of dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsdale.  <br/><br/>I have to say, once the action heats up, and the planes start coming, the movie moves into what it should have been all along - get rid of the love story between the three main stars - concentrate on the horror and shock the attack inflicted on the American troops.  The producers and directors got this right - Pearl Harbour was caught not just with their pants down, but off, hanging on the chair, and neatly folded.  Problem is, you've been lulled to sleep by the horrible dialogue, cheesy acting and bad script, that the attack loses some of the punch it otherwise might have had.  Thats not to say its not powerful, but the people behind Saving Private Ryan had it right - shock the hell out of the viewers FIRST, then insert great story (Bruckheimer would have to get a good story before he tries it, but its not in this cookie-cutter movie).  Also, the bit with Cuba Gooding Jr.?  Did that not seem horribly tacked on to you?  Did it have ANYTHING to do with the rest of the movie, except to get another big name (not to mention black) star into the movie?  I'm sure the story of his character - the first black man to win the Silver Star - is an interesting one, but its just kind of thrown in there, as a side show (I kept seeing ""TOKEN BLACK MOMENT"" flash across the screen for some reason - this story deserved more emphasis and care then the producers gave it here - I feel sorry for Cuba..)<br/><br/>In short, you've seen the movie before.  But at least Titanic had the cool bad guy.  Everyone in this movie is so whiny (Titanic also had Kate Winslet naked, but Beckinsdale expects us to believe she would make love with the man of her dreams with her UNDERWEAR ON...not terribly important, but another stupid moment in a stupidly conceived movie..).  Its worth going on cheap night to see the action, and the final moments with the squadron of B-17s attacking Tokyo (a little known historical tidbit dealt with quite well, and an aviation feat quite spectacular), but it doesn't overcome the first hour."

","I came in with some lower expectations for this film and it still didn't meet them.  There is no connection at all between any of the leads here, although it's the fault of the story and script as much as the actors and the director.  Cuba Gooding Jr. turns in a fine performance despite being in the movie 10 minutes tops.  It's a shame, because his character and FDR are the only characters you'll care about in this movie.<br/><br/>Our fearless leads are paper-thin, there's NOTHING different between Danny and Raph...we're supposed to like them because they used to always dream of flying...their nurse girlfriend in the love triangle Evelyn has absolutely no background at all, we don't know where she's from or what she did before back home and it doesn't really matter because she's a hot nurse, right? There's another guy in the lovable crew that stutters and some assorted nurses no one cares about.  Pretty awful stuff.<br/><br/>The film is shot pretty well and the SFX are generally good (but not a blow-away great as one might expect).  But they are used in a way that's not nearly as effective as Saving Private Ryan or Titanic, which the battle scenes will make you think of.  There is not much else redeeming here, the score is quite forgettable and generic despite coming from Hans Zimmer. The attempts at humor fall pretty flat.  The whole movie is extremely predictable to boot.<br/><br/>Let's not forget what happens after the Pearl Harbor attack itself; the ending hour or so of the movie should have been completely cut as it only serves to make the film worse... this is really when the movie sinks into ""The Perfect Storm""-level badness.  Most of what did actually work in the movie gets thrown out the window for a completely pointless attempt to give us patriotic feelings or something, I guess.<br/><br/>Bay's other films like the Rock and Armageddon (both of which I enjoyed), however maligned they are, are vastly superior to this one.  At least those films had some characters to care about.  There was tension there that this movie lacks... this movie is truly lacking heart.<br/><br/>Still probably worth a rental just for the 45-minute battle scene but the rest is very worthless. 3/10 (just for the Battle Scene), rest of the movie (1/10)"

It has developed characters, history, love, and action.  If all you want is action go see The Mummy II.  If you want history rent Tora! Tora! Tora!

"dust-7","Null","0","0","27 May 2001"," Great film - only if it 'calls to mind'
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>It's a great film. But . . . . it IS cliched. Basically, what you have is a 21st century war propaganda film . . . about WWII. Remember now - after the movie - BUY WAR BONDS!<br/><br/>Or, in other words, if the film works, at points, I think it's really for no other reason than that it was released on Memorial Day. I found it very moving when, toward the end, the dead still entombed in the Arizona Memorial, were mentioned by the narrator. If you identify with the love interest, and clearly the critics are loathe to do so, but where the sets and costumes and 'Francis-style' lighting encourage one to think 1940s . . 1940s, then she becomes a symbol; as you'd expect from a propaganda film. She's not just the 'dame' in the love triangle. Rather, she's the women who lost men in wartime, who served in the nursing core, both at Pearl and so many other places, and so forth. Frankly, I think Private Buckaroo, or Action in the North Atlantic, and Walking in the Sun, and so on, were better propaganda efforts, actually produced during the war. But . . . this is 2001, after all. In Titanic, the tacked on love story represented nothing but the characters, themselves, and badly at that. If Evelyn and the others are seen to represent so many others from that era, then Titanic, it's not.<br/><br/>As for the characters, then, it's difficult to see Danny as a pilot. He doesn't look it any more than Cruise did in the much earlier Bruckheimer-fest of Top Gun (where the tacked on love story, there, was disastrous, and for the career of McGillis, as well - Kelly who?). Now Anthony Edwards, I believed. And one can imagine Rafe, both in England and elsewhere. Old photos from Britain, during the Battle of Britain, show 'fly-boys' who literally look like Hollywood's central-casting image of a fighter pilot - but for real. So Affleck is believable because . . he's that. He's the guy on the poster, telling you about those war bonds. Beckinsale's Evelyn is also nearly believable. But I think I believe the romance and proposal from the stuttering 'Red', much more easily.<br/><br/>Ironically, I found the Doolittle Raid more involving than the sneak attack on Pearl. It's interesting that critics trying to demonstrate some command of history, here and elsewhere, forget conveniently that the attack was a secret, sneak attack. There was no 'warrior code' to be found, anywhere. It was purely a cowardly bombing run on a military base, one asleep and unaware than some particular country was literally now in a shooting war with the US. It was like the 'japs' shooting an unarmed country in the back, as it were. And it surely infuriated the American people - precisely - for that reason. That wasn't propaganda and lies. That was the reality. One could argue Roosevelt 'set it up', and so on, and so forth. But nobody made or forced the Imperial Japanese fleet to bomb the American Pacific Fleet when war had not even been declared. All for the Empire, when it was the very idea of that Japanese Empire which had to be defeated - as it was for Italy and Germany, and their '1000-year empires'. It's why the exploits of the sub crew in Das Boot, an extraordinary film, are such a tragedy - for their individual heroism, their 'imperial' cause rightly reduces them to playing the heavy.<br/><br/>The Doolittle Raid seemed the better of the two key sequences only because more of the details seemed to be revealed. The plane crash in China may have been the most striking sequence. And historically the raid was a huge propaganda victory for the Allies who felt themselves clawing at the cliff of survival in the face of the Axis; and just as mentioned by the film's narrator, here. The raid on Pearl seemed a little light on such details. The smoke, for example, is almost absent when compared with photos and footage of just after the 2nd wave. In reality it looked like a massive tire fire, a firestorm. In the film, it looked like isolated smudge pots. The oil soaked sailors seemed believable. But the immediate rescue efforts seemed a little weak. They had more equipment than that ready to go. But film budgets are film budgets, even if they're huge. And where was the scout plane which led the attack? I thought surely that was the purpose of the opening scene in the duster - because of the visual similarity to the Japanese scout.<br/><br/>Overall, sure . . . Rafe and Danny sink the carriers at Midway - well, if the film continued that long, sure it would have been Rafe. And he'd probably have been piloting the Enola Gay, as well, after having just single-handedly shot down a German mini-jet. Film makers can be excused for 'composite experiencing'. And such cliche as in this film is also - about - other films. It's not honest by itself. It calls . . to mind, other things. But if the critics wanted a good story, as they say, then they wouldn't make such a play about Shawshank - a hopelessly overrated effort - or American Beauty or other such wastes. That they pan this effort says nothing about filmmaking, and everything about agendas. I and others can have our agendas. And I most surely do. All those on imdb.com can have their agendas. And clearly many do. But critics tell us it's about the movies, for them - and they seem even less about the movies than the PR flacks which ginned up the Shawshank count here on this website. It's not so much that this film is 'critic proof'. I doubt few liked Raiders of the Lost Ark when first released. I think the LA guy panned it, only to have to quickly 'amend' his review a month or so, later (Champlin was his name?). It's really - why . .. . critics? I understand the concept. It's the execution that puzzles me. What the heck is a critic if he's just a Clinton-shilling Ebert, or some other slow-witted, mindless zealot who could care less about the steak, and prefers to tell the sizzle how it sounds? You know - guy - what about . . . the actual movie? That's what we're paying to see."

","What is the deal with this movie.  I went in to the theater expecting to see a movie about Pearl Harbor.  After about 90 minutes, I did see this Pearl Harbor movie.  This ""Pearl Harbor"" movie lasted at most one hour.  After this two and a half hour romp, i was disgusted to see that there still was another 33 minutes left.<br/><br/>For a film being called Pearl Harbor, there was very little focus on the events of Pearl Harbor.  Instead the majority of the film was focusing on the love triangle between two boys fighting over the same girl.  The problem with this was that the love was too artificial and not real at all.  The characters seemed as though they were paper thin, and did not have any interest in one another.<br/><br/>Although I will give credit where credit is due, when the movie stuck to its title, it was an exposition on a grand scale.  The visuals of the bombing were stunning, and amazing.  I was captivated for this 40-60 minute time period, that is about all.  The other two hours were meaningless jargon gathered in an attempt to make this Disney's ""Titanic.""  That is exactly what Disney got, a love story as pitiful as Titanic, with some nice visuals to try and compensate for where the movie lacks.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I felt myself just wanting to be watching other movies.  I wanted to be watching ""The Rock,"" another Michael Bay joint. This movie is better than Pearl Harbor, two fold.  I also found myself wanting to watch Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.  This is a much better telling of a war story.<br/><br/>All in all, when going to see Pearl Harbor, I just expected to see a movie about Pearl Harbor.  If I wanted a love story, I would have seen a film like Bounce, or When Harry Met Sally.  Michael Bay should stick to what he is good at, and that is action.  Pearl Harbor succeeds a great deal when it deals with action.  It is too bad that it only lasts for about 40 minutes of a 180 minute film.  Grade: C-"
"dprice6","Null","0","0","27 May 2001"," Good War, Bad Love
","The attack of Pearl Harbor, as shown in the film, could be a great resource for history classes. Other than that, this movie doesn't have many high points. I loved the trailer (Going to a lot of movies, I must have seen it 7 times), the music from The Thin Red Line fit perfectly. The trailer made it look like it was a grand epic, with a little love story to make romantics happy.<br/><br/>Sadly, this is not the case. The first hour and 15 minutes (or so) of the film focuses mostly on the love story, and what will later become a love triangle. It is predictable, sappy, and overdone, not in an enjoyable way (as it was in You've Got Mail), but in a manner that becomes tiring all too quickly. At times you almost wish the Japanese would hurry up and bomb the place all ready, just so we can leave the pathetic attempt at romance alone.<br/><br/>Then there's the music. If you want a good movie, you must have good music. If you saw the trailer, you know what I mean by good music. Music that stirs the soul, the moves you just by hearing it. This was not the music we had for Pearl Harbor. I will confess now than I've never been a huge Zimmer fan, but I do believe when the time calls for it he can do well. I wasn't expecting much, but even I was disappointed by his score. One point which stands out to me was when Affleck was chasing a bomber after the bombing, while music played in a background which would of fit better in a Saturday morning action cartoon than this movie. The score was uninspired, and the ""great theme"", which was Zimmer's excuse for rushing the rest of the music, wasn't all that profound.<br/><br/>Another problem the film has is a contradiction between the script and the title. You would suppose the main characters would have us involved quite a bit with the events of Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the filmmakers are more concerned with telling their love story then what happened on the Infamous Day. The main characters get so off track, that another character (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has to be inserted into the story for no other reason than to have a point of view on Battleship Row during the bombing. The main characters are away from the action for the first half of the attack, and when they do enter they are not even involved in the major areas Pearl Harbor is known for. I have heard some comparisons between this film and Titanic. Though they both had love stories, Titanic was just as focused on the sinking of the ship as it was on its fictional tale of love. Pearl Harbor seems to be a love story which is interrupted by a bombing.<br/><br/>I may be a fool, but I somewhat judge a movie by its trailer. This can be misleading, especially with comedies, but usually dramatic films give you a good idea of the story in the trailer. All in all, get Pearl Harbor on DVD, but watch the trailer and the battle scenes only. The rest is a waste of your time. Two stars out of four."

","The mention of the two words Pearl Harbor conjures up so many different emotions.  One in particular, is sorrow.  Another is anger, and with hindsight, regret.<br/><br/>When I think of Pearl Harbor, I view it as the day that the U.S. lost its innocence and its reluctance into entering WWII wilfully. <br/><br/>
Even critics of the U.S. Military policy would be hard-pressed to see this day of infamy as anything but.<br/><br/>Over 3000 people died, most of them, even before they even had a chance to know what hit them.  To them, a motion picture that would document and help us to remember the spirit of these brave men and women would go a long way for the rest of us to remember them by and to never forget what sacrifice for love of country really is.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie doesn't even come close to render justice to those who lost their lives.  In fact, this movie trivializes and may down the road; even contribute to the falsification of its memory.  That is even beside the fact that it's an awful movie. <br/><br/>****** THERE ARE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE REVIEW.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ ON (OR READ ON AT YOUR OWN PERIL) ******<br/><br/>What is the point of showing lots of stuff being blown up and planes whizzing around doing acrobatic tricks in a historical context?<br/><br/>This is confusing for me because for a film that wants to 'accurately' depict what it was like to be there, it sure likes to gloss over the human component.  Why are explosions, crashes, bullets, fire, ships sinking and pilots rah-rahing are given absolute cinematographic clarity and visceral impact, yet the hospital wards filled with the burned, the wounded, the dying and the dead - the result of such a blatant act of war - blurred almost to the point where they're nothing more than figures pawing their way through the ether?<br/><br/>I certainly abhor pain and suffering, but in this case, blurring and softening the human plight of this attack doesn't offer a counter-point to the pyrotechnics we're seeing.  It removes the consequences of using instruments of mass destruction, and it certainly doesn't help us re-sensitise ourselves to the fact that regardless of what this war was about or who started it, it was messy, dangerous and tragic. <br/><br/>I think we're past the point where we can make overly-glorified movies that forget their sense of history and perspective.  Back in the late 40s and early 50s, they could justify their glorifications due to the Hayes code, and the massive debt of sensitivity owed to the men and women of the Armed forces, who still had these events fresh in their minds.  You would think 60 years would be enough to give a more sound perspective.  Apparently, for some movie directors and producers, it's not enough time, nor a compelling enough reason.<br/><br/>Had the premise of this movie were to be a video-game or a popcorn movie, then my chief criticisms would be the lackadaisical acting, the boring love triangle, and the simply awful dialogue in places.  `Just get me into a plane' says our square-jawed hero.  Sounds like a 12-year old wanting to get into those virtual video-game rides down at the arcade centre.<br/><br/>But this movie can cause more damage than simply be a vessel of bad acting, bad dialogue or story. It has the potential to re-write history like it was an arcade game, and worse, make us forget what really transpired on December 7th, 1941.<br/><br/>If this movie makes mountains of cash, it will be a testimony on how we consumers effectively turn historical moments into trivia, and our ability to draw understanding from tragedy reduced to terms of bankability."

","I'll start by saying that for quite a while I was looking forward to seeing this movie--that first teaser trailer blew me away, and just having seen that made me want to go out and see it. So I waited the months and the months until about a week before it came out, and I was reading some horrendous reviews from some of the finest critics out there. The one that made me go and see this movie was from Harry Knowles, who I usually tend to agree with about movies. So I went in expecting a fine film, and came out having seen a movie that is just about as bad a movie as you can get(with maybe the exception of Batman and Robin, or The Mummy Returns). The whole love story is wholly unoriginal and extrememly uninspired. Throughout the whole movie you just know what's going to happen next between Danny, Rafe, and Evelyn. I had the ending of the movie figured out almost right after the Pearl Harbor attack, which, for my money, is the highlight of the movie(the only highlight, by the way). The movie was WAAAAY too long(I got up to go to the bathroom twice, and didn't care at all that I missed some of the movie). Probably the finest performance of the movie was given by Leland Orser(the killer from the Bone Collector), the man that Evelyn saves in the hospital. John Schwartzmann's cinematography is excellent, as usual, as is Hans Zimmers score. I'm truly sad that the movie turned out the way that it did, because it had so many things going for it--an incredibly cinematic event, good actors(they're not great actors by any standard), a very cinematic director who COULD be great if he had the right script and the right producer, and a very accomplished composer. Unfortunately, it also has a VERY weak script from Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart(who is blatantly ripping off James Cameron's Titanic here in almost every respect), terrible acting from almost all sides, and again it's length--and I usually love a 3-hour movie. But not here. This movie should have ended after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but it couldn't do that--the studio heads have to sell this movie to the teenage girls who wouldn't know if this was historically accurate or not(it wasn't, for the most part). It makes me truly sad that this movie is going to be a huge moneymaker--I doubt if it will be the next Titanic, but it might make about 300 million or so. In closing, I'll just say that the only reason I would go to see this movie, or even recommend it, is the bombing sequence(or the first 25 minutes, at least). It is sad when a films visual effects are its finest accomplishment, but that is the sad fact here. God help the future of american cinema."
"rookie-8","2","0","0","27 May 2001"," Ending, subject make this movie awful....
","I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.<br/><br/>As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same ""one or two men can take on an army"" concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, ""why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie."" You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie."

","I would like to have a few words with Michael Bay.  If you're going to have a love story in a war movie, make it deep and passionate, with acting worth the film it is stored on.  The script was awful, with the most unrealistic dialogue ever, save personal injury attorney ads.  But despite this hour plus of shallowness, I still watched this movie with an open mind. My mind, however, began forming harsher judgements about this movie as the Japanese appeared more and more.  They were represented in the most ridiculous manner, with government meetings in outside teahouses, headband tying rituals for the fighter pilots, and percussion that practically cried ""Stormtroopers!"" overwhelming their scenes to boot.  I was embarrassed for the Japanese to the same extreme that I was embarrassed for the way the Native Americans were represented in Dances With Wolves.  Let's be honest, the whole world was scheming during this time.  Why make the Japanese out to be barbarians?  Yes, what they did to Pearl Harbor was devastatingly awful, but look what we did to Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  We killed how many MILLION? And don't forget that generations today are still recovering from God-knows how many types of cancer those two bombs invoked.  But, of course, the only U.S. retaliation pictured in this movie is a mere ""pin-prick,"" as Alec Baldwin puts it.  I fear the kind of stereotyped pretense the term ""Japanese"" will carry in the minds of those under 10 who see this movie. <br/><br/>On a more positive note, it would be hard to overlook the amazing action sequences, and I wonder not how $135 million was spent on this movie.  I just wish that the breathtaking views of this attack were in a movie that involved a higher standard of acting and scripting.

","A technical marvel of a movie, the actual scenes of the attack were beautifully rendered (as we might expect from a major summer blockbuster). Like just about every film of its ilk, the filmmakers seem to have blown the entire budget on major stars and effects, with little thought about characters or dialogue.<br/><br/>As in Titanic, we are introduced to several fictional characters and are expected to care enough about them to become involved in the movie. The exposition is weak however, as is the dialogue. As a result, the lead-up to the actual attack is nothing more than counting the number of ""famous last words"" lines: ""Pearl Harbor? That's about as far from the war as you can get!""; ""We feel that Pearl is the least likely spot for an attack.""; etc.<br/><br/>The main plot line, a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, is weakly set up. Danny's character is pretty weakly defined and the story arc is so predictable it is laughable.<br/><br/>Donal Logue's South Carolinian redneck backwoodsman character in The Patriot, after fighting alongside a freed slave for most of a year, tells the man before battle ""I'm honored to serve alongside you. Honored."" It was all I could do to not laugh aloud in the theatre.

","Pearl Harbor is an amazing movie that is hugely under rated. This 3 hour long account on the attack of Pearl Harbor is one of the best movie I've seen in a long time. In two days I've already seen it twice! The movie, based on the lives of two brother-like best friends, shows their past, the attack on Pearl Harbor (and their role) and the aftermath. Although it may seem like it'd be too long...once it's over it feels like it's been just an hour. The special effects are amazing, capturing the explosions that get right in your face and making you feel like your in the plane with Rafe and Danny. Ben Affleck is amazing, in which is considerably his best movie yet. Josh Hartnett plays amazing as well, along with the many other actors in the movie. The movie is a romance/war story with a love triangle between Rafe, Danny and the woman they both love, Evelyn. It's also got tones of action and some pretty good humor. If your going to see a movie soon, go to this one, it's by far the best movie in theatres.

The story is trite in a way, you can guess what will happen but then again like Titanic, the entire movie is about a historical event that everyone knows the ending of.  The three hours don't drag which I would say is due to the skillful weaving of the movie, there are separate plotlines, but they are presented as a coherent single movie, which need each other to survive.  The movie managed to bring me into the spirit of the time, I could get a sense of what the Americans would have felt at this point. Seeing the bombing raids, one got a sense of the outrage that would later allow events like Hiroshima and Nagasaki to occur.  The enemy wasn't portrayed as evil which was good, they were just people doing their jobs, but you were also presented with the American side, which was that they were bombed without provocation. However I didn't get a sense that we ever learned why they were bombing Pearl Harbor aside from some comment about needing oil, just that they were.  Other than that a great movie, one I would see again.  One word of advice to people going to see it though, try to remember that the movie is a movie, a fictionalized account of real events, this isn't a documentary and so shouldn't be treated as such."

Alec Baldwin seemed to be in a parody of this movie rather than the movie itself. And Dan Aykroyd just can't be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The script is horrific. We are supposed to believe that Affleck's character is so romantic while his romance consists of repeatedly spouting, ""You are so beautiful it hurts."" When it's said just once the line is stupid. When it's said three times the character is stupid - and again I want him dead.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr's character might as well be named Token for that is the only purpose he serves. He does not advance the story one iota, he just adds about twenty minutes to a movie that already feels as if it is longer than the whole war. And Randall Wallace would have us believe that two Army pilots and a few machine guns chased away the Japanese. Are we stupid? They seem to think so.<br/><br/>
The first air battle scene is directed so poorly that the audience is left asking what the hell happened. ***Minor Spoiler*** Apparently all that mattered was that Affleck's plane went down. As bad as this scene was they should have excised it and explained his downing through dialogue.

","This film would've been good, except for one thing:  Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer Films should've stuck with fiction.  It was obvious that they couldn't make a masterful film to describe the events of what happened that day, so they had to include a love story just to try and make it work as an epic.  It turns out to be more of a ""Titanic"" with battleships and zeros than a true historical account.  They also would go and greatly compromise historical accuracy for artistic intent, if you want to call a Bruckheimer film artistic.  The sequence where Pearl Harbour is attacked is very well done and the special effects are among some of the best and most realistic, but the cliched dialogue, addition of fictional characters, and the inclusion of the insipid love story really brings this movie down.  It may be entertaining to its intended core audience, the teenagers and twenty-somethings (although I am 19) that would absolutely adore cardboard cutout romance with the sex scene, but it would be perceived as a terribly mainstream film that fails utterly to be a gripping epic by those who appreciate good cinema.  It would, however, no doubt pay for itself in the box office this summer season.  But, high grossers are not always great films.  It's still worth a watch, but the *real* good Pearl Harbour flick is still ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".  If you've not seen that film, watch it as it is a greatly accurate historical film pertaining to the subject of the attack on Pearl Harbour, and was produced in cooperation by American and Japanese production companies for 20th Century Fox.  As for the best summer film, I think that honor would go to the upcoming ""Final Fantasy"" picture coming this July.  - Reinhart"

However, the ideas in Pearl Harbor are not as original as the Rock, and it re-used many ideas from both the Rock and Armageddon (you could argue it being the director's style, though).  The visual effects and sound are top-notch (you definitely have not see this before).  I was immensely entertained that's for sure.  Many critics suggested that the movie was too long and the first half was a waste of time.  I felt the opposite... I thought the movie took time to develop the characters and the story it wants to tell before sucking us into the intense attack scenes.  I like the way the romance was set as well, it was not as cheezy as I thought it to be. In fact, it's a lot better than the romance in 'Titanic'.  One flaw of this movie was the music I would say.

The first half of the film is well-written; the flow, though slow at times, is pretty good overall.  There are also many comical moments that provides great comic relieve.

No one ever said Bay can't blow up things in a virtuoso way, and the 35 minute Pearl Harbor bombing segment is a jaw dropper. If only Randall Wallace's cliche ridden script had been equally explosive. You get the feeling that Bay wants to earn respectability, that he wants to slow down his hyper kinetic tempo to make a film with texture. Unfortunately, he can't help himself, instead relying on a Norman Rockwell storyline of an America that never existed outside of a middle school textbook. Is there any cliche left unturned here?

A few cryptic, rushed along scenes of inscrutably stoic Japanese officers, frenetic US politicians, military advisors, and a determined FDR all changing world history in Michael Bay's patented emotional shorthand???????

","If you want romance and action, this movie is for you. I mean everyone has their outlet for mindless escapism.<br/><br/>Now, on for the review of what a mindless trite piece of $197,000,000 junk this movie really is.<br/><br/>This movie sucks. Go see it if you were thinking about Tora Tora Tora while watching Titanic. One big stupid and trite romance wrapped in a battle.. hmm.. I think it was Pearl Harbor. We're reminded of that every now and then, especially the armada of CGI battle sequences unleashed in between the romance parts.<br/><br/>The acting conveys a sense of ""let's go back to the overacting '40s where everything anybody says is stupidly profound or sappy"". Even back then though, people fell in love and there were good reasons. There isn't even any depth to their love in this movie save for some dumb romantic physical comedy. SPOILER ALERT Then the movie goes full-force into the battle, and combines it with lots of special effects that hilight impossible events. Like when they play ""chicken"" with the Japanese pilots and cause four of them to crash into each other... yeah, I'm sure that happened since their pilots didn't dominate almost every battle they were in for 15 years before Pearl Harbor due to their experienced and veteran pilots, right?... hint, I'm being sarcastic). Think about it... the Japanese lost 29 aircraft... 15 of which weren't anywhere near where those two Americans that actually, in reality, did get off the ground. So that means we have to believe that these two guys (one of them with no combat experience) downed 7 planes by themselves. heh. Anyway, maybe I'm being picky. But this is just one example.<br/><br/>Also, it is chock-full of classic cliche scenes (you know, those scenes where they do something in the movie that has been done time and time again to the point where you roll your eyes) like the following:<br/><br/>1. The ""Life Gasp"" where someone who's underwater finally reaches the surface of the water and a slo-mo shot catches them as they crash out of the water with a loud guttural intake of life-sustaining oxygen. Don't forget, it's gotta be a night-shot, even though you were shot down during the day.<br/><br/>2. The ""David vs. Goliath"" where the ship's cook who's NEVER shot a gun before mounts a .50 caliber turret and blows up a Japanese plane coming straight at him.<br/><br/>3. The ""So Close Yet So Far Away"", this is a modification of the ""Train Miss"" where she chases after the train so that they can exchange vows of love, and also extend their gaze for a little longer until they are parted and he goes off to war. In this modification, the couple don't actually meet. And the one in the train can't open the window to let the other one who's just outside the window know that ""I'm right here! Look up... don't look that way, just look up at me! I'm here dammit! Oh, damn, the train is leaving! Oh... so close... yet...."". OK I think I made my point.<br/><br/>4. The ""Hey, Don't Worry, This Bomb Is A Dud!.... KABLAMM"" I presume that you all know what this one means.<br/><br/>5. The ""We Are Enemy, In Other Words We Are Robots"" where, once again, the enemy is portrayed as a mindless uberlord-obeying personality-less group. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was bigoted or racist, but there is this undertone that is very reminiscent of the WWII epics of the '50s and '60s. There is virtualy NO human-side to any of the Japanese characters.<br/><br/>6. ""Our Flags Unfurled..."" where the US flag is shown torn/tattered/floating away in some symbolic way to show, in a ""deep"" way of course, how we've been brutally violated.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie will probably make hundreds of millions of dollars. I hope Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay can find the time to thank all those that died in WWII to make their movie a success.<br/><br/>The worst thing about it was that there were actually some good things in the movie, some real touching moments and some real emotion. But if you edit out all the junk, you have a 45 minute A&E or History Channel special.<br/><br/>Jeff (seriously, watch Tora Tora Tora... at least that movie focused on something important)"

","I was very leary when I saw the previews for Pearl Harbor.  Each preview showed the same thing, the bombing.  And because of the producers, I was wondering if that part was even going to be good.  Since those two have a reputation for ""bang bang blow them up"" type movies.  I always wondered what is the rest of the movie about, since all they show is the bombing in the previews.  Well I found out last night why they only showed those parts!<br/><br/>The movie is in 4 sections really.  The first is a little background on the two main characters (Affleck and Hartnett).  Then the love story begins. And I have nothing wrong with love stories.  In ""Enemy at the Gates"" there was a love story and it was well done.  But the love story in Pearl Harbor lacked emotion.  While watching I could truly care less about the characters, because the love story was so weak and that was the only place to meet the characters.  The only thing that kept me in my seat is the foreshadowing to the bombing.  The scenes with the Japanese planning the attack to me was great.  It added a lot of suspense and really created a tension that the love story lacked.  <br/><br/>The next part was the bombing.  This part was AWESOME.  Very well made.  YOu couldnt really tell it was CG, unlike some movies - cough - Mummy Returns - cough.  The dog fights were good and it was just a good part of the movie.  Now at this point I thought the movie was over.  And that they put the love story in to make the movie longer.  But in fact there was another 40 minutes.  <br/><br/>This 40 minutes consisted of the two characters (Affleck and Hartnett) going to be apart of the Doolittle project.  This two was a good part of the movie.  I think if they had not put so much time into the love story the movie would not have been so drastically long and would have gotten a higher rating from me.

They were fun -- good romps that weren't so schmaltzy as to be annoying.<br/><br/>No so for Pearl Harbor, which is so formulaic and over-the-top that I could barely sit through the entire film. If it weren't my partner's birthday and her desire to see the movie, I would've walked out.

But that's all I can recommend for the movie. The film struggles to identify itself as either a love story within a war or a war story with a love interest, neither achieving either successfully. The result is a romantic storyline that is overblown, forced, and all too predictable. <BEGIN SPOILER> Was anyone surprised at Ben Affleck's return halfway through the film? Neither was I. <END SPOILER><br/><br/>The feeling I had throughout the film can only be described as ""unengaged."" I found myself caring little about the three main characters, especially when the dialogue was so ridiculous and you knew what they were going to do before they did it. Unfortunately, that left me uninvolved in the development and execution of the actual attack, which was the best part of the movie. If anything, I was most drawn in by the performances of Jon Voight as President Roosevelt and Cuba Gooding Jr Dorie Miller. Voight is right-on and Gooding carries a strong presence when he is on screen. The problem is that Gooding's plot-line seems thrown in as an afterthought, only connecting to Kate Beckinsale's character through a brief and unaffecting encounter.<br/><br/>My suggestion to Bay and Bruckheimer is to cut completely the last part of the movie about the aftermath and subsequent American response, and then pick either the romance or the battle to focus on. Perhaps one of the two plots alone would make a nice, manageable 90 min feature. Better yet, give the audience a bit of respect and challenge them a bit with less schmaltz and more substance."

Thus, coming into this movie, I was expecting the worst, yet the hype, which was a blatant corporate onslaught for the last four months, made it seem bearable, at least for the first of the three hours.<br/><br/>As I entered the movie, in my somewhat intoxicated state of mind, the movie started with an overused example of a boy saving his friend from his deadbeat dad after he and his friend got busted for accidently flying his dad's plane on the typical midwest farm.  After watching this, I knew it was going to be a long movie.  As the movie progressed into the time of World War II, we meet the older Affleck, who we learn is an aspiring pilot, yet is somewhat illiterate, which is rarely touched on in the film.  Thus, in an effort to join the navy, he sweettalks the eye exam nurse into letting him pass his exam becuase it was ""his dream ever since he was little to fly with the birds"".  Consequently, Affleck and the nurse hit it off, yet this proceeds for another 90 minutes, until Pearl Harbor is even mentioned. Affleck and his friend compete for Evelyn's love, until the attack on the Harbor, which was a blatant attempt by Hollywood to make the Japanese look like murderers.  After the attack, you can probably guess how the movie unfolds, the good guy getting the girl, and so on. All in all, this movie sucked.  The appearance by Cuba Gooding Jr. was irrevelant, and Roosevelt is portrayed as a god.  There was no mentioning of the legacy of the attack, and the events leading up to the attack were completely misrepresented.  I wont digress into a history lesson or anything, but America did know that an attack on either the Phillipines or Guam or Pearl Harbor was imminent.  In this film, all the chiefs of staff are clueless, and try to act as befuddled as possible when they lose sight of the Japanese fleet.  The story surrounding the movie was as thin as ever, very Bruckheimer-esque.  Basically, the story was merely a backdrop for the attack scene, and also so the movie could be shown on two tapes.

At the time of the attack, approximately 60% of the population was of color (Asian, Hawaiian, etc.), yet it's hard to find any in the film!<br/><br/>Besides that, how many years must the Japanese be reminded that they started and lost the war?  This is just another bad reminder, along with the USS Missouri (the ship that the Japanese signed the surrender papers on). Let's forget the past and war and move on to the future and peace!"

","It's amazing how Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay ruined a perfect opportunity to make a patriotic statement as well as have a moderately good movie.  The bombing of Pearl Harbor is something that is a great part of our country's history.  For this movie to draw ANY comparisons to Saving Pvt. Ryan is a horrible thing.  That movie mad a good attempt at historical accuracy regarding what had actually happened, and should not even be mentioned with the atrocity that is ""Pearl Harbor.""  The movie was a generic love story, reminiscent of the happenings that also ruined ""Enemy at the Gates"" combined with the endless repetitive explosions that seem to be the entire focus of ANY Bruckheimer film.  The mindless explosions that Bruckheimer loves so much have become so repetitive that I even found myself falling asleep during the actual bombing scene. If you want to be entertained for three-and-a-half hours......don't go see this movie.....try knitting."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOIILERS*** ""Pearl Harbor"" should be that kind of movie that moves people on Memorial Day weekend. A movie that COULD honor those who mustered up their courage so we could live -- while the rest of America had fun, young men and women had to feel driven by adrenaline. It'd be really great if ""Pearl Harbor"" could show us all that sort of honor that we should remember ever year, if not every day.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" was a very badly acted soap opera, with a script I could write when I was 10 years old, a script ANYONE could write when they were 10 years old, that had such a lack of character development or any unifying point or theme I wanted to gag. I seriously wanted to leave the theater! It was an insult to my taste!<br/><br/>Evelyn had two hot guys at her disposal. She fell in love (in 2 days of course) with Ben Affleck, and when they thought he'd died she had sex with Josh Hartnett on a parachute. YES! It's as stupid as it sounds!<br/><br/>All right, so then Ben Affleck comes back out of nowhere saying he survived, and oh -- ""When I saw your face, Evelyn, I wanted to live! OH!"" Then the best friends fight, and all of sudden the harbor gets bombed and everyone's dying, but you DON'T CARE about them. They're just people dying. Cuba Gooding, Jr. had 20 minutes of talk time in this movie, oh, it was horrible.<br/><br/>
Then the chick is pregnant, and then the boys go on another mission to bomb Tokyo, and I was wondering -- ""PLEASE, let it end! IS this the climax or what?"" and Josh Hartnett dies, so Kate Beckinsale can make an easy decision on who should be the father of her baby -- ""Oh, what a relief. Now you boys don't have to fight for me!""<br/><br/>Some scenes would have been very moving if the rest of the movie wasn't such a load of crap. The hospital scenes were really cool (until Kate Beckinsale, after saving a man's life, told him later to let her in on the top secret mission her boyfriends are involved in because she saved his life. What a..... uh, that was sick.)<br/><br/>Ben Affleck cannot act. His attempt at emotion is very hilarious. Kate and Josh might have something there if there had been a well-done script (""oh, whenever i see the Pearl Harbor sunset I think of you!"" ""I won't let go, Jack, I won't let go...wait, wrong movie!) but Ben -- LOL, he's so beautiful, but he's very bland. Matt's better.<br/><br/>I would like to quote Rick from Casablanca in retrospect -- ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world..."" This movie preferred to make a big deal about choosing between two hot guys, like that was bigger than the deaths of million of other people in the Pearl Harbor bombing. ugh! I was so disgusted!<br/><br/>Character development was a major problem in this film. Every detail that was presented about anyone was trivial and disorganized. What about Cuba? We saw about 5 minutes of development, what emotional weight could that carry? Details were very immaturely put together, thus making the powerful bombing scenes pointless and emotionally empty. It was sad, but didn't come near tragic.<br/><br/>
People applauded at the end of this film!<br/><br/>JUST MY OPINION, though, hehe."

","""Pearl Harbor"" launches off the summer season promising some of the most spectacular battle footage on film.  While that is correct, the movie itself is brought down a couple notches by the story and it's rather lengthy method of unfolding.  At just a hair over three hours, ""Pearl Harbor"" doesn't pass like ""Saving Private Ryan"" did, but rather tends to take a bit too long explaining itself.<br/><br/>Storyline consists of the friendship of two young men, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett).  Growing up together in a small town in (I believe it was) Kansas, the boys have nothing to do but look forward to one day flying for the US Army Air Corps.  One day an event occurs that leads Rafe into his role as Danny's protector.  This continues as the boys grow up and join the AAC.  Rafe volunteers for a dangerous mission in the ""Eagle"" Squadron, a group of American pilots assisting the beleagured Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britian.  Before leaving though, Rafe meets a young Navy nurse,  Evelyn Johnson (smartly played by Kate Beckinsale). Evelyn is not only smart and classy, but exceptionally beautiful.  Rafe and Evelyn fall in love and she promises she'll wait for him to come back from Britian.  <br/><br/>Without divulging too much more of that plotline, things don't quite work out as planned and tension exists between the two friends that finally erupts on Dec. 6, 1941.  <br/><br/>The next day's events are absolutely mesmorizing.  Bruckheimer and Bay are at their best when things are exploding and guns are firing.  The entire Pearl Harbor attack and the subsequent Doolittle raid (which, ironically, is exactly what it did.....little) are the high points of the film. Unfortunately, they only entail about an hour of this three hour epic.  A lot of the setup story could have unraveled faster and perhaps shortened the running time. <br/><br/>Not too much can be said about the supporting cast, as they primarly only supported.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is underused in this one, but plays his role well and never detracts from the story.  The other Navy nurses existed only as background clutter, although Betty (James King) adds a bit to the humanity factor of the attack itself.  Jon Voight makes an outstanding, if not a bit dry, FDR.  Totally believable.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is not a bad movie, but neither is it an outstanding movie. The three hour running time is a bit indulgent, as most of the primary love story could have been shorter, the Doolittle raid left out altogether, and perhaps a bit more emphasis placed on Pearl Harbor itself.  Historical inaccuracies abound in this one: Japanese carriers didnt have superstructures on the deck!!, the attack took place at 7:55 AM, yet kids are playing organized baseball games???<br/><br/>Still, ""Pearl Harbor"" is worth a viewing.  <br/><br/>3 out of 5"

","The background plot is interesting, if not somewhat predictable. The characters are captivating. Many scenes evoke heartfelt emotions. The special effects are mesmerizing. However, the film revises history that insults America and the rest of the world.<br/><br/>A Japanese naval officer, to motivate the Pearl Harbor sneak attack, says `America has cutoff our oil ... we have only eighteen months supply.' The deceptive impression that the United States spontaneously and without justification tried to starve Japan is insulting.<br/><br/>Japan's vicious war of aggression in Asia began years before the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931. The horrific Japanese rape of Nanking occurred in 1937. In response to the 1940 Japanese invasion of Indochina, the United States embargoed oil sales to Japan. Preventing further conflict by reducing an aggressor's war supply is a noble act.<br/><br/>The `18 month oil supply' referenced in the film was the JAPANESE NAVY'S oil supply - if Japan stopped its oil-guzzling conquest of Asia, they would have years of oil. Innocent Japanese civilians would not be starved by the embargo; only their military would be forced to reduce their slaughter.<br/><br/>The film Pearl Harbor revises history to denigrate America and should be boycotted."

I can only guess that either the reviewers were paid by Disney rivals, or they have a stick up their collective asses. Whatever the reason, they are wrong.  Pearl Harbor is good old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making.  Is it literature?  No.  Is it Bergman? No.  It's just a good-to-excellent yarn told with beautiful photography, excellent acting, and incredible special effects.  The attack sequence is up there with the war sequences in Saving Private Ryan.  And I didn't find the story corny or cliched at all, in fact, I was moved by it and it made the attack sequence that much more involving since I was invested in the characters (a mistake, by the way, that Private Ryan made -- starting the war sequence before you've even had a chance to meet the characters).  My jaw was literally dropped during the entire attack sequence. As to the comments that the story was cliched and predictable, I guess that depends on how many movies you have seen.  If you have seen every movie ever made, it may seem repetitive.  To a certain extent, there are only a few stories available to tell, and after you've seen a few surprise twists, you've seen them all.  I myself did not see the ending coming, in fact I was surprised.  But what do I know, I'm not a cynical s**t who likes to put down movies just because the masses might enjoy them. I'm trying to think of something to criticize.  A few of the scenes were wobbly and perhaps forced.  But the rest just flowed.

","-Warning-A few spoilers. ""Pearl Harbor"" isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't an epic the likes of ""Titanic,"" which I didn't like either by the way. ""Harbor"" follows the lives of two childhood friends (Ben Affleck & Josh Harnett) who are enlisted as pilots in the same military divison and everything is going fine. But when Affleck goes to fight in England, he leaves behind his girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale, who gives the only good performance in the movie) who doesn't want him to go. Well when news reaches the states that Affleck died in battle Beckinsale and Harnett get together, after just a month or two of mouring over Affleck's death. But of course Affleck can't be dead, since the movie must be stretched out over the 3 hour+ running time. The 'Pearl Harbor' incident doesn't even occur until halfway through the movie and even that's not the end of the film, there's still a good hour left. This isn't a great movie, most of the performances are either over the top or aren't memorable or both and the attack on Pearl Harbor isn't even that spectacular, which isn't something I would expect from a film with a $150+ budget. ** out of 4 stars."

(I actually enjoyed Waterworld).The day filmmakers stop assuming that we are as stupid as they are will be a good day for us all. The Doolittle raid didn't end like a scene out of ""Platoon.""

Zeros, made by Mitsubishi, although extremely agile, did not move like starfighters nor did pilots follow their prey so closely and flight controls didn't look like a video game joystick. Rafe and Danny would have been dead after their first encounter as the explosion of the enemy plane would have engulfed them in flames. OK, so it's the liberty of filmmaking right?

I've just spent an hour reading all the bad reviews and comments on other boards, and it is amazing how many will not see the film but just KNOW it is horrible.  I was caught up in the story of the farm boys learning to fly and ending up at Pearl on that fateful day.  The romance is not unique, just as the thousands of romances of everyday people were not unique - just real.  The sneak attact (and you have to really hate the U.S.A. to believe it could have been stopped and wasn't) is an intense 45 minutes and by the end had me in tears. People in my age range will probably be caught up in the memories as well.

","As a frequent filmgoer, I have seen the trailers for Pearl Harbor probably 50 times in theaters, and they predisposed me to disliking the film. Then the reviews started coming out with one-star-out-of-four ratings, and my early bird friends were saying ""good one hour movie that takes 3 hours"" or ""tolerate a lousy two and a half for an excellent half hour."" So I finally went, with little enthusiasm. I was surprised that the movie seemed like about two hours, and that there were more acceptable minutes than expected; this moved it from one to two stars in my book. Still, the bad stuff is plentiful and truly awful.<br/><br/>Some good things: Consistently excellent computer special effects, more authentic warbirds used than any other movie (at least in recent memory), a true sense of the horror of the bombing was brought to the audience, Jon Voight as Roosevelt, the fact that the film makers balanced the Japanese attack with our symbolic Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, fine Japanese actor Mako, some really convincing portrayals of Americans by quite a few British actors (these must have been requested by them, since there is hardly a shortage of American actors), Dan Aykroyd in another well done serious role, Mt. Fuji in the background of the U.S. Steel Plant in Gary, Indiana<br/><br/>Some bad things: The very visible lines from lower lip to ears where the prosthetic chin was added to Jon Voight's much shorter one (fewer closeups would have helped...note to director; when using so much makeup, check the results before giving the go ahead for real filming!), Josh Hartnett (however, this guy would have been useful for any film where Tommy Lee Jones needs to have a flashback to his youth), repeated lack of faith by the filmmakers in the power of the historical truth (the correct number of Japanese planes, flying in correct formations, instead of the plague-of-locusts swarms they are shown buzzing around in, would have worked just as well), I know they were working with a modern carrier deck and whatever historic flying planes they could get their hands on, but let's use those computer effects to touch up the scenes (erase steam modern catapults, fill in obviously modern carrier deck shape, correct for engine and option differences in the Japanese planes), horrible and pointless and irritating and excessive slo-motion/soft focus effects, incredibly inappropriate and mood- breaking modern pop music at the end of the final scene.<br/><br/>Most Missed Thing: One of the most important and inspiring things to come out of the attack on Pearl Harbor was the brilliant and resourceful resurrection of the harbor and some of its ships (some were refloated) in a very short period after the attack. This incredible effort helped put the USA back in the game. It was totally ignored in this movie; not even the slightest mention was made."

When Hollywood decides to do a movie about an actual historical event, they have a responsibility to depict it accurately and with some taste.  What a waste of all those millions of dollars.

The events at Pearl Harbor are surpassed by ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" The Doolittle raid was covered more enjoyably in ""60 Seconds Over Tokyo."" This film is a pale version of all those great movies. Was this movie great as some reviewers contend? Not when compared to those and ""The Battle of Midway"", ""The Flying Leathernecks"", or even ""South Pacific"". The CGI was impressive at some times and unwatchable at others. When crew members fell off the bombed out ships, they flew in parabolic arcs. Now I don't expect animators to be physics majors, but I would like them to have seen something fall. The ""Top Gun"" gimmickry was hard to take as well. Oh, look at the bad boys. Make sure you remember what they get chewed out for, because it's the secret weapon later on.<br/><br/>Moving on to the events of the day. Yes, we were caught by surprise, though new evidence presents intriguing new questions to the debate. Yes, the bases were devastated. Yes, there were signs that any Monday morning quarterback could spot. But, as the attack happened, training took over. ""Pearl Harbor"" depicts most of those caught in the event to be wholly inept cowards. I've since gone back and reviewed some real footage of the event, and watched brave men strip machine guns from crippled planes while under fire, stepping in to take the place of those who are shot. Damage control teams fighting fires as enemy planes strafe. This movie is a disservice to all their memories. <br/><br/>""If you want historical accuracy, go to the library"" is what I believe one reviewer wrote. I have two very important questions for that reviewer, and all who believe that. Was Pearl Harbor such a boring event that lies need to be told in order to be entertaining? Did the brave men and women who chose to defend our country at a time when most turned their backs on the events in Europe and Asia need to be portrayed so poorly, and on the day that is reserved to commemorate them? Idiotic scenes of Americana saturate the beginning of the attack; a group of boys playing baseball, a woman hanging clothes on the line. IT WAS 7:00 IN THE MORNING! Does anyone who watched the movie know why Cuba Gooding Jr's character got a medal? I'll give you a hint. It was not for boxing.<br/><br/>There are many wonderful stories yet to be told about Pearl Harbor, and CGI can bring that event to us more vividly than ever before, so save your praises for this horse.

","I can't believe I'm wasting my limited, precious time on writing a review for this film  but I was just so incensed from watching it that I had to go back to my PC and deliver the goods!  Like many people, I was attracted to the trailer, and also I'm a war-monger.  And when Hollywood dumps a lot of dollars into a big war picture, I'll be Johnny-on-the-Spot.  In light of this, I took my fellow-war-monger friend with me  expecting at least a competent picture.  And, after both watching `Enemy at the Gates'  we were hungry for a better war picture, and had one since `The Thin Red Line'. However, more often than not, we were turning to each other and rolling our eyes during `Pearl Harbor'. Spoiler Alert First of all, Randall Wallace has a lot of explaining to do.  I liked `Braveheart'  which was a passable film with a competent script  but `Pearl Harbor's script is just LOUSY.  After beginning with the clichéd love triangle, complete with the over-used But-I-Thought-You-Were-Dead angle  the script offers us a lot of superficial characters with trite and laughable lines.  As I glanced at my watch (for the umpteenth) time to see how much longer I would have to suffer through this major letdown, a whole hour went by focusing on the trite love triangle  with no setup regarding the Japanese.  When the Japanese finally make their appearance, they are portrayed as robotic and stereotyped.  What's more, the writer didn't bother to personalize or dramatize the attack/plan from the Japanese perspective. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays the token politically-correct black guy who may be a cook, but get him in the boxing ring and look out  as if we really care by this point.  Echoing another viewer's comments, this character is redundant  he's just there for the minorities in the audience.<br/><br/>The story really should've ended at Pearl.  But wait, there's more!  The Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.  The only good thing about this part was that it killed off one of the leads.  I don't know how many people were laughing when Alec Baldwin was giving his pep talk to the pilots in the ready room  but it was more than one, myself included.  Baldwin cannot play a gruff, tough military man  he's just too sensitive and urbane, and his performance came off as too campy and laughable. As far as the acting goes, most of the veteran actors are good, and I'm talking about Voight and the like.  The leads are another story.  The two pilots Rafe and Danny are just good old boy southerners who are patriotic and loving the same woman  but that's ABOUT IT.  We barely get to know these characters.  FDR had more character development than these hayseeds. Kate Beckinsale (FOX!) was passable, but she suffers the same fate as every other actor in the movie:  She just doesn't have the LINES.  I don't want to sound chauvinistic, but there were SO MANY scenes with the nurses  it almost came off like a chick flick.  I wouldn't have minded it so much, but the writer didn't develop these women, nor give them any flaws, dreams, fears, ANYTHING:  It was all, `Tee-hee, tee-hee, did you see that cute pilot staring at me?'.  Jesus! I was almost CHOKING from all the close-ups in `Pearl'.  Now, where is the pony in all this s***?  His name is: SFX.  The aerial sequences and the attack on the Seventh Fleet are quite amazing  thanks to the folks at ILM. Unfortunately, we had to sit through two hours of forgettable cinema to get to them. And I thought `Enemy at the Gates' was a mediocre film!"

","Living in Hawaii all my life and having worked on base at Pearl Harbor, I've probably heard more hype about this movie than most.  I heard things like, ""It's going to be the next Titanic.""  I saw the movie on opening night, and it's far from being a Titanic or Gladiator.  The movie was somewhat slow and lacked depth.  I wondered how they would work a good love story into something like the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the answer is that it isn't a very good love story.  I didn't get the feeling that the characters were really in love, other than they told each other they were.  In lust, possibly.  The notion of a love triangle to begin with was a bad idea.  It's not something very romantic and not bound to make many girls weepy eyed. The attack on Pearl Harbor was visually impressive, but didn't draw much emotion in the way Titanic did because you didn't really care about the characters.  The movie also had less than I thought it would about Pearl Harbor, for a movie entitled, ""Pearl Harbor.""  All in all, I would say the movie was just okay.  It's worth seeing in the theaters for the special effects, but other than that, I'd say it's one to wait for the home video release.  It would've been better if it was shorter and less drawn out, the characters had more depth, and the story surrounding the two best friends as being superhero ace fighter pilots wasn't so cheesy.  At times I felt like Bruckheimer and Bay were trying to do a remake of Armageddon."

","First, the Special FX are indeed spectacular.  Tucked inside this 3-hour movie is about an hour's worth of special FX bonanza.  These scenes are quite literally jaw-dropping.  It almost makes the *other* two hours of sappy love story worth the trouble.  With a $135 million budget and a great topic (Pearl Harbor), you would've thought Disney had a guaranteed hit on its hands.  Unfortunately, all they had was a huge 135 million-dollar blunder.<br/><br/>The script is atrocious --- it's hard to believe this from the same writer as Braveheart.  Not even the trio of hot young Hollywood stars can make you overlook the horrendous dialogue and the one dimensional cardboard cutout characters.  In this movie, you'll find some of the most cringe-worthy, cliche-ridden lines you could possibly imagine.  It's hard to imagine how these actors were able to keep a straight face while reciting great lines like:<br/><br/>
""I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you.""<br/><br/>""If I had one more night to live, I'd want to spend it with you.""<br/><br/>
""We may lose this battle, but we're going to win this war.""<br/><br/>
""I want you to do me a favor: I want you to pray for both of us.""<br/><br/>
""Let's play chicken with those Japanese [expletive]!"" <br/><br/>
Needless to say, you'll get to hear more of these little gems during the movie's 3-hour run.  At one point, the paralyzed President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Voight) stands up from his wheelchair and patriotically utters, ""Don't tell me what I can't or cannot do!""<br/><br/>It's moments like these that can make audience members in the theater laugh & walk out early.  A few actually did.  I didn't --- I was having too much fun laughing with my friends.<br/><br/>Rated * out of **** stars<br/><br/>PG-13: (violence without blood, sex without nudity)"

","I had high hopes for this movie, which was probably foolish considering the people behind it. Pearl Harbor should have a historically accurate dramatization. Instead it was another ""blockbuster"" style movie from Bruckhiemer/Bay, and Company. You would think such an important event in United States history would have inspired a sophisticated rendering, but, alas, money takes precedent over art. It just wasn't the epic it wanted to be. There were good points. Jon Voight was excellent as FDR, the actual attack was superbly done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. stole my heart. We could have done without the love triangle. It seemed so shallow and unimportant against the backdrop of an event that shook America's isolation idealism to the core. Some say Pearl Harbor was aspiring to be the next Titanic. All I can say is, at the end of Titanic, I wasn't thinking about my rear end being numb. I'll have to wait for The Lord of the Rings to fulfill my epic desires."

I had forgotten that so many cliches could be found in one script.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is at his finest during scenes of great action, but he seems really uninspired and lifeless during any scene not requiring some adrenaline.  He also cuts away far too often, and many of his close-ups look too close-up.

","Well the first of many exciting summer blockbusters has arrived and it delivers on the special effects front, but not much elsewhere.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is a story about two friends (can't remember their names in the movie and don't care enough to check) who like to fly planes. One of them gets a great girlfriend but decides to go off and fight the war, after his plane gets shot down everyone assumes he's dead and his friend decides to put the moves on his girlfriend. You can probably guess where the movie goes from here. Oh, I forgot to mention that they all wind up at Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941. The story is predictable and hokey but not quite as laughably cheesy as Titanic. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale all deliver better performances that Leonardo Dicaprio or Kate Winslet, but that's really not saying much.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough about the stupid story. On to the battle scenes! The movie really delivers on this aspect with some of the biggest, most fantastic special effects I've seen to date. It's got huge explosions, wizzing bullets, crashing planes, fast paced dogfights, sinking ships, falling bombs and anything else you can think of. The Pearl Harbor attack scene is the highlight, of course, lasting about 40 minutes or so. However there are a couple other scenes that are quite impressive as well. Don't expect perfect historical accuracy though as this is something of a watered down version of the attack. One thing most veterans claim is the most memorable aspect of the attack is the oil spread all over the water igniting and burning sailors alive. There are no shots of this but there are a few inside the hospital of sailors covered in oil. This is a PG-13 Disney production though so expect the actual blood and gore to be at a minimum.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with Pearl Harbor is the length. They essentially took a love story that could've been packed into less than an hour of footage and extended it over two hours. This can get quite annoying for the first 2/3rds of the film is extremely slow and uninteresting. If they had trimmed even half an hour off it would've made the film much more enjoyable. Oh well, I'll probably buy the DVD so I can skip straight to the good parts.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a big special effects extravaganza then Pearl Harbor will surely hit home, although you might consider walking in an hour late. If you're looking for a truly excellent movie with lots of depth, I would recommend you steer clear of Pearl Harbor and find a theater playing Memento instead. I'm going to do something I haven't done before which is give Pearl Harbor a couple different ratings. My final rating for the movie as a whole is a 5 out of 10. If they had chopped 20-30 minutes off the useless crap I would've given it a 6. 30-45 minutes would've gotten it a 7. And 45 minutes to an hour would've gotten it an 8. That's my opinion, enjoy."

","As a work of complete fiction, Pearl Harbor works quite well.  The plot is fairly interesting, albeit with a fairly slow and drawn-out start to the love story. The special effects are truly stunning - they're believable and there are a lot of them.  The problem is, Pearl Harbor isn't supposed to be a work of complete fiction - it is supposed to be a history of a real event, interwoven with a fictional love story.<br/><br/>It is here that Pearl Harbor fails, in the worst possible way.  The retelling of Pearl Harbor is one-sided, one-dimensional and hence utterly false.  This robs the film of its purpose, and for me destroyed any emotional impact of either the historical or the emotional/fictional aspects it entails.<br/><br/>Probably the worst thing with this film is the intense racism it contains. From start to finish, the Japanese are portrayed as hateful, thoughtless robots with the exception of one character who's portrayed as doubt-filled - but only because he believes the attack may not benefit Japan.  Of course, the American side is depicted as heroes and heroines every one...<br/><br/>A few examples of this disparity: pretty much without exception, every single Japanese character in the film has a grimace, scowl, or look of death on his face; Americans are given all of the 'good' emotions (laughter, happiness, sadness, fear, etc. - but never hatred). Whenever an American dies, we're treated to a display of the humanity of the dying character; whenever a Japanese person dies, we see little if anything. (For example, only once do we see a Japanese pilot when his plane is shot down. He falls from the plane but the camera ignores him - he is, after all, only Japanese, not human). Americans only shoot planes and bomb buildings; people aren't ""involved"".  Japanese are depicted as shooting at people instead of the planes they're standing next to; at drowning sailors instead of the ships they're drowning alongside. The whole film is set alongside US flags, US children playing, even Santa Claus gets an appearance. The only thing missing is the apple pie... The Japanese people, by contrast, make only two tiny appearances - some kids playing with a kite in the background of one scene, and a Japanese lady walking in the grounds of a house in another.<br/><br/>I've never been tempted to walk out mid-film before.  I was strongly tempted with Pearl Harbor, but didn't because I felt I shouldn't judge the film without seeing the whole thing.  Now I've seen it, I find the result to be a very, very poor retelling of a historic event.  See it as a work of fiction, or don't see it at all!"

","Pearl Harbor may be victim of its own hype. The promotions that<br/><br/>bombarded the media as merciless as the Japanese attack,<br/><br/>showed cheesy shots of children playing with planes that I saw<br/><br/>before on the last 15 minutes of the movie Armageddon. My low<br/><br/>expectations were met accordingly. Though the jaw-dropping<br/><br/>recreation of the attack of Pearl Harbor is worth the price of the<br/><br/>ticket alone, the movie was sandwiched with a story worthy of a<br/><br/>screenwriting 101 class. It all came down to money. To make the<br/><br/>gamble they made with the budget less risky, they softened and<br/><br/>dumbed down history, so the desirable audience of the same<br/><br/>braindead teens that make MTV so popular could watch it. The<br/><br/>blurry camera that was shamelessly used in scenes to mask the<br/><br/>gore was laughably ridiculous. The acting was worthy of a TV<br/><br/>movie of the week, at least they kept a straight face saying their<br/><br/>god-awful lines. The real life characters, not surprisingly, were<br/><br/>better scripted than their fictional partners, what makes me<br/><br/>wonder what'd happen if they based the whole story more in facts.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor would've been a great movie several years ago,<br/><br/>before Saving Private Ryan raised the bar on war films. World War<br/><br/>II movies of decades past had the same cardboard stories and<br/><br/>characters, but they were fine for their time. At least Michael Bay<br/><br/>entertains us with the boomfest, and proves no other movie<br/><br/>director blows up stuff better than him. The moral question is that if<br/><br/>this real life tragedy should be made into a pop corn flick with lots<br/><br/>of explosions.

","My impression of Pearl Harbor left a lot to be desired; to me it was a 1 1/2 hour love story combined with a 1 1/2 hour blood and gore presentation designed  to numb the senses. The attack was overdone, the director seemed intent on accounting for every one of the 2400 + Americans killed on that infamous day.Admittedly  the technical re-creation aided by computer generated events and special effects were Oscar-quality. There were numerous instances where the equipment and weaponary were of a much latter vintage..but you have to work with what you have. Aerial views of the Japanese fleet looked more like what it was, our modern-day Navy. Aircraft carriers  of the 1940's did not have the elaborate superstructure or the angled flight deck as an example. As a documentary, it was superficial; as a love story, too corny.<br/><br/>In summary, the special effect were the only attribute, forget about the storyline."

Yeah, didn't see this love snaffu coming.

The date we now know that lives in infamy. Gulp.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is bombed. Lives are changed forever. Some lives are reborn...<br/><br/>But enough about the sadness. Let's talk about Ben's affect. Ben Affleck is simply gorgeous. What is it that makes him so handsome in this? What's the smitt-bug trying to tell me? Ah-ha! It's the old-time clothes. Manly form fitting 100% man cloth. Not big baggy icky jeans and tee shirts that bring even the cutest of men down to a twelve-year-old level. No loud sneakers with logos emblazoned across them. No, he was in manly knickers with a belt to boot. For those of you too young to remember a belt is an ancient device used by men of yesteryear to hold there pants up, against the fear of their underwear being -heaven forbid -exposed. Well, this look works for young chuck steak Affleck in the strongest of ways. His acting was impressive too. Not that they gave him much...But, he lost his signature smirk and stayed concentrated on his character. How'd they get the lad to do that?<br/><br/>This other lamb chop, Josh Harnett (Danny) grew on you like those fig newton things tend to... At first he was ""okay"" but as the frames flowed into the next his smile got sexier, his arms dreamier, until you were ready to nosh on the whole damn man plate. Josh has certainly come along way in his career. Let's keep an eye on him shall we...<br/><br/>Now, thank you Hollywood for casting this gal Kate Beckinsale. She's the daughter of British comic Richard, who had quite a loyal following -over there. Kate did a wonderful job and is simply lovely. She really looked the part of the 1940's American pinup beauty. LOVED her clothes too. Too bad that style wouldn't come back. Somebody call Madonna, she can make it so.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, too numerous to spotlight, are also well cast. Cuba Gooding Jr. has almost a bit part, but it's an important one. Join Voight almost made me laugh outloud at his John Barrymore a' la Dr. Gillespie, President Roosevelt scenes.<br/><br/>This is definitely an epic action blockbuster. It's trying to be with out shame. Why is the buzz comparing it to Titanic? Probably because they are both real-life tragedies that intertwine those overly dramatic heart tugging scores and collasal special effects along with a mix-a-blockbuster director that practically puts us front row center for these terrible. They are also both also had huge casualties that could have been avoided if not for the infamous ""missed message.""<br/><br/>If Hollywood could get a working script from Cameron Crowe, involving the Hindenburgh Zeppelin in a love -story between a British super agent with a secret passion for pro-wrestling and an American debutante run away from her arranged marriage to a wall street meany of course, starring Russell Crowe and Julia Roberts directed by Steven Soderbergh, they'd try that too! Okay, maybe not. But they are different films.<br/><br/>And don't worry if this is just a love story. The action is there, Jerry Bruckheimer, directs it. So, even with it's heavy subject matter, there's almost a Madtv mock movie flair to it at times...Like the extreme close-ups of Affleck and Beckinsale's nose and mouth as they speak in low tones, passionately in love. All we see are six foot flaring nostrils and pouty lips.Then you have that nonstop piping of sad- story- ""epic"" music, which goes to work on your emotional psyche from the very first frame. You'll want to weep immediately at it's commencement, but won't be sure why! Oh, and the patented BruckheimerÂ® slow motion action scenes. Those all wrenching running scenes as the tough guy banter and one liners bombard you as fast as the bazillion bullets fly around picking off extra after extra.<br/><br/>This film puts it in perspective for us. We were ambushed plain and simple. It's a war thing. We've even done it. Also it was 1941, not the high tech world we live in, a 300 plane air attack coming in undetected? Not gonna happen now buckaroo.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor, it seemed, tried to be honest. Especially in it's portrayal of the leaders and their lack of information that ultimately may have prevented the loss of so many people. They were honest about some of the not so up-and-up tactics the Empire of Japan. They skirt around the issue of life threatening oil blockades a neutral America had set upon Japan. They mention it but, briefly. We are the ""good guys"" after all. War is hate. People do things unimaginable to each other. And remember, please, no one is guilt free! That's the beauty of war, it's an equal opportunity ass*%$ maker. Before you go storming into your favorite sushi parlor proclaiming- 'you Jap' this, or 'you Jap' that, remember it was war, a long time ago, and according to not only history but the blurb in the film, we ""left them no choice but to attack.""<br/><br/>Just try and remember the folks who did fight these wars on both sides without judgment.

","This movie helps establish the new standard for action sequences, with the amazingly horrific, realistic images of the attack at Pearl.  The destruction of the USS Arizona stands out particularly.  The ripping explosion of her forward magazine is played out in a scene remnant of Saving Private Ryan.  The men all struggling to stay above the water as the ship sinks, the sailors fighting to stay alive on the USS Oklahoma as she rolls over, and the Japanese pilots doing strafing runs over the survivors in the water.  <br/><br/>Not much is made of the USS Shaw and her demise, but you truly can feel a sense of what it must have been like for those stationed at Pearl to be caught so completely off guard.  <br/><br/>The acting nod goes to Jon Voight who steals the show portraying FDR.  You really think he is FDR.  Whether you like him or not, it is hard not to get fired up when you hear his fireside chats.  The Affleck trio simply clutters the movie because the dialogue is so blah and predictable.  I hate to agree with the movie critics, but for once, they are right. Cuba Gooding does a good job with his limited role.  In a 3 hour, 5 minute movie you would expect him to have more than maybe 15 minutes.  Alec Baldwin does a good job as Colonel Doolittle as well and deserves mentioning. <br/><br/>
Lastly, I wish to say the movie is good, just not truly great like I had hoped.  For gripping war reality, Enemy At The Gates and Pearl Harbor tell different stories, but you can experience the closest images yet of what War must be like. <br/><br/>Go see Pearl Harbor, but I do not imagine it will get a lot of repeat traffic.

","Pearl Harbor was a surprise for me in terms of cinematic experience, and proved once again that it remains a mystery why film critics are allowed a venue to voice their opinions.<br/><br/>This film was a pure joy to behold from beginning to end, and is one of the more entertaining movies to come along in a while.  I was apprehensive when I learned that the bulk of the film revolves around a love triangle, but this thematic device does not detract an ounce from the overall plot.  It is simply a backstory for a series of events that leads to one of America's most terrifying experiences.  The interspersing scenes of Jon Voigt's poignant President F.D. Roosevelt and the Nipponese battle plan under Admiral Yamamoto and General Genda gave us a fictionalized, yet strong, portrayal of these leaders.<br/><br/>The 45-minute sequence of Nippon's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the greatest in film history.  Never have I been so emotionally touched by a movie sequence, and I doubt that I will ever again.  To see my country struck with such a blatant show of military aggression is disheartening and mind-blowing, but on screen, is truly captivating. A few tears came to my eye when I saw fellow Texan Doris ""Dorie"" Miller go against his appointed station and at the near expense of his life to man a machine gun on the deck of the U.S.S. West Virginia.  Miller won the Navy Cross for his actions, and he deserved it.  Some would say that Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance and Miller's scenes in this film were not needed, but I disagree...Dorie Miller's story must be told for posterity's sake, and this was the perfect venue for it.<br/><br/>Of all of the fine performances of the film, Alec Baldwin's portrayal of then Colonel James Doolittle was the immediate stand-out.  Baldwin showed a definite affinity for the pilot and commander, and his depiction of Doolittle shows this.<br/><br/>I ask readers of this review who have not yet seen Pearl Harbor to do so. It is not as over long as many reviewers have stated, and its three-hour length moves along a brisk pace.  I think it's important for Americans to see this film and realize the sacrifices that our grandparents and elders made in order to keep our nation and the world safe from tyranny.  It's just too bad that it has to be a movie to finally put that point across."

","I can't believe Roger Ebert gave this film */1/2 star. What is he thinking? His main problem was that the film does not provide historical background. For instance, he wonders why the film doesn't explain why were they Japanese in China. First of all this is a movie, not a researched paper with footnotes. Second, believe me there are people out there who know some history. I think the attack itself was very well staged and that's the part of the film that really works. On the other hand, I believe the romance could have been handled better. The magical romantic scenes of Titanic were missing here. Perhaps a more dramatic twist, such as the death of Affleck, would have made the film more powerful. I must say I enjoyed the relationship between the two freinds. That was a love story by itself. I like Kate Beckinsale as the nurse and Josh Hartnett as Danny. Affleck was ok, but a better actor, such as Jim Cavaziel or Wes Bentley, would have served the film better. Finally, Jon Voight was great as FDR. I was impressed by him the most. He has truelly develped from a star to a great character actor. He should be nominated for best supporting actor. Overall in a year that so far has brought us movies like Hannibal, this was a satisfying film. It was not Titanic, but it was good enough."

","Now I know that 'Titanic' was a pretty sweet film cinematically and technically, but the focus on two characters that appeared to be more important than anyone else on the sinking ship really took away from the drama of the true story.  If you have seen 'A Night to Remember' (British/ B&W) than you know how true events told correctly can stir great emotion in the audience.  Forcing drama and tragedy down a person's throat is insulting to the viewer and to the people that were involved in the actual events.<br/><br/>
This same virus is also apparent in 'Pearl Harbor'.  By the end of the film I felt so sorry for the survivors that had to see these true events completely slaughtered through cinema.<br/><br/>I also thought the trailer was the most misleading preview for a film in the history of cinema.  The trailer disguised a cheesy over-dramatic, historically-silly film as a wonderfully-visual epic.  I am a projectionist in a theater and saw this preview over and over again, and I honestly never got tired of it.  If there could be Academy Awards handed out for building a trailer, this would get 'best trailer'.  At the same time I feel so hostile towards whom ever built the trailer for misleading me so much.<br/><br/>I am glad that some of the controversies about Pearl Harbor were brought up; but just like all the other historical events that were covered in the film they also remained a footnote throughout the film.<br/><br/>It's just so unfortunate that a film like this gets such box office success while a film like 'The Insider' is virtually passed up by every movie fan despite its best-picture/ best director nominations.  Although it could be argued that 'The Insider' is manipulating, there is so much more emotion that is stirred because the audience feels a sense of realism as well as being able to identify with the characters and events.  The true events that are portrayed in 'The Insider' are a constant throughout- the personal entanglements with family, etc, are the footnotes.  Movies like 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor' force detachment from the audience through over-dramatization and lack of respect for true events."

","I have been wanting, for months, to go see this film on opening night.  My father raised me with an appreciation for history, and I wanted to see how Hollywood would portray this event.<br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed in the love story.  I was able to predict almost from the beginning how it was going to turn out.  The producers of this film definitely succeeded in playing on my heartstrings, although the dialogue was a little difficult to listen to at times (Ben Affleck's character being particularly grating).<br/><br/>The action (read:  blowing up) scenes were breathtaking, amazing, and nail-biting, although by the time I'd seen the 1000th dead sailor scene I was crying.  It got to the point where I felt that they were playing for sympathy and not for story.<br/><br/>I think the movie went on for far too long.  It could have been a perfectly adequate film in just over 2 hours; instead, it clocks in at 3 hours. After a while my husband and I found ourselves looking at our watches and wondering when we could get up to go to the bathroom.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I do recommend this film -- especially if you know something about Pearl Harbor day, because the movie takes considerable artistic license with history and it would be good to know what the real story is when you're on your way to see this movie.  It is a very good look at this historical event, however.  I think it got its point across, and even if it took a sappy love story to make us care about the characters and what happened to them and countless others, I think the job was done right."

","Having just returned from seeing Pearl Harbor in Dallas, my mind is still spinning from the incredible action sequences and stress that comes with opening one's self to the emotion of war. However, it took about 30 minutes before I decided I would continue watching the movie.<br/><br/>The love story in the beginning was ineffective in its awkward way of dragging the viewer through a series of short scenes, then pouring on a dramatic musical score like syrup and including romantic dialogue that is reserved for the *end* of most love stories. The audience has no real attachment or concern for these characters before it is expected to feel deeply for them.<br/><br/>But, the movie redeems itself with truly stunning action sequences. I am unaware how historically accurate they were, but in my opinion the movie portrayed the Japanese with a great deal of respect. Notice the Japanese-American military men helping to decode messages for the U.S. and working in the hospital. As for Cuba Gooding, Jr., I believe his character, though placed somewhat clumsily into the script, served to remind the audience of the often-ignored African Americans who aided the war effort.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie has some cheesy moments and is flawed in its attempt at romantic sentiment. It is also, however, gripping in its action, moving, patriotic, respectful of many groups (women, African Americans, Japanese), and worth the price of the movie ticket."

","Pearl Harbor is two good movies, that were put together. The love triangle between the two pilots and the nurse is dragged out and boring. The actual attack scene of Pearl Harbor is quite good though. It has some very nice camera work. I would say that Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Voight deliver excellent performances as a Navy chef and as President FDR.

The rest of the three hour movie is a bad, bad love story.  The dialogue is wooden, the situations aren't believable, and after a while, you just wish the Japanese would finish them ALL off.  None of the actors can act, but even if they could, the editing is so choppy you'd never be able to tell.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a great technical director, but he doesn't know how to tell a story.  Shaking the camera does not an action scene make.  With the exception of the attack (which I suspect was choreographed by the artists at ILM), the action is incomprehensible.  You never can see who's doing what to whom.  <br/><br/>So yes...stuff blowing up is cool, but the love story is so sticky it's like watching a bad episode of ""Felicity.""

","I went and saw Pearl Harbor with great anticipation and left the theater feeling disappointed. The love story was so-so but I really had my eyes set for the attack to compare it to the classic ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" No contest fellas. See the latter for a much better version of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  This version is laced with so many inaccuracies and politically correct views that we are distorting the truth behind the whole event. The Japanese are portrayed too noble in my mind. In those days, they were all for war...only Adm. Yamamoto was wary of attacking the U.S. The fighters that managed to get off the ground came from a remote dirt strip, not a major airbase as portrayed in the film. I can also dispense with the stunt flying antics as that never happened along with flying in between hangers and buildings at low level. How contrived! They also left out scenes that I felt would have made a HUGE emotional impact on the audience. Such as the band on the USS Nevada playing the Star Spangled Banner to the end and only then dipersing to take cover. Also not showing the USS Nevada getting under steam and heading for the harbor entrance in it's famous dash for the sea was criminal. That act alone was also a rallying point for the men that saw it. Adm. Kimmel is portrayed too kindly also. While it is true he was not completely at fault, he also was lured into complacency in the real attack. There are more but I will not get into these. All in all the movie is nothing more than another version of Titanic with the same results....it sinks....5 out of 10. Wait for the video."

A lot of ppl are going to pass this one off as a disappointment, but I don't see how u can. It had everything a good movie should have. A great (corny at times) love story, some really good laughs (at the beginning) and action sequences that blow the mind. I found myself caught up in every moment of it. It seemed to capture the emotion of the attack very well. The acting was excellent, in my opinion, and it really added to the goodness of the film. Josh Hartnet proved to be great in his first big blockbuster role, and Ben Affleck gave his best performance to date. Newcomer, Kate Beckinsale was very good as well. My fave minor performance was done by the one and only Alec Baldwin, who did a great job as Dr. Dolittle.<br/><br/>The only flaws I found in this movie were that some of the dialogue was extremely corny and unoriginal at times. I also found the scene when one of the battleships was sinking to be too much like scenes in Titanic. However, it didn't ruin it for me because in balance, the good outweighed the bad.<br/><br/>A little piece of advice when seeing this movie, try not to compare it to other war movies, because then u won't enjoy it as much.

Tons and tons of overlit, slow-motion shots of beautiful people either (a) staring glassily at each other or (b) walking in large groups on a runway or down a hall. That's all they do -- look pretty in slow motion. No characters have the slightest traces of individuality, humor or even personality. There are no memorable lines spoken by any characters at any time, unless you count FDR's ""day which will live in infamy"" speech, which of course was written by somebody besides this screenwriter. This movie is blander than bland, and though it is very pretty to look at, it will not satisfy people who want an action movie (there's not enough action) or a love story (the romances are so superficial as to be laughable).

","Afetr making 3 great movies like The Rock, Armageddon, and Gone in 60 Seconds, you would think that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay could do no wrong with this concept. After all, everyone knows the story of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, so the groundwork was already there for the movie. All that needed to be done was throw in some great special effects, a halfway decent script, and it would be a great movie right out of the gates....right? Alas, Hollywood has proved me wrong with this loser of a movie. First of all, the movie was WAYYYY too long. At just over three hours long, I was wishing for the movie to end so I could beat the traffic out of the parking lot. The first hour or so of the movie nearly put me to sleep with all the talk and no action. Don't get me wrong, I like setting the stage, but in a movie about the Pearl Harbor invasion, less talk and more bombs and action is expected. Also, the way the movie was hyped up, its supposed to be an action movie with a love story in the background. But after watching it, its definitely a love story first, with some pesky little japanese invasion storyline thrown in as if it were an afterthought. Even the love story itself is very muddled. It involves a loved one being killed, forgotten, betrayed, brought back from the dead, betrayed again, seeking revenge, finding a resolution, another death, more betrayal, and a happy ending?!?! I think I lost track there. Oh, I forgot the action. The action itself was impressive, but nothing we haven't seen before with the likes of Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan. But the action was very sporadic throughout the film (keeping in mind that there was absolutely no action through the first hour and a half of the movie, which leaves about an hour and a half for hardcore action which they decided to divide up in chunks anyways...trust me, its as bad as it sounds!). The lulls in between in the action sequences truly ruin the only possible bright spots in this film. And let's not even get into the actors. Ben Affleck was out of the movie for a good chunk of it, Cuba Gooding Jr. had a completely USELESS role and was in the movie for maybe about 10 minutes combined!!!!!! Jon Voight(you know, Angelina Jolie's dad) actually gives a good performance as president FDR....for about the 15 minutes he's in the film. Dan Ankroyd had a role about as useless as Cuba's. That leaves the brunt of the film being carried by some girl and some guy I've never heard of. I could go on and on about this loser of a movie, but my connection would time out.

","As far as movies go this one has got something for everyone.  It's got action, romance, beautiful scenery, and a bit of patriotism thrown in for good measure.  If the critics and viewers who are commenting on this movie were around sixty or seventy years ago, no movie would have been worthy to see or have won an Oscar.  On the other hand if you happen to love those old black and whites that were packed full of sappy romance and corny dialogue, then you'll love this movie as much as I did.  Is it the best picture ever made? No.  But it is a great movie just the same.                               I've heard a lot of people say that the first hour and a half is a waste and should have just been cut.  Sure, it should have.  Just jump right to the action scenes without knowing the characters who were involved.  If this was strictly a movie about an important part of history, there would be no need to know the players, but this is a movie about how that one event, that most of us know only from our history books, actually effected those people who were involved.  Maybe those who are saying that they didn't care about what happened to the characters are the same ones who feel that the first half of the movie should have ended up on the cutting room floor.  Maybe if they had paid more attention that first hour and actually gotten to know the characters instead of simply waiting for the bombing scenes, they may have cared more about what happened to those characters. Is this movie a little corny?  Perhaps to those who feel that the generation who actually lived through Pearl Harbor are old and corny.  Many may think that these people are old fashioned and out of the loop, and perhaps that's why many think this movie is sappy, but you can't have a WWII movie without a little sappy romance thrown in.  You can't have a lot of steamy, erotic love scenes among unmarried people.  This was their life, and maybe they don't find it as corny and sappy as many do. I think the movie portrayed the Japanese in a very human way.  They were not made out to be monsters or murderers, but people just like the Americans, who entered into a war.      The hospital and bombing scenes were excellently done.  I believe they helped convey the confusion and sadness that those who lived through the attack felt.  If you have a heart you can't help but be moved by what these people went through. The movie might have portrayed the Tokyo bombing raid as righteous, but at the time it is was a victory for Americans.  It proved that they couldn't so easily be beaten, that they would fight back.  It was a boost to the American spirit. All in all I believe that Pearl Harbor is a great movie.  Don't avoid seeing this movie because of what the critics have to say, and don't see this movie because of all the hype surrounding it.  Go and see this movie because it is good entertainment, and it might just make you give a little bit more respect to your parents and grandparents after seeing a little bit of what they lived through."

","Pearl Harbor is a film that tries too hard to make too much money by giving us harrowing battles, Hollywood hunks, and a Hollywood romance. It's real focus should be to honor those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br/><br/>
Michael Bay's trademark, flashy direction is quite evident here. In many of his shots and sequences it is quite apparent that his borrowing from Titanic and Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace's screenplay is overly clichéd and includes many one-dimensional characters. Many of the lines of dialogue are quite annoying and melodramatic. <br/><br/>The performances are merely mediocre. Ben Affleck needed more expression and emotion both in his speech and facial expressions. Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett give average performances, but when they try to be emotional it's painfully clear that their emotions are forced and fake. Cuba Gooding Jr. overplays his character but his screen time is minimum so he's not as annoying as he would be. Jon Voight is very convincing as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and gives the best performance of the film.<br/><br/>The pacing is both poor and excellent. The beginning of the film is rather slow. There's simply too much there and it bogs the film down. On the other hand, the editing for the battle scenes is appropriately face-paced and riveting.<br/><br/>The CGI work and pyrotechnics of Pearl Harbor are first-rate. The sound effects and sound effects editing are also terrific.<br/><br/>John Schwartzman's cinematography is reasonably good. His use of the `shaky cam' technique is reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's melodramatic musical score suits the vast scale of the film nicely.<br/><br/>With a little bit more care placed in the editing, better actors, and a tighter script; Pearl Harbor could have been the gem it was made out to be through its extensive advertising."

","Pearl Harbor is three hours long, and three hours stupid.  I found it impossible not be offended by the movie, in part by its morals, and in part by its pathetic plot.<br/><br/>It is filled with wooden dialogue (the best being 'World War Two has just started!' - which might make a French, German, Italian, English, Polish, etc veteran wonder what he had been fighting in since 1939), and horrible moments of contrived comic relief.  Such as a guy who has a stutter, which is obviously supposed to be something we can all laugh at.  Like people with mental and physical disabilities perhaps.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor isn't just bad in terms of dialogue, acting, and romantic plot - it has a sour message.  The attack was good because it let the U.S. join the war; the war was good because it allowed the U.S. to become strong and victorious and dominate the world. Japan's attack Pearl Harbor was sneaky and 'dastardly' - the U.S. attack on Tokyo was honorable. <br/><br/>The final voice over at the end was insensitive film making.  A better ending would have been simply: 'Four years after the attack on Pearl Harbor which killed over 3,000 Americans, the U.S. dropped two atomic weapons upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing over 100,000 Japanese...'

","The first thing I have to say is this movie isn't as bleak as all the `respected' critics make it sound. From the reviews I've read, they make it sound like Pearl Harbor is the worst movie this side of `Dude, Where's My Car?' It's not going to win `Best Picture,' but it's entertaining nonetheless.<br/><br/>There are several things that prevent this movie from being great. It's filled with cheesy lines (`I think World War II just started!') and pseudo-inspirational quotes (`I'm not anxious to day, sir, just anxious to matter.'). The worst thing about this film is probably the transition between the Ben-Kate-Josh love triangle and the Japanese and Military Officials. It often felt like I was watching two different and unrelated movies.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is probably the superior special effects once the attack starts. The first half of the film is slow at times and I wondered when the bombing was going to start, but at the same time that sort of helped illustrate how unexpected the attack was and how unprepared the Navy was. Once it starts, you get a real sense what it was like and how devastating the attack on Pearl Harbor was.<br/><br/>As for the cast, there's not shortage of attractive young people. Most of the secondary characters are an interesting and funny supporting cast. I have seen Ben Affleck act better, and his character Rafe is rather cardboard, but Josh Hartnett plays the younger and less confident Danny very well and gives him a little depth. Kate Beckinsale manages to rise above her limited material, and shows promise for future roles. <br/><br/>*Warning: Female Gushing Ahead!* I find it funny that when you look at the voter breakdown, Females rated this film an average of two stars higher than males. You may ask why, and the reason is Josh Hartnett. This guy is a good actor, not to mention gorgeous and super sexy, and I came out of the theater thinking, `I must see every Josh Hartnett movie EVER.' (Which is like 3). Ladies, you will not be disappointed if you see this movie. *End Female Gushing!*<br/><br/>It will probably have to settle for a couple MTV Movie Awards nominations, but it will entertain you. I've seen my share of bad movies, and this isn't a bad movie. Like most movie, you can't read too much into it. Just sit back, don't scoff too much at the cheesy lines and enjoy the eye candy. I give it 7 out of 10"

","Then again, I'm not sure that the good ole daily soaps can meet the level of cliched love story that Pearl Harbor throws at you. While looking through some of the reviews here I was astounded to see this movie being praised. What movies are we supposed to be comparing this too? Because I can't think of any 'blockbusters' in the last few years that would make this thing look good. Granted, the 20 minute bombing scene was really cool. But it wasn't nearly cool enough to be worth sitting through the other dribble.<br/><br/>I see some 10 out of 10's here. Are you crazy!?! Are you seriously saying that this was the best of the best? If you had a choice of any movie to see this would be it? This movie doesn't lick the hardened blood on the bottom of Saving Private Ryan's feet. If I had it to do over again, there is no way I would pay money to see this movie.<br/><br/>Out of the $140mil spent on this, you would think they would have spent maybe a couple of million on a decent intriguing story. Not so. Pearl Harbor is not even close to a great movie. If it weren't for the few special effects, I wouldn't even call it bearable. Spend your money on Shrek, Memento, even Knight's Tale - ANYTHING but this."

"Kirasjeri","1","0","0","25 May 2001"," PC DISNEY REVISIONIST HISTORY - U.S. STARTED THE WAR!
","""Pearl Harbor"", the most anticipated, of the Summer's films, has finally arrived. For what this film could have been it is, in fact, a Big Bomb; for what it is it can be considered a mediocre let down. The film has a running time about three hours, half of which is devoted to a schmaltzy love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago. That includes the ""lost lover back from the dead"" routine, which was old even when it was done well, as in the classic ""Waterloo Bridge"" from 1941. We also received a noxious dose of an equally labored love triangle involving two lifetime friends. Beyond that, we get History so whitewashed it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two.<br/><br/>Some Disney apologists have claimed that there had to be a story wrapped around the history, ""or else we'd be left with just a documentary"". Not so. Out on DVD is 1970's excellent ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", a Japanese-American production on the attack, and it was factual and compelling without the need for a none too convincing romance. For those who do want romance, done well in the context of the attack and America's entrance into World War Two, I suggest they rent ""From Here to Eternity"" from 1954.<br/><br/>Disney is telling us the actual attack sequence on the U.S. Naval base at Pearl Harbor lasted over 40 minutes in this movie. By my watch it was 30, tops, only about half of which involved attacks on American warships. The rest was much less spectacular aerial heroics by the two heroes.<br/><br/>Be it noted that in 1970, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" did not have the benefit of digital special effects. In 2001, ""Pearl Harbor"" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD to be able to savor each frame of the attack. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism and verisimilitude is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. ""Pearl Harbor"" bears no resemblance to the real horrors of the opening sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, whitewashing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.<br/><br/>We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did ""Pearl Harbor"" ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.<br/><br/>To Disney, there was no need to ""offend"" the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from ""Pearl Harbor"".<br/><br/>Historical events themselves are depicted in various ways ranging from complete distortion, to convenient omission, to fabrication, to absolute accuracy. Some of the more irritating examples follow.<br/><br/>Jon Voight, doing a not very convincing interpretation of President Roosevelt, supposedly stood up on his own at a staff meeting to dramatize the need to strike back at Japan. Not so.<br/><br/>Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named ""The Ruptured Duck"" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", which should be rented and seen by all. Baldwin. I thought that putz was ""leaving the country if Bush gets elected"". Figures Kim Bassinger dumped him. As the B-25's bombed Japan Americans in the Phillipines - and Filipinos - were being subjected to Japanese atrocities and murders. Ignored by Disney, of course.<br/><br/>The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: ""So help us God"". Perhaps God is not PC.<br/><br/>The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.<br/><br/>Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.<br/><br/>American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.<br/><br/>The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.<br/><br/>Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.<br/><br/>Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.<br/><br/>The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.<br/><br/>Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.<br/><br/>So we have a banal romance mixed together with whitewashed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make ""Pearl Harbor"" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts.<br/><br/>Hopefully though, the film will introduce WW II to the hoi poloi and to those ignorant unwashed masses so ignorant of History thanks to public education failures."

","Many would agree that Pearl Harbor was Hollywood's attempt to cash in on yet another tragedy.  As soon as Titanic grossed 1.8 billion dollars, somebody must have said ""Hey, we can make some money if we just do this again, but with a different tragedy"".  This time they chose the destruction of the naval base on Pearl Harbor.  <br/><br/>However, they failed to see the reasons why Titanic was such a good movie. It was successful because it developed its characters.  A friendship slowly blossomed and then eventually turned into a love.  Then, the huge disaster struck, but the audience was still highly curious what would happen to the two main characters.  We wanted to know what there fate was to be.  We cared for the story.  Of course, the sinking of the Titanic was asthetically pleasing, but it honestly only acted as a wonderful bonus in addition to the beautiful story that James Cameron put together.  And in the end, we are left with sadness both because of the result of the love story and the horrible fact that many people lost their lives.  Yet, Pearl Harbor fails to do this.  The first hour is filled with nothing but a emotionless love story that is poorly developed.  Then, within a week Ben Affleck's character falls madly in love with Kate Beckinsale because, and get this, ""she is so beautiful"".  Then, he goes away to war and supposedly dies.  His best friend, Josh Hartnett falls for Kate Beckinsale after about a week and loves her also because ""she is sooo beautiful"".  Of course, Affleck returns and is upset because the love that he developed for Kate Beckinsale within a week is challenged by Hartnett's 2 week relationship with Beckinsale.  I just didn't buy it and it was very boring to watch.  <br/><br/>Then, came the strong point of the film; the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. It was done brilliantly, and it made me realize what a tragedy this truly was.  I was amazed, and it is truly the only reason that you should see this film.  Unfortunately, the mood was ruined as the characters began to take on this ugly patriotic image in which they hated the Japanese and wanted to kill them right away by sending an air raid to seek revenge.  Even worse, the film got supported an image that the Japanese were terrible and began to play uplifting music that would get us behind America's effort to go kill innocent people who were not involved in the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  If I would have directed this movie, I would have shown it from both points of view.  The Americans and the Japanese.  The film made an attempt to do this, but really only depicted a sterotype on the Japanese that we have been trying for 50 years to get rid of.  Now, America's youth who sees this movie will think that this is the way that everything happened and that we should be hateful towards the Japanese from this day forth.  Wrong Wrong Wrong. <br/><br/>In any event, after depicting the tragedy in the middle of the movie and actually drawing true emotions from people, the film returns to its sappy, boring friendship story and even worse love story.  In Titanic, we actually wanted to see what happened to the characters after the Tragedy, but in Pearl Harbor I was relieved that the disaster moment of the film gave me a break from these boring, underdevloped characters that I did not care about.<br/><br/>In conclusion, movies need to stay away from sacred historical events, until they are ready to deal with them properly.  The best way to do it is to create a story around the event that took place, such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.  This way you can establish charcters that the audience will truly adore and relate to and then show how an event affected their lives.  Pearl Harbor simply belittles an American Tragedy by a stupid story which was simply constructed as an excuse to make the film."

","It had a massive budget, compelling subject matter, the magic of ILM and an all star cast.  With all this, director Michael Bay delivers a movie that is 20% effects-driven war drama and 80% daytime soap opera.  The curse of Titanic has yet again cast its shadow over Hollywood.  Must movies have a contrived love story (in this case, an unnecessary triangle) in order to justify the special effects budget?  Other movies have managed to do without (Saving Private Ryan, for one).  Bay could have easily cut 90min out of this movie and made it significantly better in the process.  I fear Hollywood will continue to fill it's big budget movies with crap for years to come. If only all those 16 year old girls hadn't fallen in love with Leo, maybe we all could have been spared.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like a visual extravaganza as much as the next guy.  I just don't want to sit through 90min of ""General Hospital"" in order to see what Hollywood can bring to life on screen.  It's not worth it.  Rent it and fast forward to the good stuff."

","What a waste of a great label. If only 'Pearl Harbor' had been made by a more skillful producer/director.<br/><br/>Here's how the Bruckheimer way works:<br/><br/>1) First, make sure that you have some sort of love story going on, in order to attract a female audience, too.<br/><br/>2) Hire the best demolition/pyrotechnic team in Hollywood.<br/><br/>3) Make full use of all the clichés found in movie history.<br/><br/>4) Among all the action-scenes, create some sort of script.<br/><br/>6) Make sure that all americans are portrayed as heroes.<br/><br/>7) Label the movie ""a rollercoaster ride"", ""this years blockbuster"", or something like that (and create a trailer that matches it).<br/><br/>8) Spend enormous sums to market the movie, so people will stand in line almost when it opens (because after a couple of weeks everyone will know that it didn't live up to the hype). <br/><br/>Yet again Bruckheimer teams up with Michael Bay, to present another one of these style-over-substance movies, probably hoping that this - his version of a Titanic/Saving Private Ryan - will bring an Oscar. Well, get this: You are not gonna get one Mr. Your movie(s) will most certainly make the day for the popcorn-eating teenage audience who likes to watch things getting blown up by clichéish heroes, so they can shout ""yes!"" and give each other high-fives.

","Pearl Harbor is spectacular. It is a movie divided into three parts. A beginning, a middle, and an end. All good movies have this. There is the love story, then the bombing, and finally the rebound.<br/><br/>The love story although a little exaggerated, serves a purpose. It is to hit those moms in the audience. The first part of the movie is undoubtedly a chick flick and help brings in that larger audience.<br/><br/>The second part of the movie is the bombing. Jerry bruckheimer dazzles us with his realistic special effects that have unbelieveable detail.<br/><br/>The third part of this movie is the rebound. We go over and bomb Tokyo. The third part serves a purpose because it makes it so we are left satisfied. If the movie ended after part 2, the audience would feel unsatisfied.<br/><br/>For those (BASICALLY EVERY CRITIC IN THE U.S.A) who walked in expecting to learn something about the history of Pearl Harbor or more depth into peoples points of view, GO TO THE LIBRARY AND LEARN THIS. Spielberg usually puts this into his movies. Not Jerry Bruckheimer though. Jerry wants to make HOLLYWOOD Movies. THIS IS A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. Expect nothing more. I personally love what Bruckheimer does and thats why i went to see this. I knew it would be like ""Armageddon"" and all his others. It's unbeliveable effects and action mixed in with a love story. Thats what Bruckheimer's interpretation of hollywood is and thats what he does best and I respect that. He did a hell of a job with it.<br/><br/>That being said, the acting was also terrific. Affleck confirmed his leading man status and Hartnett recovers well from ""The Faculty"" I thought they were terrific. Not at all cardboard acting. John Voight was also terrific as Roosevelt and does deserve an oscar nomination. His role was small but he played it with ease. I also liked Alec Baldwin and Doolitle and Cuba Gooding Junior played the role of Cookie from ""Men Of Honor"" I was waiting for Deniro to walk on and say Cookie get down and give me 20!! I liked his role though. It brough the black white issue into the mix. He shot down a plane even though he didn't have the right to touch a gun. The weakest of any was the unfortunate Beckinsdale. She just did not jump out as a leading woman and Affleck was much too much for her. They should have casted someone that had a unique look and was more noticeable. I personally find her rather boring looking.<br/><br/>If you want to see a Hollywood movie and JERRY BRUCKHEIMER AT HIS ABSOLUTE BEST, then go see Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>If you want to learn the reasons the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and more incite into why it happened, then go to the library.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE"

","Pearl Harbor. Almost everyone knows what happened, and where it is. It is the date ""which will live in infamy"". Call this the movie that will live in infamy. Besides the 40 minute attack sequence Pearl Harbor fails to deliver any sort of reson d'etre. The unnecessarily drawn out love story between the main characters is filled with Hollywood clichés and predictable ""turns."" The attack scene is incredible, and may be reason enough just to see the movie, but cannot make up for the lack of vision, creativity that turn a could-be masterpiece into another reproduction of the typical Hollywood genre. Just the kind of movie that I have come to expect from Jerry Suckheimer. The movie sparked a sense of nationalistic pride in me, and I am anything but a gung-ho patriot always pushing the American cause. But, alas, Bay and Bruckheimer stumble to produce anything more meaningful than a 3 hour movie which could have been 40 minutes and had the same effect.<br/><br/>The movie was comprised of two main parts: the attack scenes (interesting, entertaining, and despite the massive slaughter, incredible to watch) and the love scenes (sappy, overly dramatized, predictable. During the action scenes I can definitely say I was on the edge of my seat. Even if I knew what was going to happen I couldn't resist began caught up the spray of bullets, the hum of the Zeros, and the courage of the sailors as their ships were engulfed in flames. The latter scenes, however, were hardly anything new and spectacular. There were much better love stories in other movies, granted there's no USS Arizona, but if it's the love story you're going to see you definitely picked the wrong movie. I can't say enough about how bad these scenes were. My words would not do them justice.<br/><br/>As a final thought, I guess I would have to say I suggest it, purely to see the 40 minute attack on Pearl Harbor, but don't expect a Oscar-sweeping performance out of this movie. It will be interesting to see if Pearl Harbor stays afloat long enough shatter records for movies. See it, but don't expect to feel like you just saw a masterpiece."

I wasn't even paying attention to this awful mess of TV commercial style romance and horrid writing. Both Bay and Bruckheimer usually come out with a good decent action flick which entertains but this is pointless. This is the first time I sat through special effects and actually didn't pay attention to half of it. I amazed myself. Maybe cause the characters didn't matter. Maybe it was the fact that I already saw a great war scene before in other movies where it is supposed to be sickening and not ""cool"". I don't know. I have seen many special effects movies in my time but this one didn't even entertain me in the effects area as it should have. The trailers didn't help.

","Pearl Harbor: Sink or Swim?<br/><br/>The latest film out from Jerry Bruckheimer, Pearl Harbor, marks Hollywood's latest entry in the Extended Play Club.  Running just over 3 hours in length (not including the credits), Pearl Harbor sets out to accomplish one simple task: to bring the totality of the events of December 7th, 1941 to heart and mind.  This, is what it sets out to do.  What they actually accomplished was something quite different.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor produced many emotions in me, not least of which was the emotional response to the destruction of the Japanese attack on the U.S. Naval base, and the finality and reality of death.  However, the one true feeling that this movie spawned was bewilderment.<br/><br/>In setting out to create a specific plot that would add some focus to the broader story of the attack and beginning of U.S. involvement in the war is a romance, featuring our films three main stars.  Yes, that's right, I said three.  Our blockbuster face, as you must by now know, is that of Ben Affleck who plays pilot Rafe McCawley.  Co-Starring as his life-long best friend Danny Walker is the not-as-well-known Josh Hartnett.  Hartnett has appeared in a few films (Town and Country, The Faculty), but this surely intended to serve as his star power engine.  And the love of these two character's young lives, Evelyn Johnson, is played by Kate Beckinsdale (Brokedown Palace, Much Ado About Nothing).  These young stars strive through most of the movie to do their best at confusing the intentions of the film and the audience in general.<br/><br/>The fact is that while there is this impending doom reminiscent of ""Titanic,"" insofar as that you KNOW that the Japanese are going to attack, the production team does its best to make you forget about that.  Their attempts, of course, fail miserably.  The thing they succeed in doing is creating a paradox of sorts.  While you know what's going to happen, there is this constant feeling that you don't really know anything at all.  The romance that develops between these three characters is so twisted and confused that by the time the attack rolls around you're so out of sorts you're wondering if maybe the American's will win the fight this time.<br/><br/>I feel pressured somehow to recommend that you see this film for yourself. I say that because I don't really trust the reviews of anybody other than myself, and can't require that any other person does the same.  But at the same time I cannot in good conscience say that it is a good film.  It is ""alright.""<br/><br/>Many historians have criticized `Pearl Harbor' for inaccuracies, and while watching it you certainly can understand why.  It is a blockbuster for Blockbuster's sake.  It is no ""Saving Private Ryan.""  It's not even a ""Titanic.""<br/><br/>This is not the best movie I've seen in a long time.  This isn't even the best movie I've seen this week.  ""Pearl Harbor"" leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>The one thing that I can say about ""Pearl Harbor"" is that it gives you everything your expecting when you get there, and it does them as well as you'd expect.  The attack sequence is what I was awaiting when I got there, and I got what I was waiting for.  It was the superfluous psycho-romance that surrounds and penetrates the attack that really drives this tirade today.<br/><br/>Great Effects.  Generally Good Acting.  Good Directing.  But was the screenwriter smoking crack?<br/><br/>Grade:	C  (60%)<br/><br/>~Fenn"
"gosox","4","0","0","25 May 2001"," A great two hour movie...
","Unfortunately, they threw in that extra hour.<br/><br/>This film had 3 one hour sub-films, two of which were excellent.<br/><br/>The first hour is a *decent* (albeit slightly cliché) love story about a girl and her soldier... and well, just see it.<br/><br/>The second hour is a historical action film so gripping it put a pit in my stomach.  Pearl Harbor strikes a closer to home to me than D-day, and the Pearl Harbor battle made me feel much the same way the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan did, with about a tenth of the gore.<br/><br/>The third hour is a complete waste of time.  The filmmakers could have left this film as a gripping experience if they had ended it when the ambush on Pearl Harbor ended.  There was enough ""promise"" at the end of the scene that it could have ended without being a complete tragedy, but they had to go on and fill a third hour with complete crap.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin is miserable as a commanding officer.  The part written for him is worse.  There is so much game-day coach-motivating-a-team soapboxing done by his character that I wish they had found some way to hit him with a torpedo or put him in ammo storage on the Arizona about an hour before.<br/><br/>The worst part about the last hour is that it comes off as almost farcical and completely takes the teeth out of the first two hours.  In the theater I was in, couples were holding hands for the first hour, everyone was dead silent and white-knucked for the second hour, but by the time the third hour was over, they were laughing at the 'heroic' speeches and checking their watches.<br/><br/>The first two hours: 8.5,  All three together, 4.<br/><br/>My advice:  Go see the film.  Leave as soon as Alec Baldwin reenters the plot.  You do that, you won't be sorry.  If you stay you might be."

","The romance plot line was decent; the reenactment of the bombing of Pearl Harbor was decent; but the two just didn't flow together.  The movie is basically a two-hour war romance movie with an hour of fighting thrown in. The producers practically used Pearl Harbor simply as an advertising ploy. The plot would have flowed a lot smoother and made a lot more sense if they didn't try to tie Pearl Harbor into it.  They should have just changed Evelyn's (the Navy nurse that the two stars are hooked on) to Pearl and dropped the word ""Harbor"" from the title of the movie."

","Despite my cold feelings toward previous Bay/Bruckheimer films, I had high hopes for Pearl Harbor. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. A cheesy, generic love story dominates the plot, with an occasional tidbit about the events leading up to the invasion. The invasion sequence, which is of course the highlight of the movie, doesn't take place until about 2 hours and several trips to the popcorn stand in. Some of the action is spectacular, but in the end, the movie as a whole just isn't that satisfying. My biggest beef, however, is Bay's treatment of the Japanese invaders. He seems to be afraid to treat them as ""the bad guys"". Undoubtedly this is so the film can be released worldwide without offending anyone. Further proof that Bay/Bruckheimer should stick to blowing up asteroids. At least then we won't expect anything authentic."

","It is hard to imagine how the writer of Braveheart could have produced another film that is also a love story set against a dramatic background, but done it with such a lack of emotional substance. Not that Pearl Harbor is bad, it's a great action movie... but that's pretty much all it is. There are some (isolated) good dramatic moments, some jaw dropping shots, and unbelievable action. Overall, it should have been a two hour action movie, not a three hour ""love story"" (if you can call it that.) If you are expecting the drama of Braveheart, or the love story of Titanic (which this film steals horribly and blatantly from, by the way), or the inspiration of Shawshank, you will be disappointed. The sound editing is incredible (expect an Oscar), and so are the special effects, most of which you can't even tell are special effects, since they look so good. Overall, if you like movies, especially action movies, go see it, and it's probably not going to be a life changing experience, but it'll be worth the 8 or 9 bucks.<br/><br/>P.S.-----very mild spoiler alert:When Alec Baldwin's character was talking about how rather than be captured he would fly his plane into a Japanese target and ""try and kill as many Japs as he could"" or something like that, the whole audience started applauding like crazy....Japanese-Americans are worried about what this film will do to their image, and first I was like ""people will protest about anything"", but after seeing the film, it is true that there is some pretty strong anti-Japanese scenes. Scenes like the one above probably weren't necessary. But I gave it a 7 out of 10 because overall its a pretty good action flick."

","Not considering the overwhelmingly manipulative sensationalism, the shamelessly biased patriotism, the over-dramatic acting, predictable plot, and thematic contradictions, I had a wonderful time watching this take on the story of the United States's early battles in the Pacific.  ***SOME SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***  My favorite parts were when Roosevelt stood up, when Cuba Gooding Jr.'s role turned out to be relevant, and how Doolittle (sp?) and everyone else said things that not only sounded powerful but made a lot of frickin sense.  I'm sorry, but everything everyone said was extremely hypocritical.  Doolittle didn't crash his plane when things looked bad like he said, Roosevelt was still being arrogant and blindly principlistic (I don't even think he even cared that much about a mainland attack that soon), and the love story wasn't a love story, they were just horny.  When the Pearly Harbor scene came up, I actually thought the movie was brilliant.  I figured, ""Oh, I get it.  Before they were leading patriotic, teeny-bopper lives.  Now they see real war and its confusing and gruesome and nihilistic and terrible.""  But then afterwards, it went back to sensationalism and an ad for the navy. Oh, and the Coke and Pepsi product placement didn't help it's respectability.  I didn't understand the message; do the right thing, join the war, its HORRENDOUS, but it's honorable.  So basically I'd say its part teeny bopper film (alla Titanic), part US Navy commercial, possibly part authentic film.<br/><br/>(Also they did a pretty good job with not making Japan look evil [sort of like with the British in the Patriot].  So even the brainwashing theme doesn't work.  The movies a fun ride, but thematically, it sucked.)"

"motta80-2","8","0","0","24 May 2001"," Battle sequence is outstanding but cliche ridden plot makes this average
","It is difficult to know whether to start with the good or the bad so I'll be kind and start with the good points.<br/><br/>I should let it be clear from the start, least my negative points seem too strong, that I enjoyed Pearl Harbor - and it is hard to know why, but I enjoyed it in the way you are supposed to enjoy a summer blockbuster, a Titanic or more typically a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. If you approach these in the right frame of mind, empty your brain, don't think too much and let yourself be entertained (while not being too cynical or anal about historical fact meets historical licence). Then even if your favourite movies are the realm of Woody Allen and Neil LaBute (like myself) you can like a film like Pearl Harbor on its own level.<br/><br/>The positives:<br/><br/>The film held some surprises in the acting stakes, not least that Dan Aykroyd can be a very good serious actor (who knew!). Josh Hartnett is also strong and should come out of this the best, it can only do him good - high profile, leading role and he holds his own well. Cuba Gooding Jr, in a role that should have been bigger in my opinion, was moving and exciting to watch but the story used him far too little. Outstanding however, and I mean (am I really about to suggest that this film could get any statuettes!!!) supporting actor Oscar worthy as FDR. Almost unrecognisable under heavy prosthesis he delivers a believable and powerful performance that brings a sense of class to the scenes he appears in and is magnetic. You will be completely swept up when he is on screen, a performance that a Bruckheimer film really doesn't deserve and an audience wouldn't expect in one.<br/><br/>The centre piece battle sequence is also superbly staged. While you may be looking at your watch during the 90 minutes it takes to get to it you won't even notice the time flying by during this sequence. Appearing like the last hour of Titanic meets the first 30 mins of Saving Private Ryan the epic scale and grandeur will sweep you up and keep you enthralled. And then you are back to the plot! Damn!<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>The obvious choice for a new live-action Pinocchio, Ben Affleck is so wooden that you'd expect to see a woodpecker land on his shoulder and have a tap. To be fair he gets all the hammy lines and cod-heroic bravura that accompany a character in this sort of cliche ridden story (think Bruce Willis in Armageddon) but he fails to rise above it and this hampers the film. Equally all the women in the film, led by Kate Beckinsale, are given thankless roles and end up as caricatures. Beckinsale is fine but not good. She walks through the role giving the annoying impression that she could do better but can't be bothered.<br/><br/>The less said about the story and script the better. The dialogue is laughable (particularly in the first hour) and raises unintentional sniggers throughout. The over sentimental love story is about as contrived as a film can get and could be likened to an MGM musical in terms of realism! Randall Wallace (writer of The Man In The Iron Mask and Braveheart) may have done justice to the real life characters (Voight and Gooding Jr) and the battles but the story makes the script of Titanic look like Casablanca.<br/><br/>Equally Michael Bay and Hans Zimmer need to be dragged out and shot for trying to manipulate the audience into accepting a love story that doesn't work. The music wells up, the hero shots come into full effect the trademark Bruckheimer/Bay slowmo running and contrived close-ups appear from nowhere. I fail to recall the last time a film used music so much to suggest the emotions you should be feeling when you are blatantly not in the same frame on mind as Mr Zimmer, the composer. The effect is grating, you'll wish you had a mute button for the first hour, or preferably a fast forward button. Bay and Wallace have managed to get every movie cliche you can imagine into this piece (most within the first ten minutes which is an appalling episode in the young lives of our two heroes as way of a backstory) and if you make a list of them before you go you'll be able to tick them off as you watch.<br/><br/>To conclude the battle scenes make this worth watching on the big screen and Voight, Gooding Jr and Hartnett will hold your attention, but the story and dialogue let it down. An average film where it could have been great, but still a good entertainment is looked upon as such."

In addition, the American propaganda is unending.  I can appreciate the obviousness of having a pro-American sentiment to this movie, but again, it's not something that sits well with a Canadian boy like myself.<br/><br/>Aside from having to follow the contrived love story, the actors do a good job of acting (except Affleck and Baldwin...ugggh).

","Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I was mentally removing the background score, cutting scenes, etc to improve the film.  As a documentary, this movie is an embarrassment.  It might help to go into the theater with a background knowledge of the strategies employed by the Japanese, because all you will find out from the film is that wooden fins were added to the torpedoes and the carriers were in radio silence while crossing the Pacific.  As a love story, it's frustratingly long, and hackneyed.  The extraneous BS (the top gun scene) really irritates the viewer.  The most intriguing character (played by C Gooding Jr) does nothing more than box, complain about being a cook, and shoot down a Japanese fighter during the attack.  Despite all of the nonsense, the movie is worth seeing for the attack sequence alone.

"gmp-3","Null","0","0","25 May 2001"," I had Tears, A powerful film if you can be transported back.
","Overall I like this film. The movie contains some scenes that brought tears to my eyes with some images of patriotism, self sacrifice, courage and bravery that, for me, were overwhelming.  To feel them, you must be able to put yourself into the mindset of the people that lived in 1941. If you can let it, Pearl Harbor will transport you back 60 years for an adventure and is the REAL REASON to see this movie. If you can't you will probably find the film a cliché riddled special effects saturated overlong melodrama. What am I talking about?  Well, leave your the post Vietnam era institutionalized cynicisms and 21st century self-centeredness in the lobby. People back then had, in my opinion, a much greater sense of duty, honor, country and personal self-sacrifice than exists today. (See what I mean? Are you already thinking I'm a preachy cornball?) Sorry X-ers we grew up in a post baby boomer world and have not HAD to live the meaning of those words the way the Greatest Generation did. ( The folks that came of age during the Great depression, and Second World War)  I mean come on, our generation's war, the Gulf, was fought and won in 100 hours and we as a nation were never in any danger. Also unlike the 1930-40s, today we have loads of government institutions and welfare  programs to care for us if we can't cut it. However don't feel bad the worst self absorbed offenders are still the baby boomers. I guess what I am getting at is when I see the some of the Pearl Harbor characters on screen that are close to my age, ( I am not talking just about the three main leads but several of the supporting characters as well ) I wonder, who do I know or have met that has what it takes to rise to THAT occasion. Few I am afraid. <br/><br/>SEMI- SPOILERS until the Cinematography review below. I was moved when I saw the recreation of the guy picking up the anti aircraft gun and fighting back when the gun crew is killed. This was real and was in part captured in newsreel footage, and shown in John Ford's `December 7th and also recreated in Tora Tora Tora (1970). In terms of self sacrifice, in one scene one of nurses confesses to her boyfriend that she is pregnant by another guy and will go with him. He takes the news like a man and accepts her decision and immediately gives her up. There is no modern ME FIRST crap via 'how could you do this to me', or 'so what, forget him and the kid, your mine' etc. It was refreshing. Kudos to the director as I really felt some of the pain and anger right along with some of the characters.  <br/><br/>THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND EFFECTS: Interestingly this movie has incredible attention to detail on one hand and a few glaring goofs on the other. One example of fine detail is in a split second shot inside a bomber where you see the historically accurate bombsite that replaced the standard Norden bomb site for the raid.  Also there is the quick broad shot the destroyed American ships where over in a corner you get a glimpse of a deep sea diver in period brass helmet attempting to search for survivors. (blink and you miss him) However there are also some glaring authenticity errors. I only mention them because in other cases the attention to detail was so incredibly fine that these goofs left me surprised the got in the movie. Primarily I am talking about a couple of shots where one minute you see WWII era carriers with their plain rectangle deck. Then in others you see modern Jet-age carriers with the protruding side runway. And in one shot you see the deck jet catapult tracks that launch modern planes. I was floored that this got by. Perhaps they got by because these were just 'establishing' shots and not part of the effects laden battle scene shots etc. were the money ( and time) was really spent. The cinematography was great. Really great. Interestingly there was much more actual model and full size effects and mock ups than you would expect. I read the June 2001 issue of American Cinematographer that covered Pearl Harbor. In it one technician laments that so many people will just assume so much of the LIVE special effects are CGI when they are not. For example real US navy ships circa WWII, in mothballs in Hawaii, were used for some of the pyrotechnics. Anyway if you can get into it, as I did, Pearl Harbor was a great, and at times moving movie experience."

","From almost beginning to end, Pearl Harbor is a love story. This may not seem appealing to movie goers who crave action, but keep in mind that it is a Jerry Bruckheimer production and a Michael Bay film, and that it's very well done. Not a lot of action is shown during the first hour, but the second two make up for that. There is a sense of historical accuracy and a few memorable lines from this event appear in the film (i.e. ""A date which will live in infamy"") The special effects are awesome, and they'll keep you on the edge of your seat. The action sequences are a mixture of Armageddon and Titanic, which is very effective. It may not be the best movie of the summer, but it's a must see. (8/10 stars)"

","This movie was pure garbage.  Not only does it play with history for mere entertainment (representing the deaths of thousands of people for their selfish cause) but it doesn't even do it well.  I feel like these screenwriters Michael Bay drags up are playing mad-libs with these scripts. ""Ok, this is where Alec Baldwin needs to say something to prove how tough he is, cause he's experienced and old."" Or, ""Now the president wouldn't say anything unimportant, and neither would Jon Voight, so how do we make him look stoic and heroic when accepting a flower from his servant?""  This movie just represents a scary trend in Hollywood: the relying on visual affects to make up for a lack of creativity of plot and characters.  I mean, the average American will miss out on quality, historically accurate movie experiences and just swallow this garbage cause it looks cool.  There's just no responsibility for someone with a big budget.  I just hope Michael Bay is proud of himself.  Wait, no I don't.  Don't see this movie unless you want to see neat-o visuals.  It's just not worth the three hours of confusing multiple climaxes loosely based around a cheesy love story with pregnancies and death and maybe even a long lost, eye-patched twin brother!  That last part doesn't happen, but I wish it did, so I could hate this movie more. Good thing it's impossible for me to hate this movie more then, huh?  Man alive!"

","Upon leaving the plush, air-conditioned stadium seating of my local megaplex, I was left with many emotions running through my brain, ranging from...disappointment to bewilderment...excitement to ennui...comfort to white-hot bladder-busting pain. I left the theatre torn, did I love this movie, or did I loathe it? Was it the greatest piece of film in the past year, or was it the worst story ever put to celluloid. In hindsight, I'd have to say that it falls somewhere between the two. It is neither great nor terrible. It's place is somewhere in the gray zone, along with most of Bruckheimer and Bay's films.<br/><br/>So, where to begin? The story itself wasn't very solid, but then again I didn't plop down my five bucks to see a story, I wanted to see what every red-blooded American did...non-stop action and carnage courtesy of Disney's generous $145 million budget. The action scenes were everything I'd hoped for and more. You're not going to see much better elsewhere. I loved everything about the attack, especially the intense, edge-of-your-seat moments leading up to the attack. The raid on Tokyo was also very well-done and very intense, but not as nerve-wracking as the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. Getting back to the story, let's see, it's your typical cliched love triangle between two best friends and the woman of their dreams...boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy goes off to war, boy shot down, presumed dead, boy's best friend breaks sad news to girl, boy's best friend and girl fall for one another, boy comes back, heartbroken. The story borrows heavily from every war movie that preceeded it, but in all fairness which war movie doesn't? The only cliche that really bugged me was the ""I'm not gonna make it, am I Sarge?"" scene in the end. That scene right there was almost enough to make me forget about the awesome attack scene.<br/><br/>This film is not without its merits. It supports some top-notch acting. The entire cast is nearly perfect, delivering believable characters. Ben Affleck has never been better (okay, maybe he has, but so what!)...Josh Hartnett really shines in this one, maybe this will be the one to finally make him (which is long overdue, don't believe me, check out ""The Virgin Suicides"")...Kate Beckinsale was superb (and extremely hot!)...Cuba Gooding Jr. was alright, he overacted a little bit too much for my taste...Jon Voight's portrayal of FDR was brilliant...Alec Baldwin really outdid himself...Ewen Bremner (Spud from ""Trainspotting) surprised the hell out of me with his authentic American accent...Tom Sizemore was great as always...Dan Akroyd was criminally underused...the list goes on and on. Kudos to whomever cast this film, they really did a great job and found some truly brilliant and unappreciated talent.<br/><br/>This film is poised to become the next big thing. It may even go so far as to break Titanic's record. This film is so big that it will either make or break every one involved. Sadly, if this film bombs, we will be forced to watch several brilliant actor's careers go down the drain and the fall of the Bruckheimer empire. If this film succeeds, we will see Hollywood continue to wallow in its own excess, watch in horror as budgets go into the hundreds of millions, as ticket prices raise higher and higher, and the continuation of the Bruckheimer empire. Either way, after this film, Hollywood as we know it, will be forever changed...for better or worse.<br/><br/>
I give this one 5 1/2 out of a possible 10."

Directing and acting as well as the CGI are solid quality, but the research behind it could have used a dash of Oliver Stone.

Unfortunately, what we ended up with was Michael Bay's warped view of how the United States involvement in the Second World War started.  What crap. I only saw this movie once in the theater.  That was once too many.  Do you get the impression that I don't like this movie?  Well I don't, and if I knew you hadn't seen it, I would suggest that anything else you might want to see would have a better change of being more enjoyable.  The story sucks (a good third of the movie revolves around a farce of a love triangle.) The special effects have a nasty cartoonish quality to them.  Mr. Bay changed a great many details that either, didn't suite him, or, were inconvenient to his plot.  As for detail, what were late 20th Century Arleigh Burke class, Aegis equipped destroyers doing tied up in 1941 Pearl Harbor?  Did he really think that anyone with any kind of knowledge about naval ships wouldn't notice something as obvious as that?  I don't know a whole lot about ships, but I do know that ships today don't look anything like those build 60+ years ago.  See Tora! Tora!

The advertising leads one to believe this movie is about the Pearl Harbor invasion and not about two pilots in love with the same girl.  The romance was what the movie focused most on.  The film is barely a war movie.  Sadly, instead of this being an epic like Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor falls into a romance category like U-571 falls into an action category. (Although I really liked U-571). The are some excellent scenes during the actual invasion and while Rafe is serving in Europe, but overall I walked out feeling disappointed.

If your making a movie about warfare, you can't just have planes swooping down and shooting at everyone and blowing up everything.  You need to have some sort of plot.  Alright, so maybe the love story was as sloppy as a used kleenex, but what else could they have done.  And maybe, just maybe, some love story like this did REALLY happen to the setting of Pearl Harbor.  You just never know?<br/><br/>A better way to tell the story of Pearl Harbor may have been to take two soldiers, one Japanese, the other American, and tell it from their sides (did you ever see GETTYSBURG?).  That would have made a much better story. <br/><br/>
As far as historical accuracy, Im big on WW2 history and most of what was said in the film was correct.  No one knew the location of the Japanese fleet at the time, Admiral Yamomotto reluctantly led the attack,some military personnel did suspectan attack on Pearl harbor etc. The only thing terribly wrong in this department was saying the Doolittle raid was the truning point of the war(err sorry that was Midway and Guadalcanl).  But in terms of showing the Doolittle raid had a psychological signifigance, I guess we can let this error go.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is worth seeing.

The Japanese were at the time already at war with China before Germany's invade on Poland.They were experienced in war and trying to create an empire including Eastern Asia and most of the Pacific.They had learned to sacrifice for their country and that surrender means dishonorment.By far the most prepared for war.Were in this movie do we see any of this? I would like to see more of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,the greatest among the American presidents.And more of the Battle of the Pacific,which was among the hardest of the war.No we emphasise on a pointless counter-attack. No mention of current events either.Just in December 1941 great changes were happening without at all being mentioned here.On December 5th the Soviets obtain Kalinin while the Germans retreat.It was a disaster for Germany.On December 6th Britain declares war against Finland(alied to the USA and Germany both),Rumania and Hungary.The declaration was an insult to USA.On December 10th Japan invades the Philipines,on December 25th they capture Hong Kong,defeating the British,During the month the Americans continue to retreat against Japan which obtains a number of American islands during the process.Any of this mentioned?

","First, let me say that this film did not live up to its name-sake.  If you title a movie about a historic battle, then you had better focus on that point, and not go off on a tangent.  Love stories and war naturally go together, however you shouldn't mix the two too deeply - otherwise you might end up with this film.  I rate the love story in this film as 7, and the war story a 5.  <br/><br/>If this movie is supposed to be about love, then the bulk of this movie should be about the couple and the war should be placed on the back burner. The dramatic interlude with the war is not needed, just its effect.  If the movie dropped the parts about the planning for the battle, and much of the battle was dropped as well, then the love story would be stronger. <br/><br/>
If this movie is supposed to be about war, then where was the planning for the battle?  I will admit, the actual battle of Pearl Harbor was spectacular, however, there was something lost in the movie.  You cannot just show the explosions without a purpose.  Although I would imagine that most people who see the movie know something about the attack, the movie still needs to give background information and the planning for the attack.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is that it is a mix of two types of movies, both trying to attract audiences.  Love and war both sell tickets, but they have to be mixed carefully, without imposing too much on the other. <br/><br/>
Something needs to be dropped from this movie, either the love story or the interest in the war.  It would be easier to drop the war, at the risk of ticket sales, but otherwise much more time needs to be spent on the story of the war.  The title would also be something to change.  If a movie is titled ""Pearl Harbor,"" then one would assume that the movie will be about the attack, which this one is not.<br/><br/>If you want a war movie about Pearl Harbor, see ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""  If you want to see a movie about the effects of war, see ""Saving Private Ryan.""  If you want to see a movie about love, don't see a war movie.

It fits many a description of the essence of cinema; the entire movie is outlined principally by sex and violence.

Of course us guys come to see ships and buildings blown up while the ladies come for the love story (which is the same aesthetic that applied to ""Titanic"") so it offers something for everyone. Who knows?, it may even top ""Titanic""'s box office record. Of course the action upstages the romance to a great extent; so when they come back to it you ask yourself, ""Now, what was happening to these lovebirds?"" but you catch up pretty quick. With Jack and Rose in ""Titanic"", we cared more about their relationship than the fate of the ship, whereas its just the opposite with Rafe, Danny and Evelyn--we are mostly interested in what happens to Pearl Harbor and how it parallels with what really happened. Faith Hill's sweet love song (which runs during the end credits) ""There You'll Be"" is no ""My Heart Will Go On"", but it does have a chance at getting nominated at next year's Oscar ceremonies.

Many people hold this against it. They say ""With one of the pivotal events of the century taking place, the makers act as if this dumb little story of 3 people matters. It doesn't; it's trivial!"" Au contraire, my callow young friends. Real Life, versus Reel Life, is made up of the small things. We experience life in macro, while we study it through history in sweeping panorama. To the people living in that time, Pearl Harbor changed their lives, sure, as it does the three main characters here. But the other things they were engaged in continued right along. --The passions, the human folly. Why do people have such a hard time with this movie, and its concessions to this particular level of reality? It is in fact no more or less ""real"" than many Hollywood films. --It is more real than most. Sure the Top Gun bit is hokey, but the love story, which is where the movie is rooted, rings true, even if a bit familiar.<br/><br/>This movie may tell the story your grandmother or father would never tell you about what they were doing when the planes came. I give it 7 stars."

","Even before this movie's release it was hard to hide from. The trailers only hint at the visual spectacle it is. Expertly directed by Michael Bay and written by Randall Wallace, this truly qualifies for epic status with its nearly three and a half hours running time. Outstanding visual effects; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is ruthless,  relentless and totally chaotic. Hans Zimmer's musical score is grand as it is haunting.<br/><br/>The story is a reenactment of one of the most tragic days in America's history, but a lot of the facts are very loosely interpreted. Albeit few can walk away from this movie with total disappointment or a dry eye. Two childhood friends(Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett)learn to fly and go off to join the war and end up falling in love with the same Navy nurse(Kate Beckinsale). The three lead characters are out acted by the brilliant performance of John Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Alec Baldwin succeeds in making Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle look smug and arrogant. In smaller roles, but notable work in support comes from Cuba Gooding Jr., James King, Mako and Tom Sizemore. Kudos to producer Jerry Bruckheimer for a project well done. Romance, drama, and dynamic war action...PEARL is interesting and enjoyable; a must see."
"preppy-3","2","4","12","24 May 2001"," Too long, too depressing
","A movie about the events leading to Pearl Harbor and the aftermath up to when America bombed Tokyo. The movie looks beautiful--some of the shots literally took my breath away. The special effects are very realistic. The film deals with an actual event but the three main characters are fictional and the action scenes are exciting if a little bit too fast and furious (I almost wish I had brought some Dramamine with me). A rousing music score is great too. All the acting is good too (especially Ben Affleck and Kate Breckinsale--Josh Hartnett is OK). Also there's strong supporting roles done by Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight (as President Roosevelt!) and Dan Aykroyd (very good in a straight dramatic role).<br/><br/>But I don't like the movie. It's way too long (3 hours--this easily could have been done in 2 1/2 or even 2 hours); the script is chock-full of every war movie cliché you can think of (right down to all the Japanese being evil and cold-blooded) and the direction--Michael Bay is very good at action--he is horrendous at romance. The love scenes between Kate Brekinsale and Ben Affleck have some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life--the actors deserve credit for keeping a straight face while mouthing those lines. Also you do not film a love scene with the camera jammed in the actors faces. We know Affleck and Brekinsale are both beautiful--we don't need constant close-ups to prove it. Also, there are reports that Michael Bay was uncomfortable directing the women in the film...it shows. Beckinsale and the other women in the cast are good, but they seem to be unsure of how to play scenes. I don't blame them--I blame the director. Also, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s part is little more than a glorified cameo. What is he doing in this? His total screen time amounts to (maybe) 15 minutes!<br/><br/>The destruction of Pearl Harbor is unbelievable. It's also very grim and looks way too realistic. It's 40 minutes of ships blowing up, men (and women) getting gunned down in cold blood or drowning to death. It's not entertaining--it's depressing. I've also heard that this movie is chockful of incredibly stupid historical inaccuracies.<br/><br/>Also, I saw it at a preview audience--people were hissing the film at the end. What does that tell you? Bad dialogue, historically inaccurate, full of clichés and a far too graphic rendering of the bombing. I can't recommend this film."

","I love this movie. I'm 14, and I saw the historical part of this movie in history class.My history teacher said it was very well made and very similar to the real thing. She said it was a fake story line but the bombing was in fact outstandingly done. This movie plot is one I've never seen before. It's so Bizarre and nuts but at the same time romantic and full of drama. I loved the romance and love triangle, even thought I think Danny should've gotten the girl. This is my opinion, but in no way, should it deserve one star. Yes it is an extremely long movie. it is my favorite movie, and you could say I'm obsessed, but what really made this film amazing was the actors Kate Beckinsale and Josh Harnett. I love Josh and Kate. Ben Affleck didn't do the best drunk impression, but he still was good in this film. Best movie I've seen! 10/10 all the way. Boys might find this a one out of ten because of the romance. But girls would love this movie!"

","It cost roughly $140 million to produce this chimera. At the rate of my current income, that would sustain me for 12,727,272 years. No kidding.<br/><br/>Well, so it had a monstrous budget and professionally competent actors, but it's not worth much mention. I suppose it accomplished its goal, which was to use computer-generated effects and make money.<br/><br/>Its chief utility may be to introduce kids to some elementary facts about World War II. It wasn't designed to do it, but kids may need all the help they can get. A recent poll showed an alarming percentage of high school students didn't know who fought whom. A goodly number thought we and the Germans fought the Russians. Does that constitute a red flag or what? Basically this is a movie about a nurse who loves two men, only one of which manages to survive the Doolittle raid on Japan. If you're interested in love affairs and that sort of thing, this is your kind of movie. The CGIs are nice and exciting. That ought to hold the interest if nothing else does. Ka-BOOM.<br/><br/>For the record, Admiral Yamamoto never said, ""I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."" That was invented for the film ""Tora, Tora, Tora"". For that matter, the bombing of Tokyo, tacked on at the end with reckless calculation, since it had nothing to do with the basic story, was not done in formation as the movie shows it. The B-25s took off early and headed straight for their targets one by one, not having enough fuel to form up. They launched early because they were sighted by some Japanese fishing vessels and it was justifiably assumed that the fishing vessels had radioed the contact to authorities. The fishing vessels were fired upon and sunk by our cruisers. They were filled with men, women, and children, according to Rod Steiger, who was among the crew of one of the destroyers in the flotilla.<br/><br/>There IS no really good movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor. A far better film of the period is ""From Here to Eternity"" or, better yet, ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo."" I realize it's hard to believe but ""Pearl Harbor"" is cornier, less accurate, and more dumbed down than ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" which is a 1944 movie made for adults not kids suffering from attention-deficit disorder."

","OK, as a histery major at a MAJOR American university, I'll tell you right off the bat this film had some serious problems with its histery - where was the Titantic? Doesn't Bay know it was sunk at Pearl Harbor along with the Battleship Lusitania? And what was with that Dr. Doolittle raid? Dr. Doolittle was a Canadian zookeeper, not a bomber pilot. And it wasn't an air raid that devastated Vietnam after Pearl Harbor, it was Texas-sized planet killer asteroids dropped from stealth planes. Didn't Bay see ""Final Countdown""? And when did Ben Affleck become, like, a fighter pilot? They could at least have given him a jet plane, or used Tom Cruise, who is a real jet pilot. Other than these ridiculous hitorical innaccurasies, it was a great summer blockbuster film! The sizzling chemistry between the two pilots was amazing and heartwarming. Cuba Gooding was fantastic as the black sailor, OMG OMG OMG I didn't even know they had black people back then (and I'm not alone on that one ask any white person)! I watched this with my grandmother and she agreed there weren't any black peeple at the time too, so this film is HIGHLY progressive too.<br/><br/>Basically it was about like, these totally cool people, like Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett and all these geeks, who were like, foreign or something and totally evil dorks who can't even speak English. Then the cool people like totally kick the their geek Vietnamese butts. We'll be renting this film for decades to come.Sure it wasn't highbrow, but that isn't what films are for.

This movie overall others has one of the best soundtracks ever. Ben Afflack has a great part and so does Alleck Baldmin. This movie really shows all aspects of the war, from Europe to Asia to right here in the U.S. i personally wish that more movies like this were made about different subjects, like maybe a Bismarck and a Lusitania movie would also be great.

","As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing wrong with a portrayal of a usual romance where two people who fall in love near the beginning of the movie are destined to end up together by the end. Anyone arguing with this is either irritated by the film not just focusing on the war of that day, hates Ben or Kate or Josh, or hates the love triangle as opposed to what it should have only been and that is a two way romance between Ben and Kate. It got ridiculous once the writers brought the idea of a baby and a best friend rivalry thing into the mix.<br/><br/>I haven't taken into account one thing said by bad reviews. I saw the movie at the cinema with friends and now own it because I loved it and still do. The war scenes are effective and emotional as they should be. There's no argument that Michael Bay should have focused only on the events of that day because he shouldn't - the lives of the main characters should have been and were covered as well. War romances were typical of those days so I don't see the whole big fuss about it. Ben and Kate do have chemistry in my view, although I'm not sure about Josh and Kate. Ben and Josh are great as Rafe and Danny, two lifelong best friends who are involved in the events of that tragic day and ultimately become heroes in the film. A special mention should go to the soundtrack of the film because that was spectacular and composed by Hans Zimmer who also did the music for Batman Begins. The music for the love story is particularly well-crafted.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it full marks because I loved the movie, the soundtrack and the actors. Ben Affleck was the star of the movie, no matter what anyone else says about his acting."

","""Pearl Harbor"" is an excellent epic in cinematic representation of the events surrounding the Pearl Harbor bombing and the Doolittle Raid. Though not entirely historically accurate, the story telling is great. It has an intricate plot in the 1940's setting and was a great way to combine a historical event with a dramatic story. ""Pearl Harbor"" has great special effects, wonderful music, and great performances from many good actors. The story has action, drama, and romance. I personally thought the movie was absolutely incredible and is unsurpassed. Anyone who loves a ""Titanic"" historic/drama style story would enjoy seeing this movie. If your into aviation, the story is about two pilots during the advent of the American involvement in World War II. If you love action, there is a lot of it here and special effects buffs would enjoy this movie as well. The story is a cross between the historic accuracy of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and the romance drama of ""Titanic."" In conclusion, ""Pearl Harbor"" is a great movie and would be enjoyable to wide range of audiences. I recommend that you give ""Pearl Harbor"" a fighting chance and see it, you won't be disappointed."

If the movie was 100% accurate, IT WOULD BE BORING! <br/><br/>Pearl Harbor gives a great message to the viewer and is all around fenominal!

","To some of the critics who absolutely trashed this movie, saying it was so fake and cheesy,  I don't understand how they can praise Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  It had people flying all over the place!!!!<br/><br/>It is sad to note that many of the critics are simply clueless about WWII-And those who slammed this movie's love story - it makes me wonder if they are this meanspirited and critical in their own love life (or lack of). Many of the critics never once mentioned feeling any compassion or empathy for the victims of the attack.<br/><br/>See this movie. It is a Hollywood movie, not a DOCUMENTARY!!!  Transform yourself back to a time when love of country, familiy and honor were an integral part of the moral character of America. A time when we did practically worship our Presidents (this was before Vietnman,Watergate,Clinton/Monica), a time when courtship was very innocent between men and women (ask your grandparents!).  A time before rap music, the Internet, tabloid journalism, and political correctness.<br/><br/>The setting for this movie was spectacular - the scene of Ben Affleck standing by the train with a fog rolling around as Kate walks up to him, was beautifully portrayed. The hospital scenes and the music scores were haunting.<br/><br/>For those who are clueless about WWII, let me help you separate Hollywood from History:<br/><br/><ul><li>Do an Internet search (or try Amazon) on the 'the rape of Nanking' the Chinese city that the Japanese military invaded where they slaughtered 300,000 civilians, old people and children and raping and killing about 20,000 women.  The year was 1937, before Pearl Harbor. (Warning-you may see very GRAPHIC, UNEDITED PICTURES of the atrocities).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Do a search on the 'Bataan Death March' and  read about how the brutal and sadistic Japanese military AT THAT TIME treated their prisoners of war.</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>When Hitler's second man in command was captured afer WWII,  Hermann Goering, he was absolutely stunned - ""How can a country full of cooks, clerks and farmers defeat the most powerful army in the world?""  yes, friends, WWII was fought mostly by TEENAGERS, not men.  If you want to read about some real heroes, not Hollywood heroes, look no further than our own military history because it is full of them.  Read about the Doolittle raid, yes that is true!!! And Cuba Gooding's character, in real life, was later killed in the war when the Japanese blew up his ship in the Pacific.</li></ul><br/><br/>Japan's leaders must have thought the same thing as the Germans.  Before the island of Tarawa was attacked by the Americans, the Japanese general had boasted that ""a million men cannot take Tarawa in a thousand years."" The Marines took it in three days.<br/><br/>See this movie in honor of a father, grandfather, uncle, etc. who has or is serving in the military.  Celebrate the heroism of the incredible generation who defended and died for our country.<br/><br/>On the island of Iwo Jima was an American cemetary with 6,800 graves, mostly teenaged American boys, mounds with crosses and stars.  Thousands of families would have no body to bid farewell.  A message chiseled outside the cemetary reads: When you go home Tell them for us and say For your tomorrow We gave our today"

","Pearl harbor is a romantic epic world war 2 drama directed by acclaimed director Michael bay and stars ben Affleck, josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba gooding jr,
Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Michael Shannon, Jennifer garner and many more, the film starts with two friends Rafe MCawley and Danny walker pretending to be soldiers fighting the german empire in world war 1 and then Danny's father gets drunk and attacks the two resulting with Rafe calling him a dirty german, then the father reveals he fought against Germany himself in the first world war and tells the boys to not risk encountering the horror experience he had. years later Rafe and Danny are now lieutenants under command of military officer major jimmy Doolittle played by Alec Baldwin who informs Rafe that he has been accepted into the eagle squadron. later then the poorly written, clumsy, dumb and unnecessary love story starts out when Rafe meets the nurse Evelyn played by Kate Beckinsale they go on a date together at a nightclub and as you see their dialogue is mediocre and they have almost no chemistry many have not liked the love story and that the films screenplay is heavily flawed and misses the point in this movie even though this is a good movie or just an average film the love story is not what makes the movie so good. later Rafe who gets on a mission to intercept the Luttwaffle raid is shot down and is presumed dead in action by the english channel. then Evelyn meets Danny and this starts the silly love triangle when they get in a romance together they dont have good chemistry either. then Rafe comes and Evelyn is surprised Rafe is standing outside her door thinking Rafe had died but the rumors were wrong. Rafe then realizes their relationship and goes to a bar where he gets drunk and Rafe and Danny then get into a fight. then the next day japan starts the attack on pearl harbor and some would say that is the only thing to see in the movie but it is not this movie has alot more action and there are scenes where the pilots fight the Japanese and sometimes crash into each other. then Rafe and danny reunite and then start working together to fight off the p-40 fighter planes that are attacking as well as the other fellow pilots who also serve as the lieutenants under command of Doolittle who then tells the fighters to get to their plane stations and fight as they strike back when the imperial forces continue their surprise attacks this film shows way too much action and that is what makes it very entertaining. it isn't completely accurate and some called it completely inaccurate which it is in some ways but in truth many say it is more accurate than many movies it has both fictional character's and real character's such as Doris miller played by Cuba gooding jr and the president Roosevelt who is portrayed by Jon Voight he does very well with portraying the character and was definitely an award winning contender, as was Alec baldwins portrayal who did well at depicting the commander Doolittle and how he was in charge of the Dolittle raid and even the Japanese actor mako who portrayed one of the films villains and was responsible for the attack on pearl harbor did very well in portraying Yamamoto in the film. though ben Affleck's performance wasn't so good and many criticized his performance saying Affleck you are horrible how is it that most of the performances in the film were good but your main character was portrayed poorly, and josh Hartnett also didn't do as good as the supporting cast but was at least better than ben Affleck even Cuba gooding jr was also doing his job correctly in the film and he got praised. the best to say about Affleck and Hartnett's performances is that they did their best and there were a few scenes where they made a good screen combo together when they were flying their planes and contacting each other saying we are going to take out these fighters and when they said of how they were going to land. but that was about it overall there ensemble wasn't too good but still the film makes you cry and is very beautiful, gorgeous and fun to watch, and not to mention that ben Affleck's then and long time wife Jennifer garner was also in the film and this might have been how they met and got together even though you don't see her much in the film she still does a good job portraying another one of the nurses along with Kate Beckinsale who was probably the best thing about the movie and was the only one who had an actual true Oscar worthy performance despite that she was part of the annoying love story, it may have been unnecessary to put it in a historical film but hey she was excellent and Michael bay had to do it for a reason. he was trying to make it the titanic of war movies and he succeeded only with making it earn almost as much money as titanic did even though he didn't make it quite as good. Michael bay here proves he is like James cameron who can fill in the blanks for a historical film by adding fictional character's and making it longer though it wasn't that necessary to make it 3 hours long it still had a point because bay is a very worldwide famous director and famous directors make long movies usually. what acclaimed filmmaker Michael bay has done is added more of what we could have learned in this history lesson just like how James cameron did with titanic which resulted cameron in earning his first Oscar win for best director and Michael bay's directing here was also good enough for a best director nomination and if not good enough for a win still a nomination, he deserves more praise and credit than ever, and the film ends with Danny dying and says under his dying breath reconcile with Evelyn, saying to Rafe you win the girl and also take care of my child she is pregnant with him. it is a sad moment, Rafe agrees and he and Evelyn get back together where only then in the end they have good chemistry and have a good combo, they raise her son while then visiting Dannys grave with Rafe promising to raise his son on his behalf. Rafe then asks his stepson to go on a flight on the same biplane as he once used with his father. people had on and off thoughts on this film and even though it isn't the greatest movie of all time it was still well made and is not terrible, its another one of the best movies of 2001 acclaimed filmmaker Michael bay and acclaimed producer jerry Bruckheimer have created something to remember with great cinematography, great editing, great costume designs, great special effects, a great cast ensemble, the plane colors were done right and they made a very good depiction of them it was showing how real aviation looked like and best of all a wonderful soundtrack from hans zimmer. Michael bay may well be the second in command of being the king of the world alongside James cameron. even though bay is not as great he is still definitely worth being compared to James cameron, this was a decent film. well done nice work to both Bruckheimer and bay you make a great team together. final grade score A-"

"rix_1000","9","2","5","12 May 2012"," Pearl of a movie
","I'd like to set the record straight for Pearl Harbor. I really don't understand the high rate of bad reviews for this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a Michael Bay blockbuster, why does everyone assume that it HAS to be historically accurate to the point. If what you want is historically accurate, then watch a documentary. Everyone knows that fighter pilots don't't fly bombers and that the Doolittle Raid was much later following the Pearl Harbor bombing. Michael Bay has and always will be an entertainer foremost and his movies will always center around entertaining the audience to the fullest.<br/><br/>That being said I'd like to say that I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor and it has been one of my top war epics for a long time now. The soundtrack is just flawless and that alone makes the movie worth watching. I loved Ben Affleck in this (haters be hating). I do realize most people say it's the worst role he's ever played, but I think he did a very good job. The same can be said to Josh Hartnett and the always beautiful Kate Beckinsale. Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight and Mako, they raise the bar of this movie to a higher level, that goes without saying.<br/><br/>The special effects are magnificent, the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence is breathtaking and Michael Bay's love for explosions finally pays off.<br/><br/>The storyline is one of my favourites. I think there are not enough movies of this magnitude that are able to pull off 180 minutes. And Pearl Harbor makes its mark. I do realize that the love triangle has been done to death, but it just works.<br/><br/>So, all in all I wanted to give this emotionally gripping epic war tale a good review, well because it just deserves it."

","Stupid, stupid, stupid of me to take any notice of the critics when this film appeared in 2001!!! As a result I didn't get a copy and watch it all the way through until 2008. I am ashamed of myself.....really. Now I admit that I am an aviation anorak; however, even given the factual inaccuracies surrounding some of the aircraft, ships etc, I still loved all of the special effects. I think it says something when computers can make up for other failings in a film, so that it is still highly watchable. OK, Perhaps I am easily pleased, but at least I rarely rant on interminably about the incorrect cap-badge on the uniform of a soldier 400 yards away, and to the left of the main action!! And the unending supply of ammunition in a Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk certainly did not stop me enjoying the sequences. We all know that we cannot expect the heroes in a 'tale' like this to keep landing to re-arm; that would be ridiculous! How would they ever win a war like that? AS many others have pointed out, this was a Hollywood version of real events, so if you watch it expecting a historical masterpiece then you will be disappointed. Just chill, and go with the flow.

(dont know about that bit!) secondly i do not recall in the film anyone mentioning that the on of the British coding machines had picked up the message that Pearl Harbour (sorry about the English I'm actually English!) was to be attacked by the Japenese, and also as mention in another users comment it would be very difficult for a USAF pilot to join the RAF, and then win the Battle of Britain?!?! We did that extremely well ourselves thank you, remember Britain did create the Spitfire (possibly the greatest machine ever built) and also had such inspirational people as Douglas Bader (see, Reach for the skies)leading squadrons. So to sum it all up it was awful should never have been made and if people are now gathering historical information from films then the Director/writer should be punished.<br/><br/>Mark Walker"

"joed1667","1","2","5","1 August 2002"," Horrible
","This was in the top 5 for the worst movies i've ever seen. Fortunately I viewed it on a borrowed DVD because had I viewed it at a movie theater, I would've walked out and demanded my money back. You'd of thought from the movie ""Midway"" that they would've learned to omit a love story. Can you imagine a movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" if they inserted a love story? What a hero that Ben Afleck is single handedly taking on the Germans and Japanese. First he's a fighter pilot then switches to bombers. He was there for it all. The Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid. Did he drop the bomb on Hiroshima too?<br/><br/>I wasn't even impressed with the special effects. The attack looked like they were attacking the ""Death Star"" from Star Wars. So much was omitted like when there's a brief shot that was stuck in the storyline where Yamamoto says ""I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant"" made no sense in this movie as to why he said it and why it was just stuck in as filler. If you want to watch a historically accurate movie about the attack on ""Pearl Harbor"" which had more realistic special effects, watch Tora, Tora, Tora and you'll even see at the end Yamamoto saying ""I fear all we've done is awaken a sleeping giant....."" and you'll know exactly why he said it."

Everybody at school said that the entire thing was about a love story, and I'm not into that stuff.  I finally rented it on video when it came out, and I was shocked to find out that it was mostly action.  The love scenes acually were not that bad, and the movie leading up to the attack on Pearl was not boring.  After the attack, it was still exciting.  I like how the movie ended.  All of the actors gave their best preformances.  I even cried a couple times during this movie (and I'm not much of a crying type of person).  I've never cried at a movie before.  If you have an extra 3 hours, I highly recommend that you see this movie. RATING: 10/10"
"Film Maiden","9","2","5","3 September 2001"," A blockbuster with real quality.
","**SPOILERS**Okay, I would first like to ask all the critics to get off Pearl Harbor's back. In a Michael Bay-directed, Jerry Bruckheimer-produced summer event film, you can not expect Shakespeare in the drama department. If you go in with that in mind, Pearl Harbor will reveal it's quality to you, through it's great action, patriotic feel, and the extremely appealing performances of the three leads. Ben Affleck is a potent leading man. His best performance was in Bounce, but this one ties with Good Will Hunting as a close second. He broods, romances and cries with equal fervor. Kate Beckinsale fits nicely in the film in a strong performance, sharing chemistry with both co-stars. Josh Hartnett is given a kind-of thankless role, but he is strong, charming, self-deprecating and touching at the same time.And- SPOILER AHEAD-- what girl wouldn't swoon at that love scene!! The bottom line is that Pearl Harbor suffers from the prejudice of movie critics who STILL don't realize that summer is the time to be entertained above all. Pearl Harbor accomplishes this while still being the best film that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have ever done. I can't help but wonder what the reviews of Pearl Harbor would have been like if it had been released last December, the original date for release. Maybe Gladiator wouldn't have taken home that Oscar."

The commercials/trailers I saw were great so I was excited in seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were GREAT/EXCELLENT/OUTSTANDING there are not enough words to describe them. They had me at the edge of my seats, holding on to the sides of my seat in a tense position. I could not cry only when the credits came up because of how intense the action scenes were. I must admit I fell in love with Josh Hartnett. Maybe it was his voice/accent or maybe because he is just such a babe. He acted so well in this movie. So did Ben Affleck. Kate Benckinsale, who to be quite honest, I've never heard of her in my life was good. And the story line was beautiful.<br/><br/>You can also go and take younger kids to see this. There are no senes that are horrible. Even the love scene between Kate and Josh is not bad. There are no naked bodies in this movie. So there is another good point that I will add to this movie."
"smithy2001","10","2","5","4 August 2001"," Best film of the year!
","""War"", as someone once trilled ""What is it good for?"" Well huge summer blockbuster, apparently. At least, that's what scourge of the arthouse crowd and best bud of the muiltplex mob, Jerry Brunkheimer, was betting when he decided to plough $135 million of Disney's money into Pearl Harbor. A risky proposition when you realise that it's not only a story about the invincible American military being caught with its pants down-climaxing in an ending that everybody knows-but has a cast, that while not by any means likely to turn down Lily Savage's Blankety Blank in a hurry, are certainly no guarantee of financial success. The question, then, is have Brunkheimer and his buddy Michael Bay (Armageddon) pulled it off? The answer is that, as usual, the Brunkheimer brand has delivered an almost dead-cert hit. Whilst a bit on the anoexic side in the dramatic weight department, it's a natural born blockbuster that ratchets the action bar up dozens of notches and represents the final coming of the age of CGI. Quite simply, you have never seen anything like it. Story-wise we're somewhere between Rolf Harris' Two Little Boys and Tora! Tora! Tora!, with best pals flying aces Affleck and Hartnett rowing over the affections of Kate Beckinsale, after she accidentally f***s the latter when the former is supposed to have been shot over Europe. Not Bay's determination to shoot everything by what appears to be a permanent sunset (and a pleasing sense of humour from Affeck vanishes far too quickly.) Bay's pre-war America looks like it emerged from a beer ad-little boys soapbox Sopwiths, while real-life biplanes zoom over amber waves of grains; trains rumble into stations in slo-mo amid billiowing clouds of steam; lovers curl in each others arms and say stuff like, ""Do you think the war will ever reach us?"" (for $135 million it'd better, baby!) But it is the bombing itself that always what this movie was going to live and die on, and here Bay really delivers, from an astonishing first 'bomb's eye view' shot that sees the camera follow a falling munition through the decks of the USS Arizona. Then comes perfectly timed detonation, using fantastically detailed long shots of hundreds of Japanease Zeroes buzzing around the exploding fleet. It's an amazing, visceral experience. ILM's CGI is, for the first time, indistinguishable from reailty. Torpedoes hiss under the thrashes feet of drowning soliders, men are blown through upturned ship's propellers towards the camera, and fighting plough into each other . It's an astounding, nerve-shredding experience that leaves the mealy-mouthed whining about flatpacked characterisation bobbing in the wreakage. And amongst the cliches, there's even a dog in the middle of the carnage.<br/><br/>TEN OUT OF TEN."

Truly touching and inspiring, a must see. *****/***** stars."
"Paddlefoot","10","2","5","13 June 2001"," Not as billed but a great ""movie"".
","It wasn't what I expected.  An epic film on the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, it was not.  A story about two friends with a bond of the deepest kind, set around a historical event, and a pure, innocent, love story, it was.<br/><br/>Having lived through such a bond of friendship, including the girl, I am sure I related to it in a way different from most.  To me, it was very real and brought back wounderful memories and sad regret.  Through all that is Hollywood, that is what I saw.  But there is an even more important factor to be considered.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck was the headliner in this movie.  But in fact, the real headliner was Josh Hartnett, as Danny Walker.  Hartnett played the role as good as it could have been played.  Little known and little seen, (I had never heard of him before) Hartnett put on a performance head and shoulders above the rest.  Perhaps Affleck did not have the best of material but his performance, except in the scenes after the Doolittle Raid, were only par. Hartnett sold me from the beginning and kept me interested until the end.<br/><br/>It was a good movie.  I have seen it twice and may go again.  When it is released on video, I will own a copy.  You can also be certain that I will go see other Josh Hartnett films.  The guy is just that good an actor."

Not all of the details have to be entirely correct. Many ""Harbor Haters"" have said that the movie is a loser because the two main characters (Affleck and Hartnett) are not real characters.

It was a complete waste of three hours, it doesn't respect history, it doesn't it's audience, and it doesn't respect other cultures. And it's an atrocity to cinema.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is an incredibly bias historical film, that rather than tell history, decides to be America propaganda. Villifying the Japanese, and feeling more like a wartime propaganda film than a legitemite historical film.<br/><br/>First criticism, the romance is terrible and main characters never existed. And because of that, we never become attached to these characters, or the events. With a movie like ""Titanic"" (love or hat it) personal I love it, and it's miles better than this. Even though the characters didn't exist, you see them interact with the real people. In this movie, they're away from the action. And when we see the action, there's no attachment to anything, because we didn't get to know the people being killed.<br/><br/>And the Japanese are portrayed as evil villians who shoot at hospitals and kill without mercy. We don't get to know the Japanese, and the film comes across as offensive. I have some strong opinions against Doug Walker and Channel Awesome, but his review of ""Pearl Harbor"" somed up all my thoughts and criticisms.

","People these days are intellectually lazy and their understanding of history comes from movies, not from libraries. Pearl Harbor is not only inaccurate but it is an insult to those who died.<br/><br/>If this were 100% fiction it would be a great movie. The thing that ruins it for me (and others of my generation who had relatives that died there) is that the actors were like children playing dress-up, who were working for producers, a writer, and a director whose understanding of things was sophomoric, juvenile, and artificial. There was virtually no research done on life, fashion, and sensibilities of the people of that era. The BS of the two pilots was wildly disrespectful to the two real-life pilots who responded during the attack, and to then pretend that these two fictional fighter guys would suddenly be flying bombers is both stupid and disrespectful to the real Tokyo raiders. If you want to see a good film on Pearl Harbor, watch Tora Tora Tora. Not only does it represent the truth, but it also shows things from both the American and Japanese sides.

","With every bad review I read of this movie, I became more and more afraid of going to watch it. I eventually decided to try it. And I loved it. Quite possibly my favorite movie, and one of the best I have seen. There are some inaccuracies yes, but the film does what its supposed to. That is paint a grim, ugly image of war. The story could be a little clichÃ©d but its actually quite good. It's executed in a fashion that ties the love story and the attack together. There are several twists and turns, and the solid conclusion ties everything together. I am probably going to get a lot of hate for this, but this is seriously the best movie I have ever seen.

","There are many ways to recall a historical event. You can call for a celebration, throw a parade or recreate it in a movie. The bombing of Pearl Harbor which took place on December 7th, 1941 is one American will never forget and is yearly commemorated. This tragic event has been immortalized on film and attests to it's importance. This film "" Pearl Harbor "" is the latest remake and for this reviewer one of the finest. The event itself has so many historical statistics one weeps. Further, the sorrow is very vivid in the minds of many survivors living today. Taking only a few hours, the attack did not last very long due to the caution expressed by the attacking Japanese. Indeed, the attack is used as a backdrop to the Romantic love story embedded within the memorable day. Destined to become pilots, two farm boys Capt.Rafe and Capt. Dan Walker (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) emerge as adults fliers and exhibit the courage, fortitude and courage prominent in the American Army/Air Corps. of the 1940's. Kate Beckinsale plays Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson the love interest of both men. Adding to the collection of major stars which enhance this movie are some real heavyweights, like Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore and Dan Aykroyd. Although, the film is seen as a 'bit' long, (3 Hrs) the action sequences more than make up for it. All in all, the movie packs an explosive punch with it's Aeriel action, fantastic combat footage and its touching human drama. In time, it should have very little trouble becoming a great Classic. Well done! ****"

","I have noticed a lot of discussion about this particular movie that there is apparently a whole plethora of things wrong with it. The fact remains that there isn't a whole lot wrong with this movie at all. There is only one thing wrong and that's the fact that it doesn't deal with a cataclysmic event that propelled the United States into the Second World War. The title strongly suggests that and so do the trailers, but it is simply not the case.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" shows nothing, yes nothing, interesting that led up to or resulted from that morning on December 7th, 1941. Nothing is shown about Japanese spies secretly gathering information. Nothing is shown of the Japanese Navy analyzing it and planning the attack. Nothing is shown of American code breakers who actually decoded several Japanese transmissions before the attack. OK enough of what the film doesn't show, but what does it show? It shows that the most important thing before the attack was a painfully corny love triangle. It shows that two American pilots with hangovers can out fly and shoot down enemy planes all without taking damage. It shows us part of the Battle of Britain, which is only relevant in passing to this film. It shows that London has a downtown (it doesn't anymore, because the Germans destroyed it during the Blitz). It shows that WWII fighter air craft can pull off maneuvers like X-Wings from Star Wars, especially if the air craft in question are piloted by Americans. It shows the Japanese as stoic and emotionless individuals despite the fact they managed to pull off one of the most successful attacks in military history. Yet it doesn't show HOW they did.<br/><br/>Funny thing is that all this mess actually makes for a fun movie. A movie that consists of a teenage novel type of romance, 40 minutes of explosions, and then the rest of the movie about how the ""good guys"" get back at the ""bad guys."" That's your basic outline for a cheesy action movie. And that's half of what this movie is. The other half is an abominable travesty of history that is harder to forgive with repeated viewings. My advice is just to focus on the first half and you'll enjoy yourself and that makes the movie a guilty pleasure for the action movie fan at best. --- 5/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence.

","Pearl Harbor is a very beautiful film. There seem to be many people who are against this movie- which is beyond me. It is filled with action, romance and drama. Plus- for cry babies like me- it is a TRUE tear jerker! It follows two young men from the time they are children until they are put into the army during world war two. The two share a strong passion for flying and so the whole movie is pretty much based on that. In comes a girl of course who gets in between them and this is where the romance comes in. But the end is the very best part and I won't say any more! Overall, this movie is very touching. It is also half chick flick, half guy flick and so both genders will find something to enjoy. The acting is amazing- well of course Ben Affleck never falls short and Josh Hartnett is absolutely incredible. In fact, all of the other characters, whether they are significant or not- are done beautifully. This is the kind of movie I would watch on a rainy Friday under the covers with a cup of hot cocoa. I'd give it a shot folks! 9/10"

","A strong contender for the title of ""Worst Movie I have ever seen."" It suffers from the same problem as Titanic; an unwillingness to tell complicated stories with a large cast and no obvious central character. Instead, everything is reduced to how it affects a small group, or as in these two movies, as a backdrop to a love affair. Unlike Titanic, however, Pearl Harbour loses track of reality early on; for example, the way Ben Affleck's character manages to change theatres of war at the drop of a hat. The special effects are unconvincing: one shot of some destroyers being bombed is used over and over again- to make it worse, the ships in this shot are modern guided-missile ships, no effort having been made to disguise them as period vessels. If you want to watch a film about the attack on Pearl Harbour, watch ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", and if you want a film about WW2 pilots, with a good script, engaging characters and good special effects, try ""Dark Blue World."""

As to Doolittle's raid it happened 6 months after PH and yes it was a revenge raid. By the way what school did you go to. Also I'm a History major on WW2.

","First let me say that I liked this movie. I repeat: I ... LIKED ... THIS ... MOVIE. I know that the story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese and the special effects were somewhat overblown (get the pun?), but this movie is not about the characters nor is it about the special effects. Rather it's about an event that galvanized a nation and transformed the world. That is, it's about the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the world was never the same, and although the movie has it's weaknesses, one thing is for certain: after watching this movie, you know that SOMETHING BIG happened on that fateful day and that it effected a lot of people in different ways. Maybe the movie should have provided more historical background - but it's not a documentary. Or maybe the movie should have had a better script - but did that really matter? What DOES matter is the event itself, and in this respect, despite the over-reliance on special effects, the movie does its job well. For this reason I cannot be too critical and that alone is enough to make this movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsdale gives an excellent performance. She is a great actress."

Its upsetting near the beginning when Danny and Evelyn receive news regarding Rafes death, and seek comfort in the arms of one another. Yet Rafe soon appears after what we see was a false report of his death and we soon see Evelyn caught between two amazing brave guys who are both in love with her and we get caught up in the story of WW2 making this film a definite crying film yet moves you so much its one of the greatest films of all time."

There are several parts where there are bombs flying, guns shooting, missiles flaring, but for the record, this movie is a drama. In my opinion one of the best. You'd think of it as a classic love story, two people in love, the man going to war, but this love story is totally different. It's more about one love, then splitting up into two. Kind of confusing, but once you watch it, you'll understand. If you like dramas, this is a must see movie. A lot of guys out there should be careful. I know a lot of my friends (guys) didn't like this movie very much at all. Only the parts with the gun firing and the bombings but besides that they thought it was a total chick flick, which it is.

"Natenbox64","2","1","2","4 September 2014"," The worst movie I have ever seen from Michael Bay
","I'm not that much of a Bay hater, heck I like Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and I actually do like the first Transformers movie. Well there are some missteps from him like The Island, I thought Bad Boys II was okay, Transformers 2 & 4, and Pain & Gain. This movie however....yeah....let's start with the good already.<br/><br/>The only good things about this movie were the effects, production design and the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor scene. That was a pretty emotional scene and a intense one, it was well shot and the action was well done. If it wasn't ruined by everything else.<br/><br/>Now the bad.<br/><br/>The acting is stiff as a wooden stick. They had talented actors in this movie, and only three of them (Aykroyd, Voight,and Gooding Jr.) did a valid job. The direction has no soul at all. The writing and dialog were cheesy as all hell. The Japanese (not to be racist) were nothing but stereotypes. And it's way too long. But none of them are the biggest problem with this movie. The biggest problem with this movie is the romance between Affleck, Harnett and Beckinsale being the main focus of the entire movie. They're obviously Jack and Rose from Titanic, except they are in Hawaii, it's the WWII era, you have another copy of Jack Dawson, and they're played by Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. Plus, the only reason why the couple from Titanic worked in the first place is because the couple are in the RMS Titanic. This couple here are not in the Pearl Harbor most of the time, so why is this movie called Pearl Harbor then?<br/><br/>It should have focus on two friends or two brothers (it doesn't matter if one of them might be gay) working at the Pearl Harbor and after the attack from the Japanese, they had to go to Japan to drop a nuclear bomb but before they go there, they had to tell their girlfriend that they may not be back alive and that kinda stuff. Now that should be the movie, but nope, we got to have a love triangle, as if that we have never seen this stuff in a long time.<br/><br/>It's also blatantly inaccurate to the actual event. I mean like (spoilers!) I don't remember hearing about the Japanese planes attacking the hospital right next to the Pearl Harbor in my history class, because that never happened. It was stupid, insulting to the people who want to know about the attack and it's disrespectful to the people who either died or survived the Pearl Harbor attack. These kinds of things are why Michael Bay should never make a drama epic or a historical epic because he's more of a action oriented filmmaker, not a filmmaker that take things serious. But I know that they weren't making a documentary but you got to get the history right, Michael Bay, other than the time line.<br/><br/>Overall: <br/><br/>You know the sad thing about this movie is that I am a fan of war epics. I like movies from Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket or Platoon or Saving Private Ryan or any decent war epic out there. And I do like the historical drama genre. Stuff like Schindler's List, The Last Emperor, and heck I actually hate to admit that I did like Titanic. This one however, was by far the worst war epic and the worst historical drama epic (combined) that I have ever seen because even if the director may not be like Spielberg for drama, it had the potential to be a good movie. But I was not so pleased with this movie. If you want a Pearl Harbor movie, I'll suggest go watch Tora! Tora! Tora! or any documentary about the Pearl Harbor attack. This movie will disappoint you or let go of your interest about the tragic event.<br/><br/>Score: 2.3/10"

I have the movie at home and my parents told me that I would love this movie that it's a beautiful story. I wasn't so interested in the movie and after I watched it I knew it was a mistake. I don't see the point in the movie and even though it's supposed to be historical, it showed a really boring example of history. It's just 3 hours of either pointless romance or boringly continuous action. I don't recommend this movie if you of course want to enjoy watching movies. The story also doesn't make sense. They assume that a guy's bestfriend is dead. The guy who's still alive falls in love with the dead guys love life. Then it turns out that he was still alive and then beats up his bestfriend? Makes no sense at all and I was rather disappointed."

","Unfairly maligned because of its stars, director and genre, Pearl Harbor is still a decent attempt at paying tribute to a significant, tragic event in American history, and does a pretty fine job of it. If only Bay had removed the clichéd love triangle aspects from the script, this might have been an overwhelming critical success. It's no ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it's a damn fine effort. You can hate me for saying this but I don't care; the cinematography is absolutely stunning and beautiful - I challenge you to not freeze any frame an not call it finely staged photography. As well, it's 3 hour run time flies by like a breeze. In addition, the 'cheesy' elements of the script were completely enjoyable; Bay makes it clear he's paying homage, (a la the scene at the start of the film where Affleck's character talks about paying respects to past achievements - ""they call it an homage""), to the love stories on screen in the 1940's and 50's, the films which the characters in the film would watch and love, (the newsreels watched throughout the film are reminiscent/copies of Frank Capra's ""Why We Fight"" films from the same time period). This is a great film that will likely stand the test of time. <br/><br/>Seriously. This is a damn good film. Matt Stone and Trey Parker don't own the public opinion."
"Rickting","2","1","2","28 February 2014"," Titanic+Saving Private Ryan should be good right? Wrong!
","The Titanic of war movies, Pearl Harbour sets a clichéd, cardboard cut out love story against the backdrop of a tragic historical event and despite blatantly borrowing from great films such as Titanic and Saving Private Ryan, it is a total misfire that fails to respect its audience or its subject matter. In fleeting moments the film shows potential: An inexplicably committed Hans Zimmer creates a very good soundtrack, while the visuals are stunning. From time to time, Michael Bay who if there was any justice in the world would be a pyrotechnics expert rather than a director, shows flashes of vision in his directing, particularly in the indulgent 40 minute attack sequence. Aside from that Pearl Harbour is just depressing. The film is like a dementor sucking your soul out as this outrageously awful blockbuster flop creaks through every badly written, groan inducing scene with glacial pacing. It takes the movie 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to the attack, which is rendered disrespectfully as a blockbuster showdown and lasts for 40 minutes, before we get the most pointless final hour of all time involving a revenge attack.<br/><br/>All 3 of the leads are awful, while the dialogue is so cringe inducingly bad it can be funny but otherwise listening to the dialogue is a genuinely embarrassing experience which will leave you shaken for days. Michael Bay's direction is as robotic as ever and the film is, in general, a soulless, bloated bomb that deserves to sink without a trace. The final hour could have been erased easily, and with a talented director and a screenwriter who could actually write maybe this might have worked. The music is easily the best thing in the movie, and others may argue the attack sequence is spectacular but I disagree. It's loud, bloated, ugly and acts as it's some big entertaining blockbuster showdown instead of a very tragic day in American history. There are few silver linings or genuine defences for this film. Pearl Harbour is an insult to history, to war movies, to romantic movies, to sunsets, to action set pieces, to its critics, its audience and our intelligence and everyone involved should be ashamed.

"StevePulaski","3","1","2","5 December 2013"," Seems more like a disservice to those involved
","Michael Bay's approach to Pearl Harbor, centering around a tedious, contrived love-triangle is like watching a film about a first date on September 11, 2001. While one thing is going on that seems so trivial, so senseless, and so impulsive, a major historical event is taking place and instead of focusing on the bigger issue, we're stuck on a smaller, more secluded issue that is almost entirely irrelevant.<br/><br/>The last time I witnessed such a big-budget miscalculation had to be when I watched Michael Bay's other atrocity Armageddon, which also victimized Ben Affleck into a senseless funk of action filmmaking. That was just an action film that exemplified the worst qualities of action cinema. Pearl Harbor, on the other hand, exercises the worst qualities of a war film, focusing on a lackluster love story and a brutal war without any agenda that I could find. Just one to milk sentiment from the audience and for a war film to rely on that move is almost cowardice. Do I need to cue Aerosmith's ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing?"" The film follows Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), two First Lieutenants for America during World War II. Thrill-seeking buddies, they both become involved in a relationship with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), an army nurse. Rafe becomes romantically involved first, exchanging disgustingly cheesy dialog like ""something hurts,"" after a fall injures his nose. ""It's probably your nose,"" Evelyn replies. Rafe hits her with, ""I think it's my heart."" Groan-worthy dialog really doesn't stop there. When Rafe enrolls in the Eagle Squadron, he is shipped off to the dogfighting portion of combat, with rumors of his plane being shot down and being killed in the process. After this news circulates, while both heartbroken, Danny and Evelyn begin to have a relationship on their own, only to discover that Rafe is indeed alive and well and now angry his best friend has stolen his girl in the process.<br/><br/>This is all troublesome indeed, but in the meantime, there is a giant, merciless war that shows no sign of ending going on right behind you guys, and this petty drama as the main focus of Michael Bay's epic seems a bit senseless, don't you think? I'm all for the humanization of war figures and characters involved in battles, but when there's a film about an enormous militaristic crisis and tragedy and its choice to focus on a love triangle instead of the real struggle at hand seems disingenuous. To use another analogy, it's like interviewing a couple who had a marital argument on a train that derailed about that argument. There's a larger, more interesting, more compelling, more emotionally touching story at hand and this is what you focus on? When we do see the battle at hand, and the action scenes, the production values are very high and the action is watchable. This is for about ten to fifteen minutes before the Michael Bay formula of making every explosion out to be an ear-shattering time bomb and every perilous instance to be a meteoric cacophony of sound that it becomes a muchness. Bay is a guy who loves to make his visuals loud and glossy and to that I give him credit. He should direct music videos for a living. His films, however, always assume this status and become nothing more than a showcase for visuals and a house for stale drama and characters that are developed in a way that feels like an obligation. Granted Bay has never written a film, a fact often misinterpreted, but I'm still trying to discover if screenplays handed to him are chocked full of character development and interesting human drama and, upon being handed back to the writer, are littered with footnotes about when to include an explosion or an action sequence in bold, red ink.<br/><br/>It's odd to note that with a romance involved, a war at hand, and a serious dilemma between characters all occurring in one film, the three hours Pearl Harbor utilizes are dull and boring ones. Affleck and Hartnett are both capable actors, but are given dialog that just bleeds clichés, and accompanied by a script penned by Randall Wallace (the man responsible for writing Braveheart), I can't help but feel that the film's corny depiction of a 1940's romance and the scenes depicting the bombing of Pearl Harbor are a disservice and perhaps offensive to veterans of the war. The film feels like a Hollywood action movie, one that is intended as something to profit off of a tragedy and make entertainment out of it, rather than show the event as it really was. There are literally hundreds of ideas to base a film about Pearl Harbor off of and it's surprising to note that with the abundance of Holocaust films that are all very accomplished and smartly done, we have one widely known film about Pearl Harbor and it's a macro-disappointment.<br/><br/>Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale.

Rafe could be an anagram for Fear and pronounced backwards sounds like the word fear.<br/><br/>....Evelyn ""What is gonna become of us?""<br/><br/>Rafe ""The future is not exactly in our hands is it""<br/><br/>Evelyn ""No, I guess you are right ""<br/><br/>The script here is telling the audience that they are not in control of their own destiny.<br/><br/>....First scene of the Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.....<br/><br/>Admiral ""War is inevitable. To hide this fact is death. There is only one way, a massive, sudden strike ""<br/><br/>Could be referring to 9/11 attacks in a couple of months.<br/><br/>....Yamamoto ""A smart enemy hits exactly where you think your safe""<br/><br/>Would the world trade center and Pentagon be a safe place?<br/><br/>....Nurse Evelyn mending petty officer Doris Millera's eye wound from a boxing match .....<br/><br/>Evelyn ""What do you get for winning?""<br/><br/>Doris Miller ""Respect""<br/><br/>Propaganda...... join the forces and you get respect.<br/><br/>....Yamamoto ""The attack training is progressingfor the success of this operation, high-level bombing and torpedo attack training are crucial ""<br/><br/>Training had been taking place during the lead up to and on the day of the 9/11 attacks.<br/><br/>....Yamamoto ""Set up teams of radio operatives to send out messages the Americans will intercept the clutter will be more confusing that way"" <br/><br/>Disinformation and ""clutter"" is what the Americans have been subjected to for many years, especially with the five years leading up to 9/11.<br/><br/>....Charles Chaplin's film The Great Dictator is showing at the cinema in a scene. During a pre-movie film, this statement was aimed at the viewers ""Victory does not come without sacrifice."" This is a propaganda movie within a propaganda movie. Victory for who? and could the victims of the 9/11 attacks be the sacrificed?<br/><br/>....Scene at the British intelligence office where there is a big table with mini flags that has numbers on, this being the strategists planning board. The main numbers on the flags are 21, 53 and 36, added together gives 11/9, this being the British way of saying the date. During the same scene an officer states.... ""I don't know how just two whole carrier divisions can just disappear"". This statement together with the numbers could be pointing to the twin towers ""disappearing"" on 11/9.<br/><br/>....Lady in red or red herring Evelyn really stands out in her red dress, and could be pointing to the matrix movie two years earlier. <br/><br/>....Japanese soldier (thinking voice, first words heard in English without subtitles of Japanese speaking character) "".I go now to fulfill my mission and destiny, I hope it is a destiny that will bring honor to our family and if it requires my life, I will sacrifice it gladly to be a good servant to our nation""<br/><br/>He uses the word our, and therefore he his not talking just about himself and implies we should all be servants. This is the words of a suicide bomber. Viewers might begin to understand how and why a suicide bomber would kill himself for a cause, thus making it believable when ""suicide bombers"" attack the world trade center. <br/><br/>....President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""I regret to tell you that over three thousand American lives have been lost. No matter how long it may take us to over come this pre-meditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan, I ask that the congress declare a state of War.""<br/><br/>This reminds me of the rhetoric by Bush and his friends after the 9/11 attacks <br/><br/>....TV footage ""Back home millions of American workers band together, bring factory life to avenge pearly harbor""<br/><br/>Propaganda ordinary us civilians need to band together to avenge the 9/11 attack, that you don't know about yet but is just around the corner.<br/><br/>....Danny talking to his colonel pre-counter attack ....<br/><br/>Danny ""We might die doing this, we wanna know what it's for?""<br/><br/>Colonel James Doolittle gives him some bullshit reply and then finishes on""we're gonna believe, and we're gonna make America believe to"" <br/><br/>This is the whole point of the propaganda is it not? <br/><br/>....James Doolittle ""There's nothing stronger than heart of a volunteer""<br/><br/>After 9/11 more recruits for the war machine would be needed.<br/><br/>....Rafe ""What would you do colonel?""<br/><br/>James Doolittle ""I wasn't built to be a prisonerI would dive my plane smack into the middle of it ""<br/><br/>Implying suicide bombers flying planes into targets.<br/><br/>....Radio Tokyo "".Watch out the enemy will get you""<br/><br/>More fear.<br/><br/>....This is just a small sample of examples, there are plenty more."

","Let's cut straight to the quick: four stars.<br/><br/>Four stars because the (relatively) early CGI is not at all bad, if overstated. Live action is pretty realistically mixed with virtual, although the aerial shots do look a tad artificial. Anyway, four stars for that.<br/><br/>Doesn't leave many stars for the rest though, does it? At three hours, this movie is at least 50% too long. It doesn't know where it's going - and it shows. If you just watched the first twenty minutes you could be forgiven in thinking it is a comedy, rather crudely done. The last half hour, the Doolittle raid sequence, is pure jingoistic make-believe. Then there's the middle bit: the raid on Pearl - and that doesn't start until nearly an hour and a half into the romantic comedy. Discombobulated is, I think, the appropriate designation.<br/><br/>I valiantly resisted seeing this film for years after reading how tedious it is in many reviews, but succumbed (this is 2012) and sat through the TV performance right through to the end.<br/><br/>I am uncomfortable with movies that are fiction dressed up with a strong historical theme. The blurring of fact and fiction is always an invitation to re-write history or, at least, be taken as fact by those who are unable to make the distinction. WW2 is recent enough to be well documented, and a movie such as Pearl Harbor does itself no favours by weaving a completely fictitious story into actual historical fact.<br/><br/>The really interesting story from a factual point of view was the failure of the intelligence services in the Pearl Harbour attack: this would itself have made a great movie but was hardly touched upon. As with Bletchley Park, much of the wins and losses in war are enacted behind the scenes and in secrecy.<br/><br/>And the music track - atrocious!<br/><br/>Sorry, but this falls into the same box as Independence Day - a jingoistic yawn. A wasted opportunity."

","After hearing all the buzz, I saw this movie a month after it came out, I figured I would give it a shot. A couple of months later, I finally went to see it in the theaters, and I thought it was awesome.<br/><br/>(Warning: Possible spoilers ahead) I'll start out with the cons: There are a few things I didn't care for in this movie. First of all, I agree with you who say that the romance was bland, etc.; but I don't really care for romance, so my opinion on that doesn't matter. Second, Ben's and all of the other twenty-something actors' acting were kind-of corny and goofy. But on the other hand, I have seen people who act like that. Not everybody in every movie has to act like they are acting. Some of my friends behave in such manners. And they are on Hawaii, where they are (or were) care-free, thinking they were away from the war. Pros: Of course, the special effects were the best part of the movie. In my opinion, they more than make up for the lame romance. I went into the theaters expecting to see some of the best shots I've ever seen, and I got what I wanted. The effects combined with the unique camera angles (following a bomb as it drops above a ship, watching a squadron of jets fly over kids playing baseball and a women drying clothes, etc.) made the attack scene one of my favorites of all time. When ""Pearl Harbor"" finally comes out on video, I'll probably get the DVD so I can skip to the attack on occasion, but I will be sure to watch the complete film."

","Honestly, it's eye candy; because it falls short in many respects; but it is fun to watch. You don't, with a few exceptions I'll abstain from mentioning (Okay, Waterworld is a fine example), spend the kind of money, $140 million or more in 2001, and make a complete flop. The shots in Hawaii and in the English Chanel are splendid. The movie does not fare well when compared to some others for war story value, I admit; there are plenty of good and better love stories and stories about friendships that beat this movie hands down. So why did I like it and why did hundreds of users score it above average (granted as many did not)? As I stated, it's pretty good eye candy. The expression should not be limited to references of beautiful looking actresses, or actors, depending on who is doing the watching; it certainly applies here.<br/><br/>Many of the actors in this movie have fans and I don't want to diss any of them; so I'll not say all that comes to mind. Besides, I'm a fan of a few of them. I'm a fan of five of them; I enjoyed the movie. It's a movie that is best watched at the cinema with friends who are fans of at least a couple of the actors, eating popcorn with extra butter flavor crap and gulping a gigantic Coke.

A lot of what happened is historically true. In terms of whether this is a great MOVIE, not documentary, it really is. Great special effects, fight scenes along with a compelling love story make Pearl Harbor a brilliant film.<br/><br/>I ignore most critics reviews on historical or religious films as they tend to be biased towards what they believe in...trust me if your not one of them kind of people, you will love Pearl Harbor."

","I know this sounds less commercial than ""Pearl Harbor"" but it's the truth: <br/><br/>the climatic attack happens well before the end of the movie and after it, there is still more than one hour of movie. Thus, this last part turns the movie from classic to average because it's dull. Roosevelt looks like the penguin and his drama told with too much emphasis! The wonderful character we have met so far turn into wrecks: the soldier Betty saves actually operates in this top-secret mission; Worst: imagine that Rafe wait the death of his best friend to tell him he's a father! When you are called into a suicide mission and if you have heart, you tell the truth as soon as possible to motive your partner.<br/><br/>So, for me, the movie ends with Pearl Harbor and i must say it's a good one so far. The 40's are recreated like a shiny world and the Japanese aren't seen as inferiors. The romance isn't extraordinary but is rather excellently served by the cast. The movie sounds right when you see the hundreds of Japanese planes fly silently over Hawai, without any reaction from Americans. They were totally taken by surprise, the same way they were hit on 9/11. As the movie was released just before the event, i wonder how the audience have felt then. Unlike ""Transformers"" of the same Bay, the attack is well shot in the sense that you understand what happens on the screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, as it's more a fiction, it would have been better to end the movie with Pearl Harbor and to resolve the plot at that day(and cut also the sequence of the dog rescued, worthless and stupid). Maybe it was too much for them!"

""Rafe I really love her"". Well duh, you boned her and now she is having your child, I hope that is the case. Wouldn't the attack on Pearl Harbor been enough drama to concentrate on?

I don't know how many more times I can say this, but, STOP PUTTING BEN AFFLECK IN MOVIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! He's terrible and he ruins otherwise good movies (not that this qualifies, of course). Does there really have to be a ridiculous love story? Is it a requirment made by the suits in order to get funding for your movie? It adds nothing at all to the story.

","This so-called excuse for film-making was designed for (1) Complete idiots-(2) Democratic Florida voters from the 2000 election (3) Global Warming is Bush's fault believers (4) Any-combination of all three.This movie would additionally impress those folks who spell the word farm EIEIO,live in a community where the entire population shares the same DNA, or think child molesters can and should be rehabilitated with treatment.<br/><br/>I realize that most younger film-goers today are not bothered by issues such as historical accuracy. Most have no clue as to the causes of World War II, or if asked- could not provide a 10 second speech on the issues surrounding the attack of Pearl Harbor(let alone locate Hawaii on a map). A minor detail such as a member of the US Army Air Corps(Affleck)leaving to join a British Eagle Spitfire squadron in early 1941(how gravely unfortunate that the Battle of Britan was in the summer of 1940), only to return from the dead in December of 1941 to Hawaii is beyond imbecility.<br/><br/>Later we are treated to 2/3rds (Danny and Rafe) of our loving sexual threesome generously donating blood in Coke bottles after skillfully shooting down several Japanese planes,and later spending an adventurous evening attempting to rescue the doomed trapped sailors on the capsized Oklahoma. <br/><br/>Once freed from these chores,the audience is further subjected to more weepy, cheesy and pus infected lines of attempted acting between the now knocked-up nurse( Beckinsale) and her former jilted stiff-dick (Affleck).Our two top gun wannabees(who have now kissed and made-up) are then ordered stateside for the Doolittle mission of April 1942. This mission was entirely voluntary- but the two pals just go where they are ordered. Only later is the entire B-25 Doolitle Raiders crew asked to take the one-step forward in dramatic fashion.<br/><br/>Of course the fact that a WWII fighter pilot flew single engine aircraft and never even touched a B-25 to fly in combat 5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack is beside the point.After successfully launching off the Hornet inspired by the leadership the excellently cast Alec Baldwin(the real Jimmy Doolittle would have vomited knowing such a left-wing,unpatriotic social hemorrhoid was portraying him),our dynamic duo crash land in China and get into a firefight with those annoying Japs. Too bad such an event never occurred, but what the heck! Why be so critical and judgmental?<br/><br/>Although poor Danny(Harnett) sadly assumes room temperature in the hand-hand combat fantasy,good old Rafe gets home safely in time to hook-up with the slut nurse Evelyn and raise the bastard child who mirrors a retard on film. If Michael Bay had the time, I am sure he would have had Affleck leave the Army Air Corps and become a Naval Aviator in time to personally avenge Danny's death by destroying the Japanese carrier fleet at Midway which was only a month later. After all, this shell game worked during the Battle of Britan. <br/><br/>Later he could have returned to pilot the Enola Gay for the Hiroshima mission in 1945 after leaving the Navy to once again join the Army Air Corps after a successful combat record after leading paratroopers in on D-Day, firebombing Dresden, Berlin, and probably attempting to assassinate Hitler in a P-51 Mustang strafing raid.<br/><br/>Any fellow veteran who isn't insulted by this trash should get some mental health counseling ASAP at the nearest VA hospital. For the uninformed civilian population, open a history book. Of course, in our modern, diversity driven educational system, your feelings are more important then reality. I wonder if Hollywood ever thought of providing ""grief counselors"" to the survivors of Pearl Harbor. In the case of this nauseating bile of an attempted movie, I think it would have been appropriate to the surviving viewers of this ridiculous garbage of a film.<br/><br/>For me, I'll place the movie Pearl Harbor alongside my other all-time favorite comedy- G.I. Jane."

","A few nice flying scenes and that is it. The romantic thing was bunk. Our two heroes were very loosely based on two real men, Ken Taylor and George Welch. Two Air Corps fighter pilots who managed to get to their planes and take off. They did shoot down some Japanese planes but the incident is much better re-enacted in the movie TORA-TORA-TORA (a much better film in all regards). Both pilots survived the war.<br/><br/>In one scene you see a Japanese Zero fly by with a camera mounted on it's fuselage. The Japanese planes were painted the wrong color. They were Navy gray but someone decided the green looked better on camera. Why not just remake the battle of Britain and made the Germans fly pink dive bombers.<br/><br/>The bit with the mechanics climbing the control tower and shooting down a passing plane with small arms was STUPID and the bit where they run 2 Japanese planes into each other is off the BS meter.<br/><br/>By the way, Jimmy Doolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) was bald. Doris Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was an huge man. That is why he was a boxer. Miller did man a gun and shoot at shoot down 1 or 2 attacking Japanese planes for which he received the Navy Cross. I think the official record show 2 shot down and 1 damaged. He was killed later in the war. None of Doolittles Raiders were at Pearl Harbor during the attack and no fighter pilots were chosen."
"teacher_tom516","2","1","2","20 June 2007"," Why Pearl Harbour fails - and Michael Bay misses the mark...
","The film is aesthetically a treat to be sure but it fails almost everywhere else. Michael Bay, Bruckheimer and Wallace thought they could get away with making a film that, quite honestly, would not be out of place had it been done in 1942 - the movie about 'Wake Island' has a tacked on romance and the movie 'Bataan' has the stereotypical interracial bunch - but nowadays moviegoers want something smarter and as true to history as possible while delivering a great story. Most people also know how to spot blatant propaganda and avoid it like the plague.<br/><br/>I think the romance is not a problem, neither is the plot the problem. The problem is the execution which is lazy and little more than a video game writ large. Check out the movie Dark Blue World about WW2 Czech fighter pilots for comparison. EXACT same plot line but worlds apart in treatment and respect for the Czech heroes who fought with the Free Czech airforce in the UK and came home only to be branded traitors by the new Communist regime.<br/><br/>Titanic had a truckload of crappy Hollywood dialogue but it made good. The reason I think is it was true to its source material. Michael Bay just tacks on the lovestory to a fictionalized story about real Pearl Harbor heroes - Taylor and Welch - and somehow sends them to participate in the Doolittle Raid (nevermind that fighter pilots don't fly bombers!) I think that yeah, expectation also has a lot to do with it. With the name Pearl Harbor you expect it to be a WAR MOVIE like Battle of Britain or A Bridge Too Far. Maybe some romantic interest but it shouldn't be the main theme - the main theme should be the WAR. For my part I was expecting a mix of John Toland and Walter Lord but I got something that's barely a cut about Ma Nouvelle France, that horrible Quebecquois movie about the fall of New France to the British which is YET ANOTHER Titanic ripoff. Sadly, too many people thought that just by tacking on a romance to a historic story and making it sappy they'd emulate the success of Titanic. No such luck.<br/><br/>Titanic succeeds where the wannabees fail because it: <br/><br/>a) appeals to a very broad spectrum of people (ie. higher ticket sales!) - the yuppies and lovers can gush over Di Caprio and Kate Winslet's Romeo-Julietesque love story, the boys can wait up for the Winslet nude drawing scene, the girls can swoon over Di Caprio, the geeks and rivet counters can errm count the rivets and enjoy the history brought to life.<br/><br/>b) incorporates various elements of story into the plot almost flawlessly and with respect to historical reality - history here isn't just a backdrop it ACTIVELY AFFECTS THE STORY (this is where Pearl Harbor fails dismally).<br/><br/>In Titanic the division between classes and decks becomes a physical divide that separates the lovers from each other and later, threatens to separate them from survival. The class restrictions provide the characters with motivations that go beyond mere mushyness - Kate's escape here is not just to be with the one who she loves but it is an escape from the restrictions of her class to be her own person and live a full life. Leo's role here as hero-saviour fits into classic mythic structure and it plays well, in spite of the corny dialogue. It becomes real to the viewer because the characters become real and the characters become real because the history, the scenario, the environment is real and true to the facts within the bounds of good drama. One loses one's self in this fiction instead of - as in Pearl Harbour's case - being reminded constantly that this is a blown up (pardon the pun) video game with a lovestory tacked on for the girl crowd.<br/><br/>c) Titanic also succeeds because it taps into the female audience by presenting a VERY powerful and positive female archetype. Where most movies of this type (historical action) focus on male achievements and character growth (and the female is little more than a pretty plot-point) Titanic's Rose de Witt-Bukater IS the main character (along with, essentially, the ship itself) and Jack Dawson is her mythic savior-redeemer. This is something we rarely see in movies of this type - only perhaps Gone With The Wind's Scarlett O'Hara can provide something comparable. It empowers women and gives women what they want - the inspiration to strive for their dreams and a man who will help them achieve that.<br/><br/>This is becoming a Titanic review more than a Pearl Harbor review but I point these out because Pearl Harbor very obviously seeks to emulate the aesthetics and scale of Titanic but gets the method to the multi-million dollar madness of Titanic completely wrong. It is a lazy film for lazy viewers who want their brains handed to them on a plate. Its beauty is ONLY skin deep and there is nothing more to be learned once the credits roll. Which is a pity when one considers that it purports to honour the heroes who died on a tragic Sunday morning in December, which led to millions more deaths and untold suffering in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the world's first atomic attack. An event like that deserves more than to be reduced to a glorified music video or video game for the attention deficient. It's just sad that most people can't see how this film pisses into the hallowed waters over the sunken hulk of the USS Arizona."

Most people say that the love story was bad but it was pretty decent. Ben Afflect and Josh Hartnett plat two American pilots training for war then Affleck falls in Love with a nurse played by Kate Beckinsale the he volunteers to go to fight the war and is assumed to be dead, then Hartnett falls in love with her, after that Afflect comes to Hawaii and finds out what has happened.

He could have won WWII alone.<br/><br/>This is a case where they didn't want to pay enough actors to pull this thing off somewhat believably.

"thatsmrpigtoyou","3","1","2","3 October 2006"," Very Inaccurate
","Although it is a story about one of the most important events of the last 100 years, it is a movie full of inaccuracies. Yes, fighter pilots from the US were asked to help defend Britain. There were numerous instances of American pilots flying aircraft for other countries. They would not have to give up their citizenship, as previously stated by another commenter.<br/><br/>Watch the attack on Pearl Harbor very closely. You can tell that 90% of the ships used for filming were non-period ships. At least use CGI ships that are accurate. It seems that the director was obsessed with explosions as you can see the same ships repeatedly blown up. In reality, not every ship was hit. The Japanese were focused on destroying major US warships. The US carriers were to be hit but since none were present at Pearl on Dec. 7, the Japanese targeted the next best thing, the battleships. The ship Cuba Gooding Jr fires at the plane from is the U.S.S West Virginia. In the movie, moored next to his ship is a modern looking destroyer. Since the West Virginia was moored outside of the U.S.S Tennessee, there would be, presumably if we were looking towards the bow of the ship, no ship to that side of the West Virginia. Also, when he does shoot down a plane, it crashes into another battleship. Where did that come from, since the ship just a second ago was a destroyer, which wasn't even supposed to be there.. <br/><br/>Also, the P-40 Warhaks flown by the main characters are not correct. P-40s of the time had 2 machine guns on the nose of the plane and 4 in the wings. The P-40s in he movie had 6 guns in the wings, something that did not happen till later in the war.<br/><br/>On the carrier taking the B-25s to Japan, when they take off, you can see catapult lines on the flight deck. They were not used till later in the war. Also, the fact that Rafe and Danny are fighter , not bomber, pilots has no relevance. True they are different, but they had 4 or 5 months to learn how to fly a bomber. You would think with the enormous budget allocated to this movie, they could have been more accurate. They also needed to get rid of the love story. With it, it's just Titanic with airplanes and bombs. The only good thing is they represent the spirit and courage of the men fighting that day."

","I saw ""Pearl Harbor"" a couple of years ago. And today I saw that writer Randall Wallace earned 2 000 000 (!?!?) dollars for the script. What? Eh? Is Hollywood like this? Can you go to California, make a pathetic script, almost totally untrue even if it shall be based on a true story, and make this fat pile of cash out of it? If I'd say Pearl Harbor before this film existed, you'd probably think about the Japanese air force's air raid at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. But now ""Pearl Harbor"" is a 3 hours long movie, starring Ben Affleck as the main character. If I was a war widow from WW2, I'd require to have Randall Wallace shot by firing squad. Not only because he wrote a romantic, awful film with the title ""Pearl Harbor"", also because he made 2 000 000 dollars out of it. Why didn't they just skip all romantic rubbish this film has? It could have been a 10/10 without it! If I would be president, senator or perhaps congressman in USA, I'd do everything in my power to forbid the title ""Pearl Harbor"" and rename it to ""An untrue, pathetic love story during WW2"". When I saw it, I thought It would be like an interesting history lesson on screen. I was wrong! Go to a library or look for real sources on the Internet if you want to learn something.

","""Pearl Harbor"" employs a feeble and woeful attempt to duplicate the success formula of ""Titanic,"" relating a historic event through a fictional love story. It doesn't work this time.<br/><br/>Instead of showing the events leading up to and including the ""Day of Infamy,"" we are instead burdened with a tedious, dry, contrived, and totally irrelevant love triangle plot device. This painful and insulting attempt to cash in on the Rose & Jack story from ""Titanic"" is a poor focus for the film, and fails for the following three reasons (there are more, but it would make this review too long).<br/><br/>To begin with, the PH triangle characters do not serve as a link to the tragedy they witnessed, as Rose did. Her eyewitness account of the calamity provides an empathic link to the people who perished that horrible night in 1912. She makes them human and real, people we can care about. The three in PH provide no such connection nor insight, whatsoever. They appear to exist for nothing else than window dressing and schmaltz.<br/><br/>Second, the obvious absence of any chemistry between them is at times tediously boring, at other times excruciatingly irritating. The dialog is trite and utterly beyond belief. Never does it touch you emotionally in the slightest.<br/><br/>Finally, the story of the Japanese attack on Dec. 7, 1941 is best told as a documentary, because of the great amount of historic information it encompasses. Approaching it as a romantic drama focuses on the fictional story, rather than the actual history. It becomes a device to tweak tears and exploit them for box office dollar signs, rather than to give dignity to those that lost their lives that fateful day.<br/><br/>The depiction of the actual attack itself was the one sequence deserving a complement in this movie. Perhaps it works because it was the only time the actual event was addressed. Special effects, stunts, action, and story were well coordinated and utilized to precision. Scenes of futile escape/rescue attempts are eloquent, even frightening.<br/><br/>But then they boomerang right back to that pointless triangle, which either has you sleeping or yelling at the screen by this time. Tacked on to the story is an American retaliatory air-raid (which occurred much later), included for reasons only the writer and director know. <br/><br/>A much better movie depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor is the docu-drama ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" It clearly and concisely portrays the events leading up to and including the attack, told from the perspective of many witnesses, both American and Japanese. If you're interested in this event, rent that movie. Ignore the movie that offensively represents itself as ""Pearl Harbor."""

To start with Love stories with the backdrop of war are a Hollywood staple and somewhat of a cliché. A guy falling in love with his best friends girl when the friend 'dies' is also a movie cliché. The first movie they have 'remade' is From Here to Eternity, one of the best films of the war-romance genre and this love story is nowhere near as well made or acted as its more famous predecessor. The second film they tried to remake was Tora, Tora, Tora an excellent movie about the planning and execution of the attack. The third film is Thirty Seconds over Tokyo about the Doolittle raids, which features everything from two friends, to one of the friends dying in China and the other returning home to his pregnant wife. Not only is it a pitiful attempt at remake three excellent films but some of the scenes, especially the FDR scenes are totally pointless(Don't get me wrong I like Jon Voight but he was poorly used in this movie).<br/><br/>Some of the special effects are neat but that is about it, why can't Hollywood do more original stuff."

Add poor lighting (many scenes were so dark it made me wonder if lightbulbs were new inventions in the 1940s) speechifying (Roosevelt standing up) poor script with a ""duh"" romantic triangle and you have a bomb. Did anyone notice that the machine guns were replaced by painted broomsticks before the Doolittle Raid? Then, in the dark, one of the B-25's managed to shoot up a squad of Japanese soldiers without hitting their own men while traveling over 200mph--with broom sticks! The attack on Pearl Harbor was well done and some of the shots of the Japanese carriers were very accurate (yes the islands were on the left side of those carriers) except the one shot of a modern US carrier. Also, they portrayed actual Japanese aircraft for the most part instead of T-6 Texan trainers like every other WW2 movie uses for both German and Japanese aircraft.

Although, Cameron did a hell of a lot better job in Titanic.<br/><br/>Affleck is a great actor who always gets typecasts. He's always put in the wrong roles and this certainly is not helping him out. Josh Hartnett is also an underrated actor, but he is just so freakin' sloppy in this movie.<br/><br/>The attack scene on Pearl harbor, the 45 minutes of the movie that actually make the movie title somewhat make sense (I think they should have stuck with the original title, Tennasse or whatever) is one of the most poorly filmed war scenes I have ever seen. Smudging lenses to cover up blood to make sure of a PG-13 rating. It's just hack film making that Michael Bay is making so popular these days.<br/><br/>The bombing raids in the end, the crashing in china, this to me doesn't seem like ""Pearl Habor"".

Secondly, a vast majority of the audience for this concept is not interested in a complicated, sappy love triangle reminiscent of a tedious ""Titanic"", and are probably not compelled by much of the deliverance of the film for that reason; the audience is interested in a spectacular recreation in the notorious historical event: Pearl Harbor! We don't need some Hollywood-style romance, some ""buddy, don't steal my girl"" hokum, and most appallingly, blatant historical inaccuracy in our historical entertainment. This is about as tasteless and nauseating as film experiences come, with some impressive special effects to wield its disastrous execution.

Nonetheless, the final 2/3 of PEARL HARBOR redeems the picture. The love triangle is ultimately resolved somewhat plausibly, with the final scenes actually being rather touching.  While obvious liberties were taken with historical accounts for various reasons, the integrity of the film remains intact -- the attack scenes and the American response to Pearl Harbor is authentic in principle, as is the portrayal of FDR and his leadership.  The cinematography, including the action scenes, are outstanding and believable, as one would expect for the budget of this picture.  Finally, devoting the final hour of the film to the Doolittle raid is a rather satisfying resolution, as it allows the story to come something close to full circle.  PEARL HARBOR was rapped in part because of the subpar acting, and there the critics have a point -- Ben Affleck still can't act his way out of a paper bag, but he is fairly well-cast as the stoic, confident fighter pilot.  Alec Baldwin is a surprise as Jimmy Doolittle (a rather ironic casting given Baldwin's politics, but he is actually a highlight of the film).

","To me, ""Pearl Harbor"" is not a bowdlerization of the kind of WWI romance/action film that ""Thirty Seconds over Tokyo"" represents but instead is an homage to it. Both films begin in the east and describe their heroes efforts to learn to fly and work as a team in the air while watching their relationships and personalities develop. The stories then move west until reaching the Pacific where the action really begins. The characters in both survived incredible adventures and then emotionally reunite at the end.  The situations are credible in both and the acting is fine and strong.<br/><br/>There is a video-game quality to some of the action sequences in ""Pearl Harbor"" but the human suffering is not ignored or trivialized. (The same could be said for ""Titanic"", which is also a throwback to an earlier style of film-making that is much missed- I actually through ""Pearl Harbor"" superior to ""Titanic"", although I enjoyed both). Complaints that ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" are historically inaccurate in some details or fail to tell the whole story of the war are pointless. All films sacrifice historical accuracy for story-telling to some extent and no film could tell the entire story of WWII. ""The Guns of Navarone"" is hokum and it doesn't show the concentration camps but was it really necessary for it to do so? Of course not.

","Although the theme song from ""Pearl Harbor"" by the usually terrific Faith Hill is annoying sappy, it is by no means the WORST thing about this movie. That honor, unfortunately belongs to the embarrassingly trite main plot of friendship lost and reclaimed due to lover's triangle. That device was probably old hat by the time of ""Wings"" (1929). However, to cheapen one of the most fateful and sorry episodes in American military history, while at the same time whitewashing Roosevelt's treachery, does a disservice to those who died for political expediency. Worse, producer Jerry Bruckheimer has assembled a cast made up largely of nasty, partisan liberals to preach to us how terrible we were NOT to see the threat posed by the Axis powers. Today it is generally known (if not widespread knowledge) that Roosevelt goaded the Japanese into war. Recent evidence even indicates US forces likely struck first. However, since this is ENTERTAINMENT and, moreso, a ""human drama,"" let's focus on the real shortcomings of ""Pearl Harbor"". First, most of the film takes place in other locations, the ""sneak attack"" taking place in the middle third of the picture. The performances are fairly good, with the exception of John Voight, who plays President Roosevelt. John Voight looks and sounds like, well John Voight. He is utterly unconvincing, never more so than, in a possible flashback to ""Coming Home,"" Voight, as Roosevelt, stands up on polio-paralyzed legs in front of his war staff. According to all accounts, the incident never happened and, as portrayed, is cheap theatrics.<br/><br/>Most of ""Pearl Harbor"" plays in a manner fitting the theme song, overproduced and bombastic. However, all of the technical credits (cinematography, costuming, set decoration, special effects) are terrific. However, you would do better to see ""Tora! Tora!

Hopefully, once introduced to the concept of WWII as actual history, it might engage some to learn more.  There are many WWII films, made either during that time or contemporary that put this movie to shame, as if it shouldn't be ashamed of itself already for countless reasons, among which might be writing, directing, special effects, continuity, casting, acting and writhing PC, just to name a few. That is all that I have to say about ""Pearl Harbor"" (the movie)."
"odor007","1","1","2","3 May 2003"," POSSIBLY THE WORST ""FILM"" IN THE LAST CENTURY...
","This movie doesn't deserve my time or my thought (or anyone else's for that matter), yet I feel the need to save my fellow mankind from degrading trash like ""Pearl Harbor,"" so I'm simply going to write a to-the-point review.     First, the single positive element this film has going for it are the special effects. They were fantastic in the one scene of the film that they needed to be--the prolonged action scene.  Yet I must ask...because this movie is about such an integral and vital part of history, yet is so appallingly horrendous in its acting, directing, and story, aren't these great special effects a complete waste?  The film makes it abundantly clear that the makers of this movie care nothing about the significance of the events at Pearl Harbor, but solely about gaudy imagery and box-office dough.  If this is the case, and boy is it ever, these special effects aren't in the picture to capture the emotions of a certain time and place, but rather to keep the ignorant drones that make up the majority of American society content in their seats.  The special effects here serve offensive purposes and are utterly drowned in the midst of a plot (saying this movie has a plot is a massive compliment on my part) that is so terrible one can't even come to appreciate the effects. I can envision the makers of this film predicting that audiences would be bored after awhile, and the timing of the battle scene is precise in a way only Hollywood can be-- the effects aren't intended to be meaningful or historically accurate; they're just to try and keep us from storming out of the theater. Anyway, I'm not even going to go into the acting, story or directing...take my word for it, they were all awful.  A handful of clever camera shots and wide, colorful cinematography were an agreeable viewing experience, yet in the end merely flaunted the film's high budget.  The cute lil' threesome leads represent the future of terrible cornball cinema, and the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer combo was almost too much for my stomach to take.  Please, if you have a brain, don't bother renting this movie.  Maybe if you're writing a paper on the formula of bad films, then its ok, but otherwise, let this movie collect dust on the video store shelf.  I especially don't recommend this movie if you know more-than-average about history, or if you're Japanese.  The movie paints a lovely patriotic picture of the conniving Japanese, hell-bent on destruction on the first half...but then, later on, we get the famous ""woke a sleeping giant quote""....oh, isn't it cute?  The little Japanese, always filmed in robes sitting in a circle in some ancient outdoor meeting ground, have learned their lesson.  Uh....I'm afraid things didn't actually happen like this people.  Does anyone know what stereotypes are? This movie made America look like a wonderful combo of heroes and victims, and, although people think it captured history flawlessly, it neglected to mention that America went on to drop nuclear bombs on multiple Japanese cities, killing hundreds of times the amount of Americans killed during Pearl Harbor.  The movie dedicated itself to showing the events leading up to Pearl Harbor (with the nauseating parallel plot of a 1940's love triangle), and then drops history with America as the hero's.  I can't go on..."

Rafe, is offered to go to war, and he accepts. He tells his girlfriend, Evelyn, who is a war nurse, goodbye as he leaves. Now, Danny, along with his friends Billy, Red, and Anthony are transfered to Pearl Harbor for air training. The nurses also go along. Then, Danny finds out that Rafe has crashed his plane and tells Evelyn the bad news. <br/><br/>Three Months Later, Danny starts to fall for Evelyn. He takes her to see Pearl Harbor at sunset from the air. Then they end up hiding in the parachute hangar, and so on. Then a couple of days later, Danny and Evelyn find out that Rafe is alive. Rafe comes to visit Evelyn, but finds out that his best pal has taken his girl. The next day, December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack, sinking the USS Arizona first. Rafe, Danny, Red, Anthony, Gooz, and Joe go to Earl's airfield and lay off some cover fire with the .50 Caliber. Rafe, Danny, and Joe go to the last planes that are ""good to go"", and Joe doesn't make it off the runway. Rafe and Danny fly into the air and play a game of chicken with the planes, making the Japanese accidentily crash. After the attack, Col. Doolittle, one of Rafe's previous superiors, offers Rafe, Danny, Red, Gooz, and Anthony to be a part of his group, The Doolittle Raid, which is to invade Japan. <br/><br/>The most under rated movie of 2001. People hate this movie mostly because it is based on Pearl Harbor. I actually like the movie. I was surprised that this was PG-13 because of a lot of violence, and language.<br/><br/>
The acting was good. Ben Affleck was okay, but Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale gave solid performances, as did Cuba Gooding Jr., Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, and Tom Sizemore. Most of the supporting cast was good also. There are also bits of humor scenes delivered by Michael Shannon and Tom Sizemore, like when Gooz says that women ""cloud the mind"" or when he says that he has a girlfriend and no one responds for 10 seconds.<br/><br/>
People might hate me, but I thought that this movie was really good. It is filled with Action, Dramatic moments, and some romantic scenes. I recommend Pearl Harbor by all means, but I also recommend other War movies even more.<br/><br/>
3 out of 4. My IMDB Rating: 7.2/10."
"someinfo","Null","1","2","3 April 2003"," Good Epic & Romantic Film with Plenty of Action
","Good film at 3 hours duration. Like any film of similar length that intends to keep audience attention, there are slow parts and fast parts. There's drama, and there's action. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines romantic as ""marked by the imaginative or emotional appeal of what is heroic, adventurous, remote, mysterious, or idealized."" That makes this a romantic film. <br/><br/>Both drama and action are well spaced. The action is often fast with quick camera angle changes and short closeups, along with camera movement that adds to the live-action effect, giving a feeling of being there. The drama has plenty of conflicts which enhance the human element. The emotions soar and dive, and not all goes as one would like, much like life, but the human spirit survives to the end. <br/><br/>This is a film for entertainment and I've made no effort to confirm or refute the historical accuracy of any part of it. As all historical films, we know the eventual outcome of it's subject before the screening. However, this film is only a slice of the whole story and the method of telling this slice, the choices in subplots, characters, character players, direction and camera work, make it well worth the time invested in the viewing. This is a very good film."

","Although the film showed a sentimental story of love triangle I see it more as valuable for the scenes related to the attack of Japan in Pearl Harbor and the events previous to it than for the sentimental story of those young persons. Pearl Harbor was a criminal act where the Japanese used all strategic weapons including the surprise factor. This is well shown in the film as well as the way the Japanese prepared and accomplished this aggression. Another aspects touched were that US hesitated to enter into the war while the allies like UK were already fighting against German nazis, that some experts in US were even able to guess the aggression of Pearl Harbor but not considered possible, the way president Roosevelt reacted to the aggression and the way he compelled his army to respond. From this point of view the film is highly valuable while the sentimental story is perhaps much better than the one shown in ""From here to eternity""."

","***Contains minor spoilers***<br/><br/>The movie tries too hard to be like ""Titanic"" and uses all the ingredients that are used in ""Titanic"" but ""Pearl Harbor"" fails...<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is that the film makers can't seem to decide what for a movie they wanted to make: A spectacular one or a realistic one, with as a result that the realistic/shocking scene's in the movie just don't work in the way they should.<br/><br/>The actors only seems to have been cast because of their looks instead of their acting skills. Especially the nurses look unrealistic beautiful complete with make-up and hair style.<br/><br/>And then the love story...well what can I say, the love story just doesn't work for me and is over the top at some points ***SPOILER***for instance when Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) finds out she is pregnant, that just seemed so over the top and out of place that I almost stopped watching the movie at that point***SPOILER*** You can say that the love story kind of ruins the movie at some points.<br/><br/>The character are not interesting enough due to poor character development and I wondered lot's of times throughout the movie: ""Why are we following this characters ??? What makes them so interesting to follow ???""<br/><br/>In my opinion the movie should have focused more on the political aspects of Pearl Harbor and the leaders, like Roosevelt (Jon Voight) and the attack itself instead of Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and their friendship and problems.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character. The character is just pointless and it's only distracting and seem so out of place. The only reason I can think of why they had put them in the movie is because it's a political correct character to put in a movie.<br/><br/>One more thing before I'll mention the things I liked about the movie. The movie makes an huge mistake to not stop after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie goes on and follows the Doolittle raid on Japan. This is absolutely pointless and I think that an alternate ending should had been made.<br/><br/>The things I liked: First of all, I thought all the Roosevelt (Jon Voight) scene's were fantastic. Secondly Alec Baldwin played in my opinion a great role as Lt. Colonel James 'Jimmy' Doolittle.<br/><br/>Some more things that I liked are: The camera work (although it was VERY over the top), the editing (the movie has a good quick pace), the music by Hans Zimmer and the attack on Pearl Harbor itself was made beautifully.<br/><br/>I don't mean to bash the movie too hard, but it just isn't good enough. If you want to see a good spectacular/realistic war movie you should watch ""Black Hawk Down"" instead and if you want to see a good realistic war movie you should watch ""Saving Private Ryan"". Only watch this movie for the special effects and when you have nothing else to do, you might even like it (I know that some people just love this movie).<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Everyone that I knew said that this movie ""blew big time"" and that I shouldn't see it. The funny thing was, no one person had the same reason for hating it! One said that it was inacurate, one said that it was long and boring and the other said that the love sucked! Yes, I will be honest, there were a few times when it got a little slow, but I still thought that it was a good movie! I know that many people hated the love story, but I think that it was needed. Yes it was overdone, but you can't make a movie just on a battle. Every movie needs some story and some characters to relate to.   Now to get to the good stuff, the battle! I am not glorifying this attack. I just think that it was good for this movie to be made. This is an important part of ou history and we should learn about it. The battle scene was intense. I personally think that it was very realistic. I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the movie. For the people who say that the scene was too long! That is what a battle is like! Battles can go on for hours! This made the movie that much more realistic. To me, a movie is good if it moves me. The battle moved me. I was shocked at dismayed to see how horrible the attack actually was. Textbooks are nothing compared to this!<br/><br/>     All in all, the acting was pretty good, the story was good and the action scenes were very well done! Another thing that I liked was the ominous ""Jaws"" tone about the Japanese. You knew that they would come, but you didn't know exactly when. Please don't listen to my friends or the people who hate the movie. Many of them are immature for the love scenes and have very low attention spands. This includes my friends. Their movies have to have constant explosions and be no longer than 100 minutes long. Yes, I like those movies too, but they are not the only ones that I watch. To sum it up. Go see this movie! I really think that you will like it. It shows a very important part of out history and it entertains us all in 3 hours. What more could you ask for. 9.5/10 Great!"

","I have to say that I loved this film, despite knowing that it's not entirely accurate and is centred round a love-triangle. Yes, it could have been better and it didn't need the love story, but give the film a break! It was well-made with superb special effects. I think one of the reasons people vote this film down is because they went to watch it expecting it to be bad and predictable, in other words, a remake of Titanic - typical romance involving a girl that two guys want. And I'm not dissing Titanic here either - I loved that film even more so than Pearl Harbor. I'm almost certain that if this film had been released as the first of its kind - modern epic of tragic historic event with love triangle and very attractive actors - it would have made just as much as Titanic did. What went wrong with Pearl Harbor was the way it was hyped about - most expensive movie ever made, etc etc. People thought 'oh yeah, been there done that' because they'd seen Titanic. And it did bear many similarities to Titanic but that does NOT make it a bad film. And I wish people would lay off the Americans. OK, so it's the biggest, richest and best (in my opinion) country in the world - so what? Any other country would act the same if it was them. I hasten to add here that I'm English and live in England, just to clarify that I'm not American and therefore not biased. Maybe some of the dialogue was cheesy but that was the DIALOGUE, not the pro-Americanism. Surely anyone - in any country - is going to act patriotic in the middle of being attacked by another country! It's a natural reaction. You can hardly imagine the characters standing there saying 'well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt - there's a reason for this' can you?! Maybe there is a reason but when you're in the middle of something like that surrounded by death and destruction, your instinct is to protect people and defend your country. So lay off the Americans everyone! The place rules - get used to it! In my opinion, Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece with a very touching love story. The people who went in there expecting it to be rubbish came out thinking it was rubbish, not wanting to admit their expectations had been wrong. It's NOT Titanic everyone - just go watch it and appreciate it for what it is, don't just compare it to every other epic that's ever been made."

The film is an abomination; it relies on a trite, if sweeping, score and a wealth of explosions to give it the feel of an epic, but its tired dialogue and minimally detailed script keep it far from that pantheon.  Also, it's packed with historical inaccuracies, so many that I felt an apology to all who were actually stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack might well be due. As for the actors themselves, nearly every performance was a disappointment, particularly Ben Affleck's.  From his work with directors like Gus Van Sant and Kevin Smith, we have seen that he is capable of bringing to the screen characters that are both complex and compelling, but that seems not to be his interest in ""Pearl Harbor"".  There is a hint of chemistry with costar Josh Hartnett that might have been developed and made the film more compelling, but, as presented, it is execrable."

The title of this movie was a total misnomer, because the actual attack only took 45 minutes of the film, which was the best part of the film.

During the film I saw 4 Japanese-looking people walk out (and I didn't notice them return) so make your own mind up about that. I have to say that this film is probably the worst I have ever seen. I would have been laughing throughout if I wasn't offended so much by the portrayal of the RAF as defeatists (""If all Americans are like you, God bless America""!!) and the low expectation of my intelligence.  All 4 of us in the cinema were literally doubled-over laughing at the film's unbelievable attempt to draw a happy ending from the real-life events. Where do I start? The president's attempt to get to his feet to give a rousing speech, the predictable love triangle saga (my girlfriend whispered the final line to me 10 minutes before the end) and most astonishing of all; the portrayal of the retaliatory attack on Tokyo as being a success!!  A dozen under-fuelled planes barely reach the mainland, yet alone Tokyo, and are gunned-down quite easily. How can this have struck fear into Japanese' hearts?! I caught myself literally mouth agape at such arrogance.<br/><br/>The film is the ideal example of the worst of Hollywood, where x millions are spent on the twisting of real-life events for the affirmation that God indeed blesses America. eg. Independence Day (they must have been so proud to see the president take on the aliens) and U5471 (it was the ENGLISH who cracked the Enigma code. While we are happy to let the Americans take a lot of credit for the war; after all Europe needed them; to take liberties with the known facts is a disgrace to the people involved and just about sums up this film as well)<br/><br/>The bottom line is that I heartily recommend this film!

","This film was not just a sappy love story which used a handful of battle scenes to promote itself as a war movie, it was also an insult to those who actually fought in the battle and a wasted opportunity to teach their grandchildren about a turning point in our history. 80% of the film involves a predictable love triangle set as a period piece, the remaining 20% consists of a dumbed-down history lesson and implausible action sequences. Some have commented that the battle scenes were good, I totally disagree. The dogfights look like something from a science fiction film and a number of ridiculous inaccuracies ruin the film for anyone who knows a thing about the battle or the weapons of the era. For example they have our Hero (Ben Afflek) dodging and outrunning swarms of zeros in a P-40 Warhawk.

To give it zero stars, I am suggesting that it is worthy of being even considered or watched, and I refuse to rate this film on the level of a ""movie"". It is betraying to a nation. <br/><br/>My heart and prayers go out to the loved ones of those killed in Washington and New York today."
"Jonnyok98ub","1","1","2","27 May 2001"," Worst Movie Ever
","Like the oh so popular Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons, will comment on this movie= Worst Movie Ever!  Please, PLEASE don't read any of the positive reviews and think that there is anything worth while in this movie.  There has been no greater tragedy in American History then this abomination of a film that Super Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and MTV lackey Michael Bay brought us.  The Rock, Top Gun and Armeggedon, all of which Mr. Bruckheimer was responsible for are fun, flashy films that have neat characters and very little plot.  Good guys are put through tough times, they win, everyone is happy!  Yay!  <br/><br/>Now lets take a look at Pearl Harbor.  This movie breaks up like this: A sleazy 90 minute love triangle which has no value, and makes Titanic look like Shakespeare in Love.  Next, we have a fairly inaccurate account of the Pearl Harbor bombing, fresh with some fiction thrown in to make our leads look heroic.  The bombing sequence is very neatly shown on film, but its not a fun experience to watch tons of American men get slaughtered by the ""Evil Japanese"".  (In reality, Admiral Yamamoto had sent word of the attack thirty minutes prior to the Japanese planes arrival over the base.  The film never touches on the fact that the Japanese Samurai Code, which was still strictly enforced, does not allow you to attack a ""sleeping foe"", instead, it makes you at least wake them up and get their sword before you can fight them.  It would have been a nice touch to try and paint both sides as human, as many of the Japanese Pilots later felt that they had dishonered their empire by killing sleeping sailors).  Then, after we are forced to watch people being blown up (and its not like Thin Red Line or Saving Private Ryan, all its in the film for is to accentuate Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett's hero status), the third act of the film begins.  We are now treated to a lead up of the April 19th Tokyo Raid by James Doolittle.  We are forced to stay an hour too long in the movie as the heroes valiantly bomb Tokyo (which in reality did nothing for the war effort) and then fight it out over China.  Then, just when you think you can leave, Kate Beckinsale gives a narration telling us that after the Doolittle Raid, we had struck fear into the Japanese and we would go on to win the war from that point.  Last time I checked my history books, after Doolittle's raid, they sent their entire Carrier Fleet at us towards Midway, and we destroyed their Navy their!  Plus, all those men who fought on Pelilieu and Okinawa and Burma and Gaudal, nope, they did nothing Mr. Bay and Bruckheimer.  Its almost as if they realized that no one would understand what they had just seen, so they had to make sure we thought it was important.<br/><br/>This film is truly terrible, in the fact that it fails at making a love story seem okay, it fails to shed any importance on Pearl Harbor, and it fails to even conclude itself well.  I felt sick to my stomach knowing that this would be what teenagers and younger people have to learn about World War II from, and that undoubtedly, this film will be a money making juggernaut.  Rent Tora! Tora! Tora!, Midway, and a Thin Red Line if you want to see some modern films on the Pacific.  Or you can check out a little film called From Here to Eternity.  Either way, don't see this film!<br/><br/>PLEASE!"
"jennifer-99","8","1","2","3 September 2001"," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I went into this movie with low expectations as to how much I would enjoy it. I'm not a war buff, or an American, and my knowledge of the factual events behind this story is pretty limited. Not to mention the fact that I am not normally a fan of Bruckheimer's overhyped action pics that are usually loaded with big budget effects and a low budget screenplay.<br/><br/>
Imagine my surprise when three plus hours flew by and I found myself walking out of the theatre having thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>
The character development, while not flawless, was well done. As a viewer, you grow to care, not only about the three leads, but about several supporting characters as well. Admittedly, I cared enough about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn to shed a few tears during the emotional climax scenes.<br/><br/>
The comparisons to Saving Private Ryan are inevitable. However it is impossible to fairly compare this movie to the Academy Award winning spectacle that was Saving Private Ryan. Pearl Harbour never pretended to be anything more than a big budget summer blockbuster film - this much is evident from any of the trailers that were being shown before its theatrical release. Saving Private Ryan was a film steeped in realism. It was a graphic recreation of the horrors of D-Day on the beaches and a piece of cinematic genius (even though it doesn't rank on my list of favourite films).<br/><br/>
To compare these 2 films is to compare apples and oranges. Perhaps a more adequate comparison would be to liken it to another tale of love and romance set against the backdrop of a historical tragedy - Titanic. While the film falls drastically short of the mark here too, it is far more similar to this film than to the aforementioned SPR. Anyone who went in to this movie expecting to see the events of the attack on Pearl Harbour with a Saving Private Ryan edge, was bound to be heartily disappointed.<br/><br/>
Taken on its own merits, Pearl Harbour stands up quite nicely. It adequately represents and recreates the events surrounding December 7, 1941 while giving the movie a greater range to allow it to appeal to a wider audience by adding the fictional story of friendship, love, betrayal and heartbreak. Granted it is flawed, and it is served with a large helping of Hollywood ""cheese"", but when was the last time a perfect picture made it to the big screen? They are few and far between. <br/><br/>Check your history books at the door and go in expecting to be entertained by this 3 hour saga. To that end, Pearl Harbour succeeds. It is a thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster that should have something to appeal to everyone."
"lorne_jbr","8","1","2","31 July 2001"," Very pleasantly surprised!
","From all the negative reviews about this film, I was expecting to be disappointed, although I am a history buff. The first half of the movie, as reported, was a love story, but a very interesting one in my humble opinion. Only one complaint though. Were there no plain nurses at Pearl Harbor? The special effects in the action scenes were very well done. I found myself bouncing around in my seat, trying to avoid the bullets. I also anticipated the movie ending after the Hawaii attack and found the sortee to Japan, an enjoyable bonus, rather than an unnecessary extension of the movie, as some others insisted. I also thought Jon Voigt did an excellent job as Roosevelt. This is a movie that I would quickly recommend. I really can't understand all the criticism....."

","Disney sure blew it with this mess of a movie. Here I was hoping for another ""Saving Private Ryan"", but what I got was a brainless stupid plot, a corny insipid love story, and cliche after cliche followed by banal dialogue. What a BORE!<br/><br/>As for History, it was almost as bad. Sure the battle scenes were good with their nice digital FX, but they were only about ten minutes of the movie, not ""forty minutes"" as Disney claimed.<br/><br/>The rest of the History was a pro-Japanese whitewash. There was no mention of Japanese atrocities, war crimes, and aggression in Asia and especially in China. No mention by Disney of Japanese militarism and plans for expansion. This stupid movie didn't even tell us why the Americans cut off Japan's oil supply (their aggression), nor did the film mention that Japan and Nazi Germany were allies!!<br/><br/>Obviously, Disney aimed this movie at teeny boppers (the corny love story) and whitewashed Japanese abominations and crimes to keep ticket sales up in Japan.<br/><br/>I wouldn't even rent this on DVD again. It stunk."
"Anonymous_Maxine","6","1","2","17 July 2001"," This is just about what I expected.
","Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay are back from Armageddon fame to once again present to us another tremendous disaster story interspersed with some elaborate and manipulative romance. The film mainly follows the lives of two life long friends, Rafe and Danny, as they grow up obviously meant to be fighter pilots, and the struggles with their friendship brought on by World War II. At least half of the film is made up of this drawn out love story, while the other half covers the Japanese invasion and bombing of Pearl Harbor. This is the reason the movie is so damn long, too. If they had left out this dumbass romance, or at least not drawn it out so much, we would have had a war movie of normal length that would have been much better. The editing between the love story and the actual war coverage is surprisingly awkward and abrupt, initially leaving us with the feeling that we are watching two completely separate movies that were edited together.<br/><br/>
The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor is spectacularly done, I have to admit that. The Japanese were obviously made to look much more evil than they were, because this is told from the American point of view, but the special effects and the torpedoes and the entire battle scene at Pearl Harbor was amazing. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a tiny tiny role as the black man who is not allowed to do anything more than cook during his entire time in the Navy, and who ultimately is able to man a gun during the battle and make a difference. This is a noticeable digression in the same vein as the over-simplified African American presence seen in Mel Gibson's The Patriot. It makes you think that Pearl Harbor was made by a bunch of rich white guys who, at the last minute, decided that they better put a black guy in the movie so they wouldn't get in trouble with the NAACP. Nonetheless, Cuba pulled off his overly small role very well, despite the fact that he was only given enough screen time to shoot down one Japanese plane, and that plane almost flew right into him as it crashed.<br/><br/>As with any Bruckheimer film, especially The Rock or Armageddon, with which he also collaborated with director Michael Bay, the entire humanistic portion of the film was shallow and predictable. We get three main cardboard characters, Rafe, Danny, and Evelyn, and a relationship between the three that is entirely predictable. Nonetheless, some people may pretend not to know that, so here is the obligatory warning Â– SPOILERS AHEAD. Rafe supposedly gets killed in combat (he would never have survived a crash-landing into the water like that, but this is Bruckheimer, so we know he didn't really die), and of course, Danny moves in on his girl. Did anyone really think that Ben Affleck would be killed that early in the film? So Danny goes for Evelyn with the ridiculous support of all of Rafe's friends (this is another thing that would never have happened in real life), and then when everything seems to be going okay, Rafe comes back and everything gets mixed up again. Yawn. As the all-seeing audience, we know that Danny had no right to move in on his friend's girlfriend so soon after his theoretical death, so this is the point when we begin to suspect that Danny will be the one to ultimately be killed in combat, and in true Bruckheimer form, it will probably be in a heroic effort to save Rafe's life. And guess what. <br/><br/>There are obvious references to the story structure of Titanic here as well as some scenes that are photographed and composed exactly like some of the battle scenes from Saving Private Ryan, but the film is obviously just trying to cash in on the success of those films. On a quality level, Pearl Harbor and Titanic are about the same, but neither even come close to the tremendous power of a real war film like Saving Private Ryan. I found myself several times thinking of Saving Private Ryan while I was watching Pearl Harbor, and the two movies are so different in their intentions (Saving Private Ryan showed us the war, while Pearl Harbor tried to make us cry by showing how a few people were affected by the war) that it almost seemed like I was watching a cartoon. This is why Pearl Harbor will never be considered a classic war film and will not be considered for an Oscar nod in any category.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer and Bay make movies that are meant to please large audiences by entertaining them without making them think. This is why their movies are such box office hits but also such critical failures. There are always a lot of people who don't see how shallow these films are. For the most part, the action sequences are fast paced and actually pretty good, but they are NEVER realistic, which is probably one of the main reasons that a war film, made by these manipulative Hollywood bigshots, about such a closely scrutinized historical event just didn't come out right. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was obviously the best scene in the film, but was not realistic at all. It was, in fact, about as realistic as a fight scene in a Jet Li movie or a Jackie Chan movie. Fun to watch, but once you walk out of the theater and back into reality, you want to laugh. It's a shame that this scene in Pearl Harbor was padded with two and a half hours of fluff, because it could have been a significant part of a good war film. What a waste."
"Felix_00","9","1","2","14 July 2001"," A stunning combination of Top Gun and Titanic
","Indeed it is one of the most amazing movies i have seen, it has a very profound atmosphere where the viewers are actually seeing things through the eyes of the many people who died during the battle... It also gives us an understanding of how it is like to be under a threat of a single nation.... The story that was written by Randall Wallace is amazing, knowing the fact that it is not an easy task, I think Randall Wallace has made a great success ever since he wrote the story of Braveheart. Other than that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made an excellent team in making this movie a huge success. I was surprised to see the user rating so low, I don't know why some people did not find it that good. Furthermore I like to say that, the movie had a great combination between Titanic and Top Gun, this resembles the ships sinking and the soldiers drowning. The Top Gun resemblence is revealed by the planes and the atmosphere of air battles."

","Pearl Harbor is a really good film in its own way. Why all the bad critics in news papers in Norway??. I can't really understand the motives. On a scale from 1-6, it deserves 5 points (9.0 here on IMDB) Why 9,0: The three hours length of the movie is not to long. Its exiting all the way out, the love story fits amazingly perfect into the film, and it's war at full price. Though it's in the big Hollywood way. Sometimes it's a little bit to much, sometimes it's hard to imagine that it was like that it went on under 2.world war, but it's Hollywood, and what do you expect? I think it's done in a real big way...

"Iggy79","5","1","2","16 June 2001"," Too long.
","What an extremely long movie. I agree with some of the comments that this movie could definitely have been shortened. I really enjoyed the last two hours. The action scenes were terrific and intensive. I could imagine myself in these scenes of destruction, completely at the hands of God- whether you survived or not was mostly to do with luck. The first hour however was unneccesary. The film has to constantly switch between the romance story to the war story. The love story was very sentimental and corny. Surely, this could have been developed alot more quickly. But overall, I found the movie thought provoking and I left the cinema feeling as though I had learnt something about the war."

","I would like to write a short review from a Germans point of view. First of all I would like to say: "" I like this movie !"". The reason for that is very easy to explain. Pearl Harbour gives us in Europe informations on World War II in the US. That's why I choose the Headline ""A good history lesson"". Everything I learned in school in Germany is about what happened in Europe and how cruel it has been for all the people. We never learned something about the activities in the US. We know that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour in a very perfidious way, but that was it. It was very easy to follow the story and the 2nd part of the story the relationship between Rafe, Danny and Evelyn the destinies linked to them entertains the people on the one side and shows them how cruel and uncertain this time must be for the people all over the world.<br/><br/>All in all It was a fantastic movie which entertains me and taught me very well."
"Wryly","9","1","2","11 June 2001"," Does exactly what it says on the tin!
","Now the film may not be a pearl, but its certainly not as bad as anyone you know may have said.  Pearl Harbor does exactly what it promises and lives up to its potential as a blockbuster.  The action is of course spectacular and the characters likeable, even if a few are somewhat under used, the script itself though is just adequate padding setting up the situations into which the characters are placed.  It is as expected the script which makes the picture's edges look just a little frayed.  The convoluted love story is a little over the top and unnecessarily complex but all the other situations are handled well enough.  The cheesy lines are few and far between, which was unexpected, and there is surprisingly little jingoistic fervour which comes as a refreshing change to a non-American, even the Japanese are portrayed as human beings.  It is in this area which the film rises above the potential pratfalls it faced, elevating it too good film status.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it was a lot better than I was expecting and it is this that may be the key to the enjoyment of the film, don't expect too much and just enjoy a film that does exactly what it sets out to do. Entertain you!"

Some might say that the love story set-up drags for the first hour, but a 60 minute extravaganza of destruction makes up for it. Forget Independence Day, this is real! The final segment of the film tells us about America's retaliatory efforts and paves the way for the obligatory bittersweet weepy ending complete with wailing soundtrack by Faith Hill.

There is so very much wrong with this ""summer blockbuster"" that it is difficult to find a place to begin. First, the love story, as lots of people pointed out, was so contrived it was almost embarassing. And how about our lovable stutterer that 'we can all laugh at'? Uh, I didn't find that funny at all, and I imagine one who has struggled with stuttering as a disability didn't either. How about FDR and his standing up from his wheelchair to illustrate the strength of the American people? Textbook Hollywood cheese....And Alec Baldwin as Doolittle? Are there any other fellow fans of SNL out there that had trouble sitting through Alec Baldwin play this goofy role with a straight face?! I felt like I was watching Frank Drebbin in the Naked Gun...<br/><br/>However the most disturbing aspect of this entire film, by far, was the sad and skewed ""USA is #1!!"" message throughout....Notice the ominous music used when the evil Japanese are shown onscreen...Or maybe the fact that the whole point of Pearl Harbor was that it was an attack sustained by the USA, and the USA, well, was defeated in it....but no, no, we can't portray the USA as NOT being #1, so we will follow our boy heroes as they shoot down a couple of planes during the attack to end the bombing sequence. Wow, it's like we weren't REALLY defeated! I mean look, our lovable Rafe and Danny survived and got 'em back in the skies! ....and even better, we of course can't possibly end this film on a USA is NOT #1 note (i.e., finishing it at the end of the attack), so we have to add in the Dolittle Tokyo bombing--aka, USA as the underdogs, with only a few planes, fighting the big bad Japanese empire and succeeding in one small way....Why don't we get a BIT more honest here and show the REAL revenge for Pearl Harbor, with the massive destruction and loss of 100,000 lives (as opposed to 7,000) in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Why? Uh oh, because then the USA would be portrayed as being the REALLY bad guys, having desimated cities and killed 10 times the number of people. Remember, the USA is #1 and can do no wrong!<br/><br/>And if the you didn't manage to pick up on some of this propaganda, or it was all too subtle for you, it is all pretty much summed up in the little narration about how great and strong America is, at the end of this movie....I felt like I was sitting through Independence Day all over again, where America saved the world from an alien invasion!

","Why there are so many bad reviews for this movie is absoloutely baffling. What I have just got back from watching was an incredibly tender, poignant and brilliantly acted film.  I simply can't comprehend the critics.  Were we watching completely different movies?  Was the UK release dramatically different from the US?  I doubt it very much.  So why do people refuse to give this movie the respect it deserves?<br/><br/>So what if a few liberties were taken with the actual facts of Pearl Harbor? That's the movie world for you.  They're not out to educate people on the finer points of war; if you want that, take a History degree.  The film was made to entertain, to inform to a certain point, and to commemorate those who died during this awful tragedy, and on those three levels it scores highly.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor may not rank up there with the classics, even though it would be a lie to say that it doesn't want to.  It has it's flaws; the dialogue is incredibly corny throughout, Ewan Bremmner's pilot with a stutter is in bad taste, and the three main characters aren't really given enough material to develop on.  <br/><br/>But if you can look past that, and look into the beautiful love story unfolding with a war horror story, you'll see something truely magical.  The three leads are all perfectly cast; Kate Beckinsale is both beautiful and believeable as the woman at the centre of the love triangle, with best friends Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett competing for her love.<br/><br/>Likewise, Ben Affleck gives another great performance as the headstrong, loyal Rafe.  He's got both the looks and the acting ability to propell him into A-list status that he's long deserved.<br/><br/>But the real find here is Josh Hartnett.  Heart-stoppingly beautiful, and an amazing actor, especially considering his age and past film history, he really captures the emotion as sensitive Danny.  <br/><br/>Pearl Harbor deserves much more praise than it's getting.  If you think about all the hard work and effort that's gone into it, there's no excuse for not giving it a mark at least over six.  It was never going to live up to the hype the media created for it, and there was bound to be a backlash as soon as it was released.  But if people for once ignore the critics and skeptics, and go to see this with the same expectations you'd go to see a less-hyped film, I garuntee you won't be disappointed."

Living in Hawaii, I have been fortunate enough to meet some of these veterans and hear their stories at the Arizona Memorial. My only question after viewing this film is, ""Why no dedication to the sailors, soldiers, and nurses who fought, died and survived this battle?""

Childhood pals grow up in some Perfect Little America, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett).Ben Affleck goes off to England to fight the Nazis... he's shot down (predictably) presumed dead (you know he isn't really)& his best friend ""comforts"" his now emotionally stranded girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale). Yawn, yawn yawn....can't you tell what's going to happen next? Broderrick returns... Zzzz Zzzz Zzzz... the friends fall out & everything that follows is played out to the tune of falling bombs, waving flags & running to battle stations while showing your muscles & good looks....Zzzzz Zzzz Zzzz.<br/><br/>By the time the battle sequences started I was already beyond caring & could hardly keep my eyes open, but the caffeine in the coke I was drinking helped. I perked up a little when the bombs started falling, but this soon faded. The CGI aircraft, bombs, ships & explosions looked cheap & nasty & the little plot line that remained between the characters was continually tiresome, irritating & pathetically predictable.<br/><br/>In the end I couldn't wait to get out & I regret having wasted time & money on such tripe. I don't often find so little positive to say about a movie, but this one takes the prize, beaten only by the indescribably awful ""Smokers"". The one & only bright spot in all this gloom is John Voight as President Roosevelt, but even this performance is overshadowed by the sheer boredom involved in getting so far & all that follows.<br/><br/>Why Hollywood continues down the same old ludicrously dreadful lines I'll never know. One explanation I have heard is that people there are so afraid of making a decision that when Hollwyood executives get married they take 15 years to decide where to go on honeymoon. No one wants to decide, because if things go wrong they'll get the blame. The result is stagnation & this film reeks of it. Let's face it, if anyone has seen the equally 'by-the-numbers' tripe ""Titanic"" then you've seen this version of Pearl Harbor. For the Japanese air attack read the iceberg, for Pearl Harbor read the Titanic. It's just another bucket load of the same, old same-old wrapped up in a different cover.<br/><br/>Don't go anywhere near this film, stick to the infinitely superior ""Tora Tora Tora"", which, despite it's age, is the definitive work on this piece of history.<br/><br/>Hopefully Hollywood will learn from this mistake, but I doubt it."

","Historical inaccuracy is unnecessary in a story like this.  There were true heros in abundance.  Two US Army Air Force flyers did shoot down seven aircraft during the battle over Pearl Harbour and their names were Welch and Taylor.  The former survived the war only to die as a test pilot for North American aircraft in the development of the F-100 Supersabre.  They were true heros - the only ones to get to their aircraft on that Sunday morning and to successfully join the fray in the air.  Yet their characters are trampled by the differently named heros of the film.  On a second matter, it was good to see some representation of the Doolittle Raid, but other than Doolittle himself, there is no recognition for the truly brave men who participated."

"Kevin At The Movies","Null","1","2","27 February 2002"," Nothing less than a masterpiece!
","Contains Spoilers Pearl Harbor is easily one of the most critically slammed movies of the decade. By being battered back and forth like a tennis ball by the critics, it has suffered a box office below expectations. However, I knew this would happen a year before it's release. ""Why?"" I hear you ask, well for the following reasons.<br/><br/>· It was hailed as the next Titanic (a film critics had to praise only to stay in touch with the public). With the fact that they could have a second chance of slating a film, they couldn't resist. · It was directed by a former music video director. · It was produced and directed by a team known for 'dumbed down action films'. · It was released too soon after Titanic.<br/><br/>They are just four measly reasons why it was slammed, and with a soppy synopsis like this, it just seemed like a Titanic rip-off.<br/><br/>Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are best friends who have grown up together in Tennessee and with World War II going on in Europe, they train to be fighter pilots. When Rafe falls in love with Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), things look good between them but Rafe is assigned to go to war in Britain, only to be shot down and presumed dead. Meanwhile, Danny and Evelyn have been assigned at Pearl Harbor in the Pacific. They soon fall in love together (not again!) but only for Rafe to return from the dead. Just as things heat up between the three, the Japanesse launch their horrfic surprise attack on Pearl Harbor!<br/><br/>As you can guess, this is not brain surgery, it's just pure entertainment, nothing else. Directed by Michael Bay, this is cinema at it's best with outstanding battle scenes and geniune emotion. Is it as historically incorrect as critics and historians have said? Well, yes actually it is, but it doesn't matter because your not going to learn anything about history anyway apart from the fact that it was Japan who bombed Pearl Harbor. Was the incredibly boring Saving Private Ryan historically correct? Uh, no, so why did it win Oscars? Oh, of course, because Mr Spielberg directed it.<br/><br/>Basically, Pearl Harbor has been criticised only for what it is, not for what it's like. It's an American flag-waving popcorn movie and critics hate these type of films, and seeing it's produced the critic's worst nightmare and the public's entertainer, Jerry Bruckheimer, that's not going to help the star ratings. This however, is going to be a 100% honest and unbiased film review.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has made an excellent three hour long epic with true emotion, breath taking action sequences, tremendous performances, as well with a bit of clunky dialogue. Each shot Bay films is beautifully done with true meaning and wonderful cinematography.  Honestly, Pearl Harbor has got to be the best cinematography I have ever seen and it's a disgrace why John Schwartzman wasn't even given an Oscar nomination. Maybe there is one sunset too many but does it really matter? Bay has put a lot of thought into his scenes and shots. For example, when the 'Pearl Harbor' title comes up, it appears in front of a sunset- the Japanesse flag. It's a very simple idea but it's a genious one too. Also, during the build up to the attack, there is a non-diegetic heartbeat sound. The audience notice this without realising it and it keeps the andrenalin and anticipation rushing. The script by Randall Wallace (Braveheart) isn't exactly the greatest ever written and some of the dialogue is awful, ""We make refrigerators while our enemies make bombs"", but the acting is done well enough for most of the cheezy lines to be unnoticed. Affleck has been wrongly headlined for the film as it's a film about three characters. However he has given his best performance yet and his partnership with Hartnett, especially in the climax, is superb. Beckinsale could have been better but Cuba Gooding Jnr in the role of Dorrie Miller is the film's biggest scene stealer. While the attack isn't as horrific as some people may have wanted it to be, the must realise that with a budget of over $135 million, the film makers needed a wide audience, which resulted in the film being a '12'. If it were a '15', then they would have lost money. By the way, anyone who says the film is offensive to the Japanesse are talking out of their bum holes because more than once, the film portrays them as soldiers of war. Fair enough, the Germans might get offended with references to 'dirty German bandits', but to be offended by that they would just acting childish because in those times, that is what the Americans would have called the Germans. The worst part about the film is the unforgivable amount of cliches. From a black man wanting respect becoming a hero, to a normal love story procedure (I can't explain because that would be a spoiler), cliches almost rule some of the scenes, but Bay has done it so well that you barely notice most of them. While people have criticised Bay's faster than normal editing pace, they are just being stubborn and unprofessional. When Bruce Willis is first introduced in Pulp Fiction, the camera is placed in front of him while someone is talking to him. You can't see the person talking which by film conventions, makes it bad direction. But it's not bad direction because that's just Tarantino's style, so why can't they accept that fast editing is Bay's style? These 40 to 60 year old film critics just can't seem to accept that film making styles have changed since the Hitchcock days.<br/><br/>Complete with a beautiful Hans Zimmer score (I would have personally chosen Trevor Rabin), Pearl Harbor is nothing less than a masterpiece. Yes it's cliched, yes it's historically incorrect, yes the script is nothing special and yes it's gung ho, flag waving, American glorified nonsence, but it's a beautiful emotional film that grabs you from the start and never lets go while also making references to 1940's style film making and wonderful film making as well! 10/10.<br/><br/>By Kevin Williams The Greatest Film Critic in Wales"

","Pearl Harbor was great. Definatly a classic. Yes it wasn't solely based on the trajedy at Pearl Harbor, the love story thrown in the mix was a good one and it was very authentic. Why did Titanic get such high praises and this movie bad reviews. Titanic was a love story based on a trajedy, and Pearl Harbor is the same. Don't hate on this flick, if you never seen it don't listen to the critics. Bruckheimer produces this, directed my Micheal Bay, two of my favorite's, and this is another classic under their belts. I found it to be very emotional, the bombing scene was a whole other movie within the movie. Probably the best special affects i have ever seen.

","A friend of mine and I watched this overly-long 3-hour flick two weeks ago on DVD.  Though the film has extravagant special effects, the characters and plot fail to live up to the massive hype that this film received when it was released.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's character and the love story with Kate Beckinsale was nearly identical with his character in Armageddon.  It's sad that he, the writers and producers of Pearl Harbor couldn't come up with something more original.<br/><br/>After 2 hours of watching this film, I nearly fell asleep.  If the editors had cut most of the whiney, sappy & melodramatic tripe to have a 2-hour film, it would have been a much better, far more entertaining and much more exciting movie.<br/><br/>My advice: if you want to see a good film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, watch the History Channel or rent the movie ""Tora!

I had to leave.  It's that aggravating.<br/><br/>Possibly the biggest insult from this movie is that the second tape of it on video is taken up mostly by a *documentary* that basically says, ""Okay, you watched us totally exploit one of the most tragic events in history for a sappy love story.  Now here's what REALLY happened!""<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" gets a big fat one; the first movie in a very long time to do so.

Last night I started watching it thinking I could cut it off if it got too sappy.  I happily stayed up the whole 3 hours to get through the movie.  So I have to give the film a high rating because it does hold your attention.<br/><br/>
As far as the comments I heard about the love triangle and the distraction from the main point of the movie, I thought it added a human element to the film.  Remember that soldiers are people too with loved ones, families, brothers, sisters, girl firends, boy friends, kids, etc.  Trying to portray this event in US history is tough enough and I believe Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay did a fine job."
"driffma","1","1","2","7 January 2002"," Pearl Harbor the music video by Michael Bay
","It is fashionable to say, when critiqueing this movie, the attack on Pearl Harbor is great, but the rest of the movie is just awful.  I want to state plainly and for what ever record there maybe that it is not the case. In fact it is all awful, every excruciatingly painful minute. I will briefly only comment on the attack as other awful aspects have been covered by other reviewers (Roger Ebert's wonderful line, ""Pearl Harbor is a two hour movie crammed into three."" should give one an idea about the rest of the film). In fact I will talk only about one scene in the battle.  It is designed (this ugly scene) to drive us to tears, but all it should do is offend, offend and offend!  The scene depicts several sailors treading water (we are looking at them from under wonderfully tinted soft sea green), the sailors are fighting valiantly to stay afloat. Behind them under the water, is an American flagg.  And underneath the entire scene is one of the most annoying soundtracks ever created. In less than 5 seconds director Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckhimer have taken one of the most tragic events in U.S. history and turned it into a music video.  And a boring, predictible, and unispired one at that."

","I don't want to make this a long comment about the missing historical accuracy, a lot of people did that before already. But what really made me upset was the exaggerated patriotic touch of that movie, like it is common these days for ""American"" movies, mixed with racism and prejudices (U-571).<br/><br/>Already in the beginning is that scene, when the father of the little boy is accused to be a German and he is all offended and telling that he fought the Germans instead! That was so unnecessary. All the the morons, that never read a history book have a reason again to think, that Germans are bad people by genetical reasons, so they are still today.<br/><br/>This is simplifying the historical truth in a way, that is a slap right in the face of every European. The reasons for WWI where quite complex and nobody could be really blamed for it. But WWII was definitely caused by the allies, who where more interested in a weak Germany than in a stable Europe.<br/><br/>But it is easy to blame everything still on Germany after 60 years, because the USA is always right, the others are wrong.<br/><br/>So for what was that comment about the Germans in the beginning? I don't see any moral superiority, if a movie is made on such a low level.<br/><br/>But also the rest is pure propaganda for American patriotism. It twisted historical facts and unwanted truth is hidden. Also a behavior that is known well, not only from American movies.<br/><br/>As I said before, I don't want to discuss the historical accuracy, since too many did that before.<br/><br/>In Pearl Harbor it was not 2400 people that died. No! It was 2400 Americans! Does it make a difference which nationality they had? Every person dying because of war or violence is too much!<br/><br/>When the Japanese planes were shot down, the movie was making it look like a video-game. ""Got you, son a of a bitch!"" If Japanese or not, there was a human being dying in that plane and the movie made it look as if it is something glorious to kill an enemy.<br/><br/>The raid on Tokyo was a REVENGE for Pearl Harbor, not more and not less. Revenge is one of the lowest feelings a person can have. Is that moral superiority?<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin says in the movie, that if there is no way to get away, that he would know what to do. He would choose the right target and make his plane itself a bomb. Something that is an interesting statement, since September 11th.<br/><br/>And at the end it is said in the movie, that this war made America grow. That is quite true, but not to something so good as it was<br/><br/>claimed in the final seconds of the movie. It made the USA growing to use the A-Bomb against Japan, even the war was over already, just for testing purposes. It made them killing hundreds of thousands of german civilians during the raids on big german cities during the last months of the war. The list could be endless...<br/><br/>No, this movie is really bad propaganda and I feel put back right into the middle-ages and not at the beginning of the 21st century.<br/><br/>I really wonder what would happen, if a german producer would do a similar german movie about WWII ...<br/><br/>Shame on that movie. Nationalism and patriotism are the main reasons besides racism and religious fanaticism for all the bad things in our world. And that movie doesn't help to make it a better place at all.<br/><br/>I wonder, when we will ever see an accurate movie from Hollywood, that is talking about humanity and one world and that every party is making wrong decisions once in a while, instead of the USA as the center-point of the Universe and it's not existing superiority. Even movies like Private Ryan and Schindler's List are not accurate on a lot of stuff.<br/><br/>That movie really disappointed me and made me sad."

"sean_36","2","1","2","5 December 2001"," the worst movie of the year
","After months of hype, the most highly anticipated movie of the year has finally arrived, and guess what, its a BOMB.  Not just a bomb but a giant stink bomb to be more precise.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a summer movie. Sure there have been much worse movies made, but never one with a trailer that actually put chills down my back.  As I left the theatre I could not help but ask myself what I (or the public) had ever done to Jerry Bruckhiemer that made him feel it necessary to inflict such a god-awful piece of crap upon us.  I've always liked Bruckhiemer movies, even the ones others didn't.  I don't recall ever being let down by one of his films (I even liked Gone In 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly), they were hokey fun and I excepted them as such.  But with Pearl Harbor, Bruckhiemer and director Michael Bay (Who I also use to worship) have entered new ground: the historical war film.  Well, new to them anyway. Unfortunately, they thought they were still making their standard action films and didn't realize that when making war films you have to worry about things like realism and historical accuracy.  So Pearl Harbor ended up being just another drawn out, flag waving, Hollywoodized flick that glamorizes war to no end.  The plot, if you can call it that, centers around two childhood friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) who fall in love with the same woman (Kate Beckinsale) during World War II.  Yes, that's right it's a love story too.  And just about the lamest, unromantic love story I've ever seen.  Most of this problem comes care of Bay, who is absolutely amazing at shooting action sequences, but doesn't know jack s**t about creating attraction or chemistry between two characters.  Every time Affleck and Beckinsale have a romantic moment it is followed immediately with slapstick humor.  Whether Affleck's shooting a cork in his eye or falling 20 feet from the side of a boat, the filmmakers obviously thought that our attention span was so short, that we could only handle 2-3 lines of dialog before we got board and needed a laugh.  Which brings us to the attack.  After 90 minutes of imitation love story, we finally get a chance to see something blow up.  And stuff does blow up, quite nicely too, but since you have been board for the last hour and a half and don't care about the characters, all the blowing up has very little impact.  However, it is the most entertaining part of the film and the 40 minutes go by very quickly.  If the film had ended here I would have given it 3 stars and considered it OK.  But the filmmakers could not have ended with the Americans losing, no, that would have been a downer, and remember this is a feel-good war.  So, it drags on for another hour showing Doolittle's pointless raid over Tokyo and turning it in to massive victory for the Americans.  Never have I seen so much flag waving, this thing is even more pro-America than The Patriot.  I mean, there's national pride and then there's propaganda.  Oh, I forgot to mention how cheesy the whole movie is.  It's overflowing with cheese.  They use every trick in the book to make the audience feel like they are watching something important.  A ship cook earns respect, a soldier is reunited with his lost dog and drowning soldiers stop swimming for their lives so they can cheer when a Japanese plane is shot down.  But the cheesiest moment of all, perhaps in all of movie history, comes when Jon Voight (playing the wheelchair-bound FDR) is told that a raid on Tokyo can't be done, and rises up out of his chair to shout  ""IT CAN BE DONE!!!!!!!"". I couldn't help but crack up in the theatre.  I could probably think of more things wrong with Pearl Harbor but you are probably tired of reading this long review.  Just do you self a favor and spend your money on somewhere else."

","I have to say that I did not get caught in the hype and watch this movie in the theater.  It was Memorial day weekend, and I knew what Michael Bay movies can be like, overly patriotic and melodramatic to the point of cheeziness at times.  I was a fan of the more historical though sometimes dry adaption known as Tora, Tora, Tora and was afraid of what kind of abuses might be committed against the memory of one the the most tragic events in United States history. <br/><br/>Skip to 9/11/2001 our new date to live in infamy.  The Historical event of Pearl Harbor is now sadly joined/surpassed by the Attacks in New York, Washington, and the Anthrax scare. Thousands of innocent Americans lay dead in a tomb that still smokes 80 days later and like our fellow Americans entombed at Pearl Harbor, many will probably never be recovered. <br/><br/>
Now the release of Pearl Harbor on DVD and VHS is upon us as well as the 60th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor.  The few veterans who are alive from that day, have lived to see yet another surprise attack on America. Their story as told in books, documentaries, and even Pearl Harbor the Movie can now inspire new generations of Americans who have been connected together as one nation, a sleeping giant yet again awakened.  <br/><br/>
This movie is very patriotic and I was moved in many parts.  The battle scenes are intense.  John Voight's portrayal of FDR is stunning.  The whole movie including Dewey's raid, that many said was unnecessary, has new meaning, post 9/11, showing America's true spirit of refusing to give up under impossible odds and the possibility of death.

","The movie is exceptionally impressive with fantastical special effects. It is made much better than famous Titanic and superior to it in every sense. The plot is complex, it encompass long period including the story of main characters, beginning of the World War II in Europe, thorough preparations of Japan to attack on the USA, the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself and American reaction. I wasn't feeling bored or tired through three hours of the movie. War sequences (especially battles in the air) are stunning. To my surprise, relationships between heroes didn't irritate me as in the case of Titanic. They were quite believable and by no means stupid. I became rather anxious about destinies of the heroes. The cast is good. No one is outstanding, but all of them are adequate and pleasant. Direction is masterful. The atmosphere of the movie is patriotic and life-asserting without being unreasonable. The authors don't accuse Japanese of cunning attack or anything, and show the history as it was. Of course, there is not a single word about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's only natural, for that nuclear attack was not a military but political action  show-off, aiming to frighten Soviet Union. Creators of the film preferred not to allude to the shameful fact, and I absolutely agree with them. They made an excellent epic war movie which entertains and thrills the viewer (and doesn't lose good taste or good sense at the same time). Shortly, the film is worth seeing."

","pearl harbor was a pretty good movie but it was sad it told the story of what happened when the japanese bombed pearl harbor and got the united states in war. in a way it was kind of like titanic because there was a love story in it as well a soldier falls in love with a nurse he gets lost in war then she falls in love with some one else and they have a baby but then the one who was lost in war came back and babies father died in japan. this was a long but pretty good movie i think everyone should see it. i rate pearl harbor 7/10"

","Despite some obvious changes to make it a hollywood movie, Pearl Harbor is fantastic.  Fantastic computer graphics team up with real life action shots to make you think the attack had actually happened all over again.<br/><br/>The romance triangle between the lead actors adds a sensitive, if not tragic touch to the movie and I have to say that the lead actress has the most gorgeous eyes.<br/><br/>For somebody who is after a true action film, speckled with a touching romance, then don't miss this film."

I would love to meet the the producer alone in a dark alley."
"Spleen","Null","1","2","5 October 2001"," The blockbuster disaster movie dumbed down. -Yes, exactly.
","What I liked especially was not the attack on Pearl Harbour but the Battle of Britain footage - confusing, as one would expect from Michael Bay, but it at least made aerial combat look three-dimensional, in a way I'd never seen it look before.<br/><br/>But of course nobody involved in this film cared in the least little bit about the Battle of Britain.  ""We need it for the plot, we might as well show it..."" - the attitude was obvious and it made the footage lifeless. Everything preceding the attack on Pearl Harbour was just killing time. Well, I'd heard as much in advance.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when it turned out that the Pearl Harbour attack was just as lifeless, and had just as much the quality of killing time, as everything that had gone before.  What's more, it seemed to last just as long.  Why were we watching bodies and things then more bodies and more things being blown to bits, again and again - for well over half an hour? More than once I wondered what was going on.  Not once does the camera pull far enough away from the digital pyrotechnics to show us how much damage the Japanese were doing, how they were doing it, what they were doing it to, etc.<br/><br/>And that's the whole film in a nutshell.  It tells us NOTHING.  You could watch the movie from beginning to end and not realise, for instance, that Japan was ALREADY at war when the story opened.  It had invaded China and declared war on Britain (and all British colonies and members of the British Commonwealth). The US could reasonably hope to stay neutral, perhaps, but ""peace in the Pacific"", which a few characters talked about, was past praying for.<br/><br/>(There's a curious attitude to the Japanese here.  Obviously, they are the villain, because they WERE the villain - but we're never told why.  When we see actual Japanese people they look like brass monuments only recently granted the gifts of speech and movement, joyless in victory and they never saying anything that isn't in the form of a sententious proverb.  I see this as a conciliatory gesture towards the modern Japanese, although not a very subtle one.)<br/><br/>Such things as why Japan wanted a war at all, or what they wanted OUT of war (not the same thing), or how they planned the attack and what they meant to do next, or for that matter what ANY nation was doing, are given the briefest mention, if any.  I know that this film isn't about military strategy, and it isn't about politics.  Fair enough.  But what IS it about? Surely not about how the war effects individuals.  The Ben Affleck has an almighty military raid fall directly on his head and it makes the barest perceptible dent in his self-absorbed resentment; he is exactly the same after Pearl Harbour as before.  So is everyone else, for that matter (excluding those who die).  When we watch the raid, does the camera linger in one place long enough for us to get a glimpse of any kind of personal reaction?  Never!  Maybe once or twice in the hospital, but to compensate the cutting is even more frenetic there than it is outside.  Unless you can weave it into a personal story or a political one, the attack on Pearl Harbour is completely devoid of drama.  The Japanese come, they bomb, they leave.<br/><br/>So the ENTIRE FILM becomes a kind of a music video montage - pretty shot after pretty shot, Hans Zimmer's score indulging in a kind of pompous mourning over the top of them all, paying no attention to whether the people on screen are kissing or chatting or arguing or killing one another.  Even the conversations between characters are montages.  Listen closely.  The people in this film don't respond to one another, they navigate from one posture to the next.<br/><br/>Ultimately the attack is over.  Michael Bay makes one desperate attempt to turn his collage of cinematic calendar shots into an actual film, by tacking on a phoney ""resolution"".  We see a raid on Tokyo (a raid that looks suspiciously like a pointless act of revenge, since nobody can clearly explain what it's meant to achieve).  Bay wanted a triumph at the end, however contrived - had the war not ended with something as chilling as atomic bombs falling on populated cities, I believe Bay would have fast-forwarded to 1945.  The raid is the occasion of some of the most mindless jingoism I've ever seen.  The Russians mastered the art of producing propaganda that seemed to have an effect on its intended audience even though it made no sense; ""Pearl Harbour"" can't compete with that kind of thing, but the glowing eulogies at the end come dangerously close to collapsing into gibberish.<br/><br/>SPOILER FOLLOWS...<br/><br/>I must also register a protest about that display of competitive heroism on mainland China.  No doubt the pilots were brave, but their actions struck me as being of dubious legality.  First, they surrender; then, because they don't like the manner in which they're being made prisoners - admittedly with reason - they shoot their captors.  They would themselves have been shot had their captors not believed them when they announced that they were laying down arms.  The pilot's actions are difficult to admire, even if the scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint.he scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint."

","I don't understand the negativity towards this film as it was one of the best films from 2001 and although I admit that I am an avid Michael Bay fan I fail to see how people could dislike it. This film had negative reviews by Michael Bay fans because of the love story, well in all honesty all of his films feature a love story to some extent it is just up to him whether he makes it a big part of the film (e.g. this film along with ""Armageddon"" and ""The Island"") or he chooses to only briefly focus on the love story (e.g. ""The Rock""). I for one thoroughly enjoyed this film as I enjoy not only a good war film but one with a good dramatic storyline such as this and on being a Michael Bay fan I look forward to seeing ""Transformers"" and I hope that it will be one of this year's best films and also that Mr. Bay continues to make films of this quality."

Before i saw it i didn't really know anything about Pearl Harbor and really didn't think of it either! but when i saw the movie, it showed what really happen and not what you learn in 8th grade history! The special affects were amazing and the bombing scene was breath-taking! During the bombing scene i was crying because here i grew up just knowing that the Japenese bombed Pearl Harbor and that was about it! Pearl Harbor is not just a remarkable film, it teaches the real event that happen on December 7.

Austrliaia has not not been hit by an Army and has got innocent people murdered.. We have. Back to the movie. The Scenes with The president and the Japanese. were enjoyable. a lot of great lines were said in that movie and i enjoy the roller coaster ride it gives you. The 45 min. attack on Peral Harbor was spectacular. It didn't let me or anyone i knew down. The first hour of the movie was devoted to developing relationships which makes the film more personal and ends up with almost everyone crying at the end. This movie was truly spectacular. Almost no other movie of this scale has a personal feel and all the explosions you expect come threw. Everyone in America at least should see this movie. It brings out the pride for our country and that should be brought out in this type of movie."
"hwfan25","10","2","7","6 December 2005"," Wonderful, powerful, exciting, romantic
","When we like a movie, my daughter and I have been known to see it more than once, but we've never seen a movie as often as we saw Pearl Harbor. When it first came out, my (then) 15-year-old daughter and I saw it 11 times in the theater. Now, 4 years later, I'm still surprised it didn't get better ratings/reviews than it did.<br/><br/>I know some people complain that the movie was historically inaccurate (so, maybe they should go watch a documentary), but this movie made us feel many thingsa sense of our history, patriotism, pride that our country pulled together then and optimism that it can do so again, and gratefulness to those who make our freedom possible. The flying scenes were exciting, and the bombing scenes were intense (and maybe overlong). Some of the hospital scenes were haunting, and gave a strong sense of the horror and confusion of that day.<br/><br/>We loved the old-fashioned love story. I don't understand why some people complain about a love story being put in the context of a movie like Pearl Harborin real life, I'm sure hundreds of the people affected by Pearl Harbor were in the midst of their own love stories. And, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett get our votes as romantic heroes any day. We still love this movie."
"bogdan_ea","10","2","8","1 May 2008"," If you want historical accuracy please watch a documentary !!
","If you want to be historical accurate then watch a documentary or read a book. I have to say that I loved this film, despite knowing that it's not entirely accurate and is centred round a love-triangle. Yes, it could have been better and it didn't need the love story, but give the film a break! It was well-made with superb special effects. I think one of the reasons people vote this film down is because they went to watch it expecting it to be bad and predictable, in other words, a remake of Titanic - typical romance involving a girl that two guys want. And I'm not dissing Titanic here either - I loved that film even more so than Pearl Harbor. I'm almost certain that if this film had been released as the first of its kind - modern epic of tragic historic event with love triangle and very attractive actors - it would have made just as much as Titanic did. What went wrong with Pearl Harbor was the way it was hyped about - most expensive movie ever made, etc etc. People thought 'oh yeah, been there done that' because they'd seen Titanic. And it did bear many similarities to Titanic but that does NOT make it a bad film. And I wish people would lay off the Americans. OK, so it's the biggest, richest and best (in my opinion) country in the world - so what? Any other country would act the same if it was them. I hasten to add here that I'm English and live in England, just to clarify that I'm not American and therefore not biased. Maybe some of the dialogue was cheesy but that was the DIALOGUE, not the pro-Americanism. Surely anyone - in any country - is going to act patriotic in the middle of being attacked by another country! It's a natural reaction. You can hardly imagine the characters standing there saying 'well, let's give them the benefit of the doubt - there's a reason for this' can you?! Maybe there is a reason but when you're in the middle of something like that surrounded by death and destruction, your instinct is to protect people and defend your country. So lay off the Americans everyone! The place rules - get used to it! In my opinion, Pearl Harbor was a cinematic masterpiece with a very touching love story. The people who went in there expecting it to be rubbish came out thinking it was rubbish, not wanting to admit their expectations had been wrong.10"

","This movie is one that gets better and better on repeated viewings. For those who had a bad reaction to the movie when it first opened, they owe it to themselves to watch it again. Too much of the negative press had to do with Ben Affleck's negative nitwit hyper publicity at the beginning of the decade when this movie was released. That obstacle is now mercifully in the past, and the movie can now be objectively judged on its own merits, and they are many. The wrap-around love story works incredibly well to frame the actual attack and personalize it. Also, the movie espouses strong American values and virtues, showing us Americans at their best. Cinematically, this movie couldn't be stronger. It is visually stunning and audacious--a triumph of the movie makers' arts. It saddens me that such a great movie has been given such negative press. The negativity, I think, stems from something not related to the true quality of the movie. Watch Pearl Harbor again--it's great!"

","I just can't believe that there would be a legitimate, Hollywood movie with decent actors, expensive special effects - the works - that could be such a gross and reckless distortion of one of the most tragic moments in the history of America. Lousy acting, lousy writing, absurd directing and apparently all done with an attitude of ""oh, what the hell. Why even bother following the facts, the truth and events if it interferes with with this love story that's contrived, anyway."" The director actually had Jap planes flying low between ships, with sailors on both ships firing deck weapons horizontally at the Japs. Which also meant the sailors were strafing each other. Absolutely no thought to such simple things as this.<br/><br/>I was able to visit Pearl Harbor, including Ford Island, a few years back. My DVD of ""Tora, Tora, Tora!!!"" had finally worn out.

Although it's just over 3 hours long you immerse yourself in the love story of the main characters while the Japanese plan their attack. It all leads to the climax of the film (the attack on pearl harbour) The special effects were absolutely amazing showing the true intensity of the attack, and you begin to sympathise with the American troops who really are caught completely off guard. Trying to deal with the aftermath of the attack is almost unimaginable, and particularly the main stars who have now become trapped in the love triangle whilst they're facing possible death at the hands of the Japanese. Definitely worth watching. Don't listen to the negative reviews. I guess some of the viewers wanted to see the attack on Pearl harbour only. In my opinion that's the whole reason for the underlining love story. You see it unfold, and more importantly how the attack changes everything."

Ben Affleck is doing his best Hugh Grant impression. Kate Beckinsale is her lovely British self. And Josh Hartnett is doing the matinée idol. I'm not being sarcastic. More time is spent on the romances than on any of the historical background. For a better Pearl harbor movie, try 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' <br/><br/>One thing Michael Bay does well is action. It doesn't start well with the shaky cam fighter aerial combat. It's way too shaky. However, he does know how to create explosive CGI loveliness. The big Pearl Habor attack is very impressive.

The background as to why the actual Japanese attack is a little blurred - can't have any excuses for anyone wanting to attack USA, can we??? So the middle of the picture is pretty good - again don't listen to the moaners that Affleck and Hartnett don't play the real US airman who got in the air that day. After all the first officer on the Titanic blew his brains out on screen (sic?) and Matthew McConaughey rescued the Enigma codes in 'U571' for the US when in fact it was British sailors, and didn't Mel Gibson win the Vietnam War?!!! Yes, Hollywood has always played fast and loose with historical fact, so get over it. Mind I would have thought you might have seen a few more Yanks in the Eagle Squadron, and the Battle of Britain was over by 1941! But of the rest, the script is shoddy soap opera, the direction overblown, the acting with a couple of standouts poor, the plot derivative from other better movies (Kate Beckinsale on the beach in a two piece in Hawaii snogging!), and Ben Affleck's Clint Eastwood-like shoot out with the japs cringeworthy.

As for the flying portion of the film, when Affleck volunteers for duty with the Royal Air Force, I thought the action scenes were really good. This movie could have been a great chick flick if there wasn't so much violence. I gave this movie a 7. Mostly because I was in the service and saw how much was added to make it seem more realistic.

When Hitler tried to have history rewritten to make it seem the Germans were the inventors of... well... everything, Michael Bay and Randall Wallace would have been perfect for the job.<br/><br/>The story: The US see their prime fleet sunk by the Japanese. (Quote of Danny: ""I think WWII has just started"". Yes Danny, if by ""just"" you mean the invasion of Poland a few years back.) However, the US, being a poor and technologically backward country, have lost all of their fighter planes in this attack, so how to fight back now? A cunning plan arises: they'll use the handful of regular planes that are left and leave for Tokyo with the intention of bombing it. Sadly, the Americans are unable to correctly calculate the amount of fuel needed and, as a result, never reach Japan. Instead they make a crash landing in China, where they are captured by the Japanese.<br/><br/>So far, so bad, but read this and weep: The Japanese, who are in awe of such commitment and bravery (???) decide to lay down their arms and capitulate to the US.<br/><br/>Yes, that sounds plausible. Or maybe Japan DID surrender because of the 200,000 innocent people killed by the two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, like the history books say. I'm not a religious man, but I do believe there's a place for Michael Bays after death. And it ain't pretty."

","I just saw this movie last night( I know thats a little weird, since it came out 5 years ago) but i have to admit it was great.<br/><br/>When the main menu of the DVD came up, with the short scenes and music thats usually there, i thought, ""This going to be good""<br/><br/>Well, it was.<br/><br/>I cried almost three times, i was stunned that the trio of Ben Aflek, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Harnet could make characters so believable.<br/><br/>The attack of Pearl Harbor was mind bending. Big booms and explosions all over the place.<br/><br/>The music was worth a third of the movie, and a big applause for Hanz Zimmer for composing it.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace wrote a great script, taking the attack of Pearl Harbor and making you really almost cry during it.<br/><br/>I tip my hat to Michael Bay for excellent directing.<br/><br/>Overall, I can see no possible way for anyone not to like this movie. It succeeded in almost every way.<br/><br/>p.s. I'm pretty sure a LOT of people will disagree, but I don't care. This was probably the best film of 2001, and even if everyone says they didn't like it, it sure made a LOT of money.<br/><br/>See it for yourself and see one of the best, dramatic, and epic films of the past few years."

","A lot of comments on this movie complain about historical accuracy... this is a MOVIE not the history channel. If you want to know what really happened at Pearl Harbor and after, there are many good books and documentaries available! This is historical fiction... a beautiful story of close friends, young love, and our men and women in the military around a time when America got involved in the war. There are a lot of fine actors, a beautiful musical score, aerial combat scenes, and some very realistic scenes of that ""horrible"" day in history (they talked with many veterans that were there during the actual attack and tried to depict some of these stories).<br/><br/>But it is a MOVIE... it is a movie that tugs at your heart; it will make you laugh, smile, cry, and maybe even get you reading about that day in history. So, if you want to see a movie about friendship, love, and heroism around the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, then make some popcorn and watch a good old fashioned movie."
"orangebaby336","7","1","3","20 July 2006"," Pretty good, but what's up with the love triangle?
","After I first watched this movie, I loved it. However, I realized later that this film isn't very good. Here you have a movie about historical Pearl Harbor, however 3/4 of it is about a silly little love triangle. You're starting to get off track from the story. I think it was good to have a love story in there about waiting for her soldier to come back to her. When they added his friend in there it became about really stupid fights and to top it all off they added in the predicament of the girl being pregnant. This movie is entitled Pearl Harbor, so why don't you make it more about Pearl Harbor. Also, I don't know all the history about Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle Raid, but I've heard from some that a few parts of the history are way off. Perhaps they tried not to make it like Tora Tora Tora, but the love story that they had was a bad idea. But I will say that the special effects were awesome! If you have the 2-disk DVD, you should watch the special features because it's very interesting. Even though I hate the love story, it's actually not a bad movie. So I give it 7 stars"

","Hey, remember that uh war thingy, happened about 60 years ago? Yeah that's it, World War II. And you know that thing, you know that thing that got the U.S. involved in it? Yeah the attack on Pear Harbor. They should make a movie about that! Wait, they already did? It was called Tora, Tora, Tora? And it was really good? Well I'll be dipped.<br/><br/>Oh well, I'll just get on to reviewing Pearl Harbor. This movie is four hours long, or at least it seems like it is. Don't let anyone tell you differently, this is a paint by numbers love story that happens to use the events of WWII as a backdrop. There's some ridiculous overwrought love triangle and then, BOOM, crap explodes! The darkest days of World War II, wow, I couldn't possibly come up with a better backdrop for a stupid little romance movie.<br/><br/>After hours of sappy romance we, much like the sailors of the Pacific fleet, are struck by endless bombs and action scenes that all pursue the single minded purpose of blowing things the *bleep* up. <br/><br/>It ends with the Doolittle air raid as a way of showing the light at the end of the tunnel, or something. In all honesty if the movie wanted to end on a more upbeat note they could have the nurse character comfort a dying man or something and finish it off with a scene of the Aircraft Carriers returning to the Harbor.<br/><br/>If you can sit through three hours of boring melodrama the action sequences look decent but they get real old real fast."
"jblue38","1","1","3","30 January 2006"," I agree with Team America
","If you want to hear what I think about Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ben Affleck and the rest of the movie, go watch this scene from Team America that explains it all. The expert critics who somehow gave this movie a perfect 10 or even a good score should especially watch it. For starters, Ben Affleck gives an awful acting performance in this movie. I give him credit for Goodwill Hunting, that was a great movie and he is where he is today because of that movie, but honestly it has been all downhill from that point. Armageddon (I don't care if you like that aerosmith song), dare devil, gigli, bounce, jersey girl, just to name a few of his classics. The love 'triangle' was not believable because the relationships for both Affleck and Beckett weren't given enough time to develop, and I didn't even feel sorry for the girl when Josh Beckett's character dies. Why was Cuba Gooding, Jr. barely in the film? This guy is an award winning actor and a much better one than Ben Affleck in my opinion. This is one of the most tragic and historical days in our nation's history and the focus of this film is on some cheesy love story. By the way, if you actually walked out of the movie theater that day in tears, than you are clearly an emotional wreck."

","""December 7, 1941 - A day that shall live in infamy""<br/><br/>This movie isn't the first and only that has steered away from the truth and replaced it with fictional characters and plot line (Titanic is the best example). As far as doing so you can't go wrong if you plot your course right and make both reality and fiction come together.<br/><br/>It's also the mixture of power and emotion brought to the screen that can make up for all the misplaced factual errors. Bay knows his stuff. He created a particular pace and time that had a great chemistry with it all in the final screening. The cheer vision is one that wasn't taking lightly. It surly wasn't dull and definitely was mistreated.<br/><br/>I'm finding it hard to fathom the critical comments on this movie where as a movie such as Titanic was highly appreciated. I myself didn't like Titanic, it misguided all what I have said and it turned out to be a real mess.<br/><br/>When it comes down to the acting, I'll come right out and say I think they all had great performances. We can't seem to pass the mixture of opinions when we talk about Ben Affleck's acting skills. I find him to have a natural talent for acting, not so much of a creative talent. That doesn't bother me in the least for this particular movie. Kate Beckansile is so gorgeous you can overlook her acting, Josh can be said the same way for the opposite sex. I'm not implying that their acting was out of line. I think their work was just fine.<br/><br/>All in all I'm am disappointed for all who don't take this movie for what it delivers, instead trying to learn the actual history.

"ChrisCottell","1","1","3","30 September 2005"," Worst movie of all time.
","This is the worst movie of all time, now I've seen the movies with the lowest ranks but they're just badly done, this on the other hand I reserve a special venom for. We'll start with a general look at the film, it's clichéd to hell, how could anyone get joy from watching a series of obvious scenes where you know exactly where the next one will lead, Anyone with any IQ should get bored with this stuff pretty quickly. The only saving grace are the explosions, though this doesn't stretch you much. <br/><br/>OK so we accept its not a highbrow film, I'll sit through an Arnie film no problem, so how about the cast. Alec Baldwin (if anyone's seen Team America  F.A.G), old Cuba I've not seen in a film where he's not overacted his token black actor heart out. And of course there's good old Ben, old Affers (F.A.G) can not act, sorry CAN NOT ACT, would somebody put him out of his and our G.Damn misery. So the big actors are all the American A1 guys who will get bums on seats but don't' have a morsel of class or integrity, which is a good thing as. <br/><br/>We now move onto the plot. Apparently Goebbels died in 1945, I think this is a lie, I think he was whisked out of the country by the American armed forces and given a job creating Hollywood movies (To date he must have had a hand in Devil's Own (The IRA are freedom fighters), U-571 (Americans find the Enigma Machine), Saving Private Ryan (2 Brits in the whole film), Master and Commander (Supposed to be Brits chasing Yanks), etc, etc, etc). My reason for this theory is Goebbels as the master of propaganda is the only one who could orchestrate what appears to be a conscious and concerted plan to re-write the history of the world to make America responsible for every great event in history (Watch out next month as Abe Lincoln invents the wheel and defeats Napoleon in a fist fight). So what has happened with the plot to suspect this old Nazi, well the raid on Japan at the end to start with. no, No, NO. This did not happen for several years and when it did it caused F all damage, sorry but after Peal Harbour the armed forces were shattered and had nowhere near the capability to do this, but the Yanks had to go 'kick ass'. But this still wasn't the worst part, not the bit that actually hurts. <br/><br/>The Presidents speech, just before they fly off to ""Bomb ALL of Japan"", The Pres says something about how America's allies will now see what they are made of. Sorry but up until this point America had been happily sitting on the fence milking everyone and making a packet out of our need for arms and food as the Allies had been throwing millions of troops and slowly starving for nearly three years before they were FORCED by the Japs to join. Ugh. <br/><br/>It is at the end of the day just a movie and if I truly thought that I would just turn it off or leave. But the point is a movie is no longer just entertainment, a movie like this alters our perception of events and for a large number of people forms our education, but if we continue not to object to these lies then they will become our truths. <br/><br/>History is written by the victor"

","This movie is one of the reason why we have kids who know nothing about the TRUE history of this country. Besides obvious errors to the true events of December 7th to make the movie sell, the events shown are even more absurd. The whole movie twists history into a three ball of confusion. Pilots going from Bombers to Fighters back to Bombers in the space of year just didn't happen. No pilot ever served in the RAF and was at Pearl Harbor in the Army Air Corps. This is slam at the real members of the Eagles Sqd. (American volunteers in the RAF). A lot more should have been done to tell the real story of the some of the real people who were at Pearl Harbor, like the two pilots who did get up and fight the Japanese in the Air. More about the first Black Navy Cross winner could have made a much better story than trying to cram the Battle of Britian, Pearl harbor and Doolittle's Raid into this movie. Some of the film was redeeming. The action sequences were good (if a bit overblown). Trust me and see Tora Tora Tora or it's Japanese counterpart to get a better idea of what December 7th was all about."

T3 is DOCUdrama and if you really take a good look at that one the acting is truly abysmal, especially on American side. One of my personal pet peeves against war movies of 60's and 70's is that they don't much care about costuming, 70's fashions in second world war really rubs in the eye and that throws the good IL' suspension of belief out of the window quicker than you can say terylene. Pearl Harbor is a throwback from the earlier time, war flicks of 40's and 50's, and if you really want to compare it to something, do it with those. >From here to eternity is probably the first contender, and surely it is superior to Pearl, but Bay didn't have the kind of stellar cast as Zinneman did so what can you do. Affleck ain't Burt and Hartnett sure ain't even in the same hemisphere with Clift or Sinatra. Of course us nonamericans find Bays excuse to put American flag to every fifth scene quite hilarious and dialogue is beyond corny in some instances, however PH is entertaining spectacle in it's own right AND it's not supposed to be taken as fact.

Over half the movie was dedicated to the silly love triangle that was ripped off from some daytime soap opera.  And Ben Affleck is terrible in this.  But, maybe he seemed so bad because of the horrible dialogue he had to say like ""not anxious to die, but anxious to matter.""  And Alec Baldwin had a bunch of cheesy lines too. And why was Cuba Gooding JR even in this. He didn't have much screen time and not much to do. So much could have been edited out to make this movie closer to 2 hours instead of 3.

"Malifer","10","1","3","27 May 2001"," What are you people talking about?
","As you will have probably noted by this its one of those movies not many people think is okay. There are those who love it and those who want to scream their  heads off about how much they hate it. So the only way to find out which one you are is to see it. My biggest problem is with the people who seem to abhor it not because I liked it, even though I did, but because their excuses for not liking it are tired. One comment was that there was not one historical fact in the film, while in fact I can name a couple off the top of my head, i.e. Doris Miller, Doolittle Raid. Another thing that bothered me was how intelligent everyone was trying to sound by finally being able to use the word jingoism. For those who didn't like this movie because there was too much patriotism do yourself a favor find a WWII veteran and talk to him. I am sure you will find out how much we Americans have become shallow little creatures because the people of that era did actually give a damn about something other than themselves. There were only a few but some negative comments on the portrayal of the Japanese. This was one of my favorite things about this, movie although it could have used more screen time. The Admiral comes off as a man doing what his country needs, but has compassion for those he is going to kill and the letter the zero pilot writes just gives a glimpse of the other sides turmoil. If this hadn't been in the film I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. Cuba Gooding's character is another that is either hated or loved. I would have liked to see more of him, but not at the expense of cutting something else.<br/><br/>Now for the big one people's complaints about history. I hate to be the one to take you from your nice little bubble where everything is perfect, but the truth is history is bent. It is not written with in perfection. It is jotted down by a human that wants to talk about his favorite parts. Proof of this is in a book I got on Charlemagne, which was very good except the author decided to leave out the day he had twenty thousand people slaughtered. There aren't many history books written about after Pearl Harbor America set up concentration camps for all Asian Americans, although German and Italian Americans were allowed to live in America like they always had. It is very hard to find a book on how at the end of WWII America brought Nazi scientists that had part of the holocaust here to continue their horrifying human experiments, sound a little fishy to you well go find out how we created the nerve gas tabun, it was our Nazi scientists. But the big thing to remember is this is a movie. No one pays lots of money to see a documentary.  As much as you might like to think the studios are there to make art the truth it's a business and they are not going to back something that does not have a chance at making it's money back.<br/><br/>Some little notes to add are so many complained of it being cliché. Everything has been done already if you think you have a new idea I am sorry but someone else thought it a long time ago. Cliché just means if people liked it so lets do it again. And we do like it because if we didn't there wouldn't be anyone to buy books or see movies. For those of you who are so above doing something that is cliché guess what that is a cliché in it self.<br/><br/>Far too many people said this film was too long. They say to cut the romance and just leave the blowing up stuff. I am not going to comment on the stupidity of our culture and it's downward spiral into incessent babbling. Heck I was happy to feel I got my seven bucks worth after a long line of 80-minute movies.  We are coming to the end I swear, but I had to add these couple of things. In one comment while bashing Pearl Harbor it was comparing it to other great films Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and Air Force OneWhat is Air Force One doing on the same level as Ryan and Braveheart. And I laughed heartily when I read a comment stating it had `bad dialogue'. As for reasons I am going to see it again. It is an epic. I like the characters. I love the setting. I love the story.

This movie lasts for over 3 hours, and it seems like an eternity.

","I do not care what people say about this movie; it was WONDERFUL. I sat down for 3 hours and 3 minutes and enjoyed what you can truly call a summer box office hit. The love story (or stories)was quite interesting since as a viewer, one develops an attachment for the characters. As far as the special effects go, you get a heck of a lot for your money! Of course, there are a bunch of scenes which will leave spectators teary-eyed (I cried like a baby half the time). The actors were amazing, though I wanted to see more of Cuba Gooding Jr. Michael Bay did an exquisite job of directing this movie (long live all his summer Blockbuster hits). It's a very ""busy"" movie; I don't think I had time to breathe. In conclusion, I want to convert my nationality to American and I want to move to Pearl Harbor to get myself one of those hot Navy boys (there are plenty in the movie!!! ) Well, I have been marked...  and it's all good because I LOVED EVERY SECOND of this movie! <br/><br/>( 10/10 )"
"jhclues","8","1","3","6 January 2002"," Michael Bay Revisits That Infamous Day
","Depicting history on the silver screen is no easy task; critics and historical purists wait in eager anticipation to pounce on a shading that's not quite right or a spent bullet casing that rolls left instead of right in the heat of a battle.  To even consider doing a dramatization of the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, in this era of endless information and minutiae, is a bold act in itself, and the filmmakers deserve a nod of credit right out of the chute just for attempting it.  And, happily, they deserve still more credit, as `Pearl Harbor,' directed by Michael Bay, goes on to successfully capture the pain, pathos, angst, frustration and fear born of that day that `Will live in infamy.'<br/><br/>	Told through the lives of two lifelong friends, Captain Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Captain Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), this is a movie of epic proportions presented on a personal level, which enables the audience to connect with the story on an emotional level and not just as an observer of a reenacted historical event.  And when Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Stewart (Kate Beckinsale) enters the story, it becomes even more involving, and as it builds in intimacy-- juxtaposed against these monumental events as they unfold-- it creates that empathy that really puts the viewer in the picture and gives that sense of total involvement.  This is nothing new to storytelling, of course; writers and movie makers have long understood that when dealing with events that are complex and larger than life, they have to be concentrated and presented from a personal perspective to effect a truly appreciable impact, and as James Cameron proved with `Titanic,' there's no better way to do it than with a love story.<br/><br/>	Without that intimacy between the characters, which is what provides the audience with a frame of reference and a specific element with which the viewer can identify, the impact of all that eventually happens would be significantly diminished.  Like Cameron (and many others before him), Bay recognizes this, and the approach he takes is therefore very effective.  By the time the attack comes, you know and care about the people involved, and it gives the tragedy of that day a personal, rather than just a national or historic perspective.  And though all that follows is visually stunning, it's that personal focus-- that singular involvement that's been so carefully crafted-- that predominates the moment and makes all the difference as far as what you're feeling and experiencing as you watch these horrific and horrendous events play out.<br/><br/>	Bay is also successful in evoking a true sense of time and place with this film, and he does it not only with authentic settings and visuals, but by giving the film itself a sense of cinematic sensibility that makes it more reminiscent of films like `Bombardier,' `Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' and `The Bridges At Toko-Ri,' than the more recent `Saving Private Ryan' (though it does have `Ryan's' same level of realism).  It's easy, in fact, to envision this film had it been made fifty or so years ago, with a cast that would've included Dana Andrews, Van Johnson and Gene Tierney as the principals, with Randolph Scott, Pat O'Brien and Eddie Albert in supporting roles.<br/><br/>	Heading up this cast, Affleck and Hartnett give strong, engaging performances, as does Kate Beckinsale, who successfully manages to take her character to a level beyond that of simply being the romantic interest of the story.  She makes Evelyn believable by responding honestly to the complexities of her character's situation, which in turn adds to the overall credibility of the fictionalized part of the story.  If there's an element in the story at all, in fact, that could be deemed questionable, it may be Rafe's reaction (some may argue, `over-reaction') to his personal situation; it is not, however, a reflection on Affleck's ability as an actor-- he gives a satisfying, credible performance-- but merely a subjective evaluation of his character's motivation.<br/><br/>	Giving memorable performances in supporting roles are Ewen Bremner as Lieutenant Red Winkle, and James King as Nurse Betty.  Also Notable, are Alec Baldwin as Lieutenant colonel Jimmy Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Dorie Miller, a Navy cook who rises to the occasion during the attack (though Gooding does bring a bit of melodrama to his portrayal), and especially Jon Voight, who is excellent in the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Tom Sizemore, however, as Sergeant Earl Sistern, falls into stereotype, and with the brim of his hat turned up comes across like an actor playing William Bendix playing a role in a war movie more than anything else.  In his defense, though, he does seem to do the best he can with the material he is given, and it is a fairly small part with little time for development.<br/><br/>	The additional supporting cast includes William Lee Scott (Lieutenant Billy Thompson), Jennifer Garner (Nurse Sandra), Mako (Admiral Yamamoto), Colm Feore (Admiral Kimmel), Leland Orser (Major Jackson), Scott Wilson (General Marshall), Peter Firth (Bennion) and Sara Rue (Nurse Martha).  One more qualified than I will have to comment on the historical `accuracy' of the film, but without question, `Pearl Harbor' succeeds in conveying the magnitude, scope and significance of the attack, and does it in a way that is emotionally involving and memorable.  It depicts a moment in history that-- regardless of how dark and horrible-- must never be forgotten; and, even as Steven Spielberg's `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan' did much to preserve their respective moments in history, so will this film help to insure that December 7, 1941, will forever be remembered.  I rate this one 8/10."
"Buddy-51","Null","1","3","2 January 2002"," great action scenes; dreadful story
","One can only speculate about how great a part timing plays in determining whether or not any particular film is a success or failure at the box office.  I suspect that had `Pearl Harbor' been released three or four months later than it was  in say September rather than June of 2001  it might have been able to ride the wave of renewed American patriotism that accompanied that other Day of Infamy, the September 11th terrorist attacks - and found itself some true financial glory.   As it is, the film will probably now enjoy a more lucrative life in its home video incarnation than it might otherwise have done under more normal circumstances.  So I guess, in some ways, the film's timing ends up being fortuitous after all.  <br/><br/>
Even from the start, one could see that `Pearl Harbor' was designed as a bald-faced attempt to replicate the unprecedented success of `Titanic.'  One is only amazed at how completely it fails.  In both films a simplistic love story has been grafted onto an historic event of monumental tragedy, one that is familiar to the audience beforehand, comes mostly at the end, and offers scads of special effects wizards gainful employment in bringing the episode to life on the screen.  In many ways, `Pearl Harbor' is simply the biggest, loudest and costliest example of that strange hybrid genre known as the `chick flick/war movie.'  (In this way, I guess filmmakers feel they have the whole date-night crowd covered).  Somehow, one expects to find romance on a cruise ship.  It feels right there.  A romantic story seems somehow less apropos as the foundation for a film on this particular subject.  In fact, the love triangle scenario that makes up fully the first half of this film's enormous three-hour running time is of such surpassing banality that one begins to wonder if anyone bothered to read the script before the actors were pushed out in front of the cameras.  For it is quite obvious that all the creative minds engaged in bringing this film to completion were focused far more on the massive reconstructed sets, elaborate explosions and jaw dropping special effects than on anything so simple and banal as character development or thematic depth.<br/><br/>
It would be hard to imagine three less interesting characters than Rafe (catch the All-American hero name yet!), Danny and Evelyn to serve as the focal point for a film on this important a subject.  The first two (played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are childhood buddies, now turned bomber pilots, who happen to fall in love with the same beautiful nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale).  Just think back to the complex characters at the core of `From Here to Eternity.'  In that film, so absorbing and grand were those figures and the situations in which they found themselves that the Pearl Harbor attack actually stayed, for the most part, in the background.  In `Pearl Harbor,' we are never allowed to forget that the sole purpose for the movie's existence is the attack sequence.  Every moment of the first half is painful to watch  from the awkward and silly first meetings, to the sappy and drippy love scenes, to the inevitable fistfight between the two best friends just hours before they will be called upon to demonstrate brotherhood in action for a greater cause.  Rick, the main character in `Casablanca,' uttered the famous truism that the travails of three insignificant people don't `amount to a hill of beans' in the face of events of global importance  and that philosophy has never seemed more on the money than in the case of `Pearl Harbor.'  But then when you are fretting over making back those untold millions you've lavished on your star-studded production, you don't dare allow yourself to entertain such subversive thoughts.  I hate to have to say this but the pasteboard love story that weakly props up `Pearl Harbor' ends up being an insult to both those who survived and those who perished in the holocaust.<br/><br/>What is NOT an insult to their memories, however, is the attack sequence itself.  Here the wretched movie almost redeems itself, for not only is this scene breathtakingly realized in its complexity and scope, but it also captures the poignancy of the devastation in amazingly graphic terms. The gruesomeness of much of the death and carnage put before us makes us fully appreciate, for the first time I think, the enormity of the horror and suffering that accompanied that event.  `Pearl Harbor' justifies its brilliant excesses by bringing this moment to epic life for a whole generation who has heretofore probably encountered it only as a highlighted study note in some dry high school or college textbook.   For a glorious half hour or so, the filmmakers husband all the resources of modern special effects to plunge us into an epochal moment in our nation's history.  Herr, indeed, is technological excess employed in a salutary purpose.<br/><br/>
The advantage in seeing `Pearl Harbor' on video rather than in the theatre is that, in the latter venue, one could only snooze through the torpid first half and wake refreshed when the bombs started dropping and the guns firing. Now, with the power of the remote in one's hand, one can simply fast forward to all the good parts and leave the sappy ones behind."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","2","10","1 February 2010"," Amazing spectacle, but what happened to the script?
","As we all know, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a major event in history, so why not do a film version? I do applaud a film that takes on a very ambitious project, and this film is indeed that. However, I was hugely disappointed in this film, it had huge potential but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Well there are some good things. Visually and technically the film looks phenomenal, the attention to detail is wonderful. The sets are realistic looking, the costumes are fine and the cinematography is stunning. The music by Hans Zimmer is pretty darn good as well, it really gives power to the climatic scenes. The action and special effects are very well done, the actual attack which forms the film's middle act is utterly riveting.<br/><br/>Sadly, everything else doesn't work. Shame really that one truly brilliant scene, a great score and wonderful visuals are literally gone to waste by a bloated plot, cardboard characterisations, questionable historical accuracy and an awful script.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is very long at 3 hours. Don't get me wrong I have absolutely no problem with long lengths, what was the real problem was the pace. It was so slow, that the slower scenes were close to tedious and there were parts at the beginning where I was finding it hard to keep awake. The plot is also very bloated, a lot is crammed in including a love story and old-fashioned heroics, but for a long film I was expecting a lot of attention to plot. But Michael Bay seemed to be concentrating a lot on the visual aspect of the film and seemed to have forgotten about the story. Consequently these details were underdeveloped, and the film is full to the brim with historical inaccuracies. The actors are undeniably talented, but they are given very little to work with. I had real difficulty empathising with any of the characters here, for me they seemed rather cardboard and clichéd. Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale both give lifeless performances and their chemistry is non-existent. Jon Voight is wasted yet again as Roosevelt, somehow he felt more like Dr Strangelove, and out of the cameos Dan Aykroyd especially is completely out of place. Bay's direction is also uneven, there are parts like in the attack itself where it is great but others where it is sloppy. But the worst asset was the script. It was AWFUL! It gave the actors very little to work with, and some of the dialogue instead of moving turned out to be unintentionally cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, this film was disappointing. There are some good moments, but a vast majority of it doesn't work. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

","Any time I watch Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) I feel obligated to re-watch this film. Nothing in this movie can be defended except the scenes portraying the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. That is only 30 minutes of the film. But even then the quick editing and computer graphics ruin the portrayal. Tora! Tora! Tora! is by far the better film. Yes, it is dated. Yes, it has its flaws. But it conveys the historical events in a way that a novice actually learns something about history. And the real strength of the film is in portraying the attack with real effects and no CGI. It has incredible visuals and the terrifying sound of the engines screaming through the sky and the bombs falling. There is no comparison between the two films. Watch Tora! Tora!

"TheAll-SeeingI","2","1","4","18 January 2019"," History-Lite
","As an entertainment vehicle, it can be argued that Pearl Harbor as a movie doesn't have to appeal to the history buff as its foremost objective; it's a major studio film which absolutely must sell tickets to serve its masters, and of course there can be forgiven elements of formula when a film is steadfastly required to accomplish that on a grand scale.<br/><br/>That said, it's been proven many times over that in a war-centric film, the solemn and thoughtful introduction of the brutal horrors of war can help us appreciate and forgive the simultaneous incorporation of any required turnstile-enabling mechanisms (in the case of Pearl Harbor, the concurrently running device of a love story). Sadly, this is a film that presents its human losses no differently or more poignantly than a prototypical shoot-em-up video game, as it's all too easy to get up off the couch from either unscathed. The dialogue presented is indeed weightless and at times wince-inducing. Affleck's superficial acting response - albeit to a superficial character and script - is redeemed in some career roles subsequent to this film, but Pearl Harbor is without question the bleakest of his self-inflicted acting wounds. Michael Bay has since become the highly notorious Michael Bay, towards whom many jokes of derision have since been directed (both appropriately and otherwise). Here, it proved disastrous to treat a subject of historical gravitas to his stylized inclinations.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor as a historical event is a fascinating and horrifying moment within the American fabric. Pearl Harbor as a movie doesn't aspire to convey that in a way that provides punctuation or lasting takeaways beyond its initial lite-fare consumption. Its failure as a film was surely foregone before the first frame was captured, and right after the creative approach was first baked in."

","So what did I think of Pearl Harbor? Awful, just awful. The only reason I'm giving this movie two stars is because the effects were good, yet the 1970 classic Tora! Tora! Tora! did a better job with no CGI, but with real fire, explosions, and models. Pearl Harbor gets some things correct, but most of it was wrong. Here are some examples<br/><br/>ADMIRAL YAMAMOTO NEVER COMMANDED THE JAPANESE STRIKE FORCE.
So, first off, the movie shows Admiral Yamamoto on the aircraft carrier Akagi. This is wrong because Yamamoto was in Japan during the operation. The Striking Force was commanded by Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. While Yamamoto planned the attack, he did not command the fleet that carried it out.<br/><br/>BEN AFFLECK IS FIGHTING WITH THE BRITISH, EVEN THOUGH THE AMERICANS WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE WAR YET.<br/><br/>Affleck's character is fighting in the Battle of Britain with RAF fighter pilots. One, he is fighting a Spitfire or Hurricane with POLISH markings on it, because there were Polish volunteers in the air war, and Poland was invaded at the beginning of the war, which is why the war started, so the Polish could fire at the Germans. Two, America was not in the war until after Pearl Harbor, American pilots only started fighting with British pilots until September of 1942! So doesn't their need to be a state of war between the US and the Nazis for Affleck to be firing at German planes?<br/><br/>THE HOSPITALS WERE NOT FIRED ON DURING THE ATTACK.<br/><br/>During the attack, the town and hospital are strafed and bombed by the Japanese. Honolulu was never strafed during the attack! Yes, it is true that civilian fire trucks were strafed and some civilian firefighters were killed... NO NURSES WERE KILLED! I was just very mad and angry to see the nurses weeping over their friend the nurses death, not because she was killed by the Japanese, but because it never happened.<br/><br/>THE QUEEN MARY WAS A TROOPSHIP IN 1941, NOT AN OCEAN LINER.<br/><br/>Affleck and whats her face steal a police boat and get on the RMS Queen Mary. The Queen Mary was one of the fastest ships in the world through the late 1930's, throughout the 40's, and in the early 50's. Today, she is a hotel and tourist attraction in Long Beach California. Just one problem... When the party on board is supposed to be happening, the ship was a troop transport, transporting troops across the Atlantic to Europe. PEOPLE!!!! THERE IS A WAR GOING ON!!! ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE A MILITARY VESSEL FROM COMBAT AND SAY ""HEY! LETS HAVE A PARTY!"" They could have done those scenes in say, a nightclub in NYC.<br/><br/>So... Did you people not do any research into the war? You combined two Japanese admirals into one, sent an American pilot to fight in Europe, which was against the rules of war, killed a nurse and bombed a hospital to make us cry I guess? And you take a military vessel from service on war duties for a party.<br/><br/>If you people want a better Pearl Harbor movie, watch Tora! Tora! Tora! from 1970."
"filipemanuelneto","3","1","4","12 February 2018"," A missed opportunity
","The Second World War is undoubtedly the conflict that cinema most portrayed. The movie list is almost inexhaustible but the good movies list is much smaller, and I don't know if ""Pearl Harbor"" can enter that list. Addressing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the main American military port in the Pacific at the time, the film has huge cons. Michael Bay tried to focus on realism, historical accuracy, romance (the lead story is a love triangle, in which two childhood friends engage the same girl) and special effects, trying to do something different and better than it's direct competitors, with whom it would inevitably be compared (for example, the enshrined ""Tora Tora Tora"" or the more recent ""Saving Private Ryan"").<br/><br/>But despite all the hard work, the film exaggerates so much in everything that has lost quality. For example, the love story that links all events (ranging from the Battle of Britain to the Doolittle Raid) is so sappy and cliched that it seems to have been copied from a cheap novel or a soap opera. The film is so sugary that it was even compared to ""Titanic"" because of that. To make things worse, the characters are so poorly constructed that the audience never really cares about them. What interest does it have if that girl dates one of those guys, the two, or goes to a convent? Although they gained notoriety with this film, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale were not able to shine at all and I think they will not carry good memories of this film. Other problems in the script are the ""black-and-white"" perspective of war and world, and the inability to portray facts outside the ""canonical version"" of the story: Americans are the good guys, who were quiet in their corner, japs are the bad guys who treacherously attacked that little Hawaiian paradise. Although the film shows that there was an imminent danger of an attack and that statement was discredited, it never shows the great interest that the US (and Roosevelt) really had in being attacked, in order to finally be able to fully justify the entering into a war that would make economy (still trying to get back up from the 1929 crash) make a lot of money. We know that there are even indications that the US provoked Japan in order to be attacked. The film ignores all this, preferring to portray American heroism, but historical accuracy shouldn't be limited to the choice of an airplane or paint for a ship, but must also (and mainly) be used in the way the story is told to the public. That didn't happen here.<br/><br/>If the script is bad and very fragile, the film improves when we observe the technical questions. The special effects are good, the state of the art when the film was released, but they end up catching your attention so grandly that you stop believing what you see. You don't feel the danger, you know they will survive by a hair, threading the plane through a hole in a needle or by some other unbelievable way. Then you just watch and expect them to finish playing with the planes and blow things up. The soundtrack is forgettable, and the best are in fact a few hits from the Forties that were introduced in the film."
"sarah_a29035","10","1","4","18 February 2013"," Best movie I have seen in a LONG time!
","This movie is incredible. However, if you are looking for something that is primarily action (ie Black Hawk Down) you won't find it in Pearl Harbor. Though this movie mainly focuses on the relationships of Danny, Rafe and Evelyn, I think something more in depth is being examined. Since the story of Pearl Harbor is told through the relationships of the main characters, the movie really becomes personal. As you watch and observe how the war affects those who are participants, and those who are loved ones of the participants, you begin to better understand and gain an appreciation for the difficulty that those who fought and still do fight for our country went/go through. Pearl Harbor reveals the hardships and horror of war and the toll it takes on those directly involved. Most war movies I have watched are mostly focused on the fighting, bombing, etc. While those movies may be interesting to watch one time on a weekend movie night, they have not stuck in my mind. Pearl Harbor is an emotional film that goes deeper than the action and really leaves an impact on the watcher. Don't let the 3 hours deter you from watching this film either! Its one of those movies that you want to continue on for a good length of time. Plus, this amount of time is needed in the movie to fully develop the plot. I honestly cannot praise this movie enough!

This is about dozens of ships, planes, and people fighting against an invading enemy. Titanic was excellent, but this movie was nothing like it(besides the romance).<br/><br/>Another thing that people complain about is its historical inaccuracy. Those people have to know that to make a historical moment into a drama film, you must adjust some things. Plus, if you add in everything that was important, as well as all historical moments, the length of the film can be higher than it already is.<br/><br/>The last criticism is, that this movie was too long. Three hours and ten minutes is not long! If you are fine watching Titanic, you should be perfectly fine watching Pearl Harbor. There is absolutely no reason to complain about its length if it tells the story very well.<br/><br/>The actors/actresses in the movie made it come alive! Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett are all fantastic actors. The supporting cast was also excellent and recognizable.

","I can't believe how many people said they hated this movie. Sure, it may not be entirely historically accurate, but a story's first purpose is to entertain, or people won't watch it. I think this does a great job of entertaining, but you can't see that if you sit through it just trying to nitpick little details that don't detract from the story.<br/><br/>A lot of people said the love triangle is clichéd and corny. Personally, although it isn't the most original idea to have two best friends fall for the same girl, I thought the love triangle added depth to the story. I didn't feel the characters were flat at all, and I liked Danny especially. When he died, I felt sad, and it made the tragedy of all the people that died in WWII real to me. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was amazing, but not for those who want a history lesson.

Its all very well watching a film about a known historical event, but didn't Hollywood always do these things? How difficult to get all the designs/vehicles right. 8/10 because of the inaccuracies. I even wondered if the Dollittle bit was an extra fiction bit to round the film off and say, see, we did have a go back, risked it to say take that.. BUT NO? It happened? Well, there you go.I've been educated tonight. The end bit of Ai was criticised, but to me it worked. IT rounded the film off nicely. And as one of the characters in this one I guess, had to 'not come back'.. for the sake of the story line.. again.. OK."
"vip_ebriega","7","1","4","13 March 2009"," Not as bad as they say.
","My take: An expensive, old-fashioned epic rather than the historical event it promises. Not nearly as bad as critics have reported.<br/><br/>Since its release and up until now, Bay and Bruckheimer's version of ""the day which will live in infamy"" remains much-maligned and heavily criticized. Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as ""...And then I kissed him"" or ""I'll be back for you""? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go ""woosh!!"" in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.<br/><br/>Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage à trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.<br/><br/>But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog (""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant."") is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.<br/><br/>But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures. But what it lacks in human and character dimension, it makes up in pure spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and the production design is spectacular. Hans Zimmer's score is adequate to the film's dramatic and patriotic tones (with the addition of Faith Hill's theme song ""There You'll Be"", there are guaranteed misty eyes while the credits roll).<br/><br/>There are definitely better films about Pearl Harbor, including an accurate one (TORA! TORA! TORA!) and a similarly dramatic one (FROM HERE TO ETERNITY). But just because there are even better choices doesn't mean the lesser one's make bad choices. PEARL HARBOR, while never going to be on the same league as the said films, is still an enjoyable piece of ""they don't make 'em like this anymore"" entertainment. For accuracy, go see TORA! TORA! TORA! But for pure, old-fashioned entertainment, PEARL HARBOR just about gives me what I have paid for.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","If you've been assigned to write a term paper on America's entry into WW II and you're too lazy to read, this movie will not help you as to it being a reliable source of factual information. There was a real attack on the Pearl Harbor base on 7 December 1941. The attack was chaotic and a real tragedy. There are some real-life characters portrayed in this film, e. g. FDR, Jimmy Dolittle,et al Beyond these and a few other (loose) facts, this film is strictly entertainment, filled with action and ""romance."" If you're looking for an education and you want factual info on real life events, ask someone who was there. Not many of them still around who were at Pearl Harbor on that day, but they are out there. PS The comment about ""bikinis"" under TRIVIA is a bit off. Kate B. was wearing a 2-piece sunsuit common in the day. Her outfit was not a bikini. Take Care!"

And that is only because of Ben Affleck. They have no idea what war was actually going on when they are done watching. The one point goes for the air raid of the American base.

","Everyone's so hard on this film and, admittedly, it deserves some criticism. Some of the lines are flat and the ""love triangle"" plot definitely gets in the way of the rest of the story. Also, the love scenes between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are downright laughable. Still, the attack scene is some of the best film-making I've ever seen. The magnitude, scope, and shock are all conveyed perfectly. There's also lots of other things to like here. For one, the film-makers have definitely captured the essence of pre-war Hawaii. Finally, much of the supporting cast turns in top-notch performances: Dan Ackroyd, Tom Sizemore and, especially, John Voight as FDR. My recommendation? Rent it on a Sunday afternoon on the biggest TV screen you can find, make some popcorn, and enjoy the ride."
"fuzzylarmas","8","1","4","27 May 2006"," Batti, get a life please or at least a love.
","OK, it's not as good as other war dramas, such as Band of Brothers, but still was excellent. As a British teenager, I tended to have been brought up on war tales such as the Blitz and the Battle of Britain. Pearl harbour is briefly mentioned as the catalyst that brought the U.S.A into WW2, but never given much thought or detail. So one day as I was off from school with nothing to do, i rummaged round the old video case and found a dusty version of Pearl Harbour. I knew facts about it, the date which ""will live in infamy"" and the aforementioned catalyst. So i decided i had nothing to lose and watched it.<br/><br/>What i found unravelling before my eyes was a fantastic and heart wrenching movie, if a little on the long side at 176 mins.<br/><br/>The storyline takes you along the journey of two best friends in the U.S.Airforce, played by Ben Affleck (in one of the best roles i've seen him play) and a young Josh Hartnett, fantastic as a young pilot in training and a devoted best friend.<br/><br/>In comes Kate Beckinsale as the customary love interest, looking amazing as a Navy nurse. Obviously Afflecks character falls for her, but then his application to join the Battle of Britain in Eagle Squadron comes through and he has to leave her to fight. They promise they are in love and write as often as they can.<br/><br/>In contrast, both Kate and josh get posted in Pearl Harnour, Hawaii. Very peaceful and idyllic. <br/><br/>News comes of Ben's death, obviously both are devastated. Three months later, Kate's friends urge her to move on and Josh and she have a chance meeting, leading up to all sorts of things in a vacant hangar.<br/><br/>Ben comes back, realises whats going on, but meanwhile the build up that has been running throughout this overture of love, Japanese planning, and American attempted code cracking reach the climax as Pearl Harbour is attacked,.<br/><br/>The scenes are intense, and I never realised to what full extend happened that day on December 7th 1941. the sub-plot with Cuba Gooding Jr. is fantastic and shows the racial inequalities of the Americans in the 20th century, and is heartwarming when he receives what he justly deserves.<br/><br/>Back to the plot and Josh and Ben off to the hangar to counter attack. <br/><br/>They succeed and become enrolled in the secret mission of Doolittle squadron. The love triangle deepens when Kate becomes pregnant.<br/><br/>The outcome of the secret mission I won't spoil for you, but the film works out with a mixed sad and happy ending, with the last scene so heartwarming you feel all fuzzy inside. I found this film thoroughly enjoyable and very informative. Contrary to batti's statements, this is not a fill about America good, Japan bad, as scenes featuring the Japanese commander shows his inferior saying :<br/><br/>"" You are a brilliant man, sir"" with him replying:<br/><br/>"" A brilliant man would know how to settle this without fighting a war."" Very True."

","I didn't think the movie was as bad as most of the critics did.<br/><br/>Yes, the story is overly simplistic, there is little historical perspective and attention to detail, but what's the big deal? The movie is what it was intended to be: a high-budget, typical Hollywood blockbuster, to be taken all-at-once with a good dose of popcorn and beer.<br/><br/>What's wrong with that? Not all films can or should be artistic masterpieces! The camera and sound is excellent (the Oscar for sound f/x was well deserved), the acting is good to very good (Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous in the 40's look) and overall, the movie is fun to watch, it provides for 3 hours of very decent entertainment.<br/><br/>Just don't expect any metaphysical musings and you'll be alright."

But anyways I thought the acting was okay, but again romance and war don't mix. Just like women and machinery don't mix.<br/><br/>This movie had terrific action and I felt like I was in the middle of the battle. But I've found out how inaccurate this movie was and now It really ruined the movie.

"ElKabong-3","3","1","4","16 August 2005"," A steaming pile of dung, but very heroic dung
","Ridden with clichés, a predictable cornball back story, this film manages to take one of the more monumental tales of the 20th century and reduce it to a tale of a love triangle in uniform. The main characters are stiffly played, and so unrealistic that I was unable to care about their fates by the end of the picture. 2 hero wannabes fall in love with a nurse who can't keep her legs together (my interpretation). Her true love is reported missing in action, and she responds to the news by putting out for his best friend. The Pearl Harbor story spills over into the story of the famous Doolittle raid on Japan. Alec Baldwin emotes the role of Doolittle with his typical hammy style, causing the audience to begin to sympathize with Japanese anti-aircraft guns, and hope that they are successful in shooting down the mission, even if after their bombs have been delivered. An enormous effort was made to take this epic historic war drama and reduce it to cornball melodrama.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 (Rent the Victory at Sea series if you want a quality WW2 film experience)"

","Everyone who is so eagerly writing in to say that this movie is awful because their is this love story this is for you. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT. This movie was not made to teach you guys about Pearl Harbor, if you want to go pick up a book. This movie was made to humanize the attack on Pearl Harbor, to give the event a face which would teach people the horrors of the attack. For the people who say this movie is an anti Japan movie then you guys have no idea what your talking about either. Although I do not have any prejudice towards Japan the fact is that on Dec. 7th 1941 they attacked us with no cause and killed many Innocent people in the process. No where in this movie does Micheal Bay depict Japan as anything other then a country that attacked us, nowhere does he purposely depict them in a bad light and certainly not a some second class nation that the US will just crush, he actually if anything shows the genius behind their attack and shows them as a military force that should not be written off. If you guys want to see a movie that shows the US as a big bad force that is needed every where then go watch The Last Samurai where Zwick felt it necessary for the US to take credit for training Japan's army when in reality the US never sent any military officers over to Japan during that time period."

","I just recently (2004) saw this movie and now regret not having seen it earlier. This was a truly entertaining HISTORICAL FICTION, and much more than merely a war epic. It was an Audio/Visual extravaganza - where no expense was spared, and tremendous attention to detail was paid on the scenery, costumes, buildings, room decor, music, etc.<br/><br/>The movie included an excellent romantic side-plot (with amazing nostalgia such as: bidding farewell thru old fashioned revolving doors).

"BStalker","10","1","4","22 July 2002"," If you can adjust to the style, it's awesome.
","Clearly many viewers disliked this movie.  Passionately.  Chances are the same people hated Armageddon.  Passionately.  Michael Bay has a distinctive style which produces powerful reactions - either you go with it and enjoy the rollercoaster ride, or it doesn't work for you and his style comes across as shallow and painfully cheesy.  IF you let yourself dumb down and take in the visuals instead of expecting a war movie in a similar vein to all the other recent attempts, you should find huge enjoyment in the film. Indeed, it was the second highest grossing film of 2001 behind Shrek which suggests it can't have been hated by everyone.<br/><br/>Personally, I think expectations were too high with people looking for another Titanic/Saving Private Ryan.  The first hour is admittedly a little slow, but this is the price for the BEST 45 mins of action ever put to screen.  This is the only film I've ever seen where the CGI is almost always indistinguishable from the real stuff.  Somehow Lord of the Rings won the Visual Effects oscar instead, despite having some fairly poor effects at times.  The hour of light-weight romantic build up gives the battle scene greater power by having such a strong contrast between the frivolous love story and such a momentous historical tragedy - especially in the recent Director's Cut which restores all the battle violence that was originally trimmed for the necessary PG-13 Theatrical rating.<br/><br/>The last part of the film was heavily criticised for it's apparent ridiculousness and what looks like a heavily contrived upbeat conclusion. However, the Doolittle raid is portrayed fairly accurately (most of Alec Baldwin's dialogue is a word-for-word copy of Doolittle's actual speeches). As far as the nastier details of the campaign are concerned (e.g. Japanese treatment of captured pilots), financial pressure from the Japanese market forced some omissions.  As far as the somewhat contrived love story is concerned - blame Disney.  They only agreed to put up the huge budget on the condition that a love story was included.<br/><br/>Basically, if you go with the cheese, the film is immensely powerful and entertaining.  If you are just too cynical, or unable to enjoy ""dumber"" films, then there is little chance of making it through the entire film without vomiting.<br/><br/>Bay's style, like Tony Scott or John Woo, is highly distinctive and quite probably an indication of the style that will become more popular over the next few years as audience intelligence and attention spans continue to decrease.  Perhaps then, Pearl Harbor will be more appreciated.  Currently it is simply too uncomfortable a mix of Bruckheimer dumb action/romance and serious war film for most people. Those of you who haven't seen it, try the Director's Cut - you might like it."

Teaming up again from the 1998 summer blockbuster Armageddon, (also starring Ben Aflect) The 2 bring the events of before, during and after the faithful events of December 7th,1941.<br/><br/>The film starts off as a flashback in the 20's were our two charaters are playing on an old cropduster. Both clearly have dreams of becoming a fighter pilot and leading a squadran into battle against germans. But when little rafe and danny play around in rafes fathers cropduster, there first flying lesson isnt exactly a doozy.<br/><br/>Now cut to the early 40's. With both friends in the air force craving battle in the war, the only thing that stops them from actuley doing it is Americas will to stay out of the war. Soon rafe meets a young nurse and a weve seen it all before but we wana see it again romance blossoms. But things are about to change for rafe and danny, when rafe is sent to england to help fight off the luwafa with the R.A. But during one such battle, Rafe is forced to ditch, and declared dead.<br/><br/>The young nurse evelin, heartbroken, turns to danny for comfort, and the two fall for another as in the background, the japs prepare for there attack on the pacific fleet.<br/><br/>Suddenly in comes Rafe, aperentley not dead and a love tringle appears. Fighting for the same woman, danny and rafe soon become rivals. But just as the rivaly cools down, the harbor heats up. And its aftermath and americas revenge takes place by John Dolittle, in a exelent climax battle over tokyo.<br/><br/>Filled with all the horrors of war and the glory of victory and revenge, this film packs a punch. With more stunning dog fights, bombings, everything you can think of exploding, and simply stunning special effects, you WILL experience the bombing of pearl harbor. An exelent epic, chock filled with sappy romance, more stunning dog fights the the whole star wars trilogy combined, sinking ships that make the titanic look like a water slide ride, and amazing special effects that look so real, if wasnt for the screen, would leave your pants brown. Add to that a nice simplfied history lesson, and saving privete ryans horrors of war (toned down on the gore, but not on the fear and horror) you have an epic on your hands that can only be experienced in the theaters. WARNING: When on home video, if you buy the pan and scan vhs version of this film, you deserve to be hung! Truly a theater experence, you will walk away from this film stunned, sad, and shaking with fear and pride.<br/><br/>THE ROUNDUP<br/><br/>ACTING: Great, some oscar worthy proforamces in Alic Baldwins john dolittle,John Voights ROSEVELT.

I bought a DVD and tried about 2-3 times to see it, and the furthest I could go was an hour(that's about 1/3 of the movie.)<br/><br/>When I was in 10th grade(age 16), we were required to watch the actual Pearl Harbor attack scene, and that is one of the few bits that I have seen AND enjoyed.<br/><br/>I also had interest in the opening scene with the 2 boys in the plane and the eye exam scene, but otherwise this movie was dull and just dragged.<br/><br/>I appear to not be the only one against this movie. My youth pastor and I(I hope he doesn't mind me bringing him up)had a discussion or 2 about how bad this movie is. His main issue is that they took an important part of history and twisted it into a love story.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert didn't care for it either, writing: ""Pearl Harbor"" is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.<br/><br/>Its centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality.<br/><br/>The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialog, it will not be because you admire them.""<br/><br/>I disagree with Ebert often, but the fact that we both dislike a movie AND gave it the same rating(1.5/4=4/10), also considering that I didn't see the whole thing, all says something.<br/><br/>My youth pastor, myself and Roger Ebert all agree this movie is bad. Aside from very few exceptions, I don't know many who actually call Pearl Harbor a good movie. That should tell you something.<br/><br/>Edit: I woke up the morning after writing this and ALREADY had a ""not helpful"" vote. If you don't like my review, please just read another! These are my detailed, though-out reasons why I don't suggest Pearl Harbor. Please put positive votes in here!"
"mitsubishizero","2","1","5","14 April 2019"," Surprisingly boring and inaccurate
","This movie is 3 hours long! I remember telling myself I wouldn't watch this movie but my curiosity got the best of me and needless to say it wasn't worth it. It was so long I couldn't finish it at all because it drags on. The movie's inaccurate, the characters are bland and forgettable, the writing's super clunky and the story's just insulting. It's basically Titanic but in WW2 which's pretty disrespectful when you think about it. Rafe McCawley(Ben Affleck) and Daniel ""Danny"" Walker(Josh Hartnett) are best friends who decide to enlist in the Air Force (then a part of the Army) out of patriotism. Their stunts get the attention of Jimmy Doolittle(Alec Baldwin) who scolds Rafe then advises him to transfer to Britain to fight there. While on a mission he gets shot down and is presumed dead. His girlfriend Evelyn(Kate Beckinsale) who's a nurse is devastated and turns to Danny for support which leads to a romance between the two. Rafe is alive afterall and after a misunderstanding between the 2 they fight in a bar before escaping and making up afterwards.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in Japan the navy's planning a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in response to America cutting off their oil supply. The scene of the attack is cool but it's also inaccurate and hollow. The Japanese never fired on the hospital despite it being in their range and as for Dorie Miller(Cuba Gooding Jr.) his role is very limited. You'd think the movie would focus more on him considering he was a real hero but no. The scene where FDR gets up from his wheelchair while uplifting is unrealistic. There're plenty other inaccuracies but that's just the tip of the iceburg. Bottomline, skip this movie it's not worth it. After reeling from the ambush the U.S. finally declares war on Japan and Germany and the Air Force prepares for the Doolittle Raid (which did little damage as depicted in the movie). Rafe and Danny are one of the many pilots who volunteer to bomb Tokyo despite being trained as fighter pilots. After they complete their mission they crash land in china and almost get captured by the japanese. While fending them off Danny ends up getting fatally shot by one of them and before he dies Rafe tells him that Evelyn's pregnant with his kid. Rafe is rescued and becomes Evelyn's husband as well as the stepdad to his friend's son also called Danny. The film ends with him taking him on a plane ride into the sunset.<br/><br/>The movie's not just inaccurate but it's also melodramatic and puts focus on the wrong things. The characters are bland and have little personality, and like I said it's so disrespectful to the actual event. It tries to be the next Titanic and Top Gun and fails. The tragic event serves as a backdrop for a sappy love triangle. The action scenes are cool but they're short and kind've hollow like the rest of the story. Bottomline, skip this movie, it's terrible."

I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid (??? - an early warning sign). I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor, for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970, allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous big-budget movie about Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora."

","Where does one begin in trying to describe this joke of a movie. Do we start with the ridiculous ""southern"" accents of the two lead characters, accents that they did not have when the flashback scenes showed them as kids? How about the frosted hair of army pilot Affleck? Maybe the fact that 3/4 of the movie is shot in slow motion, for no apparent reason? Or Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Fred Sanford impersonation and celebratory dance after he shoots down a zeke, while countless other planes continue to fly over? Maybe we should deal with the numerous historical inaccuracies, such as the Japanese strafing a hospital, which never happened? How about Jon Voight's hilarious and over the top performance as FDR? This ""film"" should have been burned and the director shot. I want a congressional investigation into how this got made.

","Pearl Harbor (2001): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight: One of Hollywood's great big lies. It is not so much about the 1941 attack by Japanese forces as it is about the pathetic love triangle where two soldiers fight to get into the pants of a nurse. With that said the title is misleading. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are the two war buddies and Kate Beckinsale plays the nurse and the big highlight is a love scene underneath a parachute. Remember, this is advertized as a war film. What a load of bullshit. There is an embarrassing needle injecting scene where Beckinsale passes Affleck even though his vision isn't the best. They have a corny romance before he goes off to war where he is reported dead but he makes a surprise return only to find her and Hartnett banging like porn stars. Stupid tearjerker ending for the suckers. An embarrassment for Michael Bay who previously made the idiotic Armageddon. Pitiful opening regarding a kid accidentally starting a plane. That should key viewers in to just how stupid this garbage truly is. Dreadful acting by Affleck, Hartnett and Beckinsale with Cuba Gooding Jr. deserving better. Jon Voight plays the stupidest United States President since Bill Pullman in Independence Day. With no broad Japanese roles the film becomes a racist $140 million hunk of sh*t. Score: 1 / 10"

","This movie was absolutely breathtaking. The actors were phenomenal, the soundtrack is amazing, the plot is just mind blowing with sudden turn of events, great setting and props, and MUCH MUCH more. In my opinion, this movie is better than a lot of other war movies I've seen, and I've seen A LOT. in my opinion, this movie is even better than Saving Private Ryan. This movie is greatly underrated that is irritates and even angers me sometimes. It's a very beautiful film that I think everyone should watch. I don't understand why it has such low ratings. Even without the romance, this movie would still be amazing. I have not yet found a thing I do not like about this movie. I'm actually surprised it doesn't have as high ratings as I thought. What a shame. Very good work done by the director and casting directors."
"loopmyworld","9","1","5","17 March 2012"," No matter what people & critics say about this movie but this is Bay's finest job behind camera !!!!
","I really don't understand the concept of people hating this movie. I mean can someone please explain me where this movie lacks soul, a good direction, background score & screenplay. The movie is 3 hours long & to be honest I hate watching movies which are so lengthy specially 3 hours. I want to watch Godfather but couldn't since the movie has 3 hours of runtime. This is the only movie which I took a risk of watching & believe me I didn't felt bored even for a sec in the whole movie. To describe movie in 1 word, I would say MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>The movie begins two childhood friends desires to become air force pilot. The characters of Raff & Danny are well scripted & the cast is been placed perfectly for the movie. Kate looks beautiful & charming lady working as a nurse in a navy. The love triangle between Raff, Evelyn & Danny is beautifully scripted & executed throughout the whole movie. The first 70 mins are totally based on the main characters life which I believe very well directed there was neither too much or less or romance in between Raff, Evelyn & Danny. Meanwhile Japanese makes a strategy to attack America on Pearl Harbor. The movie takes sudden twist when japs plans to attack Pearl Harbor which according me takes movie to new level. The start of air attack on Pearl Harbor are the soul of the movie. The 40 mins of Pearl Harbor attack is gonna blow you away. The action sequences at its best, & of course it will be cause Michael Bay is behind camera. Best use of cgi in that year made this movie to have the best war action sequence ever hit Hollywood screens. The attack on Pearl Harbor what I believe wont have been better if any other director would have directed this movie. The action any days beats the war action sequences we see today in other movies. The cast of the movie is well very casted, each & every character has a crucial role in this movie. You won't find yourself saying that this character was useless in this movie. The background score of the movie is was soothing, the japs score is perfect scored & mostly importantly the score of Pearl Harbor attack scenes adds more emotions to the movie.<br/><br/>I don't understand why people & critics says that the love triangle wasn't needed in this movie at all. OK tell me what about Titanic, jack & rose meet up on a ship just for 2 days & they fell in love sooo deeply with each other, don't you find this hard to digest if we look practically. The love triangle takes months before attack on Pearl, which completely makes sense. Titanic sinking scenes adds emotions to the people but what about this movie, there should be more emotions involved in this movie cause this movie is based on true history, while on the other hand jack & rose are fictional characters created by James Cameroon. Well both Titanic & Pearl Harbor are completely different movie & Titanic is my all time classic movie. But we cannot say that Pearl Harbor lacks emotions in the war sequences, people Bay wanted to show the attack on Harbor to show the reality nor a emotional movie for ladies to carry with hankie in their hands. Of course there was so many moments which made me emotional too, specially when Danny dies & the last scene of the movie. Stop criticizing about the movie lack emotions, if you want emotional movies to watch. Better consider yourself as a women who cry's even on a small stupid scenes.<br/><br/>OK the next thing, why people always blame Bay for his work, why don't you blame the writer's who actually writes the movie not Bay. OK we understand what Bay has all the authority to make some changes in the script but still he is not that fool enough to direct movies which will make people & critics blame & abuse him for his work. Appericiate for what work he has done either criticizing him. This is no doubt Bay's finest work behind camera & has been executed & portrait perfectly well on big screens. I regret myself for didn't watching this movie in theaters as I was just 14 that time & would have gone to watch it. I have seen the documentary of Pearl Harbor on National Geography, no doubt it reveals the important & crucial details about Pearl Harbor. But still Bay wanted to show the real disaster not some kind of a documentary.<br/><br/>Watch Pearl Harbor it's a highly recommended movie. The movie which got everything a viewer needs in a movie. <br/><br/>MY RATING – 10/10 WAY TO GO BAY !!!!!"

"callanvass","3","1","5","25 May 2010"," Too long, too boring and much too over produced.
","Pearl Harbor is yet another example of why I get so frustrated with Michael Bay. Aside from a few good projects like The Island, Transformers and a couple of others, he's generally trash. There is no heart to this film, and it doesn't know whether it wants to be serious or jokey in tone half the time, which ended up grating me to no end. Ben Affleck has proved to improve his abilities since than, but at around this time he couldn't act worth a lick!. His obvious wooden performance is quite the turn off, while Josh Hartnett who I actually like a lot of the time isn't much better. The love storyline plods ever so terribly and I didn't give a damn what was going on, while Michael Bay makes the action scenes much too overblown once again.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Pearl Harbor is not worth the long running time it has. Save yourself the torture, and if you must, rent some of his better work.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Well, after hearing all the bad reviews of this, i sat down fully expecting to be disappointed. However, in spite of a weak love triangle (I agree it was awful), i think the rest of the film was great! Although it isn't the best war film ever or the most accurate one, i'm sure any of the actors or crew would say that they never intended to offend anyone by it being unfaithful to the real heroes of Pearl Harbour and the DoLittle Raid, and so if you watch it with a pinch of salt and don't compare it to the greats like Saving Private Ryan, then you actually get an enjoyable film out of it. The war scene's are good, the music lovely, and the actors aren't all that bad. So my advice? Sit down, watch it without being overly critical.... and you might just find a film that will become one of your favourites, as i did. And well.. the ending, lets just say, i bet you cry :)"
"november_ran","9","1","5","24 May 2008"," you can't deny it's an epic romance
","we all know about the massive dislike for this movie due to its apparent blatant disregard for the people involved in the pearl harbor attack. what needs to be seen here is that this film is an epic romance like few other, and it's Michael Bay at his sensationalistic best.<br/><br/>The sweeping angled shots, the slow motion sequences, the consistently dramatic and intense score....it all works as long as you can get over yourself enough to be able to appreciate the great storytelling going on here.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for anyone who can watch this film and not be truly moved by the poignancy of it all. When it comes down to it, this film is about the romance, and they really do it well. Admittedly some scenes may be a little stressed (having your gal sitting on your knee in the cockpit while you do a barrel roll?); but this isn't a problem for the romantic idealist that most of us are lucky enough to have somewhere within us.<br/><br/>We all loved Cuba Gooding jr's character; i challenge anyone to deny they had goosebumps when he manned that gun and let out a maddening scream as he shot down that plane.<br/><br/>I imagine Alec Baldwin's character is what pushed the haters of this movie over the top. He was a perfect stereotype, delivering the macho-hero-patriot-badass-never say die lines. It's sensationalism, its exaggerated it's painfully Hollywood, but it fits, and you can't help but love it.<br/><br/>In terms of pure entertainment, and pulling at the heart strings, this film is tough to beat. I am a fan of the classics, i love the indie circuit, but most of all my main criteria when judging a film is if it can move you, and the impact that it leaves. We all know this film scores high in this area...and il say again if you aren't affected by it, then maybe you should try and think back to when you became so jaded or distracted from what fascinated and moved you in younger years."

It will take your breath away.Just be patient and watch it all.

I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. Say what you want about it. But the acting was great, the story was compelling and it gets my approval. The only thing I have to say against it is the length. It is a very long movie, especially with the directors cut. While it's true that there are historical inaccuracies, this movie tells a story that must be told. Again and again. The lives that were lost, the event, the day must be remembered. For my generation it makes that day come alive. It's something that shouldn't be forgotten and this movie takes you back to that moment, to that time and for me, it's one of the best WWII movies I've seen. That's why I give it 10 stars."

The film was quite simply excellent, the chemistry between the cast members is amazing (Kate Beckinsale's performance was stunning)and the special effects were superb. You really get a sense of the horrors of the attack on Pearl Harbour.

","PEARL HARBOR <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8<br/><br/>(35mm and 70mm release prints)<br/><br/>On the eve of America's entry into World War II, two young fighter pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) - friends since childhood - are driven apart by their love for a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale), but they're forced to set aside their differences when Japanese forces attack the US naval base at Pearl Harbor...<br/><br/>One of the most expensive - and vilified - films of its day, this gargantuan epic stands accused of exploiting historical tragedy for commercial gain, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (notorious for a string of opportunistic blockbusters) and director Michael Bay (previously responsible for such unassuming action fare as ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon""). This argument may - or may not - have merit, but as a *movie*, PEARL HARBOR is romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned, like a 1940's picture postcard come to life. And as a spectacle, it's hard to beat: The attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the most breathtaking set-pieces in Hollywood history, offering a pilot's-eye view of the aerial bombardment, the destruction on the ground, and the horrendous loss of life. It may seem exploitative to some viewers, but Bay uses modern technology (including a terrific multichannel soundtrack) to capture the drama, heartbreak and horror of the occasion like never before.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace's overheated script is a little too jingoistic in places (co-star Alec Baldwin is much given to speechifying in this regard), but the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett is depicted with great tenderness and affection, and while their dispute over Beckinsale is probably the least engaging aspect of the entire production, the pay-off still packs quite an emotional wallop. The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Mako and Dan Aykroyd, with Jon Voight as President Roosevelt (his speech to Congress on 8 December 1941 remains as powerful today as it ever was). Try to see the R-rated director's cut, which offers a slightly more graphic - and therefore more honest - depiction of the death and destruction inflicted on American servicemen (and women) during the Pearl Harbor disaster."

","If people want to learn the precise history of Pearl Harbor or America's role in WW2, they can read a book or watch one of the many TV series'/films/documentaries that have been made on the topic. 'Pearl Harbor' never set out to fit into those categories.<br/><br/>Instead, Pearl Harbor tells the truly heart-wrenching stories of three young lovers and their friends as their world is torn apart by war. The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor is only a minor moment of the film, as it is what happened before and after the event that is most important to this film's story. Up until the bombing, many Americans still naively believed that they could continue to stand by while the rest of the world was a war; December 7th shocked them into the reality that they could not. Consequently, lives were torn apart, friends and lovers died and the freedom enjoyed before the war was desperately fought for. This film dealt with the human side, the everyday effect of war on individuals' lives. The human experience of your plane going down over enemy territory and the terror of being captured and killed, when only the week before you were lying on a beach with your lover, was shockingly and painfully portrayed here.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett out-shone Affleck by far, and Kate Beckinsale was also brilliant. The confusion of losing one love, only to find another in his best friend was well portrayed and you believed every word each character had to say.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score adds even more emotional depth to the story, as does the Faith Hill song 'There You'll Be'. The film has it's moments of comedy, romance, action and terror. What more could you want from a romance set in wartime? <br/><br/>There's only so much you can learn from studying history, wartime in particular. The human element is often neglected, until you can put a face to 'that soldier that died' and can see the effects his death had on so many people, whose lives will never be the same. The total lack of normalcy that war invokes and the way it literally tears lives apart was stunningly displayed.<br/><br/>Now having read that..go watch it! At least now you'll know what to expect."

He was a Colonel in the Airforce and he was one of the pilots that escorted the atomic bombs to Japan.  I never fully understood what that really meant.  I know I never will, but I wish to God that I would have seen this film before he passed away so that I could have had and shown a real appreciation for who he was.  Sure the romance in the film is fluff, but the terror and horror and courage hit me like a ton of bricks.  Had to give it a ten for allowing those of us who just don't get it - a strong feel for our nation's most horrific tragedy and the men who came forward in her defense.  Thank you."

On a tight budget to make the film, I thought the entire cast and crew did a remarkable job of telling the story of what happened on the December morning, but still managed to incorporate a love triangle story line. I think adding in the love story, was a way to warm you up to character of the 40's and showed how they who were involved in Pearl Harbor reacted and felt.

","I sat down to see this movie out of personal interest for WW2 history. I guess the warning lights should have started flashing when the director was Michael Bay, but I watched it anyway and wasted almost three hours of my life. Three themes are re-occurring in this movie: A desperate/embarrassing attempt at making a touching love story, a sickening amount of patriotic moments and (surprise!) tons of explosions to cover up the mess. The acting never convinces me and the whole ""love drama in love in a war-torn world"" is way too heavily emphasized. But most of the critique is aimed at Bay, who obviously finds it fitting to depict the very attack on the naval base (which, for some reason, is what people remember Pearl Harbor for), as a cowardly act of terror. Japan had declared war, the casualties we see are military personnel, and the revenge bombing of a city full of civilians is not as heroic and brave as Bay might think. Films about events of historic significance should be everything this plane crash (pun intended) is not. <br/><br/>1/10. And I'm being kind."

","Recap: Two kids grew up as best friends with a fascination for flying. They both become army fliers during the WW II and end up at Pearl Harbor the fateful day the Japanese strikes. They also end up in triangle drama when both become involved with the same woman, a navy nurse.<br/><br/>Comments: A long movie, but a little to my surprise, not too long. It has no problem to fill out the entire 160 minutes it runs, which many other movies finds it hard to do. One reason this does is that it has a few distinctive phases, or acts. There is pre Pearl Harbor, the attack and then post Pearl Harbor. Each with it's own story, almost like small movies or episodes within the movie. Because of that, no story runs too long, or gets old.<br/><br/>But honestly, the story is mostly secondary to the real experience. The epically beautiful visual part of the movie. If a depiction of a brutally violent and fatal event ever can be described as beautiful, I think this is it. Two details I was most impressed with was the bomb-perspective, were we got to ride piggyback on the bombs falling. And the vortexes behind the fighters as they fly through the smoke. Attention to details are appreciated.<br/><br/>This was a positive surprise for me. I had expected nice visual shots, and was not disappointed. But I had feared a much weaker and duller story. But together with the action shots it never felt long. Good entertainment, whatever others say.<br/><br/>7/10"

The film deeply touched my heart. I left the cinema with tears, and I wasn't alone. And I can re watch it for several times together with my family. This movie is definitely in my home video collection and I will highly recommend it for those who hasn't seen it yet. Silly to compare it with Armageddon or Titanic.

"Deleauvive","9","1","6","20 April 2008"," A mesmerizing movie from beginning to ...near-end
","I am not your strong nationalist type, yet I enjoyed Pearl Harbor tremendously. One of the reasons virtually anyone could endure a watch or two of Pearl Harbor is for its incredible cast. Cuba Gooding Jr., as a patriotic cooker, Jon Voight as the unforgiving President with guts, Dan Aykroyd as the intuitive and barely able to get himself heard of subordinate, the list goes on forever.<br/><br/>Secondly, CGI-based special effects in P. H. were used for the better. That is to say, if you tend to agree with other reviewers about the script sounding dull at times, I could nearly allow myself to suggest renting this movie solely for those amazing scenes bearing special effects. The hovering over the fleet scenes and the subsequent bombing are remarkably rendered, blended with black & white presumably historical footage transitions.<br/><br/>The photography, the nurses and soldiers uniforms, the make-up, the settings and the soundtrack of Pearl Harbor are nothing short of extraordinary to those eyes and ears. Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous and most of all sincere all throughout the movie, thus one can't help but feel bad for her when she swears she was not intentionally doing harm to Rafe while he was away. Another movie in which one may find echoes of Rafe / Dany somehow confrontational friendship is Gattaca.<br/><br/>Of course, you get your moment or two of bravado, especially when some of the pilots attempt to climb into their planes after the zero's attacks over the bay is acknowledged. Such is the case when Tom Sizemore runs for cover, grabs his gun shouting ""I need more ammos, ladies!"" but that should not distract viewers excessively.<br/><br/>Concerning the ending of the movie, the predictable nasty counter-attack in the ""an eye for an eye"" tradition, I feel it could have been cut off or shortened. We know for a fact that Americans would have their revenge on the japs after that massive blow, anyway! **Review hopefully slightly improved over the previous one, or let's say rephrased**"
"jack-1228","4","1","6","5 April 2008"," Unmissable

The attack is about 45 minutes and after the attack they bomb Tokyo in planes and that is brilliant to watch. It really makes you feel like you are in the attack. It is like going back in time and being in the attack and the planes bombing Tokyo. Before the attack it is a love story about two best friends loving the same woman. It also shows the Japanese planing the attack. It very realistic and if your like war films like me you will love pearl harbor. If you like world war two like me you will love pearl harbor, if you like love story films (unlike me)you will love pearl harbor too. It is amazing."

","Performances were excellent all round. And where I noticed that someone claimed that no red cross army nurses died at Pearl harbor, he was right. The military nurses that did die were navy nurses, not civilian. I was especially touched by Jon Voight's performance as FDR. When I saw him in the first scene I was ""oh no you're not."" But as the movie went on I was totally pulled in as it was obvious that he had carefully studied for the part. The love story was a bit over the top, but the impact of what happened and the aftermath of the event was well portrayed for those who were not around in those days. <br/><br/>No picture depicts history exactly. If it did we wouldn't want to watch it. This film caught the essence of it however. If you weren't moved by it then you have a heart of stone."

Love story aside, this movie captures the essence of the times and of the attack. You feel the emotion of what has just happened. Don't miss out on a great movie because of the secondary story of the love affair. If all possible see this movie on a large widescreen TV with surround sound. The DVD has DTS sound. I swore bullets were flying by me. They filmed this at Pearl! right at the spots where this whole thing took place. They took bits of the stories from the men and women that were there and put them into the film.

We can see Americans as a strongly united nation, true patriots of their country. Although some historical inaccuracy takes place, the battles, events and emotions the heroes came through look really impressive.<br/><br/>The movie also touches upon some other eternal themes like friendship and love. Do you think it has never happened for real? I think it has. Every soldier had to leave something dear to him - family, girlfriend, friend whatever. The war brought a great loss to most people who took part in it and that is a suitable scene for such a film.<br/><br/>The actors and Michael Bay did a great job. It looks naturally and impressive.

It's been criticized as a clichÃ© mushy love story disguised as a war movie but it's not true, i believe it has the right ingredients of a successful blockbuster from all three filmmakers and really depicts WWII in a glorious fictional kind of manner. Who cares about accuracy and all that? i think he does a small bit of historical accuracy even on some casting like Cuba Gooding Jr. who made a damn good role of playing the first black American soldier to get the cross-medal and i love Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. The action sequences are well executed by one of the biggest Hollywood action maestros Bay and it's a very well made movie that is a must see for everyone as i loved it since i saw it in theaters before my graduation for it's a sad, sometimes uplifting and dark War drama that even has a bit of humor."
"jboothmillard","3","2","37","15 June 2009"," Pearl Harbor
","I agree with the critics that Razzie nominated producer/director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Transformers) and producer Jerry Bruckheimer were great choices and could have made a great film out of a big event in history. Basically it follows friends Capt. Rafe McCawley (Razzie nominated Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) becoming pilots in the army during World War II, and both meeting Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe and Evelyn hook up quite quickly, before he is transfered to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The surprise military strike by the Japanese bombing the Harbor was one of the biggest attacks in the history of WWII, with over three thousand men killed. Anyway, Evelyn and Danny hooked up when they thought Rafe was dead, so of course when he returns he is very upset, but they do have to continue fighting in a counter attack. Also starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as Petty Officer Doris 'Dorrie' Miller, Tom Sizemore as Sgt. Earl Sistern, Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Colm Feore as Adm. Husband E. Kimmel, Mako as Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto, Alec Baldwin as Lt. Col. James Doolittle, William Lee Scott as Lt. Billy Thompson, Michael Shannon as Lt. Gooz Wood, Scott Wilson as Gen. George C. Marshall, Peter Firth as Capt. Mervyn Bennion - USS West Virginia, Greg Zola as Lt. Anthony Fusco, Ewen Bremner as Lt. Red Winkle, Jaime King as Nurse Betty Bayer, Jennifer Garner as Nurse Sandra, Dan Aykroyd as Capt. Thurman, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Cmdr. Minoru Genda and Prison Break's William Fichtner as Danny's Father. The film should have just been about the attack, and focused on just the bombing and fighting. If it wasn't for the ridiculous attempt at a romantic story almost dominating the film this would have been great, the key scene of the film and all the battle sequences are good, but at almost three hours long it isn't one you'd see more than once. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Visual Effects, Best Song for ""There You'll Be"" (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Sound, it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer, and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Affleck with either Beckinsale or Hartnett and Worst Screenplay.

","I'm a big historical drama guy, so I was of course excited to see Michael Bay's take on Pearl Harbor. Disappointment is putting it mildly. The first qualm with the movie is that it's not accurate. It doesn't even seem Michael Bay cared to learn about Pearl Harbor. He just wanted suspense and big explosions.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the story is shallow. Throwing in a triangle romance into one of the most consequential events in American history is bound to fall flat, and it does. You may like the romance, I just never cared, and thought it was just something Michael Bay threw in there to satisfy those that were dragged to the theater against their will.<br/><br/>The eventual attack scene on Pearl Harbor is Michael Bay's bread and butter and it didn't disappoint, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the rest of this lackluster production."

","What's good: The recreation of the actual attack on Pearl Harbor is stunning. Told from the point of view of both the Japanese and Americans, the movie captures the surprise and the destruction.

The bad: Almost anything having to do with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. I have seen them in other movies. They can be very good. The dialog they work with here makes me thankful for my fast forward button. The one line that sticks out (and sticks in my throat) is Affleck during the attack who says (more than once), ""Somebody get me into a damn airplane."" Savor that for a moment. People are dying. War has just started. And Affleck wants ""somebody"" to pick him up and deposit him in an airplane. If only we had known. We may have saved the USS Arizona-maybe even won the war right then and there. Once ""somebody"" does get Josh and Ben in airplanes (in their Hawaiian shirts), they commence to shoot a bunch of of Japanese down down and outfly veteran Japanese pilots so badly that they actually cause the Japanese to run into each other! By the way, all the air combat takes place at an altitude of about 75 feet. In real life, I don't believe any Japanese planes were shot down by American fighter planes. This movie is a real mix.

"josephrygaard","7","0","2","3 January 2020"," Before Watching: Pearl Harbor (Theatrical version) (2001)
","""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a movie following two pilots and a woman during the events before, during and after Pearl Harbor. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>First, there are two versions of Pearl Harbor - the theatrical version and the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut has slightly different love scenes and a lot of added violence and gore, as well as somewhat cruder language. The Director's Cut is therefore rated R and represent more accurately the shocking brutality of warfare. Depending on the viewer and his or her relation to war violence, either could be preferable, as the violence in the theatrical version is much more scaled down. This review is of the theatrical version:<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor may be known and labeled by some as a slow, pro-American, over-explosive and historically inaccurate war movie - sprinkled with distracting love relationships on top. These labels could be justifiable; the movie is over 3 hours long with over an hour of set-up before the actual skirmish, which does feature a lot of explosions and destruction. Throughout the runtime, Americans are depicted as strong, charismatic heroes while the enemy (whether Japanese or German) are invasive and ruthless. Added to all this is plenty of anachronisms and details which doesn't make sense nor add up, and a lot of the plot does hinge on love relationships. It is a lot of spectacle and drama, and the violence in the theatrical version can feel inaccurate. These are all valid points to criticize, but in so doing, it needs to be known that neither of these points necessarily distract unless one is pre-occupied with them. As entertainment and as a vessel to carry an important story, Pearl Harbor holds up fine. The views are shot beautifully with a nice variance of vistas, the score by Hans Zimmer is swelling and fits the movie well, and the poignant points rarely feel blunt. The actors and actresses feel genuine as well.<br/><br/>In summary - this movie does have faults and is therefore perhaps not for everyone. Still, the less this movie is viewed as a documentary and more as an interpretation with some liberty, the more enjoyable it will become.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an acceptable 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","PEARL HARBOR is an attempt by Michael Bay to do what James Cameron did on TITANIC: create an epic romance surrounding a real-life historical disaster plot. Unfortunately, the romance takes the form of the cheesiest love triangle ever, with boring Ben Affleck and struggling Josh Hartnett competing for the affection of the entirely wooden Kate Beckinsale. This laborious, badly-written, long-winded nonsense means that PEARL HARBOR clocks in with a three hour running time, but the truth of it is that at least two hours of said running time is pure padded excess. No matter how many famous cast members they add to the mix, there's no getting around all of the cliches and the monotonous nature of the human interaction. The good news is that the attack itself takes the form of a forty-minute set-piece sequence which is quite exhilarating, utilising some very good CGI effects and non-stop explosive stunts to make it a truly impressive and immersive experience. The rest can be safely ignored, and if you're looking for a definitive version of this story, I'd recommend TORA! TORA! TORA!."

","This is a good movie, with the most good looking people, beautiful, magnificent scene and great songs. However, the plot is too weak and dramatic.

I couldn't feel empathy because I am not in that environment and that era. What I will love more is love story about ordinary people. Ordinary people are more complicated, ordinary people are not that good looking to love each other from the first glance. Ordinary people may not be good looking, may not be so selfless, so brave, so patriotic. However, they would still be willing to understand another ordinary person, be willing to love and give."
"AmyJenson1995","6","0","1","19 October 2017"," Alert! This is a raid on history accuracy! This is no drill!
","You heard me people! If you're an history buff looking for authenticity , this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>Indeed, it seems obvious that making an history movie was not the intention of Michael Bay at all. Many of the historical facts of that dreadful day have been overlooked or deliberately tweaked. I can cite the Eagle squadron, the one Rafe flew with during the battle of Britain , which is pure fiction or the fact that both heroes are able to switch from fighter pilots to Bomber ones in a blink of an eye which was a good one. So if you are only looking for authenticity, I should suggest you to watch movies like Tora!Tora!Tora! instead which are far more accurate.<br/><br/>But it has also its moments and besides those flaws, this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable to see. Some of the scenes will glue yourself to your seat with their beautiful shots and action. The Attack on the fleet itself is masterfully done for example. The 30 minutes long part is truly breathtaking both visually and orally. Michael Bay is a master in this area and he proves it once again with that masterpiece. It has now become a classic on YouTube and it's deserved.<br/><br/>Now as a romantic girl, I couldn't help myself being moved by the love story between the characters. Sure the dialogues are more than cheesy sometimes but it's touching anyway and will make you smile. It's also not the most original story I've ever seen but it's entertaining and enjoyable to see so who cares! I remember crying at the end of the movie especially the last scene which was heartbreaking. <br/><br/>So leave the history out and enjoy the movie. It may not be the perfect flick but it's not a bad one neither. If you are forgiving about the historic mishaps, you will like it."

","This is is not as historically accurate as Tora, Tora, Tora, it is a love story set in Pearl Harbor/Doolittle raid. Like all ""dramatizations"", there is poetic license to make the story more interesting. From a dramatic perspective it generates an emotional response. Is not that the purpose of art? The Last Supper by Da Vinci is not accurate to history, but it is not less art. Those who pick apart this story because of inaccuracies I am afraid are motivated by Michael Bay's politics. That is unfortunate.<br/><br/>Remember, this was homage to the 60th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor and it was a tremendous effort and worth watching. To feel good about America and the spirit and dedication that made America great.<br/><br/>BTW, to the reviewer that did not call the Doolittle raid a victory, needs to read the Two Ocean War by Samuel Eliot Morrison or ""Blue Skies and Blood"" by Edwin Hoyt or ""Incredible Victory"" by Walter Lord. The Doolittle raid made the victories at Coral Sea and Midway.<br/><br/>What is ironic: Pearl Harbor was a sneak attack that was unprovoked and a catastrophe for the attacker in the end. About 4 months after this release America was again a victim of a sneak attack that killed about the same number of people as Pearl Harbor. A major difference with 9/11 is the 9/11 attack was televised real-time. The movie Pearl Harbor shows the emasculation that has taken place to the United States. Had Pearl Harbor been filmed real time, the Japanese race would be extinct today. The fact that Americans do not have the same resolve in 2001 is an interesting truth. Its rightness or wrongness will be judged in 2061 when they do movie about the WTC for its 60th anniversary of the attack."

","The problem with this movie is that when you try and look at it and judge it as just a movie, it actually works out pretty well. As a movie, it is well made. There is good acting, good directing, the effects are pretty good, and the sound editing along with action scenes when the attack happen are all really good. However, it is just also really hard to sit through and watch due to the fact that there is not a lot of stuff that is similar to real life events. What I mean is that the way that they portray most of the characters is borderline untolerable. The soldiers who fought in the war were given off the idea of being idiots and only cared about showing off to the girls (let's not forget the toothbrush guy or the guy who couldn't swim). On the other end of it though, there is some really great things that do history justice. Such as Jon Voight's brief portrayal of FDR. He has some of the best acting I have ever seen in a supporting role and he alone makes it worth watching. If you want a decent movie, watch this. If you want a good portrayal of history, then don't watch this."
"twitter-adress","6","0","1","1 May 2017"," ""Pearl Harbor"", (2001) is an American movie which does not only deals with the Second World War but also a love story.
","Michael Bay, the director, who also had great success with his Terminator films, delivers us here a film both historical and romantic. Yet, he's still being criticized due to an excess of special effects, which makes his movies less realistic sometimes, but not for Pearl Harbor. On the contrary, all of these special effects are true to what happened during the real attack of Pearl Harbor which creates a true combination between horror and violence. What's more, we could wonder why would have Bay decided to add a love story, because we could have done without it... But then, when we think about it, we could guess that it was a strategy. Indeed, the purpose of Pearl Harbor was to attract not only men who are fond of war and violence, but also women who love the romantic touch. And I think it worked well, as it is for a lot of women ""an amazing romantic movie"" before a war film. An important thing throughout the movie is the significance of the different shots. Actually, most shots are aerial, which is typical for a war movie. Bay uses most of the time these shots in order to show how much power the Japanese had on the Americans who were weak during that attack. It is even more obvious when we can see the American flag and the US vessels plunged into the water: it is the nation that is drowning. During the attack, Bay uses a lot of point of view shots, and thanks to these, the spectator can put himself in the American soldiers' shoes, and it gives us a feeling of oppression, fear and horror. We automatically feel pity for the Americans, who are being unfairly attacked. Furthermore, there are a lot of off-screen spaces, just like during the Japanese attack scene. One actor isn't looking at the planes while we, spectators, see it in the background, which means that there's even more planes we can't actually see. Indeed, each individual shot feels huge but also implies bigger things outside the frame. It shows you a lot for just a moment and then it takes it away. Michael Bay style is ""simply"" the use of movement, composition and fast editing to create a sense of epic scale.<br/><br/>Yet, at the end of the movie, when we thought that everything was against the Americans, that they're definitely the victims, there is a plot twist. Indeed, they win; rescued by the Chinese soldiers and they are considered as heroes. When Danny dies, he dies as a real superhero. Right after his death scene, there's a fade out shot and we can see a Chinese soldier waving the American flag, which proves that the American nation is not, and never will be down. Right after this scene, there is another fade out which shows the American flag waving to the right, symbol of hope, of a better future. Then follows the reunion between families and the soldiers. Once again, Bay shows the dual vision of the soldier: he is not only a killing machine but also a man, who has a wife and kids. During that entire scene, the images are in slow-motion, and there's a music which is at the same time moving, sad, but also patriotic thanks to the trumpets. Music has a major role in Pearl Harbor. Thanks to Hans Zimmers' soundtrack, we are automatically plunged into the atmosphere of the movie. For example, when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, the music highlights how chaotic the situation is, how hopeless America is at this moment. Pearl Harbor is also known thanks to this amazing song called Tennessee, once again, created by Hans Zimmer. At the very end of the movie, there is a voice-over: Evelyn speaks and pays a tribute to the ones who died during the war. She insists that despite the fact that America may have known defeats and many casualties, she will always stand up and she will always fight for her nation and her pride. What's more, we learn that Dory Miler was the first Afro-American to receive the Navy Cross, which is once again a proof of a better future and hope. The movie ends with a child (Evelyn and Danny's child) who picks a flower. The kid is the perfect symbol of innocence, and the fact that he picks a flower highlights the movie's moral: no matter what happens, life goes on. Here, the flower might be the metaphor of rebirth. To put in a nutshell, Pearl Harbor is a movie which deserves to be seen because it is very representative of the horror of war. It is not only the attack of Pearl Harbor that Michael Bay denounces, it is war in general. However, we soon understand the second purpose of this film which is to glorify the American army and the American soldiers. Pearl Harbor is based on many American stereotypes which are close to ridiculousness: the slow-motion scene where we can see many soldiers moving forward an aircraft carrier, torsos bent, with a proud expression, looking fearless. And we often see it in movies, such as American Sniper by Clint Eastwood or Saving private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. Not to mention the soundtrack which is very patriotic but also overwhelming. We're really dove into each situation whether it is horrifying, romantic or simply touching, thanks to the music. What's more, we could say that Pearl Harbor also strengthen the idea of brotherhood during war which make the spectator feel even more sorry for them. To conclude, if you have never seen Pearl Harbor and you do want to watch it, you must expect to see a pro-American movie and an unnecessary but beautiful and romantic love story."

","Well, it is a little different. That can be said about it.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is sort of a WWII remake of China Beach.<br/><br/>Anyone remember China Beach? The series about Vietnam that was more soap opera than war? The series that was one long love affair ala 90210 style ""who're hooking up with who"" drama? Anyone remember that? Yes? No? Well, Pearl Harbor is kind of China Beach set in Hawaii and post dated to the 1940s. It sort of has that ""War isn't a tragedy, it's a love affair"" kind of vibe to it.<br/><br/>But then it is Bay and MOST of his movies seem to have a political Agenda. He's not even really trying to hide it these days is he? Sure, when Pearl Harbor was made he was still sort of keeping it under wraps, but now...he's making movies blatantly far right.<br/><br/>So, it's a Bay film so I guess the central theme of it is ""WAR IS AWESOME AND America SHOULD START MORE WARS"" It certainly, amidst the tragedy of the actual Pearl Harbor still comes off as a propaganda film and one that suggests that ""America should be at war with someone all the time and you should join the military right away so you get your chance to heroically serve in one."" I like Edwin Starr's version of it more, to be honest.<br/><br/>But honestly, Bay always seems to have a specific agenda in his films and it's usually to glorify the mass and senseless slaughter of thy fellow man.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is no different.<br/><br/>I go to movies to be entertained...I like to save propaganda for talk radio."

","Firstly I had to admit that I literally forced myself to watch this 3 hours long Michael Bay flick. I wasn't satisfied, but I expected something far worse than this. Although the movie is only slightly average. <br/><br/>Let's start with the couple of good points. Ben Affleck's performance in this movie was quite enjoyable and was pretty surprised about this, because most of the time he plays, Affleck shows only three facial expressions during his acting in a certain film. Josh Hartnett was just there, so as Kate Beckinsale and the other minor cast. Except Alec Baldwin, who is extremely badass in this feature, sometimes even hilarious. Though Hans Zimmer's score can't be compared to his latest works such as Risen from Darkness (The Dark Knight Rises), Imagine the Fire (The Dark Knight Rises), Time (Inception) and Lost but Won (Rush), it's stunning as always. The visuals are astonishing (what could we except from Bruckheimer and Bay?), except the pretty pure cinematography. <br/><br/>Here comes the plenty of awful features of Pearl Harbor. Michael Bay's direction s*ucks, as always, including the slow-motion rotating dolly shots, the explosion scenes and the layer amounts in certain scenes. The editing was especially poor, even compared to other Bay films. I read somewhere the editing is way better in the director's cut, but I just simply can't force myself to watch a 4 hours long feature containing even more bayhem than the theatrical version. <br/><br/>The script has huge problems, including the historical inaccuracy and the large plot holes. Although I expected zero accurate in history, some parts even surprised me, like when the two heroes nearly managed to eradicate the hole Japan air force. <br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this film, but you should watch this in the same way as I did, with no expectations to historical accuracy, character development, acceptable direction and editing. The romantic line is surprisingly entertaining, though pretty foul, so if you want to watch a romantic movie containing historical background, large explosions and 20th century interceptors than you can give it a try. Otherwise I do not recommend it. <br/><br/>6/10"

However later on during the famous attack Rafe returns from the dead and as such a feud between the two best friends begin set during the attack on pearl harbor by the Japanese empire. The acting in this is terrible, not to bad from Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale they do try with the horrible script that they've been given but by far the worst out of our three main leads is Josh Hartnett who's eyes look like the eyes of Brock from Pokemon which is really distracting and stupid when he's on screen. The special effects are kind of good still but there beginning to show age since this movie was released in 2001 and was directed by a man who can't make a good movie to save his life. You know this movie is one of disaster romance movies that have fictional characters that are suppose to have an impact on this but they don't. At least with Titanic you see the fictional characters interact with the real life characters so when the tragedy happens you know who they are and can build emotional connections with them. Which is what this movie needed and what all movies need. This movie could have had that but no it didn't so case in point it sucks. I give Pearl Harbor one and a half stars out of five."

","'Pearl Harbor' is a biopic which recounts the events of that tragic day on December 7th 1941, where the Japanese bomb the historical American base.<br/><br/>1. In the vein of 'Titanic', 'Pearl Harbor' has the same effect of having a fictitious love story in the midst of a factual tragedy. This time around, it comes in the pairing of Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale (who do make a cute on-screen couple to be fair). Keep in mind, the movie is 3hrs long so we mainly get scenes with the both of them at the beginning and near the end. The love story works well up until we get to the awkward and forced love-triangle involving Josh Hartnett. This is the unnecessary weight of the film that could easily be trimmed down to save on running time. Let's summarize the romance shall we? Your best friend (Affleck) aids the British army, is presumed dead after his plane crashes, you (Hartnett) use that as an opportunity to make a play on his mourning girlfriend (Beckinsale), then unknowingly get her pregnant after a month of having unprotected sex in Hawaii.<br/><br/>2. If there's one thing Michael Bay knows, it's action. Every action and battle sequence in this film is highly intense and really captures the feel of what this war could have been like. The theatrical version is tamed to a certain degree, but the director's cut is Rated-R and shows tons of blood and gore. Of course, the actually bombing of Pearl Harbor occurs in the 2nd hour of the film after the campy stuff.<br/><br/>3. The acting is nothing spectacular with the exception of Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight, who play Lt. Doolittle and President Roosevelt respectively. Affleck, Beckinsale and Hartnett are the leading characters (with the latter being the weakest) that we follow as the film progresses. If nothing else, I know women would like the romance in this film more than the guys.<br/><br/>'Pearl Harbor' is an okay/down-the-middle type film and nothing else. Michael Bay delivers on the action and Hans Zimmer provides the breath-taking score to follow. Love it or hate it, but it exists."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","5","0","2","7 February 2016"," Not the best war film but not totally unworthy either
","For the mid-1990s, it was a big time for director Michael Bay. After successfully making three action blockbusters with Bad Boys (1995), The Rock (1996) and Armageddon (1998), producers thought that Bay would be the next best director to handle another blockbuster made film. However, this movie came in the form of a more delicate topic and that was the tragedy of Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces landed a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. An event that took several by surprise and shock, the infamous day would forever be remembered as the day the US would enter World War II. This particular event isn't per-say something anyone would want to revisit. After all, this movie would be released 60 years after the actual tragedy. Yet the film was made anyway. As for those who know what Michael Bay is capable of, some may be a bit leery of how he handles such a touchy issue. Well, he actually does both. He doesn't make it insultingly terrible but he also misses the point on some degree too.<br/><br/>Randall Wallace wrote the script to this war drama. Wallace was also known for The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and more notably Braveheart (1995). Here, Wallace flubs a bit on what exactly what is more important. Pearl Harbor actually takes a backseat and yet this is what the title clearly states what it should be about. Instead, viewers are introduced to Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), two young men who enjoy nothing but flying planes and looking to go fight for their country. Of the two, Rafe is the older one and acts like an older brother to Danny. As they grow up, they enlist into the air force. Rafe ends up meeting Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) during physical exams. As to what happens between these three, it is fairly obvious as to what becomes of them. If you have two male and one female lead, there's not much else to be said. The love subplot just feels too cliché to have for this movie. <br/><br/>What war film fans usually enjoy is the struggle of living through the bad times. Look at Steven Spielberg in Saving Private Ryan (1998), Ronald F. Maxwell in Gettysburg (1993) or even Edward Zwick in Glory (1989). All these films focused on characters that had their own separate lives given through carefully written backstories. This gave a better picture of the people involved in the overall time period where the event took place. Here, Pearl Harbor feels like more of pawn in this love story than vice versa. This is the area where Michael Bay doesn't quite get it. It has been clearly stated by him that he liked the love story but giving it all the attention was not the right direction. Apparently, Bay also included some historical inaccuracies that angered both US and Japanese veterans. If a filmmaker is going to make a war film, there has to be some decency to keep the facts right. It's also understood everything may not come out right but at least try not to make it controversial.<br/><br/>This is about it though. The acting itself is fairly acceptable from both sides of the war. The cast is also packed with a lot of familiar faces. Ewen Bremner from Guy Ritchie's Snatch. (2000), plays one of Danny and Rafe's fellow pilots. There are also appearances from Alec Baldwin, Jaime King, Jennifer Garner, Jon Voight (as FDR), Cuba Gooding Jr., Michael Shannon, Dan Aykroyd, Makoto Iwamatsu and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. For the most part these actors are far less involved but still have a significant amount of time. The chemistry between Affleck and Hartnett feel real; they certainly act and behave like brothers a number of times. It is bit weird seeing Affleck talking with a southern accent though. Beckinsale's chemistry with the two works as well but the blatant overuse of her role as the main storyline may make her annoying to some. It's not say that love stories didn't exist during the events of Pearl Harbor but making it the star of a tragedy seemed in poor taste.<br/><br/>The special effects and action are nicely executed though. This is a Michael Bay film so that should be at least natural for him. Even more appreciated is that Bay doesn't go overboard on his pyrotechnics either. Really the only big set piece is the attack on Pearl Harbor and although it isn't as graphically realistic, it is still difficult to watch. War is ugly and that's exactly what Bay gets right. Everything dealing the impending danger is accurately displayed with none of Bay's comedic shtick people loathe him for. The camera-work handled by John Schwartzman (Armageddon (1998) & Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009)) is decent too. Occasionally Schwartzman will use shaky camera to emulate first person but that's it. The rest is smooth with wide panning shots. Lastly the music by Hans Zimmer is memorable too. Again although the love story should not have been of main focus, Zimmer has a great theme for that and the Japanese Empire. Well done.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is an event nobody should forget and for much of the long running time, it's not focused on a lot. The writing and direction focuses more on the love story than the event itself. If that's the case, then just change the title. However, Michael Bay thankfully omits his usual humor and abundant explosions in exchange for more control. The music, camera-work and depiction of war are nicely done too. Just don't expect Pearl Harbor to be around a lot."

It is so bad that it isn't even funny- an overused saying for sure, but perfectly fitting in this situation. Now, had the movie not been called ""Pearl Harbor"", I'd probably have been kinder to it. Instead of just being very bad, however, the title clinches it for me as ""the worst movie ever"". Absolutely unwatchable garbage from start to finish, this ""movie"" is a disgrace to both cinema and America."

","Michael Bay has always been known for style over substance, which is fine if you're doing Donny Osmond videos. But he should not be allowed near any serious subject matter. He lacks the talent and sensitivity to tell stories. He is a one trick pony, whose one trick is neither interesting, nor original.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with cheesy action movies and bad love stories. Many people enjoy them. But the subject matter, budget, and talent are all completely wasted on this disaster. Apparently Mr Bay could not find anything compelling about one of the most important events in American history, instead using the war as merely the backdrop for one of the worst love stories ever inflicted on an audience.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, fast forward to the battle scenes and don't waste any more minutes of your life on the rest of this clichéd, uninteresting train wreck of a movie."
"karagoraymond","2","0","1","18 March 2015"," Before he ruined Transformers, Michael Bay tried to re-write history
","The visuals were amazing, but the film unfortunately sucked. We were all expecting this grand tale, also seen in Saving Private Ryan or Platoon. However, Michael Bay took one of the most significant moments in American History and one of the most significant moments of the Second World War and turned it into a three hour mess in which the morale of the story was ""America-**** Yeah"".<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the film is the depiction of the events. When the Japanese attacked, they only attacked soldiers and did not target civilians while when the Americans attacked, they targeted civilians, and in the film it is the opposite. Also, I did not appreciate the Indiana Jones style stunts the pilots pull off, particularly during the attack on Pearl Harbor, I know the film was meant to reach a wider audience, including a younger audience but, WHY? Kids will learn about this stuff in school, I believe that in making the film more family friendly, they did not do the story justice. If you are going to represent a historical event, you must show all sides and not just the romanticized Hollywood version that kids will enjoy, if you want your kids to have a good time, take them to see a Disney film or a Superhero film, not a film depicting an important era in history.<br/><br/>Though I did not find the acting was great, I did not feel that the actors had a great deal to work with from such a lack luster script as well as such hollowed out characters that were just walking clichés, Ben Affleck's character being the ""cowboy"" etc. And while giving these uninteresting characters the most screen time, the film takes focus away from the event it is meant to be portraying as well as actual real life characters such as Doris Miller or Roosevelt who had more of a right to have had their stories told.<br/><br/>Overall, I am probably being too harsh to this film, but the saving graces are the technical aspects such as the explosions and the angles from the planes are actually quite good. The sad thing is, there is a good film in there somewhere but it was never realized and I hope if Hollywood ever visits this topic again, they will."
"pepsooi","4","0","1","25 February 2015"," War : a pretext for a love story
","Rambo and Starship troopers' fans may have been quite upset as Pearl Harbor is a so-called war movie, focused on an impossible love story with war only in the background. Young and brilliant soldiers in love with the same beautiful nurse but separated by the fate of the war and intern betrayals: hard to make more stereotypical. Like many others, I was expected to watch a war movie -as the title may suggest- not a national drama left behind a romanticized plot. If I would have wanted to watch a good and silly romantic movie, I would have chosen Notting Hill. Pearl Harbor doesn't embody the perfect war movie (since it is told to have many historic inaccuracies) but it isn't a good love story neither, because everything happens too fast in this love triangle. Focusing on a love plot is not a problem in itself. It can maybe helps reaching a wider audience (girls don't generally go to see Rambo). But the problem remains in the fact that all the details in the movie sink into sentiment; the numerous sunsets, President Roosevelt's reactions, the social achievement of the black cooker... It seems like Michael Bay wanted us to cry every two seconds of the film. However, one could see above these failures because there are still few admirable things. Even if the war only begins at the middle of the film, it can't be totally denied that this is a war movie because the unique attack is remarkably realized. Despite the horror of the war and all its meanings linked to the notion, the public can't help but appreciating the shoots of all these bursts, fires ands smokes embellished by an awesome soundtrack. Not bloody but still realistic for the public, PH is maybe one of the first movies which represented war as something pleasant to see. To conclude,I don't think that the success of that movie is due to likelihood with reality nor the beauty of the shoots I just praised. I rather tend to think that Americans needed to see how exemplary their country and grand-parents were against these mad Japanese who attacked a peaceful and prosperous nation for blurred purposes. Each of the movie's characters (soldiers, medical staff, officers and cookers) embodies the best qualities of an American at war : absolute loyalty and sense of duty to their beloved homeland. So if (and only if) you like flag-waving movies, go to see Pearl Harbor."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","0","1","28 January 2015"," Underwhelming 3 hours, drags a lot
","""Pearl Harbor"" is one of the most known films by director Michael Bay, a man who is known for works that mostly put visuals over everything and rarely convince through dialog, drama or suspense. His other works include ""Transformers"" and ""Armageddon"". ""Pearl Harbor"" scored four Academy Award nominations in the technical categories and won one of them. However, that is almost the only positive thing I can say about it. This film which runs for over 3 hours had just too many parts that added really nothing and just made it very boring to watch. The occasional parts of humor (""I lick you"" instead of ""I like you"") did not work at all and even if (or maybe as) the script came from the writer of ""Braveheart"", the screenplay did not seem particularly refined.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of the film are about the relationship between Affleck's and Beckinsale's characters. They fall in love, but he goes to war right afterward. We see lots of battle scenes next, especially with planes and it slowly moves towards the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. What I found strange though was how the scenes that involved the Japanese generals talking about the attack felt so unconnected to the action including Affleck and Hartnett as if we had two different films. Then there were also unrealistic scenes, like Cuba Gooding Jr. beating up a white man in a fight after he was badly beaten up before. A few words changed the outcome? Not gonna happen. By the way, Gooding Jr. already was an Academy Award winner when this was made and so was Affleck. He got his second not too long ago, again not for acting, but Hartnett, a big prospect almost 15 years ago, has become pretty irrelevant by now and is back to television work, even if that, with the great state TV is in these days, isn't even a negative thing.<br/><br/>But back to the movie. One of its biggest problems is that none of the characters were particularly likable, especially not Affleck's. Another criticism is that the acting simply isn't good. Those who give solid performances (like Alec Baldwin, Michael Shannon) only play minor parts or roles just like they usually do, like in Baldwin's case an authority figure. So yeah, after 48 minutes, Affleck's character is already dead (seemingly) and I felt the speech that Hartnett's character gives at the funeral is something that did not come off as authentic, maybe because I never really felt the two had such a strong ""best friend"" connection.<br/><br/>Also I have to say that I was not even wowed by the special effects and other technical aspects of the film. Maybe that came because the drama and relationship aspects weren't interesting. It's all style over substance, even if the Academy begs to differ. There was one scene when Japanese planes fire at a car with the two protagonists inside, but all of a sudden stop firing. I did not understand why as the car obviously was still driving, so somebody in there must have been alive. I guess there are more plot holes in this movie if you took a closer look to find them. That is just one that I remembered. Also, with what the United States did to Japan later on, the film was slightly too patriotic for my taste.<br/><br/>To end the review on a more positive note, I would like to say that I liked the song ""There You'll Be"" and I would not have minded it winning the Oscar. However, as a whole I cannot recommend watching this film. Looking at the fact that it ended up among the 10 most seen films from 2001 at the box office, far too many watched it already in proportion to its (lack of) quality."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","7 December 2014"," Talk about a bomb
","*** This review may contain spoilers *** Pearl Harbor doesn't seem to have been written by a professional screenwriter as much as it seems like a badly written assignment in a sixth grade creative writing class. The student gets an F and is made the stand in the corner.<br/><br/>I am not exactly sure what history book this movie is derived from but if you can believe director Michael Bay and his movie, the events of December 7, 1941 were a premeditated attack on America to force a nurse to fall in love with the wrong guy. I never thought I'd see the day when a movie about That Day of Infamy would supply the Pearl Harbor invasion as a subplot but now I believe (and fear) that anything is possible.<br/><br/>The movie stars Ben Affleck as Rafe an Army pilot and standard issue World War II movie hero who looks good in a uniform and is about as interesting as a five-pound sack of flour. He's not a man loaded with wit and his sentiments invite way too many bad laughs. Such formidable nuggets of banality come in the form of lines like ""I'm not anxious to die sir, just anxious to matter"" and ""I almost died in that plane and her face lead me to the ground"".<br/><br/>Ug! The face belongs to Evelyn, played with drywall intensity by Kate Beckinsale. She can't decide if she loves Rafe or the equally dunder-headed Danny Walker (John Hartnett), Rafe's best friend. Evelyn is in love with Rafe but when he's reported dead she jumps ship and falls in love with Danny. Rafe comes back, none too happy that this union has taken place and Oh by the way the Japanese suddenly attack Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Danny and Rafe put their differences aside and join Jimmy Doolittle's air corps that is going to launch a retaliatory strike on the Japanese. Unfortunately that means that we have the sit through nearly 90 minutes of discussions about who will get Evelyn, what the war means, what America is all about and who is not coming back.<br/><br/>We are also subjected to that time-worn scene where the General addresses his troops on the airstrip by saying ""Take a good look at the man next to you, its a good bet that in the next six weeks either you or he will be dead. Everyone brave enough to except this, step forward."" Of course EVERYONE steps forward in unison. I'm not a military genius but it seems to me that you'd have to be REALLY brave not to step forward. I'd like just one scene where everyone steps forward and suddenly the guy on the end changes his mind and steps back.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Franklin Roosevelt (Jon Voight) sits in the White House and tries to figure out what to do about this Pearl Harbor business. Voight plays FDR caked under 40 pounds of make-up (20 of it is chin). There isn't much wrong with Voight's performance as the great president except that he plays the role like . . . well like Jon Voight doing and impression of FDR.<br/><br/>Even his dialogue is at the level of driftwood. He offers such priceless lines as ""Do not tell me it can't be done!"" and ""I like sub commanders. They have no time for bulls**t, and neither do I"". Apparently he was saving the good stuff for his fireside chats.<br/><br/>Sitting down to watch the film I wondered why the Japanese didn't protest. Having seen the film I now know why: The Japanese have so little screen time in the film that they are mostly played as extras. When they are on screen it's all as a matter of planning and then some pseudo-remorse for what they've done. There is a priceless scene involving the Japanese Generals planning a sea attack with toy boats in a pond.<br/><br/>Then comes the 40 minute climax, lauded as a grand spectacle of special effects as the American air force strike back. The battle is portrayed as a long series of games of chicken in which Ben Affleck shouts at his enemy before coming inches from a head on collision. On the ground Cuba Gooding Jr. goes against an order given by his racist superiors and boards a machine-gun turret and shoots down several enemy planes. Of all the clichés I thought this movie would avoid, the token black guy was one of them.<br/><br/>The historical inaccuracies in Pearl Harbor are endless. There is not a single element that this movie gets right. Oh wait! There is one, the poster's tagline says ""December 7th, 1941 . . .It was a Sunday"". That one they got right."

"thebasquez","6","0","1","26 May 2013"," It's only good if you're in it for the romance.
","As I do agree with the fact that this story is mainly based on a love triangle with 2 best friends and a girl, I still believe that the director (Micheal Bay) did a decent job on capturing the Pearl Harbor event.<br/><br/>The movie... has too many fillers in it. There's a lot of pointless scenes in the movie that should have been cut out, like a previous critic reviewer said ""a 2 hour movie stretched into 3.""<br/><br/>If you look at Micheal Bay's movies, they are all typically long movies... Titanic, Avatar, etc. Plus, Micheal Bay movies are also typically based around LOVE STORIES. If you looked at the cover of the movie where it says ""Pearl Harbor"" then ""directed by Micheal Bay"" you can't complain about the romance in the movie, because that's practically a given on almost any Micheal Bay movie.<br/><br/>Just like Titanic, it's a romance twisted around a real life event. The romance drama is actually very good and it keeps you locked into the movie. I really liked the situation of the love triangle and the fact that Rafe came back to find that his one and only love had fallen in love with his closest & best friend Danny. HONESTLY, THE WHOLE STORY REVOLVING THE ROMANCE WAS GREAT.<br/><br/>Where the movie lacks MAJORLY is the accuracy of the real life event of Pearl Harbor. Now the reason why this movie has a big fat ol' ""F"" of a rating on IMDb ""5.8"" is because when you call a movie ""Pearl Harbor"" IT SHOULD BE ABOUT PEARL HARBOR. There was a lot of foreshadowing throughout the movie that Pearl Harbor was the target for the Japanese. Why? I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE Micheal BAY DIDN'T TELL US. People who have no historical knowledge of Pearl Harbor will feel lost watching this movie. BESIDES THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DIED AND THE Japanese BOMBED PEARL HARBOR, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON.<br/><br/>Also, the film featured ""Doris Miller"" and his story of the black cook hero of Pearl Harbor. You don't know who Doris is? Well that sucks. Micheal Bay apparently didn't want to do a very good job at explaining who he was. He comes in a scene here, then a scene there, and all of a sudden he's shooting down an aircraft. Why this has any sort of importance, WE DON'T KNOW. Then he gets a medal, why? WE DON'T KNOW.<br/><br/>Overall, one half of the movie I'm like ""YES I LOVE IT"" the other half I'm like ""THIS IS TERRIBLE""<br/><br/>So I'm giving this movie a 6.5 (I put 7 though)<br/><br/>Not one of Micheal Bay's best movies.... BUT IT'S STILL WORTH WATCHING."
"Stanjaudit","9","0","3","11 December 2012"," Pearl Harbor Jolted Us Awake
","We Americans are slow to remember and slow to awaken to just causes and that is what this movie Pearl Harbor attempts to do. Forget the love triangle and whether or not the guns used were historically accurate. This was a movie to make Americans aware that we can be attacked and our life's are not as secure as we would have ourselves believe.<br/><br/>I'm not here to criticize the writing or the direction of the movie. It was what it was. There are other movies that focus on the attack and love triangle. Tora-Tora-Tora for one which presented the attack from both the Japanese and the American viewpoints. <br/><br/>As far as the raid on Tokyo 30 Seconds Over Tokyo is an excellent movie that depicts that raid with Spencer Tracy playing the role of Dolittle. <br/><br/>When all is said and done a little over 3,000 people were killed at the attack of Pearl Harbor. We fast forward to our time; on 9/11 between the two towers of the trade center, the Pentagon, and Shanks Field in Pennsylvania a little of 3,000 people were killed. I experienced 9/11. What amazes me is how soon we Americans forget when Americans have given there lives that we can remain free and secure. Pearl Harbor was and is a great movie."
"terry-slesser","7","0","1","23 March 2012"," Not as good as ""Tora! Tora! Tora!""
","Pearl Harbor I thought was an OK movie, but not great movie by any means. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, but just skip the romance part of the movie. It goes without saying that everyone thinks ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is MUCH better."

","I've seen this movie so many times and it is just epic. It has everything a movie with such a theme should have.<br/><br/>I always say that for an epic movie to be created there are just two things that needs to be perfect, script and director, who could argue with the talent of Michael Bay (Director of the transformers trilogy, I am number four, Armageddon...), and I read a review claiming the script by Randall Wallace to be insane and yet genius, a result too clear on the screen, the love story is unique and the action seems to be right in the room. It grabs hold of your every fiber from start to end and afterwards your'e so inspired but don't necessarily have something to with that inspiration, yet it remains there. 10 out of 10 for excellent scenery, great acting and an incomparable love story. I've heard complaints of how it is historically inaccurate, and I couldn't care less about it, the only thing that made me consider lowering my vote would be just the fact that I am not a Ben Affleck fan, but that's not fair to take in consideration, Johs Hartnett however impressed me!"

"alicedick","6","0","2","7 September 2010"," Watch It for the Character Actors
","Michael Bay clearly went to a lot of trouble and expense to film this reenactment of the events which led America into WWII. Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the other reviewers here and state that ""Pearl Harbor"" is not a very good movie. It has its points: The battle scenes are very well filmed and the attention to period detail is wonderful. The soggy love story at the movie's center is not.<br/><br/>As with most epics, playing ""spot the star"" here is lots of fun. I didn't recognize Jon Voight as FDR. Colm Feore as Admiral Kimmel, Alec Baldwin as James Doolittle orchestrating the bombing of Tokyo, Dan Aykroyd as a military codebreaker racing against time to decipher Japanese messages - they're all great to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also good as a black seaman who finally gets his chance to see combat during the raid.<br/><br/>For good measure, Bay throws in the Tokyo raid which took place four months after Pearl Harbor. This makes for a good one-two plot punch, but the first hour of the movie with its excruciatingly slow buildup could and should have been chopped. I fast forwarded through a lot of it. The most ridiculous part of the film's plot has to be Kate Beckinsale's pregnancy, which is magically never visible even after the Tokyo bombing (by that point she'd have to be six to seven months along)! It's a miracle baby!<br/><br/>If you're in the mood to see a lushly filmed modern take on Pearl Harbor and it's a slow afternoon, you'll probably enjoy this. If you want to see a more tightly filmed version, try one of the others such as ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"""
"Air America","8","0","3","24 November 2009"," Overly Criticized
","While reading just a few of the comments, I experienced great anguish at the ""armchair warriors,"" or, those I regard as ""warriors,"" criticizing this film. It is a compelling story yes, and maybe only 5-10-15% of the depictions were a complete re-creation, accurate in every detail. The idea was entertainment, and I give the makers of this film a very big hand. First of all, this happened one December morning I either remember parts of while visiting (as folks did back in 1941) or that I revere very highly among all of the other actual recollections in my life. I treasure seeing this and other historically founded films. The producers of this piece tell that many depictions are composites of actual events for sake of placing diverse events and important results into a deserved perspective.<br/><br/>I want to start by saying that I am surprised the Navy even gave Doris ""Dorrie"" Miller the decoration he received; the Navy Cross. This was 1941 and a segregated military was still the national model. It seems likely that if this happened after 1990 or 2000, that he might have been awarded the Medal of Honor. On the face of it, others who remained at their station and who performed similar gallantry did receive the Medal of Honor. No doubt they deserved theirs, and I see that this is not a solitary view as this is the view of a writer at encyclopedia.com. I hope the President and members of Congress see fit to upgrade this award for him.<br/><br/>I was astonished at the details covered by this film. The amount of work to just do the flames and explosions is beyond belief.<br/><br/>There is a large effort apparent by the stunt persons who acted in the production. Mentioned are the feet of primer cord, dynamite and gasoline used in the film. The arsenal and ordinance expenditure used in this film I feel sure, exceed the GNP of small provinces and it all had to be paid for on the gamble that it would be shown enough to just come out even. That it was overlooked for Oscar® nomination or award receiving only the ""Best Sound Content"" award seems very surprising.<br/><br/>Having been a training flight instructor I have even greater respect for the men (and perhaps women) who flew their aircraft between actual ships just feet above the water where any minor miscalculation would not have been survived. The scene where tho two childhood pals, Rafe and Danny played chicken does not look like a computer generated piece. Maybe parts of it were manipulated, but undoubtedly the actual head-on closing speed of what must have been 400+ mph is real as well as the maneuver to first roll one direction and suddenly change to the opposite direction and then do this clear of each other. I am sure the slightest mistake would have erased two men's lives and retired two old war birds. A big hand for the pilots and certainly for their bravery and for whatever they were paid to do this. It must have required many rehearsals and many spine-tingling moments-to-hours expended by the pilots and undoubtedly, backup crews were also used in order to insure the shooting schedule.<br/><br/>A lot of ingenuity is apparent when seeing the battle scenes and later viewing the special effects section on the second disk. While others have been critical of this film to extremes, it receives my highest regard and respect. Gor another similar topic to come to the screen soon is very unlikely. unlikely."

","Yes it is not historically accurate, but when are movies word-for-word correct? I agree that there were some terrible clichés in it, but it was not that bad. The movie was not supposed to be an accurate depiction of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, rather it was about the impact of it revolving around the stories of two American pilots and the nurses stationed in Pearl Harbor. What I think I loved best about it was the music and visual effects. Hans Zimmer delivers beautiful and compelling music throughout the movie at the right moments. The visual effects (being 2001) were accurate. The actors too were good for the parts. Maybe there were some cheesy parts but you'll get that almost anywhere. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett had good chemistry being best buds along with Kate Beckinsale as their love interests."

","Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's film Pearl Harbor is based on the true story of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. It starts out in a field with two young boys playing in a father's crop dusting airplane. Little do we know that those two boys are going to be a big part of America's victory in WWII. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are Army Air Corp Pilots and best friends. Rafe goes to Britain to fight the Germans, leaving love behind. His plane gets shot down and he is presumed dead. As Danny comforts Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), they draw closer to each other. When Rafe turns up alive, the two former friends become enemies. It is through the turmoil of the war that the two are able to reconcile their differences. This film was made to remind everyone of the disaster that America had to overcome that morning in December. It was made to remember all those men that fought and the women that nursed soldiers and civilians back to health. This movie is seemingly aimed more towards the audience that knows little about what actually happened in WWII. Pearl Harbor is not for the historians. It may not follow the events exactly as they happened, but overall it is a good film if we are just looking for some great special effects, fight scenes, a few laughs or a good cry. There were many mistakes in this movie. In some of the shots of Battleship Row, you could see the Arizona Memorial in the background. Also, at the end, the pilots flying Doolittle's Raid crash land in China after running out of fuel. They are shot at by Japanese patrols, and there was only a vague explanation of the Sino-Japanese war that was underway. Some viewers may be confused as to why there were Japanese patrols in China. Bruckheimer and Bay did not make a history film to be shown in classes or to be compared to historical events. They made a war film with a love story entwined. I feel that Pearl Harbor is a good film."

The ending was very tragic, which always makes a movie better. I HATE happy endings. The acting was great on all parts and dialog could have been improved in certain areas, but truthfully it was pretty good. What really needed work here is the cinematography. A couple scenes, such as the actual bombing scene and the one just before the bombing had excellent cinematography. Other than that, the camera angles were terrible. In up close fight scenes and dialogs the camera switched too fast and was not held steady.

","Pearl Harbor is a very interesting movie. Now their are two sides to my opinion of this movie. The historian in me knows this movie is horrible in showing everything that occurred. But i love the atmosphere of this movie. Jerry Bruckheimer's movies always look good. I also am a sucker for war romances ( I love the Winds of War). If you don't like romance in war movies i would steer clear of this film. Although i would watch anything Kate Beckinsale is in because she is gorgeous. I did have a problem with some of the casting. Ben Afleck works in the movie but i hate Josh Hartnet in this movie. He's just kind of there, he doesn't do much. His relationship with Rafe is not fully shown so it kind of diminishes the whole story. All in all this is a pretty average war film, the highlight is the special effects an beautiful scenery."

","Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" is terrific, explosive, exciting, and technically well-made. John Schwartzman's photography, and the film's effects, are outstanding; and, many of the supporting performances would have been exceptional, in a better story. Unfortunately, this film is far too long, and focuses on a the lamest possible retelling of the eternal ""love triangle"" during a war setting.<br/><br/>The film's length is not justifiable. First of all, the Japanese segments are pointless; since there is no attempt to portray them accurately, or with substance, they should have remained in the shadows. Secondly, the underused supporting cast's stories are even not worthy of inclusion. For example, Cuba Gooding Jr. appears to receive a medal, due to his race, apparently. And, Jon Voight appears to do his Franklin D. Roosevelt impression. But, Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler appear as themselves. So, wasn't the real Roosevelt good enough?<br/><br/>Ben Affleck (as Rafe McCawley), Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), and Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson) make up the starring threesome; and, they are earnest and attractive, playing out the storyline like they were acting in an old movie. Still, there really isn't anything to this trio; compare them, for starters, with the extraordinary characterizations in the silent ""Wings"" (1927). Then, see ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953). Either of those film's stories would have been preferable to this non-smoking ""Pearl Harbor"". <br/><br/>It's all so obviously contrived and predictable; and, with such good production values, a certain level of disappointment is assured.<br/><br/>****** Pearl Harbor (5/21/01) Michael Bay ~ Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr."

The fact is that of course, some of the stuff in it was historically incorrect, but isn't that the same for most movies? I think a lot of you are missing a lot of good about this movie.<br/><br/>For starters, this movie tells a great love story between a friendly nurse and two guys who are practically brothers. Bay does a great job showing how close these two were, showing their childhood together and even showing at the end Ben Afleck naming the son after Danny. This movie also has amazing special effects, and it does a good job portraying president Roosevelt. <br/><br/>Sure, you can say some of it was corny, but i thought it told a great story on two friends, both in love with the same girl, during one of the toughest times in American history.

","Pearl Harbor is a disappointment.I mean come on.The entire movie should of been sad and tragic story about two friend's and their unbreakable friendship.But it wasn't.It was planed to be but it wasn't.Rafe McCawley who is played by Ben Affleck and Danny Walker who is played by Josh Hartnett are two best friend's that dreamed to be in the air-force for their entire life's and when it comes true it all goes to hell.They start complaining about everything and they fight and argue about anything.Evelyn Johnson who is played by beautiful Kate Beckinsale is the worst character in the entire movie.She first hook's up with Rafe McCawley who she loves more then her self.Then Rafe goes to war and his plane is being crashed which hurt's her so much that she sleep's with his best friend Danny Walker who gave his best to comfort her.I mean...He was Rafe's best friend for his entire life and then he get's over his death in like two day's.Anyway he fall's in love with Evelyn and everything is perfect until suddenly Rafe comes back.What am i supposed to cry on this.It's so typical American war heroes story except there were much better ones.Evelyn is supposed to look like a virgin Mary in this movie an she end's up to be like some girl from Red Light District. Relationship between Rafe and Evelyn and Danny and Evelyn should have been more described and better realized.Then the movie could worth something.Like this it all happen's too fast and all the character's look like some moron's. The movie wasn't directed badly as written badly which is quiet surprising since the screenplay was written by Randall Wallace.Where are the Japanies in this story.They look like nothing but a terrorist's.They had innocent's dying too but in this movie only American's have lost their loved ones.This is supposed to be something like Flag's Of Our Father's and Letter's From Iwo Jima,then it would be worth of something.Like this it's nothing but a wasted three hour epic story with some fun in it.

","I first came about watching this movie after seeing an episode on MTV of I Love the New Millennium in which they described it as 'having a lot of stuff blow up' and it being the 'death of Afleck's career.' I had some time to kill, so I dug out the old VHS that we had of Pearl Harbor and started playing it. I was surprised that it was a Michael Bay film at first, for I am a fan of his work and didn't think he was into historical events.<br/><br/>The first half hour or so, I was appalled with the film work and bored with Afleck's relationship with Beckensale's character. Once his character of 'killed off' I started to actually get into the movie. I found that I was very emotionally drawn to the struggle of everyone in this film. The emphasis on color during the bombing scenes, and the artistic approach taken when filming the Arizona going down really touched me, as I have an uncle that is still entombed in the ill fated ship.<br/><br/>Once I got to the end, with the scenes in the rice paddies, I was ready for something to happen. The whole movie had been leading up to this point and I thought sure one of the boys was going down. Sure enough, one did, and I found myself crying, actually crying for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Historical accuracies and made up characters aside, a lot of us nowadays know a little about what happened at Pearl Harbor to know how devastating an event it was. This movie, if you let it, brings to life a little bit of what it was like, and continues to be like in some places, for soldiers around the world. In my opinion, it's a wonderful movie that gave me a new perspective on war with the added bonus of my favorite kind of film, a love story."

I like the way they solved it but it still tore my heart out that Rafe a) watched his best friend die and b) is raising his best friend's child from his wife's womb.<br/><br/>In addition to being a amazing(and tragic) love-story, it has realistically depicted war scenes.

If I wanted a great story... well you get the idea. When I want explosions devoid of plot, I turn to Michael Bay. This is why when I heard he was directing Pearl Harbor I immediately became sick to my stomach.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, you have disgraced history, disgraced anyone who fought off the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, disgraced anyone who survived the incident and you did it all to make the explosions look prettier. To alter the incidents which took place at Pearl Harbor and expect people to respect you is asking for it big time. Would you do the same with a film about the World Trade Center Twin Towers? When it comes to making movies regarding events in history that involved a great loss of life, people demand that you stick to the facts.<br/><br/>This is where Pearl Harbor fails miserably. Disregarding facts to increase the length of action sequences was a bad move. Things like playing chicken with P40s? Give me a break. Playing chicken and successfully taking out 4 Zeros in the process? Embellishments like increasing the death toll where it counts in order to further the emotional impact is also a big no no. I'm referring to on screen death of a Navy Nurse.<br/><br/>The actors themselves seem out of place and miscast. Whereas Hartnett was excellent in Black Hawk Down as Sgt. Eversman he seemed like a lost 12 year old kid here who was more afraid of Afflecks accent and acting than the Japanese. Affleck...well...Affleck. Kate Beckinsale is a looker but she has no place in a film like this. In fact the whole love triangle has no place in a film like this. Hollywood needs to understand that good films fill seats and that relying on big names will only work for so long. Time to start casting the right people for the right role. <br/><br/>Plot wise and with regards to accuracy, this movie is garbage. Typical Bay fanfare. Someone didn't do their homework as Mitchel Field was spelled with two Ls. Hartnett's line ""I think World War II just started"" when WWI was still referred to as ""The Great War"" in those times. Factual inaccuracies like this are inexcusable. More importantly, World War II did not begin with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It was preempted when Japan invaded China in '37 and began in '39 when Germany invaded Poland. Why does Hollywood assume history always revolves around the United States?<br/><br/>Now with all of that being said, you're probably wondering again why I gave this film 4 stars. In my opinion Michael Bay has succeeded in creating what are arguably some of the finest action sequences ever, despite the fact that they are horribly inaccurate. Because it's Pearl Harbor I have no tolerance for ignoring history. It's a shame really. If Bay had stuck to history, this movie would have won academy awards left and right. The action was amazing (aside from the occasional X-Wing handling capabilities which I didn't know MEs, P40s, Spitfires and Zeros possessed). Because of the fantastic direction regarding the action, I gave this film an extra 3 stars. But this doesn't excuse the horrible plot and blatant disregard for the facts (geez how many times have I said that). In the end, Pearl Harbor is a pitiful Hollywood trash film with explosive but unrealistic action sequences that pay no attention to history.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, you make wonderfully entertaining popcorn action flicks, but for the sake of mankind please stay away from history."

","The depiction of the Japanese Zeros in this film were entirely inaccurate. They should have been white, during the attack of Perl Harbor. In the movie, however, they are green. Couldn't anyone at Disney do some research and get that right at least. Everything about this movie was horrible, the directing to the script writing. At least one would think the battles would be somewhat accurate. I mean in every war film the color of the Zero before 1943 is show as white.

","When PEARL HARBOR was first released, I was, I admit, a silly teenage female. While watching the film, my thoughts were not focused on how historical it was, how well the plot developed, the emotions, or the acting skills. Instead, my thoughts went along the lines of: ""Josh Hartnett! Ben Affleck! *SQUEE!*"" I am pleased to say that this is no longer the case. I finally watched the film with a critical perspective, and must agree with many of the reviews. The romantic plot, to put it mildly, was not good. The actors were not very good, the script wasn't very good, and the dialogue was just awful and trite. I often found myself rolling my eyes and wondering when in the world they would get to the good action part.<br/><br/>As for the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence, that was (in my opinion) an amazing scene. The background music fit the mood perfectly, the effects were beautiful, and it just seemed to overall capture the true tragedy of the events. Of course, this was all ruined by the appearance of our two 'heroes'. They killed the mood, and I could just hear all of the preteen and teenage females in the world sighing and staring at the actors.<br/><br/>The after sequence of the attacks, in the hospital and the ships, was also quite well done, I thought. I found it very emotional and tragic. Of course, I did not feel this way when it was once again ruined by the appearance of the title characters, but lucky for me, they did not show up to much in either of these sequences.<br/><br/>After that, the movie just went downhill. We had to witness more clichÃ© 'plot twists', I suppose they meant for the pregnancy to be, and we had to see the actors attempt to act (and fail miserably.) But by far, the worst acting was shown at the end, when the character Danny dies. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. The whole thing was like a parody of a death scene, complete with touching speeches. I half expected Danny to whisper: ""The light! I see the light!"" He didn't say that, though he did mention being cold.<br/><br/>Overall, I suppose I must give two grades.<br/><br/>Acting: 1/5 Bombing sequence: 5/5."

","I think some have an expectation of this film based on the title. It wasn't. How would your expectation of the film have been different if it wasn't so titled?<br/><br/>If you're gonna make up a story around a historical event, don't call it the historical event, call it the story. I mean, they didn't call Dr. Zhivago: ""The Revolution"" What do you think when you hear the title? I think - a love story about a progressive writer set against early 20th century Russian political struggle. People don't try to take the thing too seriously. It's just plain inappropriate. So what we have here is egotism and ignorance and greed. Putting a Japanese flag on an American ship for a movie? Have you no shame?"

","This movie severely disappointed me. I was expecting an epic romance, a wonderful war movie with maybe even a little bit of social commentary on current/impending wars going on at the time of the film's production. I missed seeing it in theatres, which was probably a mistake, since the movie had exceptional special effects and very good (if not gimmicky) cinematography. The production aspects of the film were probably the only thing the movie excelled at. The acting was appalling. Kate Beckinsale failed to make any clear choices for her character or her motivations, and the two men served as great eye candy but really nothing more. It all added up to a cheesy love story about love carrying on through all and conquering all, without believing, at any time, that anybody was really in love at all."

","Pearl Harbor could have been bigger then Titanic, so what happened??? There was a number of things that caused this movie to flop it the way it did. <br/><br/>1. The story about best friends falling for that same girl. 2. The films running time of 187 minutes. 3. Using some cheap CGI shots. 4. The attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't happen till 93 minutes into the film. 5. The love and passion. 6. The music. 7. The uneven filming and pace.<br/><br/>I'm blaming Michael Bay for the films box office flop! It looks like he tried to copy Titanic's method of a love story, it just doesn't belong in a movie like this. Even though that the love story didn't go with the film. The film had great special effects, the attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the best ever filmed! But you can tell sometimes that they ran out of money because some of the effects are cheap CGI shots. (Notice this in the Battle of Britian dogfight).<br/><br/>Maybe if this film had a better writer, if Michael Bay was thinking right not to have a crappy love story and if the movie was cut down to an easy 2 hours, (and there was a lot of stuff that he could have cut from the film). This could have been one of the biggest blockbusters in film history. I'll give the movie a 4 out of 10."

"titanrd1","5","0","1","19 April 2006"," pointless, but watchable
","Why was this movie made? Was it to tell the story of The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that killed thousands of Americans or an overly predictable love story? I think it was neither. This film was made with the intent to follow in ""Titanic's"" profitable footsteps by combining romance with disaster, but the only difference is that the love story served ""Titanic's"" goal to convey the tragedy on an emotional level never before achieved on film whereas in ""Pearl Harbor,"" it just gets in the way. The characters are wooden and the love story is as unbelievable as Ben Affleck is playing a soldier. The only decent performances were Jon Voight (as FDR) and Cuba Gooding Jr., but neither have large parts. There are very few good things that I can say about this film because, as a whole, it has no point and carries no message. Luckily, it is kind of nice to look at, the cinematography is good and the special effects are, at times, brilliant. That's enough for me to watch it maybe once a decade."

","Question?what do you get with a combination of Jerry Bruckheiner,$150million budget and a screenplay based on one of the most important historical events in modern history,Ansewer,a complete mess.<br/><br/>Micheal bay's reconstruction of the infamous attack by the Japanese air-force on the American pacific fleet based at Pearl harbor in December 1941 is 30 minute's worth of impressive film making which looks spectacular on screen ,Its just the other 130 minutes of ""Pearl harbor"" that is a complete load of rubbish. The film tries to pack to many subjects into one movie and in the end this is it's downfall.What you get is a war film,buddy movie,love story,biographical account of historical people and events,defeat and victory all mixed in to a 3 hour film that should of been only 2. The prolonged sickerly-sweet love triangle and the doolittle raid were totally unnecessary given the most crucial aspect of the film was the attack on Pearl itself,And if the director had had concentrated on that subject alone instead of going down the ""Titanic"" route of story telling (love story set against a sombre theme)it could of turned out so much better.<br/><br/>The set pieces are effective and use the aid of modern digital technology to it's advantage,Bringing the aerial sequence's to life which are thoroughly eye catching.Though sum of these scenes are spoilled by the gung-ho American approach.Points being the young USAF pilot being inexperienced in the field of air combat but able to jump straight into a spitfire and take on the Luftwaffe and later Japanese zero's,But where supposed not to notice that. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the script and the wooden acting.<br/><br/>Ben Affeck and Josh Harnett give it their best as Raffe and Danny but are not convincing enough in the period characters they are playing,Kate Beckinsale's character Everlyn gives you the impression that she would open her legs for any serviceman with a little bit of charming and Ewen Brenner's stuttering character is just annoying,As for Cuba Gooding jnr's take of Dorris Miller, that is the worst and not done to the right effect. That said there are some creditable performance's from Jon voight as FD Roosevelt and Alec Baldwin does a good job playing Lt col Doolittle.But these roles are lost among a weak scripted.<br/><br/>The film tries and fail's in bits to tell the story of WHY and HOW the Japanese planned and then attacked Pearl harbor from a Japanese point of view,Unfortunately their isn't enough of an explanation of why,just they refuse(the US) to give us vital oil,and the how is a very quick bunch of scene's and not explained with enough focus on the actual event,the director's to anxious to get back to the love story and blowing ship's up.<br/><br/>THEN THE MOVIE TAKE'S A ON AN UNNECESSARY THIRD ACT.<br/><br/>After the humiliating defeat by the ""Jap's"" at Pearl harbor it's time for the Americans to kick some ass,This is achieved by the Doolittle raid on Tokyo which is historically accurate but the timing of it is not ,Or the film gives you that impression! The Doolittle raid tuck place around the middle of 1942 after which time the imperial Japanese had occupied much of south east Asia including American territory(the film fails to tell you this). And this is how the film ends with Raffe and Danny crashed landed in China after the Tokyo raid.(what about the US pilots captured over Tokyo,which also doesn't get a mention in the film).<br/><br/>I do like the bit where during the Pearl harbor attack Danny say's the line ""world war two as just started"" to inform everyone as to why there being blown to bits,I wounder what the British,French,Canadian and Russian force's would of made of this belated observation by the young American. To sum all this up i would say the film is a embarrassment and insult to the veterans on both side's(OK the Japanese were no angels)but the American's never fought back at Pearl harbor the way it is shown in this film .If your looking for an account of the events in the pacific field of combat during 1941 try watching ""Tora Tora tora"".If your offeneded by the good ole American view of the war""(what defeats)""then i recommended you stair clear."

","How could one possibly describe Pearl Harbor in one sentence? For me, it's saying this: it's a completely difficult one to judge. I really cannot say whether it's a bad film or a good one  it's neither. It was obviously made for big bucks at the box-office, but it is quite hard to tell if Bay was interested in creating a good movie or not.<br/><br/>Pilots Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) have been best friends since childhood. Soon, Rafe finds out that he has to leave for England to fight with the RAF during pre-WWII for America. He soon says goodbye to Danny, and his loving girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). When Rafe is supposedly shot down in France, Danny tells Evelyn. Soon, the two fall in love and turn to one another after the tragedy. But, months later, it turns out that Rafe is still alive and comes to visit Evelyn and Danny at their new base in Hawaii. Though the three are held in a tough situation, it gets even worse the next day when the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, drawing America into World War II.<br/><br/>I don't know whether I should begin stating the strengths or weaknesses  so I'm going to do both. I'll start with the main relation to the title- the attack sequence. The special effects are stunning. The scene would have been an achievement in cinematic action scenes if it weren't for the film's bad reputation. Not including the beginning or aftermath, the attack lasts over half an hour. That means, as exhilarating as it is, it's very hard to watch soldiers and innocent people being shot and blown up. It is very depressing, and not very fun to watch.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is best known for making loud action pictures (""The Rock"", ""Bad Boys""), and many label this as his worst film. I really do think that this is one of his harder works, but I would not call this a good movie either, and nor did I not enjoy it much. It seems like Bay would rather concentrate on the action and effects rather than the characters and their emotions (with a good screenplay).<br/><br/>The script in the film seems completely rushed and written without much thought. ""Pearl Harbor"" has very weak comedy, tedious love exchanges between the characters, and a clichéd, predictable outcome. I think Bay has tried too hard to create a Hollywood, love-story action masterpiece, but since it comes off as both a 'guy movie' and a 'chick flick' with such strong manner, it probably won't appeal to either sex.<br/><br/>The love sequence is probably the film's main weakness. Like the script, the love story has been recycled in many other films, mainly reminding us of ""Titanic"". ""Titanic"" had a fresh love story, great visuals, wonderful acting, and a terrific script. ""Pearl Harbor"" is missing over half of these qualities. ""Pearl Harbor"" was meant to portray America as a tough nation during WWII, but Bay belabors the point, and almost makes it Anti-Japanese (especially by giving us an unnecessary last 1/3 of the film showing a revenge attack).<br/><br/>I admit, the acting is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Affleck is pretty bad, yes, but he has done worse. Hartnett actually isn't too bad, but was better in Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"". The supporting performances are pretty poor, aside of familiar faces such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and Tom Sizemore.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that ""Pearl Harbor"" is an epic cinematic disappointment. A movie that could have been so much more than it is. However, it is a prime example of today's movie-making  how some films are made strictly for money, and not good criticism. I would say that I don't recommend ""Pearl Harbor"", but if you are a hardcore action movie fan, who can stand a long running length and a cheesy script, then go for it. Not really a bad film, just one that could have made itself so much more. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","Before we start lets say this movie isn't a success. It does have its ups, but unfortunately it crashes like Ben Affleck's spitfire in the movie in most other areas.<br/><br/>The convoluted love triangle between Beckinsale, Hartnett and Affleck left me horrified that this was going to be yet another ""Titanic"". And yes, it was. As usual the film attempts to attract the female audience to the film with the romance, with the side effect of boring the whole theatre witless as this is played out with clichéd film-craft and wooden dialogue, not to mention some dire acting from Hartnett, who would have been more at home in a Pantomime than this idealised rubbish.<br/><br/>Of course the battle scene is impressive, with excellent CGI and very good film-making displayed. It was clearly well thought out and executed and the inclusion of Cuba Gooding Jnr as the heroic black seaman, although it sounds corny, is surprisingly entertaining. Unfortunately this trips over too, as the two ""heroes"" dogfight with the Japos over the harbour. Yes, that is historically accurate, in case you missed it that was sarcasm. The film then deviates on some strange tangent about the Doolittle raid, which while interesting, really had little relevance to the Pearl Harbour raid, and served only to set up the inevitable ""NOOOOOOOO Danny don't die"" moment.<br/><br/>In conclusion this movie is dire, watch Tora Tora Tora!, don't waste time and money on this."

Talk about Pearl Harbor means to talk about politics, and that's impossible to avoid. When Balck Hawk Down shows such that thin red line from the side of the madness and lost heroes, this shows that war is not just funny, but is a place to meet the perfect girl and to save your country without getting dirty. How many people like this movie? well, the percentage of lovers is almost the same as the percentage of loathers, so it's pretty equal. I don't like the politic plot of the movie, but the director's work is impossible to spank. Michael Bay stills one of the best action directors in the world, and his editorial work is award worthy. But the screenplay is not good, damn, is just not good, and that's all. Ben Affleck is not a war hero, in action movies he loses the expontaneous genius of Chasing Amy or Dogma, and Cuba Gooding Jr is impossible to make another believable work since Jerry Maguire.

"ghoge","Null","0","2","8 September 2004"," a moral dilemma, Hollywood style
","*** may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>Let's get to the good part right away: the attack sequence is stunning. The visual effects are spectacular, and the sense of ""you are there"" is palpable. Plus, they portray the air raid itself with a reasonable degree of accuracy. (I appreciate strict adherence to historical accuracy as much as anyone, but we do have to remember, ""Pearl Harbor"" is not a documentary about the titular event.)<br/><br/>Once we get away from the attack sequence itself, things start to fall apart. Quite a few continuity mistakes dog the film, making it hard to concentrate on the story itself. (Examples: a plane gets shot down in broad daylight and crashes into the sea, but when the pilot swims to the surface, it's night time. A train passing near what looks like the Rocky Mountains would not arrive in New York that same evening. Ships at sea don't sail so closely together that they look like a fleet of toy models in a bathtub.)<br/><br/>The Japanese come off looking very cold and calculating. They always speak in rather stilted language (""we shall destroy the great American fleet"" as opposed to, say, ""we'll cream the jerks!"") and the background music is a bit ominous whenever we see them making the pre-attack preparations. The film portrays the attack as being made as a result of the Americans cutting off their oil supply, but they never mention that the U.S. cut off their oil because they were conquering China and other places in Southeast Asia. So it makes it seem as if, for no good reason, we provoked the Japanese into attacking us. They show Roosevelt as badly wanting to help the British fight the Germans, but at least they stop short of suggesting that he knew about the Pearl Harbor attack before it happened, as some revisionist historians have suggested.<br/><br/>And then there's the love story (actually a love triangle), ""Pearl Harbor""s raison d'etre. Yes, it's rather sappy. But (and, judging by the other reviews, this appears to be a minority opinion), it's also reasonably engaging. Specifically, the filmmakers set up an interesting moral dilemma:<br/><br/>if someone appears to be dead, is it wrong for the deceased's best friend and the deceased's lover to then fall in love with each other? And then, when they find out that the presumed dead person is in fact NOT dead after all, what should they do? Will the girl choose her first boyfriend or her second one? And will the best friend choose his friendship with his un-dead buddy, or his love for their mutual girlfriend? In a situation like this, there are no easy answers . . . except of course in Hollywood, where they arrange things in such a way as to work it all out much too neatly.<br/><br/>Discounting the too-pat resolution, I did think that the film explored these issues in an interesting way. And here was one detail that I, for one, found quite refreshing: amazingly for a contemporary Hollywood production, one of the boyfriends refuses to hit the hay with the girl when the opportunity arises, because he does not want to ruin things between them. (Regrettably, the other guy doesn't have the same morals, so -- in typical Hollywood fashion -- the two new lovers get it on right away.)<br/><br/>All in all, for a good, accurate portrayal of the air raid on Pearl Harbor (and the events leading up to it), skip this movie and see ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" instead. For impressive special effects, actually, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is quite good in its own right, but ""Pearl Harbor"" is amazing. If you want a sappy love triangle, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" will disappoint you, because it doesn't have one; the one in ""Pearl Harbor"" isn't too bad.<br/><br/>My recommendation: see the movie, but don't expect much out of the first hour and a half. Just sit back and enjoy catching the mistakes. The attack sequence is worth the wait. After that, you can watch the love triangle get resolved all nice and neat, then get on with your life."

","Personally, I really loved this movie. A lot. But that's just me. I realize that it got bad reviews, both from the newspapers and critics, and from people on this very site, but I disagree. Everyone rants about how it is historically inaccurate, has a ""hollywood"" plot, and does the soldiers on both sides injustice. However, and this may not be 100% right, most people who gave it such bad reviews were expecting a war movie, or a history movie, or a documentary, not a love story, which is what is primarily is. The attack is very important, don't get me wrong, but it is not the only thing happening, and is crucial to the plot.

Okay, so there's an American guy who goes a-flyin' and drops some Zeros when they're attacking. I can take that. But if you're going to make a movie about the most humiliating defeat USA has seen in a war, why oh why did they have to specifically continue from there, showing some weird morale-raising military manoeuvers after the whole thing? ""Hey, we got kicked around, but see, we lost a battle but not the war! Aren't we cool?"" ... They should have just ended the movie at Admiral Yamamoto's worries about US retaliation, like in that other movie (where even that scene was done far better!).<br/><br/>Part 4: I don't know - to me, it didn't *seem* like a WW2 movie. Especially the latter morale-raising part. Strip off the gear and make them a bit more modern, and presto, here we have a *modern* war/action movie.

Two childhood friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are sent off to a Hawaii Navy base and take part in defending Pearl Harbor, and later are sent off to briefly fight in WWII. It sounds like it will be a good film, but the love story is literally a mess. Michael Bay's direction isn't so great either. The action scenes and special effects are ultimately impressive. Affleck gives a pretty good performance, and Hartnett gives an even better one. He was in another war movie that year, Black Hawk Down, my favorite film of 2001 and one of my favorite war movies ever. It was better than Pearl Harbor, far better.

Pearl Harbor was well made, the acting from the three main leads though not spectacular, was certainly adequate, Ben Affleck was quite good as the square jawed all American Hero type, Josh Hartnett was not bad either as his quieter best friend and Kate Beckinsale proved an attractive and quite engaging female lead (this was actually the first time I had seen her in a movie). The special effects were superb and the battle sequences realistic. Also some of the smaller parts, most notably Alec Baldwin as Affleck's commanding Officer & Jon Voight as President Roosevelt were very well acted indeed.<br/><br/>I rated this film 6 or 7 out of 10, Ignore the bad reviews watch it and judge for yourself."

","I have heard many people groan when Pearl Harbor is discussed. To many people in my school, this film was a total disaster. It was a film that was made as a love film. Indeed it was made as a sort of love film, relating it to Titanic because it utilizes a major disaster and puts in two lovers in that situation. This film was yet very beautiful in my idea. I don't see why it should be considered a horrible movie. It was kind of annoying when classmates said that this film was only about love. Love Love Love..... who cares? Wouldn't it be delightful to see something unique in a war movie for a change? War films were always about deaths and blood. It was gore as it is. I see in this film a new ""type"" of war movie. Indeed, the film overdid love a little ""too"" much. I actually do consider this a love film, as well, but I don't see why it isn't compatible as a war movie. The battle scenes are very intense and sensational. It was very enjoyable to see the screen follow a plane. When a plane does a somersault, so does the screen. It was very emotional and striking when I saw the Japanese planes bomb the ships. The director did the most fantastic job in bringing the battle to life. I was very satisfied at the effort given in these scenes. The love story is unique in itself as well. I never saw a love film with such a different style. I enjoyed at the ebullience of many of the actors and actresses. They performed beautifully. I thought Josh Hartnett was particularly good in playing the main character's friend. He seemed very fit as the character he played. Ben Affleck was very good as well. His character was very show-offy but I thought that all was good. Kate Beckinsale did a tremendous job in playing both friends' lover. She seemed VERY into her character and she did look like someone from the 1940s. I actually consider this a great war film and a tragic love film at the same time."

","I had really been looking forward to ""Pearl Harbor"" when I saw the previews. Once I saw the long string of bad reviews, I decided to hold off and watch it on video.  Well, it earned those reviews. ""Pearl Harbor"" really tries to be three movies: 1) A historical account of the attach on Pearl Harbor; 2) A love story framed by that attack; 3) A story of the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo. I imagine that the producers were banking on audience having no interest in older films, because each of these themes was done much better in ""Tora, Tora, Tora,"" ""From Here to Eternity,"" and "" Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.""  If you're interested in the story of Pearl Harbor, a torrid romance framed by the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid, just rent these three films and you'll get a much better sense of the whole thing.  Yes, I admit that some of the action scenes in the attack were good.  But there's an awful lot of bad movie surrounding those scenes.  It's a shame because I'm sure many Pearl Harbor survivors were hoping that their experience would get the same respectful treatment (and intensity), that Speilberg gave the guys from D-Day.  That treatment is still to come."

","I think this film is only an action movie without a real reconstruction of a crucial event in the USA history. Two pilots and a girl, the old triangle good for anything love novel,  is a too poor story for giving support to a real tragedy in the second world war. I believe in the American talent and hope to see a new film on this argument:a damned day experienced through the eyes of a navy commander that isn't in love, but is living the drama of his seamen. and above all,it's useless to amplify the acts of bravery. In war a man doesn't aim to exalt one's exploits, but he wants to save one's skin and, in the same time, to eliminate obstacles. A war film isn't a performance of fireworks, it's a succession of bad scenes of blood and horror."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I won't deny I've been avoiding this film. When I learnt about it's release three years ago, I was going through a very anti-American stage, and as a result the sight of this film had turned my stomach. Skip forward to 2004 and the terrestrial television premiere. Sitting there watching this film, I pondered how accurate it was (this is not a period of History I pretend to know a lot of details about, I'm more of a renaissance Europe fan myself) and I groaned occasionally at awful lines. Over all though, I actually quite liked it.<br/><br/>In ""Pearl Harbour"", we're introduced to young Rafe and Danny (Affleck & Hartnett), two friends who grew up together and are like brothers. The two army fly boys spend all their time flying and hanging out together. Then the Nazi's invade Poland, WW2 in Europe begins and Rafe travels to England to join the good fight. Add to this situation the female input of the delectable Kate Beckinsale as a nurse and Rafe's love, and a three way love triangle develops. As the film progresses, the three experience first the bombing of Pearl Harbour and the entry into the war of America and then America's retaliation on Tokyo.<br/><br/>Like I'd said before, this film took a beating at the Box Office due to it's historical inaccuracy. I'll admit I'm not sure how inaccurate it is, although I'm sure it's not as bad as Gibson's farcical ""The Patriot"" or ""U-571"", but ultimately as long as you question every fact you see in the film, it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Aside from historical questions, the other criticism of this film is that it's just generally not very good. For this point I must confess, I really disagree. Whilst there are some really awful lines in this film, and it's so ridiculously over patriotic, for graphics, plot (or sub-plot if you want to put the War as the main story ahead of the romance) and the vast ammounts of intensity, I feel it delivers. So it'll never be as dark or powerful as other war films (""Saving Private Ryan"" to name one), and compared with other love stories it also falls short, all in all it's not as bad as everyone says.<br/><br/>If your looking for a film which combines the better parts of awful films (the boat & graphics from ""Titanic"", the romance from ""Armageddon""), then watch this film. If your going to be touchy and condemn anything with even the most remote historical inaccuracy, or your going to insult any film which isn't Oscar material, then yeah ok avoid this. For a blockbuster to relax to on a Monday night though, it does the job quite nicely."

","This movie is much more a fictional love story than historical fiction. Consequently, history and authenticity frequently suffer in order to bend the story around Pearl Harbor. Fortunately, the early reviews of this movie panned it and so I didn't pay to see it until it was on TV.<br/><br/>It starts off with the two heros meeting with Lt.Col. Doolittle a couple of years before the war. Doolittle, a WWI veteran, returned to active duty in July 1940 where he was assigned to implementing war production. He did not command any squadron until he formed the B-25 raid on Tokyo so he could not been involved with the two heros. Secondly, when Doolittle formed his squadron he used already trained bomber pilots. The two heros were experienced fighter pilots and would never have been transferred to bombers.<br/><br/>
The movie further departs from what happened on the Tokyo raid. First, it states that Japanese patrol boats were sighted 400 yards away. That didn't happen and no enemy  boat would ever have gotten that close to the American Fleet. In fact it was Japanese fishing boats spotted four miles away. The decision to launch the raid early did not come from Doolittle as shown in the movie but from an overly cautious Admiral Halsey. The movie shows the Doolittle planes flying in formation as they bombed Japan. In fact, each plane flew separately to different targets in Japan. The surprise was so great that unlike in the movie none of the planes were fired upon by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. One plane did encounter Japanese fighters but the fighters flew by. At that time the American insignia included a red meat ball in the center of a white star, similar to the meatball on Japanese planes and the Japanese who believed that it was impossible for American bombers to reach Japan probably thought they were Japanese planes.<br/><br/>Further, no two planes landed close together as depicted in the movie. For viewers who want a more authentic version of the Doolittle raid, see ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" or watch the History Channel.<br/><br/>If one wants to see a more accurate movie about Peal Harbor, see ""Tora, Tora"" which focuses solely on the Pearl Harbor Raid. Unfortunately the movie ""Pearl Harbor"" gives a shallow overview of the attack and what preceded it and it lacks accuracy. The special effects showing the attack are superior to that of Tora, Tora, but we have such inaccuracies of using air cooled anti-aircraft machine guns on the ships when the guns were water cooled. The two heros did not fly from Hickam Field as shown in the movie but from Ewa Field which was not under attack. No fighter ever got off of Hickam Field.<br/><br/>Generally speaking authenticity went to hell in this movie and so did the movie with a silly love story."

","In an era of different cultural contrasts as well as preaching of hatred towards races, the so-called 'protectors of peace' should be providing an example. Despite two horrific World Wars, mankind has still not learnt from his previous mistakes. World War 2's central catalyst was Adolf Hitler's self belief that the Germans were a superior race. It was his refusal to accept or respect the nature of other cultures that, in theory, led to his attempt to create a global German Empire. An attempt which caused the deaths of millions of men. In this age of knowledge and cultural understanding, man should have learnt to diminish the notion of the 'white man's burden', a term invented during the Scramble for Africa in the late 19th century. In order to create a world of cultural appreciation and respect, propaganda must stop in inferiorating the world by continuously illustrating the apparent 'greatness' of one nation. This is a concept that is clearly not understood by the producers of expensive Hollywood films.<br/><br/>
'Pearl Harbor' is a pathetic attempt to create sympathy towards the tragic event that began the war for control over the Pacific. Where do I begin? The story is simple. Affleck, a pilot based in Peal Harbor meets and falls in love with nurse Becksingale. He then joins the British RAF and has to leave Pearl Harbor. He asks his best friend Hartnett to watch over his girl. Affleck's plane is then shot down and he is assumed dead. After 3 months, Hartnett and Becksingale fall in love, and despite their gut emotions telling them that their relationship is morally wrong, they go ahead with it, yet to their disbelief Affleck's character returns. In the midst of all this emotional chaos, the Japanese attack and destroy Pearl Harbor. The film then goes on to deal with the love triangle as well as the United States' desperate attempt to regain a minor feeling of their supremacy and immense power over any other nation.<br/><br/>'Pearl Harbor' has re-used the genre hybrid remarkably seen in 'Titanic'. The combination of a love story within a disaster was an outstanding formula in James Cameron's 'Titanic' that created one of the greatest love stories seen in cinema. 'Pearl Harbor' has jokingly taken the formula a step further by adding a love triangle to the equation; a move that appeared to be a very bad choice. Whether it was the poor acting or the terrible screenplay, the audience gain absolutely no emotional understanding or attachment to any of the characters. The love between Affleck and Becksingale does not grasp the viewer; their relationship is not poetic and attracts no warmth. Neither does the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett. Their best friend status is poorly reinforced and there is no sense of reality amongst it. This grows even worse when Hartnett falls for Becksingale, which makes him almost despised, especially when the film predictably hints Affleck's return by portraying an emotionless response to his apparent death. The weak bonds between the characters causes a lack of concern for them when disaster strikes. There is no grudge or sympathy.<br/><br/>
Contrary to the poor dimensionalization of the characters, the action is outstanding and maintains Michael Bay's well reputed ability to create perfect images of disaster scenes, i.e. Armageddon. The Japanese attack is amazingly shot, and detailed to perfection. The camera angles are beautifully positioned to provide a realistic sense of the attack. The horror and fear within all the characters is about the only emotional aspect they seem to show believably.<br/><br/>With the poor start to this film leading on to an outstandingly impressive display of the Japanese attack, one would only assume it would get better. However, the viewer is terribly let down with a change in plot, that whether or not was historically accurate, was quite simply not necessary. It provides no balance for this story and almost seems pretty careless and stupid. I will restrict myself from detailing the events as I feel I would be wasting my time considering how out of context it was. For certain viewers, it may provide the need for a sense of self satisfaction, yet for the film to give itself some credit, the change in plot should have been avoided.<br/><br/>The final insult of this picture is the closing message at the end celebrating the US's victory over Japan. To remind readers, the US's victory resulted in the use of mankind's deadliest invention, the atomic bomb, which was dropped on two different Japanese cities instantly burning hundreds of thousands of lives. This is an event that deserves to be dramatized just as much if not more than the attack on Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>All in all a poor film. Its attempt to become another 'Titanic' fails miserably. Despite the good action sequences, the plot is bad, the performances were not grasping, with the exception of Cuba Gooding Jnr's lovable character as the chef, and the overall quality of this film was not as high as expected from the director and producer in relation to their previous work."

","""Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer do Pearl Harbor their way.  Their story follows the lives of a few people, Titanic style, leading up to the main event.  Like Titanic, this has visually and technically impressive production values, but unlike Titanic this is not all that great of a movie otherwise.  While there is nothing wrong with any of the acting, the story, or most anything else tangible, there is something amiss in Bay's directing style.  He is simply too slick for his own good, and while that is fine for something like The Rock, here it does not feel right at all.  Everything is shiny and sumptuously lit, and everything feels too perfect, too Americana, like Norman Rockwell had painted it.  The story is still plenty potent and there are great moments, but history would have been better served by a Saving Private Ryan approach than this sometime action-adventure romp."

","This movie reminds me of an old nursery rhyme: ""There was a little girl, who had a little curl / right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good. And when she was bad she was horrid."" You can also sum up this story by saying in the main that the parts in the air are terrific, and the bits on the ground are rather bad.<br/><br/>A good example or this is the romance segment between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale's characters. When they're flying in the air, it is really touching and effective. When they get back on the ground, it all gets tacky and clichéd. Again with Ben Affleck in Britain. The scenes in the air are breathtaking; while the shenanigans on the ground are pretty awful.<br/><br/>Exceptions are the guy with the stutter, who I thought was very good; and the draft examination sequence, which I thought worked rather well. Also, despite the strong criticism, I thought Alec Baldwin was terrific as Doolittle; and the famed raid on Tokyo was a good climactic coda. But again; while the characters are in the air or around the aircraft; it goes brilliantly. Once they crash onto the ground, the film literally drops away into schmaltz.<br/><br/>I have to say that I still prefer TORA TORA TORA as the better dramatization of this story, especially Jason Robards and Martin Balsam's characters. (My Dad totally loves this version however.) The best way to sum up this film is to say that, while it's not the great masterpiece it's obvious trying to be, it isn't nearly as bad as the critics who savaged it reckoned. It's just a moderately entertaining little story:- but that's something Hollywood doesn't ever seem to want to admit to now, is it?"

","I for one love a good war film and when watching a film titled Pearl Harbor thats what I expected. However I was very disappointed. The first part of the film bored me to tears, as any film staring Ben Affleck usually does. The movie does have amazing special effects, which are very difficult to be unimpressed by. I would have thought that any film about an event as dramatic as Pearl Harbor would have focused more on event itself rather than some cheesy love triangle. The movie turned out to be one that I would only watch again for the special effects. The film needs to be remade using the special effects of this movie and the storyline, and historical accuracies of the 1970 film ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", which has nothing to do with any romance, it just delivers a detailed account of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. And is far more gripping than ""Pearl Harbor""."

","My Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor had the makings for a great movie, but it failed along those lines. The movie was mostly enjoyable, but I think it was meant to better than that. Pearl Harbor succeeds in a few areas but falls short in others. I found it better than Titanic, I will probably be in the minority on that one.<br/><br/>The acting is a mixed bag. I think Josh Hartnett is actually good here. Kate Beckinsale is also good here, she and Hartnett have some chemistry that make them believable as a couple. Ben Affleck is downright horrible, he has no chemistry with either Beckinsale or Hartnett. Alec Baldwin is actually the best as Colonel Jimmy Dolittle. Cuba Gooding was just put in this story for star power, he doesnt have enough screentime. Jon Voight is decent as Roosevelt.<br/><br/>Michael Bay was the wrong choice for directing this movie. Bay is not an accomplished enough director do something like this, hes made entertaining action movies and thats what Pearl Harbor is, but Bay would never be able to make this into a ""serious"" movie. He uses a slow motion technique that is really unnecessary and kind of distracting.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor may have some problems in the acting and the director is totally wrong but its real problem lies in the script and editing. I feel that there are scenes between Beckinsale and Affleck that are unnecessary or too long, because these two have absolutely no chemistry together that it makes there scenes seem very uninteresting. Yes I will also admit the movie is about 20 minutes too long. Now we come to the script, which has some very bad dialogue. Some of this stuff is real sappy s***. Its obvious that the screenwriter has as much talent for writing a lovestory as George Lucas did 1 year later with Episode II. Pearl Harbor would have been more successful with a better script.<br/><br/>The real strength of Pearl Harbor is in the technical categories. The Attack Scene is one of the most impressive battle scenes I have seen in my life. For 35 minutes you will take a journey back to Hawaii 1941. The movie also has beautiful sets, cinematography and costumes. The movie contains excellent sound too.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is a bit of a disappointment but I still found enjoyable."

","I do not claim to speak for WWII veterans, or survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I don't have to be one of them to be insulted by this so-called epic film directed by someone who is under the impression he is Cecil B. DeMille. I have never liked any film that Ben Affleck was in, with the exception of ""Good Will Hunting"" and that might have been because his screen time was cut down to minimum. His presence on the silver screen is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard... the guy has ""I am a narcissistic jerk"" written on his forehead. Josh Hartnett acquits himself very nicely, as he usually does in most of his films. I think he understands, unlike Mr. Affleck, that in movie acting, sometimes less is more. Kate Beckinsale did a good job in her impression of a wooden plank. Perhaps Jerry Bruckheimer thought any Kate would do? Beckinsale tries her best to channel Kate Winslet's bread and butter ""english rose"" acting style but comes up short, way short. Don't even get me started on the films money sequence, the 45 minute long attack on Pearl Harbor. Almost 2,000 men went down on the Arizona, and countless others died on that morning. If you were going to make a film about it, why not give them some dignity, instead of a tired, sorry and clichéd love triangle story?"

A total waste of time, and an insult to the men who were killed in the event.<br/><br/>The love story wasn't terrible in itself (although not above the mediocre); its problem was that it was incredibly irrelevant to the story and seemingly mere padding.  But no matter how boring the love story was, I don't think it comes close to being as awful as the battle scenes which, in spite of having the entire canon of modern effects at the film's disposal, seemed sensationalized while oozing a phony patriotic attitude as the silly carnage went on forever.  The attack had NO pathos, no human feeling, no sense of loss.  Just the usual spectacular bilge.<br/><br/>What a dismal film -- and certainly the worst big film of 2001.<br/><br/>The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves!<br/><br/>

The guy at Ford Island who received the report from the radar van responded by saying ""Don't worry about it"", not the way it was shown in this movie. What happened to the USS Nevada?---it wasn't shown at all (the Nevada actually got underway but ended up beaching itself rather that be sunk and block the harbor entrance). Admiral Yamamoto was show on board the carrier ""Akagi"" in this movie, when in reality he was back on his flagship in Japanese home waters listening to reports coming in. Mitsuo Fuchida, who had the rank of Commander was referred to in the movie as ""Colonel"" (later in the attack sequence). Only 2 battleships were shown being attacked, but there were more than that present at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. A flight of Navy aircraft, as well as some Army Air Corps B-17s were coming in to land. Both groups of aircraft were shot at by trigger happy gunners. But this was not shown in the movie, either. During the Doolittle Raid, the B-25s split up--they all didn't attack the same target. The special effects were spectacular, but the overall historical accuracy could've been much better.

I thought one of the beefs with our militia is that we put black dudes on the front line and used them as cannon fodder, I guess back in 1941 we attempted to protect them from any potential danger by making valuable commodities like Cuba Gooding jr. cooks.  What were his credentials for becoming a cook?  Did he have any training?  They don't just make any old guy the cook, especially one who in theory could fight, if he wasn't such a huge wus.  Once again, where was star of Wild and Crazy Kids, Omar Gooding?  He is clearly the more talented of the Goodings, whie we are at it we might as well replace Affleck with Donnie Jeffcoat and Hartnett with Annett Chavez.  I think that would have added a nice twist to the movie.  Anyway, I watched the battle scene, which had some impressive effects paired with delightful homor by Gooding and Affleck.  I also saw this part where Cuba boxes some guy and then goes to the hospital complaining how he's just a cook.  If only they had a cameo by Fuzzy Zoeller complaining to Cuba Gooding while on line at the mess hall about the constant serving of fried chicken and cornbread, that would have been the perfect compliment to Affleck's brilliance.  All in all I'd say don't see this movie, cause it sucks.  However, if you have an utterly useless life or a few hours to spare, perhaps while you are on copious amounts of morphine, I'd throw it on for a good laugh or two."

The Japanese fighters are nothing than bad guys. The Americans are the best people of the world and doing everything righter than right. The U.S. President has been surprised of this attack....

","Pearl Harbor had one of the best trailers I've ever seen.  The John Voight voice over even gave it a verisimilitude of a real FDR Fireside Chat.  The shots and staging were some of the best of any film to date.  Bruckheimer and Bay seemed on their way to hitting a grand slam.<br/><br/>Instead, they hit a single.<br/><br/>If you mute the soundtrack and script, most will agree that Pearl Harbor is perfectly filmed.  The costumes, settings (modern Navy frigates aside), and feel of the film were perfect.  The script, however, is horrendous.  Ben Affleck delivers the worst lines in movie history.  Beckinsale and Hartnett LOOK great, but have equally deplorable dialogue.  Why in God's name would you make Pearl Harbor into a love story?  It reminded me of the Saturday Night Live skit where they combined Crystal Pepsi and gravy to make ""Crystal Gravy.""  Some things just don't mix.<br/><br/>No doubt, there are several well made scenes in the film.  Voigt's FDR is actually reall good, but again, we have the perennial dialogue problem. The actual bombing is riveting, but then we return to the moronic love triangle that hangs over the film like a sword of Damocles.  Alec Baldwin and Kim Coates provide throwaway characters -- perhaps the most shallow portrayal of Lt. Col. Doolittle possible.<br/><br/>I'm at an impasse because the film could have truly been so much better. Bruckheimer had good actors, big budget, well-financed production, and talented writers.  Yet combined, he created anti-syngeries:  The best looking film with the worst story.<br/><br/>I suppose it's impossible to expect every hit to be a grand slam. Bruckheimer did redeem himself with Black Hawk Down.  As for Pearl Harbor, just catch it on HBO reruns.  It's barely worth the rental on Video on Demand."

The film's first half holds your interest with believable characters, impressive set design, and a harrowing, over-the-top depiction of the attack itself, but then it drags on for another hour or so and leads up to an unsatisfying finale.

It is also highly offensive cinematically, historically and racially.<br/><br/>Cinematically this movie falls on its face from the first shot. Director Michael Bay seems to think we are more interested in the spectacle of the event rather than the people involved. Therefore we get lots of eye-candy but minimal character development. Therefore the actors can't do anything but look the part. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett are awful in the leading roles, and Kate Beckinsale is nothing more than a one dimensional skirt. What is worse, we are supposed to get an adrenaline rush from watching innocent people die (i.e. the numerous explosions). <br/><br/>Bay even has the cheek of showing Pearl Harbour as a US victory, when it was anything but. <br/><br/>Racially, this movie uses all the Japanese stereotypes and then some, presenting us with a laughable set of villains. If this is the point, then this movie is even worse. <br/><br/>I don't have a problem with films that promise you pure entertainment.

","SPOILER Out of ten I gave this a three. and thats only because the acting was good you spend three quarters of the film bored. Ok lets see basic storyline, Pilot goes off to Europe to fight for Britain but while he's away she cheats on him and not only that with his best friend. Ok maybe its because she thinks he's dead but is that really enough. and then he turns up alive just in time to find out she's pregnant with his friends baby and to be bombed by the Japanese, What a stroke of luck in the timing there. So then you have the bombing by the Japanese which is where the story gets quite exciting maybe because they actually pick up the pace a little, To be quite honest at this point you feel like your told the story by a Ninety year old with breathing difficulties.<br/><br/>So then the Japanese are quite merrily bombing the crap out of the US Navy Port of Pearl Harbor. And guess what you got the Two friends fighting side by side. anyway I think you get the Gist. This is nothing but sentimental rubbish. If you actually enjoyed the storyline of Titanic you'd probably enjoy this.<br/><br/>P.s. If you don't know your history here's a Hint The US Won in the end, but only after they were drawn in by this event. so this is reflected in the storyline with the usual Hollywood Aren't we great ending. After all the victors write the history books and the beaten crawl back ashamed and try to forget they lost.<br/><br/>This could have worked if they had of cut out the sentimental storyline, had the Japanese attack earlier and extended the fight back part of the storyline<br/><br/>So in summation this is a film that will probably only be enjoyed by people who like soppy movies or people who like mindless boring crap that teaches you nothing and twists events to suit their end goal (I think you know a few of these people in powerful political positions).

"emverano","5","0","1","2 March 2003"," A Crowd-pleasing Melodrama But Definitely Not A Masterpiece
","Screenwriter Randall Wallace did it again.  In 1995, he sentimentalized, melodramatized and generally dumbed up the historical accounts about William Wallace and wrote a rather mediocre script for the movie ""Braveheart.""  He did it again for ""Pearl Harbor."" He twisted and warped well-documented historical accounts and ended up with a weak script, which has an annoyingly predictable story line.  Moreover, the film clumsily climaxed right in the middle and kept on dragging on and on after that.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this movie was its battle scenes.  Unlike many other phony Hollywood war movies, the technical consultants of the movie amazed me with a great attention to details.  Many of the replicas of Japanese naval planes were constructed with minute details.  Most of the Zeros, Vals and Kates were painted very accurately in light gray or greenish camouflage.  Some of the machine guns on these planes were constructed surprisingly accurately.  (There was a slight inaccuracy in painting some of the Zeros greenish.  Historically, all the Zeros, which participated in the attack on Pearl Harbor, were painted light gray.)  Even though they were reproductions, the uniforms of the Japanese pilots (i.e. brown flight suits) and Japanese aircraft carrier crewmen (i.e. white outfits for enlisted men and black outfits for officers) were relatively accurate.<br/><br/>
A scene of a meeting of Japanese naval staff in which several large models of U.S. battleships were placed in a pool was surprisingly accurate historically.  According to an account written by a former member of the Imperial Japanese Naval staff, such a meeting did indeed take place in late 1941 at a Japanese naval base.  During this meeting top members of Japanese naval staff and several admirals did indeed debate about the tactics of Pearl Harbor attack while experimenting with several models of U.S. warships, which were placed in a large pool.  However, I am not sure if Admiral Yamamoto himself participated in this meeting.<br/><br/>
The attack scenes on Pearl Harbor were filmed excellently.  Even though the scenes in this movie were not as good as those in the 1970 movie `Tora, Tora, Tora,' the computer-generated animations were very well done.  Also, the panic, pain and carnage at Pearl Harbor were depicted very well.<br/><br/>
Japanese-American actor Mako played Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto very well. Just like Mako, Yamamoto was a short unremarkable looking man.  In fact, Mako looked like the real Yamamoto more than late Toshiro Mifune, who played him in a 1976 war movie `Midway' and 1968 movie `Isoroku Yamamoto.' Another Japanese-American actor Cary Tagawa played Captain Genda very competently.<br/><br/>
WARNING!!!  POSSIBLE SPOILER.  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ THIS, GO TO THE POINT MARKED WITH ******     Unfortunately, there were many really disappointing things about this movie.  The script of the film is very weak and clumsy.  For instance, the movie climaxed with the attack on Pearl Harbor which happened right about the middle.  The rest of the movie which led to the Doolittle's raid dragged on and on.  Moreover, why did the movie end with Doolittle's raid?  Even though this raid had some moral significance, this was a rather unsatisfactorily tame ending for this movie. Why didn't the director end this movie with the Battle of Midway, where the U.S. Navy did indeed spectacularly avenge the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor?   The director did not have to portray the entire Battle of Midway. He only had to show the crucial scene in which U.S. dive bombers attack and destroy three Japanese aircraft carriers.  That would have been a more satisfactory and spectacular ending to this movie.<br/><br/>The movie's central story line about the love of Capt. McCawley, his best friend Capt. Walker and the beautiful nurse Stewart was rather cliché and highly predictable.  Similar story lines have been used by Hollywood dozens of times in the past.  The story was so predictable that I could foresee the outcome hours before the ending.  Couldn't Hollywood writers come up with something new?  Also, why did McCawley and Walker, who were fighter pilots, participate in Doolittle's raid, an attack by medium bombers?  I did not know that U.S. fighter pilots were cross-trained to fly bombers.<br/><br/>
The scene of a meeting of top Japanese admirals and generals was so ridiculously portrayed that it became a laughing stock of some Japanese movie critics.  With Japanese soldiers dressed in crisp uniform standing next to a banner with the slogan `Service to Our Country' exquisitely written in large Chinese characters, this scene looked convincing, but only superficially.  Historically, no outdoor meeting like this ever took place. (In fact, top secret meetings anywhere in the world are rarely held outdoor due to security problems.  Almost all top secret meetings are held indoor in secure meeting rooms.)  Numerous meetings between top Japanese army and naval brasses did take place during 1940 and 1941.  But they all took place at secure meeting rooms within the Army and Naval Ministry buildings in Tokyo.<br/><br/>Just like in many other Hollywood war movies, the enemy soldiers in this movie were total morons.  Japanese soldiers captured McCawley and Walker but failed to search them for weapons--a very elementary battlefield procedure. While several Japanese soldiers were pointing their rifles at both McCawley and Walker, McCawley suddenly pulled out a Colt pistol and killed all the Japanese soldiers.  Those mentally-retarded Japanese could not even hit McCawley once.  In Hollywood movies, all Japanese and German soldiers are clumsy morons.   If Japanese and Germans are so dumb, why did the U.S. lose so many men and women during WW II and spent almost four years to defeat them?   I cannot figure out.<br/><br/>*******  This movie is neither a great masterpiece nor a total flop.  I agree with many people that `Tora, Tora, Tora' was a much better movie. `Pearl Harbor' was just a mediocre movie with good battle scenes and a very weak, cliché script."

","Okay, let's divide this comment up into two sections: One: Positive comments Two: Negative comments<br/><br/>One.....................okay, that's enough of that. Two, Get ready, this is a long one. But first, I'll say this in all fairness. It's an exciting film, and in some ways, does manage to portray the kind of intense, chaotic atmosphere that the attack must have engendered that morning. I love war movies and I've seen hundreds, good, bad, and ugly. This is a very ugly one. Only the special effects are any good. Period. This is only Jerry Bruckheimer's lame attempt to capitalize on the Titanic scenario of putting a heartwarming love story on a stage of a major historic event. But he did Cameron one better. Three lovers, but of course, one dies in a way that makes Jack Dawson's demise look wooden. Oh, I'm sorry. IT WAS WOODEN. This movie has no business masquerading as a portrayal of one of our history's most tragic and pivotal events. I personally know six PH survivors, including John Finn, the last surviving MOH recipient for December 7. He and most of his comrades simply shake their heads when they are asked about this film. It's a damned joke, a tragedy, and a downright INSULT to them and their dead comrades. A pathetic attempt to make the Arizona's 1177 dead into the 'focal point' of the film's patriotic theme is nothing more than a 'look what a great special effect this is' showcase. Now for the nitty gritty: 1.The RAF Eagle Squadron did not use active duty USAAC pilots. They accepted American volunteers with extensive or PAST Air Corps experience. The US could not risk the Germans saying that the US was actively sending American servicemen to fight in the Battle of Britain. 2.A PT12 Stearman, the crop duster in the beginning of the film, was a current and state-of-the art aircraft in the Air Corps inventory in the late '20s. Danny's dad would have had a Curtiss Jenny or a DeHavilland DH4. 3.Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm not) but the Battle of Britain ended on September 15, 1940. Even if Rafe was shot down on that day, (and what was he doing near the French coast?) and returned three months later, it would have been in no later than January 1941, not December 5. Granted, he might have been in the RAF until much later, but that's not what the film seems to suggest. 4.Where in hell was General Walter Short? 5.As noted by another comment, there were NO green Japanese Army A6Ms (Zeros) on the PH raid. Only the Nakajima Kates were green.<br/><br/>6.USS Nevada's run for the sea. USS Utah sinks. USS Maryland sinks. USS California sinks...okay you get the idea. As this film says, only Arizona sinks, Oklahoma rolls over and Shaw explodes. End of raid. Nothing about Kaneohe Bay NAS or the B-17s coming in. 7.The 'heartrending' scenes of the attack are nothing more than a vehicle to get Rafe and Danny into a pair of P-40 Warhawks from a satellite field. By the way, with all that was happening, how in hell did Danny know that the Halewa Field nad not been hit? 8.No Warhawk pilot with more than 3.6 minutes of flying experience would EVER try to dogfight Zeros. Can't be done. All the Flying Tigers used the greater weight of the P40 to dive into Japanese formations, attack with one pass, and get out. They always had the advantage of altitude. Having three or four Zeros  chasing you through the streets of PH at eye level would have one result: Two dead Americans. And what was that junk about 'let's play chicken?' What a load of dung! I'm sure that any surviving Air Corps fighter pilots must have walked, or stormed out of the theater at this point, thrown up or fell on the floor laughing hysterically. And getting men into the tower to shoot at the Zeros with Tommy guns. Nice touch. How'd they get the 100-round drum magazines? 9.The worst part, is that quaint bit about Doolittle saying, 'hey, let's get you into some bombers and go bomb Tokyo. Wanna come?' What a bigger load of dung. The crews of the 16 Doolittle Raiders were from a bomb group in Oregon and were all brought to Eglin in Florida for traning. NOT A FIGHTER PILOT IN SIGHT. A figher pilot going WILLINGLY to bombers is like an LeMans driver retireing to drive 18-wheelers to Cleveland. Didn't happen. Never. 10.Rafe and Danny, even BEFORE they left Pearl for the states, had the correct shoulder patch for the group that flew the raid. But how'd they get them? They were not in that bomb group. And I'm sure that the costume dept is patting themselves on the back for having the right patch. Duh. 11.I noticed that the USS Hornet went at one point from being WWII Yorktown class carrier to a modern one with an angled flight deck. USS Hornet had been painted in camoflage before the raid and DID NOT have the number '6' painted on the bow. 12.There was no last-minute frantic lightening of the bombers just before the raid. They simply loaded more gas onto them and had stripped them to a bare minimum long before they were placed on the ship. 13.Nice shooting, Danny. A bunch of mad Japanese soldiers with guns on you and you manage to pull your trusty .45 automatic and gun them all down. Nice shootin' Tex. 14.There are a ton more, but why bother? The film is an insult to the brave and traumatized men and women who were there that Sunday morning. Tora Tora Tora is a far better account, even if it does have a few flaws. I feel sorry for the people who take this to be an accurate and compelling portrayal of Pearl Harbor, but it's just a stupid, vapid love story with a predictable end, using a dark and painful episode of American history to make us think watching it is a patriotic act. It's not. I've seen patriotic films that work. Gettysburg is a good one. So is Longest Day or Band of Brothers, and Saving Private Ryan. This turkey is a joke. A cruel joke. 15.Nuff said."

","The Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production PEARL HARBOR is one of the great missed opportunities in the history of American movies. A year before the film's May 25, 2001 opening theater audiences were teased with a series of impressive trailers highlighting spectacular action sequences from the 135 million dollar production. Advance poster art for the film displayed handsome visages of the three main stars with vintage military aircraft flying in the background. Could it be that Michael Bay, the director of such mindless crash and burn spectaculars as THE ROCK and Armageddon , had acquired a gift for epic storytelling? James Cameron, another filmmaker noted more for technical know-how than with a gift for the pen had pulled it off a few years earlier with TITANIC , creating a hugely popular historical romance the likes of which had not been seen since DOCTOR ZHIVAGO and GONE WITH THE WIND. Alas, it was not to be. PEARL HARBOR emerged as an overblown , incredibly mediocre wartime romance. A box office sensation in its first 2 weeks of release , its numbers dwindled drastically as a result of lukewarm reviews and poor word-of mouth. The film seemed to gain a loyal following among the younger generations far removed from the events of December 7, 1941. But to World War 2 veterans and older members of the baby boom era, the picture was looked on as a travesty of history and a totally false depiction of the culture and its times. Randall Wallace's original screenplay had the quality of a sloppy first draft. The paint -by-numbers story of two childhood buddies who join the Airforce , fall in love with the same woman ( a gorgeous Army nurse, naturally! ) and go on to seemingly defend all of Pearl Harbor against the sudden Japanese attack is numbingly predictable. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray the two boyhood friends with great earnestness but they are crushed under the weight of a poorly written scenario.<br/><br/>The lovely and talented Kate Beckinsale , the object of the boys' affections, is also wasted in an essentially generic role. In fact the entire supporting cast is one huge blur, everyone playing ""types"" instead of flesh and blood people. The film's spectacular set piece, the attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor, is a tour De force of visual and sound effects (for which the movie deservedly won an Academy Award) but it can't save the second hand plot from sinking in its own commonplaceness. I wanted to like PEARL HARBOR. Making a movie , large or small can be an enormous task and it's amazing when a project is completed that fulfills even half of what the filmmakers intended. But the creators of PEARL HARBOR announced the importance of their brainchild early on , and the critics were armed on opening day.<br/><br/>In this case the critics were right. PEARL HARBOR is the frivolous product of a costly, uninspired imagination."

And none of them were Welch or Taylor, the two American pilots who made it into the air on 7/12/41.  <br/><br/>The modern warships masquerading as pre-WWII warships look as out of place as an M-16 in the Civil War.

Actually, the whole first half of the film deals with the really boring love triangle mixed in with the foreshadowing that Japan will attack us. If you took out the whole love triangle thing, this would have been a superb movie.<br/><br/>As of this point, I will pretend the love triangle (which was most likely thrown in for the DAWSON'S CREEK teenybopper audience) thing didn't exist.

Yes, my enjoyment of this film is of the guilty variety.  The writing is full of cliches, overblown speeches, and one-note stereotypes with a mediocre love story at the center of it all.  But the performances are all charismatic and surprisingly fitting for a movie set in this time period and the battle scenes are spectacular and visually stunning.

"jer33_3","4","0","2","19 November 2002"," Pearl Harbor wasn't the only thing bombed in this movie
","What can I say about Pearl Harbor? When Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer set out to make this movie they wanted to make a powerful epic war film. They clearly missed the mark on this one. First of all who in their right mind would hire Michael Bay to direct a war film? I'll tell you who, Jerry Bruckheimer. The two together make a great team when making blow up action films, but dramatic movies are definitely not their forte. Michael Bay is no more capable of directing a war movie than David Lynch is capable of directing a movie that makes sense.<br/><br/>However I can't completely blame Michael Bay for this awful movie, or Jerry Bruckheimer for that matter. Clearly one of the biggest problems with this movie was casting the whiny Ben Affleck in the lead role. He is the worst cast war hero in the history of war films. I would have been ok with it if the character was supposed to be a whiny wimp, in fact I can't think of anyone better to play that kind of character than Affleck, but they tried to make his character this heroic, cool, pilot. His performance was nothing short of pathetic. There were parts of the movie I enjoyed, but coincidentally all those parts were when Affleck was supposedly dead (to bad he wasn't). Every moment Affleck was on the screen I wanted to throw the remote control at the t.v. You might as well have cast his dorky brother Casey for this part, that would have been a heck of a lot better.<br/><br/>The script definitely didn't help this movie much, but as a huge Randall Wallace fan I can't hold him responsible. He wrote the script that Bay and Bruckheimer wanted. Randall Wallace is a very corny dialogue writer and it usually works, in fact it's downright brilliant in movies like Braveheart and We Were Soldiers, but for some reason in this movie it just didn't work. Why is this? The answer is that he was just writing what they wanted, and who wouldn't write some sappy cornball movie when you're getting paid a truckload of cash.<br/><br/>The acting overall was wretched. Even Tom Sizemore disappointed in this one, mostly because he was playing the same character he always does. But I can't write this review without giving credit to Josh Hartnett and William Lee Scott. They turned in great performances considering what they had to work with.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was a sad excuse for a war film and an insult to the Pearl Harbor tragedy. Most of the time this movie looked like a pepsi commercial masquerading as a legitimate WWII movie. This movie was an insult to me as a fan of war movies and for that reason I can't recommend it. However if you like to torture yourself by watching garbage then by all means give it a whirl.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 (would be lower but the scale doesn't go down to minus 347)"

All that time they spent showing the closeness between the three fictional characters they could have spent on REAL people in Pearl Harbor before the attack, much like Cameron did in Titanic. See my review on that for more insight.<br/><br/>When my mom and stepfather got home from seeing this, I said, ""Too bad it wasn't true,"" and my mom and stepfather were so misled by the love story they couldn't believe it was fiction. The same went for my sister and her husband, and even my brother who is an expert at war movies, ESPECIALLY WWII, was duped, and his girlfriend.

","It mystifies me that the complaints against this movie so often center around its lack of historical accuracy.  I hate to tell you this, guys, but the movie mostly gets the history right.  There's a minor detail wrong here and there, but if somebody who never heard of World War II saw this movie, he would walk away with a very clear picture of what happened at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.  He would know that the Japanese planned the attack meticulously, that they struck without warning and achieved complete surprise, that the battleships were caught moored in the harbor, that the American carriers were not damaged, that the ARIZONA exploded and the OKLAHOMA capsized.  He would even know that the Japanese admiral who planned the attack, Isoroku Yamamoto, had severe doubts about Japan's ability to win the war it was starting.<br/><br/>Perfect historical accuracy was not achieved, but neither was it claimed. The movie never pretended to be anything but a fictional story set against a historical backdrop, and the historical backdrop is perfectly adequate - far better than average for Hollywood.  It's the fictional story in the foreground that stinks.<br/><br/>PEARL HARBOR's story is about a love triangle.  That's not the problem either.  The love triangle is a perfectly good plot device; some of the finest dramas ever made are built on it.  But the device can't work by itself.  It's a setup for the characters to make dramatic choices.  In PEARL HARBOR, the characters in the triangle mostly don't make any choices, and even when they do, the choices are irrelevant.  Forces outside the characters themselves set the triangle up; forces outside themselves then resolve it.  The characters' own thoughts and feelings don't drive the story.<br/><br/>The arbitrary setup and denouement aren't the only problems with the story, though they are the worst.  The movie also presents stupidity as if it were a survival skill.  From their boyhood to their adulthood, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker fly like dummies.  This isn't accidental; the movie deliberately paints them as dangerous to themselves and their comrades.  In the real world, stupid military pilots die - quickly.  World War II aerial warfare was one of the most unforgiving combat arenas in military history (for instance, you could very easily kill yourself without any help from the enemy).  What would it have cost to show these fellows as being aces because they were smart?  Not only would the movie have been truer to life, but it would have been more fun to watch.<br/><br/>I can't help but sympathize with Cuba Gooding, Jr., who might as well have had ""gotta get the black demographic"" stamped on his forehead.  He has nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the actual story; he doesn't interact with any of the main characters meaningfully, and had he been white he would have been written out of the script or, more likely, never written into it in the first place.  I have to admire Gooding's professionalism, since he did a good job anyway, even though he must have known he was a token.  I hope most of the black viewers had the good sense to feel insulted by the condescending assumption that no black person would have any interest in a story about white people.<br/><br/>At least the bloated budget does achieve the things that bloated budgets can do.  The high-dollar acting talent pays off.  Ben Affleck's acting is superb; he does pain, resentment and embarrassment very well.  He doesn't get a chance to be subtle, but screenwriter Randall Wallace clearly intended Rafe McCawley to be a man who wears his heart on his sleeve.  Mako does a first-rate Admiral Yamamoto; his lined face and spare figure make him less than a perfect physical match for the real man, but he gets his spirit just right.  The visual effects are reasonably good.<br/><br/>PEARL HARBOR was made in an attempt to copy the success of TITANIC.  Even the most rabid TITANIC-hater will have to admit, on seeing PEARL HARBOR, that James Cameron could have done a lot worse.  He could have made a movie like this one.<br/><br/>Rating: ** out of ****<br/><br/>Recommendation:  See it on cable on a slow night."

While the special effects were adequate, the scene failed to capture my attention.  It dragged on for an unbearable forty minutes, and instead of being enthralled, I was bored. However, at the point when Affleck and Hartnett get into their planes and start shooting down attacking Japanese forces, I wasn't bored.  I was angry. That simple action destroyed any credibility that the scene may have created.  While TITANIC's heroes performed some heroic deeds, they never saved the day, and when it came down to it, they were just trying to get off the boat alive. The biggest insult in the film, however, would be Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s performance.  It can best be described as ""brave.""  You'd have to be brave to compromise your career in such a reckless fashion.  His character has no purpose whatsoever.  He escapes the kitchen, watches his favorite captain die, then mans the nearest machine gun and shoots down one plane.  ONE PLANE.  This may have meant something if there weren't about a thousand planes bombing the harbor.  Good job, man.  You're a true American hero. And what scathing PEARL HARBOR review would be complete without a mention of the complete lack of chemistry between the three leads?  The groan-inducing dialogue?  The embarassingly inept screenplay?  The hideous performance by Jon Voight as FDR?  The laughably bad makeup that is used to give him turkey neck? Oh, so many complaints, so little time.<br/><br/>The movie is a gaudy monstrosity, so convinced of it's own importance yet completely oblivious of it's superficiality.  One of the worst films of the decade."

","The acting was uniformly bad. The historical inaccuracies were too numerous to itemize. The special effects were cheesy. But some of the nurses were very cute. I like Kate Beckinsale a lot, and maybe this movie was good for her career. But it doesn't look good on anyone else's filmography.<br/><br/>
Now, I admit that it's much more difficult to make a realistic WWII movie now than it was 50 or even 40 years ago. But it can be done. Saving Private Ryan is a good example, HBO's Band of Brothers is another. Filming a simulated attack on Pearl Harbor is more difficult than a simulated assault on an empty beach. But if you're going to spend $150 million on a movie, the result should be a film worth watching. This one rates as equal to a fairly mediocre network mini-series."
"shenzhengxian","Null","0","1","12 October 2002"," it's not perfect but worth seeing
","Pearl Harbor, I think, can be called as the hottest one for last summer vocation in Shanghai. 'cause it has many great and huge scenes of the war-fighting. They were made perfect, I consider, not worse than the ones in Saving Private Ryan, even better. But what should be mentioned here is that you'd better see this film in the cinema, or I'm afraid that you would not find the feelings of how strong the scenes are for your eyes and the music are for your ears. As we all know, the synopsis is that set during the time of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, two friends (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are caught up in the events that draw the United States into World War II. One of them enlists with the U.S. Army Air Corps and the other flies for the British Royal Air Force, but they both find themselves in love with the same woman (Kate Beckinsale). I've seen this flick-show for three times. I dun think of it as one of the greatest movies in the world, but I still consider that it is worth seeing. Before watching it, I thought that it would surely talk much about the war. ( I just learnt it from the name of the movie.) But I was wrong! I found it talked more about love--the relationships among Rafe, Denny and Evelyn. I guess that the director wanna use the love story as the main clue to the whole movie story. But too much has made the movie neither the kind of love nor the kind of history. In the way of love, Pearl Harbor is not as good as Titanic and in the way of war, it is also not so good as Saving Private Ryan. So I think that's the reason why Pearl Harbor is not in the tops box in the States. Well, having said a lot about the main idea of the movie, let me change to talk something about the characters in this film. I like the three chief actors. Ben Affleck who acts as Rafe is very handsome. ^^ I like him. His handsome face, tall and straight figure with the uniform makes me feel the hot heart inside his body--brave! He is really like an officer, a soldier. During the wars, he showed the very wisdom and courage of a real soldier. Besides those, the friendship between he and Denny has touched me much. Rafe always tried to protect Denny from dangers, but in the end Denny cost his life to save Rafe's. I also desire this kinda friendship. Evelyn is the woman the both love at the same time. I think she loved both of them. 'cause they are too nice! It's hard for her to make a choice. If I were her, I would get the same trouble. In addition, the music through the movie is perfect I think. The main music in it makes me feel how vast, wide, calm the sky is. And I also got a little bit sadness in the song. Anyway, Pearl Harbor is worthy of being seen. There's no doubt about my words. Trust me!"

However, I do have to strike back at these critics and inform them that ""Pearl Harbor' was a very important film to make especially because of September 11. As most of us know, the film is based on that `day of infimacy' when the island of Pearl Harbor was `turning japanese'; we really think so. The movie also depicts a love triangle between two best friends air force fighters and a beautiful nurse. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett execute decent perfromances in parts I am sure they fought hard for to get.

To me the reality of Pearl Harbor is intensified when it involves people we know and like.

","Events in history, in my opinion, can never be captured into a movie, at least not with full effect. However, Pearl Harbor does a great job at it. Although the first little while in the movie can be a bit boring to some people, it caught my interest. And when the action finally starts, it never stops. Bombs fly, planes soar, and machine guns mow soldiers down. I didn't experience the attack on Pearl Harbor, nor did anyone in my family, but I can imagine it was something extremely close to this movie. I'm sure that nurses and doctors in hospitals were swamped with half-dying people, and I'm positive that any soldier rushed to a plane so he can take action in the war. I gave this movie an 8 because in my opinion the movie was a little too long. I've watched this movie once in it's entirety, and everytime I sit down to watch it again I think, ""I don't want to watch this whole movie again."" But other than that I have no problems at all with this movie, I think Pearl Harbor is a great film and deserves more credit than people give it."

PEARL HARBOR is not the worst film of all time, by all standards.  It has cutting edge visual and sound effects, and was a minor box-office success.  The extravagant DVD box set must have sold even more copies, which is shocking.  Whereas TITANIC lacked a story, there were a few good performances and the FX were pretty damn good.  PEARL HARBOR has the worst acting and the worst screenwplay I've ever seen in a big budget film.  The destruction sequences would have been ten times as apalling if they weren't already used in TITANIC, and the cast is awful.  Ben Affleck is not a very good actor.

The number one complaint I hear is that the main focus is the love story. What in the heck was wrong with it? It showed the America before the attack, innocent, carefree, but in the back of their minds, they knew there was a war out there, and they knew it could come to them. If they just had the movie be about the event, there would be no reason to care, it would have been impossible to establish how big the event was and have any characters for us to care about at all. When they revolved the event around a love triangle between 3 characters, they made it relatable. Pearl Harbor hit the ordinary events of their lives like a sledgehammer, making everything else in their lives seem insignificant, which is a whole lot more relatable to me since 9/11. Another complaint is including the story of the mission to bomb Tokyo. Well I was born in '83, and am not a big history buff, so that whole part of the story was fresh and exciting to me.<br/><br/>As far as the actual historical events of Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle bombing of Tokyo, they were breathtaking. The special effects were flawless. It showed the sheer terror and chaos of those events. I had to watch the ""making of"" documentary to separate what was real and what was the work of ILM.<br/><br/>I will admit that the representation of the Japanese are the biggest flaws with this picture. Japan didn't attack us for the reason they gave in the film. They were not sad that they had to bomb the U.S., in fact they celebrated the attack. And the final flaw was the lack of the abundant amount of Japanese American citizens that were living in Hawaii at the time.<br/><br/>Despite those flaws, I think that Pearl Harbor is a wonderful movie that I only put second to Lord of the Rings as the best film of 2001."

","What can I say, this was your average Michael Bay/ Bruckheimer film.  Awful, awful awful.  Sappy scenes used to their best advantage to manipulate the audience into feeling a certain way with no nuance whatsoever.  An overwhelmingly simplistic plot with no characters that the viewer could care anything about.  The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because the actual beginning of the attack scene was pretty interesting, although the moment that Affleck and Hartnett went up in their planes during the attack the thing turned stupid again.

","After repeated viewings of this movie, including the (quite superior) director's cut, I think I can finally give a good judgement on this movie. When people critisize this movie they most often complain about the corny love-story and the abundance of american patriotism (especially in the last part of the movie). But I think you're missing the point of the movie if you do that. Michael Bay wanted to recreate the emotions and experiences of Pearl Harbor. He chose as main theme, the loss of innocence, how the isolated USA suddenly realized they weren't invinsible and couldn't ignore the conflicts in the world. How he did this was by recreating the life-style of that era, of the 1940's. You have to understand that our ideas about love, sex, romance etc. are so different from people's thoughts in 1941. What to us sounds like cliché's, at that time, might very well be considered normal. The smooth-talking, the romantic goodbye-kisses etc.<br/><br/>This makes Pearl Harbor an interesting movie, because the movie doesn't really project the society in wich it was made (like American Beauty or Fight Club and probably about 90% of all movies), it's like a time-capsule. Pearl Harbor recreates the era of the 1940's with all it's beliefs and ideas. That also makes this movie, nowadays, not very easy to appreciate (especially when the whole world has already seen the quite similair Titanic), people just don't accept the movie, because it doesn't fit our current state of mind. It maby is too soft, too unchallenging for our minds.<br/><br/>
And here lies the main critique you could pose to Michael Bay. Pearl Harbor isn't THAT facinating anymore in 2002, because the audience has already seen Saving Private Ryan, Titanic, even Tora!Tora!Tora!. Pearl Harbor isn't breaking any boundaries, as a movie (ignoring the FX), so people feel like they're watching a rehash of other War/Disaster movies. If it would have been released pre-Titanic, who knows, maby back then it would've won 10 oscars or whatever, because in my eyes it certainly isn't a worse movie than Titanic.<br/><br/>Taking this all into consideration, you come up with a movie that is actually quite good. The slick directing of Bay might not appeal to you (it isn't my favorite style either), but it has it's strong points, especially during the battle-scenes. The cinematography is also beautiful, though not really inventive. Acting, writing, it's all pretty solid. But you HAVE to accept the film for what it is, because if you look at it with a pair of 21st century-glasses, it looks like the most repulsive kind of military propaganda ever, full of cliché's and repeated formulas. Seeing it as a flashback-piece, a look in the past, Pearl Harbor becomes a gripping, spectacular and facinating look at the attack and how it changed America at that time.<br/><br/>overall, yeah, about an 8 out of 10."

Nevertheless, these virtues are not enough to overcome a love story that is lame even by the standards of WW-II propaganda pictures, which it tries to emulate.  In its romantic subplot, boy gets girl; boy loses girl because she thinks boy has died a heroic death; girl then falls in love with boy's best friend.  Has boy really died?  What do you think?

","I think sometimes people find it easier to jump on a bandwagon, that way they don't have to think for themselves.  As Brad Pitt's character said in '12 Monkeys', ""there's no right or wrong, there's only popular opinion."" <br/><br/>
That seems fitting in the case of this movie. Its just not as bad as I was led to believe by movie reviewers, movie fans and Joe Sixpack on the street. <br/><br/>Believe me, I know bad..I hated 'Armageddon' and that was bad!<br/><br/>Of course its corny.  Of course the romance is strained at times and sugarcoated.  This is where the gap between the generations shows its teeth. Audiences today are unwilling to transport themselves to a time and place when life was probably a lot more joyful.  Crime was not that much of an issue, there was no television, and a slice of Wonder Bread was as good as it got.  People talked corny because the movies they were seeing at the time were like that!  So I think you have to remember that when jumping all over the script.  <br/><br/>I do see a problem with some of the acting, for part of the movie at least. I didn't buy Affleck for a second and for my money he made a ton of bad acting choices.  He had no chemistry with either Hartnett or Beckinsale and I just don't see him as a leading man at times.  I did in 'Chasing Amy' and maybe he's more comfortable in movies like that, so maybe he should stick to that.  He knew this was a romantic war epic and Kevin Smith was nowhere to be found.  Hartnett is much more emotionally available but still has a lot to learn.  Beckinsale also seems a little uncomfortable with the material at times.  <br/><br/>But all problems were overcome with the extensive attack scene, which is exceptionally well-done from all angles.  In movies like this, if I can sense the terror, if I can get a glimpse of what that must have been like, then I am grateful.  The terror was encapsulated in the screaming plea of an extra, 'I CAN'T SWIM!'  Whoever that guy was, he acted his pants off and showed me a soul in distress.  That is probably very hard to do, also..show that in two seconds of screen time.  Then the hospital scenes were also very well done.  The chaos that occured had to have been unimaginable. <br/><br/>
As a New Yorker who was 2 miles from the WTC when it was hit, I cannot begin to know what being attacked was like..but I do live here so it did happen in my hometown.  That day I had to walk home (that's not a complaint) and on the way I spoke to several people (that's not a complaint either).  I remember saying to one guy, ""This is Pearl Harbor"" and that was before I saw the footage of the buildings going down, or this movie.  But the movie hit me harder than it normally might have because of the 9/11 attacks.  Seeing Americans being murdered in a surprise, cowardly act does not get all that much easier with time, unfortunately.  For the people around in 1941, these events were profoundly disturbing.  <br/><br/>Everyone that complained about 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbor' was really just complaining that no one in either movie had a cell phone.  8/10."

The script is terrible, changing from love story to goofy comedy to supposed drama.

By the end of the film I could tell that one of the leading males was going to die but i was so mind-numbingly bored i couldn't have cared about which one became worm food. Yet seeing as Ben Affleck wouldn't stay dead earlier in the movie and had been jilted it became more obvious that the other guy would croak. And what was that bit with Cuba Gooding Jr all about? He had no importance in the storyline and seemed to be there so that the movie could be sold by the names of those in it, even if there is no point in them being there.

My own wishful thinking....If you're going to go three hours, drop the RAF beginning and the Tokyo raid ending.  Cover the destruction of more dreadnoughts in real time, with enough lead-in for historical motivations, and there will still be plenty of film left for a love story.  2. If you are short on time...Fast-forwarding through all scenes that do not include a plane or ship does not detract from the likeability of already pleasant-faced characters and cuts running time to two hours.<br/><br/>3.Alec Baldwin yelling ""max power"" conjures up images of Homer Simpson changing his name to same. Mr. Baldwin's natural smirk makes him a natural comedian; as far as Doolittles go he's got too much Doctor and not enough Jimmy.   4. My favorite ""you are watching a Bay/Bruckheimer film"" scene.. Baldwin and his flyers walking out of the hanger in slo-mo vee-formation with a couple of B-25's buzzing the field. Max power!    5. My favorite ""instant transportation to another era"" scene ...The shiny yellow/orange gas station near the end.  If you're starting to doze off it might get you going again for the last half-hour, like a refreshing glass of lemonade/orange juice.   6. Least likely production memo...Bay: ""I'd like to include actual footage of  modern warships, digitally obscuring their modernity, in order to juxtapose the obsolescence of the battleships and Japanese illusions that the attack would cripple America's will to fight in the Pacific ."" Bruckheimer: ""Hey, we're already over $100 million, go nuts.""  7. Most poignantly confusing moment: Japanese gunner frantically waving from the back of his plane while kids on baseball diamond interrupt play to stare skyward. Is he...a) gesturing for them to take cover, b) telling the planes behind him not to open fire on the field, or c) admonishing them for an inferior style of play?  8. Sexiest moment for the ladies without Ben or Josh in the picture...waist-down shot of Japanese pilot in stylish undies putting on cumberbund before the big dance.   9. Sexiest moment for the guys without Kate in the picture....Tom Sizemore pulling a 12-gauge out of his motorcycle and calmly opening fire on the attacking planes.  10. Proudest moment...Reviewing the U.S. Navy's great tradition of fast carriers during the launching of the  well-anchored Doolittle raid. I'm not familiar with the production troubles this movie had, but did they use three carriers (two active, one museum) for this?   11. Rent it for the spectacle that it is.

Any woman that much in love would not sleep with the love of her life's best friend three months after he ""died"". The beginning was very well done, the movie had me until Rafe MCawley ""died"" and then Danny Walker, his best friend, took over as the leading man. Beckinsale and Hartnett had no chemistry and their romance was just an excuse for a conflict in the movie. They should have left it with Rafe and Evelyn together the whole time. Parts of the movie were very predictable, including the fake death of Rafe. The only other very troubling part in the movie was that at the end after Danny died, Evelyn just decided to go back to Rafe. This didn't make her look to good. From Rafe to Danny back to Rafe, it was too much switching-this made her look very unreliable. In the beginning I adored her character but by the end I disliked her. *End of Spolier*<br/><br/>The scenes of the actual battle and of Doolitle's raid were very good. I couldn't have asked for a better portrayal of these battles. The script and love story could have used a lot of work on the other hand.

I would have given this movie 1/10 if it weren't for the special effects."

It could have slipped through as cheap, forgettable action movie if it concentrated on the action scenes, like the 40 minutes of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but unfortunately, it doesn't.<br/><br/>This film has one of the biggest budgets in the history of cinema, and all we get are a lousy 40 minutes of action scenes, which are ridden by historical errors any person who has the slightest interest in history can't possibly ignore? Instead, Pearl Harbor tries to tell us the love story of a girl and two men, and it tells it over two tedious hours long.<br/><br/>But a love story needs more than a girl and two boys. It needs a believable plot, good actors, and a reasonable background. Which means, everything Pearl Harbor lacks.<br/><br/>I won't even go into detail about the diseases that many Hollywood productions plague, Pearl Harbor being no exception, like blind patriotism, horrible dialogues, and historical falsification.<br/><br/>On the other hand, mankind has films like Dark Blue World, which has great albeit unknown actors, interesting characters, great flight scenes which put Pearl Harbor to shame, a captivating love story, and many great characteristics more although the film had a fraction of the budget of Pearl Harbor. Dark Blue World surpasses Pearl Harbor just in every aspect, whether it's actors, story, flight scenes or historical correctness.<br/><br/>If you want a really good war movie which leave you with the impression that you just have watched a good film, go and watch films like Dark Blue World or Das Boot.<br/><br/>If you want to see a war movie and the feeling that you are wasting time and money on it, go and watch Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Rating: 1/10"

Now, when someone says 'one of the greatest movies ever' I think of film titles like 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Silence Of The Lambs' or something near that. But, since my friend was a pop-frenzy teen who generally looked for only hot guys in a movie to classify it as good, I decided to see this wondrous film.<br/><br/>When I came out of the theater, I was extremely disappointed. This movie was awful. The only actual good scenes were battle scenes that even then were kind of boring. I found myself yawning more than often and surprised that Cuba Gooding Jr. was in it (not one of my favorite actors but, still). Also, I thought that it was extremely...weird how so  many older people on TV. said it was fantastic. This movie, I guess, is recommended to young teens who only want to see a woman lose faith and betray Ben Affleck and also see Josh Hartnett take his shirt off.

","*Pearl Harbor*<br/><br/>*slight spoilers*<br/><br/>This movie, by far, is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  Big stars can't save it.  How on earth can people like this movie? <br/><br/>
The character development is horrible.  Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale)is a nurse who falls for Rafe (Ben Affleck), a pilot.  Rafe's best friend Danny(Josh Hartnett), is also a pilot.  After Rafe goes off and ""dies"" Danny and Evelyn are heartbroken.  But what the heck, about two weeks later Danny has Evelyn knocked up and he thinks he's in love.  This sounds like it might not take that long but it's stretched out with plenty of bad dialogue and corny jokes.  Than Rafe returns (his plane crashed into the ocean, he survives), he isn't very happy and decides he doesn't like Danny anymore, but loves Evelyn.  Lots more boring dialogue and than 30 minutes of a great battle scene take place (this is all they showed us in the teasers, false advertising at it's worst).  We had to wait through about 2 hours of Evelyn loves me, Evelyn loves me not to get to JUST 30 minutes!  Than we wait through more corny dialogue, ""I'm giving my heart to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you"", and than we get a bit more action scenes.  Not enough.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the acting.  It's just plain bad.  There are so many familiar faces in the movie... but the acting is still bad.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie at all costs.

They are known for concept.  They are known for action. They are known for special effects.  And that, ultimately, is what PEARL HARBOR delivers.  <br/><br/>I will agree that the film takes a while to get started, and ultimately we in the audience have to suffer through as many bad lines as bullets fired by Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  But the film is nowhere near as bad as the critics made it out.  It is not the root of all evil.  There is far worse dreck out there occupying space on a video store shelf.  The fact is that once the movie does get going and the and the Japanese attack, the films visuals simply soar.  Some of the sequences are amazing.  And this is where the heart of the film lies.  Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a visual spectacle at the expense of story and character (neither Ben Affleck nor Josh Hartnett are good enough actors to elevate what little material they have been given here)."

"sddavis63","5","0","3","9 June 2002"," Stick With It - The Wait Is Worth It
","This is two movies in one, and almost forces anyone trying to review it to divide it into two parts.<br/><br/>You have to have some serious ""stick-to-it-iveness"" to make this work for you. The first hour and a half or so is all about the love story between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). The most generous thing I can say about this is that it is excruciating. The romance is never really fleshed out. It appears almost out of the blue and seems to move in a stuttering way that doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't think there was much chemistry between Affleck and Beckinsale, or for that matter between Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett, who played Danny - Rafe's best friend and eventual rival for Evelyn's love. Too cliché, and the reason for the conflict between Rafe and Danny is too contrived. This first half gets a 2/10. You will almost be prepared to turn this thing off - until the Japanese attack!<br/><br/>Here's where ""Pearl Harbor"" begins to shine. Everything you've heard about the special effects contained in this are absolutely true. They are magnificent, and succeed in putting the viewer right into the heart of the battle. The acting still doesn't shine - but it doesn't have to! This is edge of your seat stuff and makes the horribly dull first half worth it. These have got to be some of the most realistic war scenes ever put together by Hollywood. The second half rates an 8/10.<br/><br/>A couple of casting notes are in order. Dan Aykroyd as the naval captain who is also the crack decoder just didn't work for me, and Jon Voight - who played President Roosevelt - simply did not capture the part. Overall - no better than average performances, even from the leads. So, let's see. A 2/10 for the first half, and an 8/10 for the second. That averages out to 5/10 - and that seems right to me. Not a glowing endorsement overall, but you will be amazed by the battle scenes."

The reason is simple, a REAL war movie will have a much smaller audience and probably have stayed in the reds forever. Therefore they make a mess of a movie that is part romantic drama, part history lesson(not really), part action and above all an ultrapatriotic piece of technological terror. Doing that they have ensured a very large audience(particulary in the US), but the quality is bond to be so-so. This was also done with ""Enemy at the Gates"", a movie that was far superior to this one but still lacking simply because it tried to hard to get a big audience.<br/><br/>As a war movie it's quite bad. One of the problem with this movie is that it's way to ""arcade"", particulary the scene where our two heroes decides to play chicken with the japanese Zero fighters. The creators decided to make things look cool instead of making it look realistic. This may work in an actionmovie, but it just look plain silly in a war movie. In effect it has little touch with reality.<br/><br/>I hope that the next time they spend so much money on a war movie they make it a WAR MOVIE(a movie like ""Das Boot"" or ""Talvisota""), not a mess describing how the good old US of A won the war. 4 out of 10."

","because now I know just how bad Typical Hollywood Shlock can get.<br/><br/>This is truly the WORST movie I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. The story was just awful, full of transparent characters and the dialogue was laughable.  At one point, Cuba Gooding's character is asked, after a boxing match, by Beckinsale's character, ""Why do you need your fists to get respect?"".  What?? Nobody talked like that in 1942; nobody talks like that NOW!  Only in paragons of affected melodrama like this can be found flimsy, feeble self-serving lines like that.<br/><br/>The acting was likewise deplorable.  I couldn't muster a modicum of concern for any of the characters.  I swear, by the time the island was actually attacked (which seemed an eternity in itself), I was actually rooting for the Japanese.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the direction.  I don't know that I can fault the actors as much as Michael Bay, the director and chief architect of this crap.  I hope he never gets another Hollywood job again; his work was THAT awful. Instead of actually using a STORY, he just tries to convey a sense of motion by using flashy imagery, perhaps hoping we won't notice the lack of cohesive story.  Sorry, Mikey; didn't work.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that in this, and other cases, Hollywood knows exactly what sells.  Put the aforementioned flashy imagery together with pretty people and lots of explosions and you've got yourself a hit.  As long as the barely verbal, easily impressed public are wowed by this fetid, steaming pile of dung, Hollywood will keep churning out drivel that appeals to the lowest common denominator that make up the viewing public.

The event that the story comes involved with ""The attack of Pearl Harbor"" became candy coated so not to offend those who actually attacked us. It was a Special Effect show that was incredible to watch but did not have the emotion and the horror that was going on that day. As an American I am the one who became offended.<br/><br/>I realize Disney wants to make money especially in foreign markets by not showing the horror that we had to endure as ""Saving Private Ryan"" did (even though Japan was the ones who attacked us) therefore I did not feel the same emotions of watching this film as I did ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>""Saving Private Ryan"" raised the level of war films and ""Pearl Harbor"" fell short.

A one hundred and fifty million dollar budget, an A-list cast, promise of some intense action scenes, supposedly going to be a great summer film, and in the end, turns out to be just another Michael Bay film: loud, stupid, boring, excessive hero and sunset shots, and a complete waste of audience time, crew's efforts, and money that could have been used to finance thirty ""Memento""'s.<br/><br/>The redundant storyline (of which even writer Randal Wallace wants erased from his resume) revolves around a love triangle with the Pearl Harbor bombing at the center, which seemed to have been inspired when Bay noticed ""Saving Private Ryan"" eclipsed the box office of his ""Armageddon"" domestically and decided to do the same movie, as well as duplicating his lack-luster love story that centered in ""Armageddon"".<br/><br/>Now in order for romances to work, the audience must believe the characters have a reason to either be together or in love. Neither surface. The result is a waste of Kate Beckinsdale, who is reduced to staring blankly in every scene and seemingly to throw herself at everything that has a penis, be it Affleck, Hartnett, or that guy in the clinic. In fact, I even feel dirty as to how she stared at me from the screen.<br/><br/>As for the bombing sequence itself, it fails to either excite or inform. The CG planes are completely fake looking and the ships they bomb aren't even supposed to be around until the eightes. At least Titanic spent a large amount of time trying to detail the period accurately. Even my friend from the Navy, described this film as being ""boring.""<br/><br/>One thing ""Saving Private Ryan"" did well was depict violence in all it's shocking realism, and never trying to leave the audience with a happy feeling by the end. In ""Pearl Harbor"", the end result is merely a three hour film (of which I regret not using trying to mentally block out the fact I ever heard of this lousy film) that doesn't even show as much information (or any at all for that matter) or, let alone, do anything to actually credit the memory of the unfortunate lives lost at Pearl Harbor."

Other than that, there was nothing redeemable about the experience.<br/><br/>First, being a history buff, the way they portrayed the attack was laughable.  The subplots were sub par, and often times, I found myself wondering why this movie was called Pearl Harbor, when only a few minutes actually dealt with the raid.  Then again, there were those shots of kids playing baseball, which just warmed my heart.  Too bad that they were playing ball at seven in the morning on a Sunday.  The eagle squadron in England was not comprised of volunteers in the US Army Air Corp., because anyone who wanted to fly with them had to relinquish his commission. Finally, the whole story about FDR standing up was atrocious.  FDR was paralyzed from the waste down due to polio.  There is no way, save perhaps a miracle from god, that he could achieve that feat.  Then there was the flashback sequence at the beginning, which broke every rule of what not to do in as script.

","Please read this review after you see the movie<br/><br/>I saw this movie in the movie theater and was very disappointed. First, there are many people saying,that those who criticize this movie should watch documentary about Pearl harbor , well,i guess they are missing some point. One of the problem of this movie is not showing historical fact, but showing some details with very poor historical knowledge, even some are very much wrong. For example, Japanese military personals are making the plan of attacking Pearl Harbor, well, which Military discuss such an Important plan in Open air place? Did they have no headquarter building? I don`t think so.and this movie does not explain why USA had cut the oil supply route to Japan, what was the situation in the Asia etc. it showed just like japanese were cold blooded,evil,,,etc. and, how exactly that charactor from Ben Affleck went to UK from New York!?<br/><br/>I think if they make the movie based on historical event, should not show something which is actually wrong. Some people will believe those lie. another bad point is, main Actors. They were not acting well. Especially Josh whoever he is, his character had no depth. And love triangle was cheesy and crap. And later on the film, they bomb Tokyo... then movie gets very much like American. America must be always No.1, have to win always. It seems like some Americans can not be proud of who they are without the help of feeling/being American.they have not much self confidence, i guess.<br/><br/>Walt Disney also did something very awful. For Japanese and German release, they did alter the dialog in the end, how USA lived through the hardest time and won the WW2 or something like that. Were they afraid of hurting the feeling of Post WW2 losing Countries?I don`t think so.  It`s MONEY! For Example ""Titanic"" made 20 % of entire profit only in Japan, and Disney wanted to sell this movie for Japanese market as Romantic love Story, that`s why they have altered the dialog. It seems like Hollywood is losing creativity of making movies in these days because of running out of idea,too much Special Effects etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is also way too long and have less plot. I would rate this movie 8 out of 10 ONLY for Attack scene special effects, as the entire Film, 0.5 out of 10"

","What has the world come to when a movie critic is the only reason weather a movie is good or bad.  This truly is a great movie, but due to Hollywoods beloved movie critics it gets  dumped in the gutter.  It is not a lie that the critics hate Jerry Bruckheimer claiming that he is nothing but explosions.  Excuse me but this movie had the exact same theme as Titanic had 4 years ago.  The only reason Titanic won those awards is because people fell in love with the actor.  The acting was horrible in Titanic where as in Pearl Harbor it was next to best.  Josh Harnett has proven himself as an actor in this film.  It is truly sad that hatred for one man can bring a truly good film from fame to filth.<br/><br/>Ohhh and in case if i forgot to mention it, this movie is good and i hope that all of the actors, producers and especially Jerry Bruckheimer realize that critics are next to trash and this movie is Oscar worthy."

All these people complaining this movie is not arty enough or not moving in a metaphysical way...who cares? Do you really think the average joe-blow WANTS artsy-fartsy? I mean, MOST movies aren't arty. They are just too boring! And the others who complain that it has too much romance, look at the top of this page. Drama / Action / War / Romance. Only one of those is war and 2 are drama and ROMANCE. YES, romance! Surprise, surprise!<br/><br/>If you don't like this movie, that's okay. But don;t see it based on critics alone, okay? See it.

","I did not want to like this film.  Much of the dialogue is corny and sappy in a bad 1930s Broadway musical kind of way.  The plot is barely focused on the historical details of the Pearl Harbor bombing, even though that is the title of the film.  There is a sort of light-hearted jovial attitude to this whole war business, as if everyone is just out to have a good time. Whenever Alex Baldwin's character spoke, it made me feel like laughing.  (I kept picturing him in that SNL skit about ten years ago where he played the boy scout leader.)  And yet, I found myself enjoying this whole film and wanting to see what came next for almost the entire three hours.  I did not ever get bored.  I laughed (sometimes when other people were crying, but hey, that's why you get when you write lines so sappy that they get stuck in the audience's hair) and I cried (mostly during the battle scene).  And that battle scene, wow, what a tremendous piece of work.  Just non-stop gripping action for an hour.  I guess my main comment on a film such as this is that I feel guilty for liking it because I believe that some of its images are so NOT the way life (or history) is.  Everything is just too easy in this flick.  But I guess if one accepts it as entertainment, then, eh, whatever."

"andreas_soerensen","1","0","1","21 July 2001"," This is a terrible movie
","I went to see this movie with low overall expectations, knowing that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer who I knew was somehow connected to ""Armageddon"", which I thought was an absolutely horrendous American patriotic bullcrap movie. I was hoping it would be pretty empty and bearable leaving me free to ignore it and enjoy the action scenes, which looked pretty impressive in the trailer.<br/><br/>What I saw though, increased my distrust for any film connected to Hollywood more than after seeing ""Armageddon"" or ""The Patriot"". The glaringly formulaic scripting (and acting) of the love story left me gasping in amazement at how unpicky (and dare I say unintelligent) Americans have become when watching movies, knowing how much it's making, and especially after reading the numerous ""This is the best, most touching movie I've ever seen!"" reviews on this site. I simply cannot grasp how anyone could be touched by the predictable clichés deployed to give the film an ""epic"", deep outfit. It was just so silly, it reminded me of the stories you expect from cheap paperback novels and daytime tv soaps.  I could have bared it if only a small percentage, say less than 75% of the film, were pure love-story. After all it's hollywood, and it's a blockbuster. But what shocked and angered me was how seriously it took itself, as if the director and scriptwriters really felt they were creating art. There were no unpredictable twists, the acting was cold with no chemistry between the actors, and music is employed ALL THE TIME in an attempt to control our emotions. Real movies don't need constant orchestral mood-changing music, they manage to convey feelings to the audience by using picture and dialogue.<br/><br/>Now for the other parts of the movie. I found the Pearl Harbor bombing sequence pretty impressive as I am easily impressed by special effects and cool sound in movies. But again I cannot understand how people can avoid seeing and being annoyed by the glaring clichés in the story. Sure, the Japanese did kick some American butt, everyone knows that from history books, so the filmmakers couldn't really change the hard facts. Instead they showed that at least they were actually better than the Japanese, as is shown in the idiotic dogfighting and retaliation bombing sequence, or the ""simple cook shows that pure patriotism can help shoot down some Japanese planes"" scene.<br/><br/>""One on one the Americans would have prevailed because they are better"", the movie seems to say, because that's the patriotic feeling Americans have and the movie works at that level to make its countrymen like it. Americans that can't tell the difference between a movie that makes them cry a little and feel good about their country, and a movie that has genuine artistic qualities.<br/><br/>Some say this is simply entertainment, but it annoys me and insults my intelligence when a movie takes itself as seriously while being so glaringly made for the sole purpose of making money."
"cemk-2","3","0","1","20 July 2001"," Overkill is the word for Pearl Harbor. Pity!
","Now, Disney knows one thing very well, and that is trivialising and sentimentalising a story and presenting even the most tragic events as if it's another happy day for Lassie. This works in Lassie, or in Free Willy, when we see the relationship between a poor animal in danger  and a poor, lonely, but gifted kid. However, this same Disney formula that worked with many films made Pearl Harbor a total flop. Its subject is one of the most tragic events in World War II and never understands what it is talking about. It tells us the story of a pilot with dyslexia and his best friend with an awful background narrative, puts in a love triangle which doesn't make one want to know what will happen next as we already may guess what's to happen from the 10th minute of the film. Besides, as it's Disney,  we know that one has to die, and bravely so that the remaining friend gets the girl as he already deserved. The story that tells us about the real event is very poorly told as if it's not a $270m production but a high-school drama on very limited resources and which can't be bold enough to say the things it might actually want to say. So, we keep wondering why the President is first uninterested then becomes too involved in a Japanese attack on the Pacific, we don't understand whether the character played by Mr. Aykroyd is there to show the human side of events or how his incompetence caused the loss of many soldiers' lives in Pearl Harbor, we don't see why the colonel played by Mr. Baldwin is actually joking about shirts when nearly his entire fleet is bombed to dust and so on. Thus, the script sucks. Acting, though names are good and great, is second-rate, with the exception of Cuba Gooding, jr., who surely is cast to have some African-Americans watch the film. However, I'm not sure if he or anyone really undertstood what his part is about: A black cook fights for respect, and then gets caught in the battle and sees his captain die and tries to shoot some Japanese fighter planes and fails. This doesn't really make one want to go and hug African-Americans or weep for what a brave transformation this man experienced. That we see his boxing opponent while trying not to drown doesn't make anything any better, either, as it seems to say `See, this bulky guy wasn't good at the ring and isn't good at saving himself and his mates from death, either. Failure once,...' The romantic scenes are as if they are from a primary school skit, so I'm not bothering to talk on them. The scenes at the hospital when things go mad made me feel disoriented from the film with all those stupid games with light exposure, that thing didn't work on Traffic, doesn't work here, won't work anywhere else, directors should just stop doing this. Besides, dialogues were shabby, most characters were cartoonish, and although there were some Disney moments when one wanted to weep for the heroes' friendship, the whole bunch of characters failed to impress me. And, that's the worst part, really: You don't want to be absorbed in the story of characters that don't affect you. The love theme in Titanic  was as bad if not worse than this one, but Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet made us watch the film with their brilliance. Here, however, it can't be done because Ben Affleck isn't actually a good leading actor, and Josh Hartnett is nowhere near a Ryan Phillippe or Leo DiCaprio so that we may feel the need to devote ourselves to his character's story. What we have here is a couple of farmboys who love the same nurse and who know to do one good number on air, risking their lives and the resources of the country. Had the leads been, say, Ryan Phillippe and Jonathan Brandis, instead of Affleck and Hartnett, things might be far different as their auras would make the film watchable and perhaps enable it to profit. In addition, I must admit I am surprised to see Kate Beckinsale who was brilliant in Shooting Fish to be this motionless, motiveless, looking either depressed or bored all through the film. To sum it up, although the battle scenes were spectacular (despite one feels the CGI effects every now and then) and the cast was full of well-known actors, the film is a case of overdosing of many a stories into one. This formula had worked  in Braveheart that Randal Wallace had also written because Sir William Wallace and his alter-ego Mel Gibson were full of charisma, but it miserably fails this time as the film suffers from the overkill effect. It might have been a far better movie with an hour or more of it cut out. It would have been good if we knew the names of the other pilots rather than that of the nurses, if we followed the stories of the two friends who believe in fighting for their country and the good of humanity, and had the film centred on the attack and the Washington DC events; not on the lousy love story which made me look for a sick-bag at times. I felt really bad about this film as I had some hopes as it tells a strong historical story and I liked Ben Affleck as an actor. I must say, I'm gravely disappointed at the end. For those who might like this one, I very strongly recommunend to see Enemy at the Gates as it was the best war film with a romance sub-theme. Pearl Harbor's director and actors and producers should watch it and weep in shame after they see how the scenes of war that can touch the very heart of the audience can be filmed and what good acting is."

During the bombing scene the special effects is awesome. Rafe and Danny make great best friends. The good thing about the love story is that there is not a lot of argueing between Danny and Rafe. There may have been a few punches though.  They got the right person to play the girl. Thank God the love story wasn't like Titanic.

The acting of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett was excellent, however the portrayal by Kate Beckinsale as the nurse torn between her love for two war-time pilots is truly exceptional. Special mention for Jon Voigt as President Roosevelt.  The scene from the White House in front of all his military aides and advisors is enough on its own to recommend compulsory viewing. The actual attack on Pearl Harbor has to be seen to be believed. It just went on and on as I feel sure it did in the actual event.  It was really like being there.

"len-21","9","0","1","7 July 2001"," 9 on a scale of 10
","Pearl Harbor was a visually stunning movie. Fantastic special effects, brilliant colors and wonderful to look at - as most movies set in Hawaii are. But, to imply these qualities are the sole - or even primary - reason to see the movie would be grossly misleading.<br/><br/>First and foremost it is an education about what brought us into WWII and it is told in a way I have never seen and rarely heard. The educational aspect alone was worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Secondly, and most rewarding, it is the story about a woman and the two men in her life, their relationships, trials and, ultimately, their tragedies. This is a marvelous love story that has several chaotic twists - symbolic of the times. Even their hearts were at the mercy of events far beyond their control.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie was an awe-inspiring war movie. Bigger than life. Nothing can prepare you for how shocking (even to this day) it is to see American ships lined up like fish in a barrel and knowing that at any moment the lives of everyone there - and the lives of everyone around the world would be changed forever. The sudden and intense level of carnage was visually and emotionally played out on the screen in such a way as to permanently implant it on our minds - much as Saving Private Ryan did with the beach landing.<br/><br/>I can only think of a couple criticisms of the movie and they are fairly minor. One criticism worth mentioning is that they could easily have shaved 30-40 minutes from the 3 hours and still maintained the level of intensity.<br/><br/>Also, the Cuba Gooding character was one of the most extraneous add-ons I have ever seen in a movie. He had nothing to do with the other 90% of the movie we saw. His 10% was in its own world. I don't doubt that the reason it was there was to make sure the message of Pearl Harbor was that there were heroes - white AND black. But, either they should have tied it in better or left it out.<br/><br/>Still, as I say, my criticisms are minor. The story was an epic tale in the scope of the Titanic. Better story, more action, superior acting and a visual masterpiece. Hard to beat. Glad I went."

","I really didn't want to see Pearl Harbor but I really liked it.  I think the reason was that it was less of a Saving Private Ryan style hardcore war movie (although it had aspirations as such) and more of a summer popcorn flick.  I liken it to sci-fi war movies like Independence Day and Starship Troopers (especially the latter).  What I liked about it was that it made me appreciate the artistic side of filmmaking.  The time and the effort which has been lavished on this movie makes every single frame look suitable for the cover of a glossy magazine.  Some of the images from this movie would hang proudly on a wall.  Its a mega budget flick, which shows you how much advertising and music video making has influenced cinema in the last ten years.  Michael Bay made his debut with Bad Boys, and set the style which has been utilised in most every Jerry Bruckheimer film since, but he was following in the footsteps of Tony Scott.  The Last Boy Scout and True Romance (as well as his earlier collaborations with Bruckheimer) all introduced elements of different styles of filmmaking, which included not only ads and vids but also Hong Kong flavourings which have since become the norm.  Films like Pearl Harbour make me think about cinema in this way and it gets me excited.  I love different movies for different reasons and I love this as art.  Beats the crap out of Titanic, probably because it's more manly.  I also thought how much Josh Hartnett looks like Jan Michael Vincent from TV's Airwolf, who in turn looks like Charles Bronson.  They all have thin eyes which make them look like their looking into the sun constantly. I also thought that Jon Voight was really good, I could not believe this was the same man who hammed it up in Anaconda."

Rafe has always treated Danny as sort of a younger brother, always looking out for his best interest. With America on the heels of World War II, the two enlist in the armed forces to fight for their country. Rafe meets a young and beautiful nurse, Evelyn, who he falls in love with. When Rafe chooses to go to England to fight the war in Europe, Danny vows to keep an eye on his best friend's love. But when an accident involving Rafe occurs, friendship and loyalty is put to the ultimate test. Soon, the characters find themselves locked at the turning point of the war: The battle at Pearl Harbor. <br/><br/>Superficial? Yes, some elements of the film are indeed, not too flattering. Having seen any other kind of love story in the past, the so-called twists and surprises in the movie's plotline become all too predictable and quite frankly, unbearable to watch. With ""Pearl Harbor"", it's not a case of hindsight bias. Who lives, who dies, who ends up with who, etc. could be foretold by even the most clueless.<br/><br/>Still, though, ""Pearl Harbor"" makes up for a lacking screenplay with its incredible battle scene, with reigns of deja vu ringing from ""Titanic"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" While perhaps not as emotionally driven as the opening D-Day sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the 40-minute Japanese dogfight scene will earn its position as one of the most memorable scenes from a war movie. <br/><br/>Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer shifted their focus to the recreation of the drama, tension, and reality of Pearl Harbor, an aspect that journalists have become too critical about. With the two having collaborated on ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock,"" it is obvious that these two know exactly how to put together a film that would please an audience. ""Pearl Harbor"" is not a classic, not an epic, nor even an Academy Award contender.

Yes, the movie has characters that are somewhat two dimensional and yes, the movie uses a tragic historical event as the backdrop for a cliche-ridden romance, but why is it that no one complained when James Cameron did that with the much inferior ""Titanic?"" Take a look at some of the classic war films - ""Bridge Over the River Kwai,"" ""From Here to Eternity"" - you will find highly glossed Hollywood romances and big explosions, but if they were dissected with the unblinking cynicism that modern-day critics use, they would be attacked with as much fervor that ""Pearl Harbor"" has been.

Pearl Harbor is just another example because it leaves out important facts and simply does not tell the true story. This movie is not controversial - as in my opionion a war movie should be - it just confirms the view of the general American audience. I heard that director Michael Bay said in an interview that he tried to treat the Japanese fairly and to make the audience understand why they attacked. Well, how he showed the Japanese (threatening, emotionless except some scenes, but in general, they´re the BAD!) confirms once more the image that the standard American has - the Japs are evil! By the way - during the attack on Tokyo show at the end of the movie - the Americans killed about 10 times as much people than the Japanese killed at Pearl Harbor. These are just the relations - the film does not show the terror and fear the Japanese people felt. Pearl Harbor lets the audience feel that that attack was right and that the Americans had the right to kill! I think the only wise sentence of the movie is  spoken out by the Japanese admiral who says ""A brilliant man will find a way not to fight a war."" - this is so right for both the Japanese and the Americans. After all, all the comedy and the jokes made the film seem so ridiculous. I just cannot imagine that in the horror of war, someone can behave in such a way. A war film cannot be entertaining. I recommend the book ""Empire of the Sun"" by James Graham Ballard, and the film based on the novel by Steven Spielberg. It shows how war in the Far East was for millions of Chinese, Japanese, English and American: it was a war without good or bad and without any heroes. It was merely a fight for survival."

"Launchd-II","Null","0","1","25 June 2001"," Ignore the Critics- prepare to be impressed (and bring a hanky)
","It may be a Bruckheimer production and that single point made me cringe, but he produced and stayed away from the director (apparently). Yes, some historical facts are juxtaposed, but so what? Even the much ""docu-drama-ballyhooed ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" wasn't perfect and is rather drab and boring. This tale surrounds 3 people but they are the adhesive for linking a backdrop that quickly overtakes that subplot at the right moments. The 1st 45 minutes are worth admission price and that is BEFORE the attack. The Japanese sequences are more minimal than maybe I'd have liked and seem to be more of a lesser budget expenditure- but hey! This story is involving the attack vice the planning- for that, see ""Tora!"". That opening 45 minutes is about the bond between two friends and the warfare that draws one away from the other- it's great friendship stuff. The two kids through to adulthood is fun: getting a plane airborne as runts to doing daredevil maneuvers in fighter training school (which of course plays during the attack later on).<br/><br/>This is THE film that shows what CGI should be all about: creating what isn't any more. ""Jurassic Park"" did it too- but can we really relate? Modern times that are extinct due to the on-slaught of human history should be recreated. Maybe then we can get the damned concept across: war is NOT good or divine or ultimately better. Someone once said (referring to the Viet Nam war peace talks) that so what if we sat forever at negotiating tables- it beat killing one another. Well, maybe next round of talks at the next conflict, people should see this movie and the opener of ""Saving Private Ryan"". Maybe then they'll get the clue-  There are moments during the attack that are frightful, yet stunning for the ability to thoroughly convince that we are seeing the real thing. For a plane buff as myself- just the footage of A6M's (""Zeroes"") flying by is majestic. Seeing the Arizona lifted out of the water as the lower-deck munitions go up in a singularly massive explosion is traumatizing to the point of exhaustive sadness. The attack on 7 December 1941 was a sneak attack, a cheap attack, and a very far eastern attack. It should not be accepted as though it were a product of it's day. But it shouldn't be forgotten- ever.  The film reminds us that man and machine can bring horror and fascination. Humans that strive to entertain and enlighten as those who manufactured this film ARE of a breed different from that day. I don't see any of them doing this just for the paycheck though- it's a message and an entertainment movie. <br/><br/>The performances are good and solid and yes, some may call this a ""guy's"" film but the women doing double, even triple duty as the mavens of life-saving deserve the honors shown here- they too fought the good fight and are all-too-often not recognized in war epics. I was glad to see that here. I wasn't however glad to see the technique utilized to show hospital horror- it DIDN'T work. It just didn't. I thought that the projection equipment was malfunctioning. How ridiculous- in the midst of presenting with the finest effects material ever achieved, the focus goes nutso and I began to wonder if that was LSD the counter kid placed on my popcorn. Dumb. Just dumb. However I didn't let that ruin the film- taking the story out to the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, the first retaliatory move by the US some 4 months later was good and awesome in it's light manner of saying that the U.S. was ready and going to demonstrate that we were ready to fight that good fight. Seeing the B-25's swooping down over Yokusuka's factories was simply breathtaking- it became believable that we'd actually filmed it all.<br/><br/>This is a human film about the worst and best of humans- 3 times only are foul words said (and two of them were ""SOB's"")- and the worst was out of what is SURELY to be a nominated performance by John Voight as President Roosevelt. His is a great role- as are many. I must put in a plug  for Mako as Yamamoto- his performance translates the reluctance to wake the sleeping dragon known as America of this sad military career man very well.<br/><br/>Don't wait to see this on a small screen."

","SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>After sitting at the theater for 3 hrs and 15 mins, I have been amazed and depressed at the end. Knowing that Josh Hartnett was going to died at the end before I ever seen the movie was a bit of a spoiler to me, but it didn't stopped the feelings I felt when he died. It was so sad...I was hysterically crying my eyes out!!! After the movie, I start to daydream. I was sitting in my car waiting as my dad drove home. I was thinking, ""What if Rafe was the one who landed second and Danny was the one who were attacked by the Japanese soldiers? Then Rafe would be the one dead...and I started to find an ending to the movie if Rafe die."" And then I retrace back to Danny.I guess the writers lets Danny died because his death would have a bigger ending and the audiences would cried even more than Rafe's death (basically). The whole relationship between Evelyn, Danny, and Rafe was just a big misunderstanding. If only Evelyn wasn't pregnant w/ Danny's baby then I would really think she would of gotten back together w/ Rafe. The whole drama at Pearl Harbor and the problems with the Japanese were really interesting. Watching this movie, I felt liked I wanted to be part of the war and if there were ever a war in our time, I would volunteer because watching this movie was so so sad plus it was very entertaining. Basically what I'm trying to say is that this is a absolute best movie I have ever watch!!! At the beginning I was  kinda of bored at how the characters develop and the storyline grew. But when the Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor I was so into it that I was so feeling every emotion, tragic, and pain. And I thought that this movie was so much better than the Titanic's scene when the ship was sinking. ""Pearl Harbor"" created a strong powerful feelings/visual that I felt during the movie. When Danny died, I was so sad because I knew he was going to died, but I didn't knew how. If only if the Chinese came earlier then Danny would of kept his life. You could say that Danny save Rafe's life when he was landing and shot those Japanese, but.....if Rafe hadn't destroy his position when Danny's plane crash, I would think this movie would have another turn out. This movie brings out alot of joy, pain, and sadness. The ending was terrific. Danny's death was a perfect plan for how the movie was to end. I give this movie an A+ for every category. Better than Gladiator don't you think!!!??!!"
"django-1","2","0","1","26 May 2001"," Fine battle sequences, but otherwise poor and laughable
","I won't waste any of your time with a long review the way this film wasted 3 hours of my time. Simply put, there's about a half-hour of exciting, well-staged battle sequences that I wish I could have seen by themselves (perhaps theatres should list what time the battle scenes begin, then we can arrive late and miss the rest of the movie), and the rest of the film is dramatically weak, horribly written, and non-acted by two male leads who make Keanu Reeves seem like James Woods!! Ben Affleck is far too bland to carry a major motion picture, Josh Hartnett doesn't seem to be able to convincingly capture ANY emotion as an actor (one wonders how ANY woman would find him interesting!), and the female lead is given such a one-dimensional script that it's impossible to evaluate her performance. At least a dozen times during the film, the audience hooted at lines that were intended seriously, and some jokers in the audience actually completed the lines for the actors before the actors did--that's how cliche-ridden this dog was! Jon Voight as FDR was impressive, but someone should have told the filmmakers that an actor of Voight's caliber does not need to have a wax-museum style make-up job. I was waiting for Cuba Gooding Jr., but his performance is little more than a cameo and the script gives his character no depth. Alec Baldwin is badly miscast--audience members were making rude noises during his scenes. I'm surprised Disney didn't re-edit or re-shoot some of the film after what must have been poor preview response. TITANIC may have been a crowd-pleaser, but it did achieve what it set out to and I felt that I had more than gotten my money's worth from James Cameron and crew. As for this bomb, I feel like asking Bay-Bruckheimer for a refund--the battle sequences were worth about $1.00, so I feel as though I've been ripped off for the other $4.00 (PLEASE, don't pay over matinee price to see this!). Thanks to Roger Ebert, for pointing out that the emperor has no clothes!"

","I think Pearl Harbor was a terrific movie. The actors did a great job of bringing the love story and entire movie to life. Bruckheimer and Bay make an awesome team. The attack of Pearl Harbor was so tastefully done and wasn't too over the top, just right. Also, the creators have to be credited for giving a somewhat objective and not a ""we resent you"" attitude and look towards the Japanese. I was a big Titanic fan and didn't think any movie could come close to or beat it. However, I believe Pearl Harbor is a huge blockbuster, ranking right up there with Titanic. Hans Zimmer composed some beautiful music for the movie's soundtrack. Faith Hill's song reflects the attitude of the whole movie. To me, the difference between Pearl Harbor and Titanic, the difference that makes Pearl Harbor better to me, is the various movie genres it represents. There's action, (war), drama, powerful love story, and portrayal of an historical event. The love story doesn't get too intense and is just enough to make it a powerful love story. This movie can't be said to be a chick flick because of these various aspects. Titanic was a chick flick because the love story consumed the whole movie, even during the sinking. Regardless of what the critics say or what others may say about this"

But after I have watched the movie, I found that two films are really comparable... they simply suck! However, if Titanic can get 40 marks, Pearl Harbor may well get only 10. The war scenes are good on average but they fail to carry the audience away for long. The latter part of the film is boring! The cheesy love story gets on my nerves...

Character development was more than sufficient, acting was good, and the story was fine (ala Cameron's ""add a romance to a real-life tragedy"" scenario theory).<br/><br/>What made this movie work, though, was Bay's mind's eye.  One thing that can't be disputed is the fact that he can make a damn good looking film. The movie is long, but didn't feel like it; it's quick-paced (mostly). And it's just plain beautiful.

The love triangle is very clumsy and overcooked.  Cuba Gooding Jr couldnt have played cornball any better if he'd tried.

"scoteric","Null","0","1","11 June 2001"," Drop a Bomb on This!
","From the outset, I will readily admit I went into the screening of PEARL HARBOR with minimal expectations.  Mister Bay's previous films were pure popcorn munching, ""check-your-brain-at-the-door and watch things go BOOM"" summer blockbusters that were not to be taken seriously (The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon, etc).  Still, I was not prepared for the 3 hours of utter dreck I sat through.  The film is nothing more than the worst ""I'm going to war"" cliches strung together with wince-worthy dialogue, shot with the sheen of a prettily produced television commercial for cotton, life insurance or oatmeal.<br/><br/>Now, I'm perfectly willing to allow for a certain amount of hokey cornball dialogue in any gung-ho period war flick, but the onslaught of poor line readings of pure cheese was too much for my ears to bear. Affleck turns in a performance that makes use of a rather ridiculous hick accent (as does Hartnett) that is implausible at best.  While Affleck has done some decent work (in Good Will Hunting, Boiler Room and Shakespeare in Love), perhaps those shoulders aren't quite wide enough to carry a big, noisy Hollywood offering just yet.  Both Affleck and Hartnett seem to be little more than eye-candy for the teenage girls hoping for a TITANIC-like fix.  Those pilots sure were pretty, but other than nice haircuts, they don't offer much else. Kate Beckinsdale does do a convincing American accent; if only she had been given lines to read that had been worth repeating.<br/><br/>The ""romance"" storyline makes TITANIC's look like GONE WITH THE WIND. The highlight of silliness is when two of the characters run into an airplane hangar where scores of parachutes are hanging from the ceiling (had they been freshly dry cleaned?). As the couple lose themselves among the softly hit gauzy cotton parachutes, one chute has handily already been laid on the floor at the center of the room.  As the duo fall all over each other, and the streaming parachutes sway gently back and forth, one begins to taste whatever was for lunch earlier that day. The viewer must wade through nearly an hour and a half of such horrible ""romantic"" muck to get to the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor. Please do not misunderstand me; I do like romantic films (like Bridges of Madison County, Doctor Zhivago, and so on), but most daytime soap operas pull off better storylines and chemistry than the triangle at the center of PEARL HARBOR.<br/><br/>The bombing of Pearl Harbor is done reasonably well, but the impact and the horror of the event is minimal. Squeezing the film into a PG-13 rating must have required the removal of nearly all visible wounds. One character is apparently killed in a bomb blast, but there is no trace of blood, or even dirt on that person's body.  Hospital scenes depicting the carnage of the wounded are shot with a blurred, out of focus style that may pass for ""the POV of the nurses"", but is really just the director trying to remove any unsightly gore that may upset people (and garner an ""R"" rating).  At one point, many soldiers are seen trudging towards the hospital, presumably horribly wounded and suffering. In fact, they more closely resemble a bedraggled team returning from a rugby match, covered in mud and oil.<br/><br/>
Articles about this film has skewered the inaccuracies that abound through the film, so I will only mention one. FDR stands up! No canes, no crutches, no podium or table top for support, no handlers at his sides!  It truly was the age of miracles!  This was a shame, since the makeup for Jon Voight was rather convincing, but this scene shattered any credibility the performance (or film, for that matter) may have had.  Actually, it may very well be the funniest film moment of 2001!<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can only say this. PEARL HARBOR may be my most painful film-going experience over the last year and a half. You want war-torn romance, see CASABLANCA. You want gut wrenching war scenes, see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. You want to spend your movie-going dollar wisely, don't see PEARL HARBOR."

","Everyone probably has a different reason for hating this movie; and most likely, they're all correct. And yet, to be honest it also has some engaging aspects, and even a tiny number of good moments.<br/><br/>First, the effects are good. Having seen literally hundreds of recreations of the Pearl Harbor attack over the past decades, what could they do that would dazzle or even inform the audience? Not much, I'm afraid. So the good effects don't really mean much. They are kind of wasted, because they are so humdrum. Although the flying bullets were scary.<br/><br/>Second, the history is rudimentary. That's OK, but it does ignore a lot of real-life meaning. For example, the movie depicts Japanese Admiral Yamamoto, the inspiration and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, commenting on the bombing success. In the movie, he (as played by way-cool actor Mako) is merely a head-shot, evidently in the open air. He says, ""Perhaps we have merely awakened a sleeping giant."" Ok, that's historically recorded. What isn't depicted in the movie is context within which he is said to have made that remark. According to historian and author John Toland, the pilots, officers, and crew of the Japnaese aircraft carriers were wildly celebrating their victory at Pearl Harbor. Amidst the drinking, whooping-it-up,  and general Part-ay!!! vibe, the admiral refused to join in. His officers begged him to party with them, and he declined, saying, in effect, ""I lived in the United States, and have toured her industries extensively. You have NO idea how vast her power is. As successful as this raid was, I'm telling you we've only awakened a sleeping giant. Rather than partying right now, I suggest we get back to Japan as fast as we can, and start building as many airplanes and training as many pilots as possible. We're going to need them."" OK, so maybe that's close enough to the movie version, but in a 3-1/2 hour movie, don't you think a few seconds of character development time could have been devoted to the Japanese?<br/><br/>Lastly, the soap opera vibe was hideous! Right from the first scene, the music score was loud, dramatic, syrupy sweet, with ""dramatic-climax"" violins and female choral voices. Throughout the movie, the tone was mawkish, overly sentimental, and annoyingly corny. Many of the scenes, and story threads, were so ham-fisted and clumsy, it was just plain BAD!<br/><br/>If ""Pearl Harbor"" were a book, you'd read it in the bathroom, skip half it, hoot and laugh and the other half, and never reveal your dirty little secret to anyone!"

","A lot of people that I have talked to about this movie all thought it moved too slow, the plot was too predictable, etc. Well, I for one, enjoyed it immensely. We all know the ending - that Japan was going to bomb the hell out of us, so because the plot is obvious in that respect, there has to be something more to the movie, and there is in this case - a love story and the relationship between two best friends.<br/><br/>I've also heard comments from people how its similiar to Titanic - well, no, not really. In Titanic, its JUST a storybook love story..an upperclass woman forbidingly falls in love with the poor boy and then, oh no, the ship's going to sink now and I better love you forever. blah. In Pearl Harbor, there's so much more to it. A sinking ship is vastly different from WAR. You can't even begin to compare the two. These guys are risking their lives for the good of our country, not running around on ocean liners. So I think it's a helluva lot better than Titanic...and I really don't know where people saw the relationship (I mean..... come on... war and ocean liners?!?!)<br/><br/>The graphics and war violence in this movie are great, the acting is mediocre, but it's really a heartfelt movie and demonstrates how powerful war is and how it tears people apart.<br/><br/>Trust me.

","Despite what those stupid critics say, this movie is very good! I found it to be very emotional... the story allows you to get into the lives of the people. Then the attack comes, and it makes you feel something. This isn't a war movie... but a love story amidst a war, which makes it enjoyable for guys and girls. Much like Titanic, you'll never think about Pearl Harbor the same once you've seen this movie."
"LittleMissPsycho","3","0","1","10 June 2001"," Nothing special (SPOILERS)
","This film was organised all wrong. They could have done without the *whole* Tokyo attack, and probably large sections of the Pearl Harbour attack. The SFX were amazing, but after an hour of relentless action and destruction, it gets too much, and I could see people in the cinema fidgeting and getting restless. The Cuba Gooding Jnr character was interesting but utterly pointless, just a token black character. <br/><br/>The love triangle had potential, but they made the fatal mistake of making Danny seem nicer than Rafe, and I ended up rooting for the wrong couple although it was painfully obvious what was going to happen. Evelyn and Rafe seemed to fall in love for no reason, whereas Danny and Evelyn had a basis to their relationship. Aside from anything else, Rafe was cocky and arrogant and fairly unlikeable next to Danny.<br/><br/>From a British perspectice, I must admit that it was a lot fairer to the British soldiers and victims of the Blitz when compared to fiercely patriotic and propagana-ish films like U5771 or Saving Private Ryan. I must admit that I chuckled during the final sick-making ""God Bless America and all who sail in her"" speech which, ironically, was delivered by a British actress."

","PLOT: People kiss. Followed by some big loud noises and bright colours, followed by more people kissing.<br/><br/>ACTING: The only good ones are the smaller parts like Jon Voight and Cuba Gooding Jr (who when used with the word ""underused"" would very well be the biggest understatement in history) though Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale (I can't remember how many people have asked who she is but it's a lot) Josh Harnett and Alec Baldwin (in one of the smaller roles) are all stinkers in this movie.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: Michael Bay, nuff said.<br/><br/>WRITING: It's written by the writer of Braveheart. So you'd expect something good.

","Pearl Harbor has caught a large amount of negative attention. Do not listen to the critics, who claim it is a let-down, and a bad film. Pearl Harbor is a surprisingly realistic portrayal of the events that took place in 1941. Obviously, the elements of love are fictional, but many of the other items in the movie are authentic. The action in this movie is amazing, some of the best action and special effects in recent years. Some people complain it takes too long to 'get to the action.' These people are un-patient, because without the first part of the movie, the entire story implemented in the movie would not work at all. The opening sets up the movie, and gives a better effect of the havoc the events at Pearl Harbors caused. The length of 3 hours is not a bad thing- rather it is good, as it is an epic, and any thing less would of given the movie a rushed feel. The time flies by. Don't listen to the critics. Go see Pearl Harbor. It is a fantastic movie that will provide an exciting, entertaining viewing."

"somasleep","7","0","1","4 June 2001"," Horrible movie worth seeing.
","I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think this movie is worth the price of admission. However, I would warn anyone who is about to see this movie that this is a bad movie. There is no question about it. This movie is contrived, bereft of inspiration and originality, laughably cliché, mawkish, under edited, and worst of all it is a testament to bad dialogue.<br/><br/>You never for a moment believe the love story involving Rafe and Evelyn. Rafe (Ben Affleck) seems to fall in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) because she is beautiful. Evelyn seems to fall in love with Rafe because he is pathetically persistent and has a cute butt. There is no intelligent and substantial foundation for a romance. Instead of writing in the substance needed for a romance the movie tries to induce romance using dramatic music, slow motion, all sorts of romantic clichés. The effect is that the love story becomes nauseatingly mawkish. You don't believe me? In one scene Evelyn tells Rafe, `I will never be able to look at another sunset without thinking of you.'<br/><br/>The second love story between Evelyn and Danny (Josh Hartnett) was a lot better yet it got a lot less time. The reasons they have for falling in love are a little more complicated and interesting. Strangely the best love story, the only one that moved me was the one involving Betty (James King) and a stuttering sailor. That got the least time.<br/><br/>The dialogue is phenomenally bad. Throughout the movie I kept wondering how a professional writer could possibly produce such unnatural, cliché-ridden dialogue. I suspect someone held a gun to Randall Wallace's head as he wrote the screenplay. Let me give you an example of a cliché. There is a scene in the movie where Evelyn runs to the train station at the last minute to find that Rafe is already on a train about to leave. The old lovers at the train station scene! Can you believe it? I couldn't. I started laughing. There were at least five points in the movie where the dialogue was so stunningly appalling it actually made me laugh out loud. Lawyers can be disbarred, doctors can lose their licenses, can't screenwriters be thrown out of the screenwriters guild? I am not exaggerating the dialogue in the screenplay is that bad.<br/><br/>By now you are probably wondering why I would recommend a movie that has what I claim is probably one of the worst screenplays ever. I recommend this movie because the actual attack on Pearl Harbor is that good. You have to see it in a theater, just like you have to see the ship sink in `Titanic', or the battle scenes in `Saving Private Ryan.' The scenes allow you to see things so horrifying that you could never have imagined them. Before this movie I had read about the bombing of Pearl Harbor but I had never felt anything. ILM's brilliant work allowed me to experience what it's like to see people incinerated by bombs, to see sailors clinging to a sinking battleship, to see people being cut to pieces by strafing fighter planes. Now Pearl Harbor feels tragic to me and I have a new respect for the people who suffered through that atrocity.<br/><br/>I recommend that anyone interested in this movie simply arrive about an hour late, just in time to see the bombing. After the bombing scene you should just run out of the theater as though it were being attacked by Japanese fighter planes."
"Chris_Docker","6","0","1","6 June 2001"," The Eat-As-Much-As-You-Like Movie
","At over three hours it's easy to see why the critics don't like it - they get bored - humdrum script, lousy acting for much of it, formulaic and predictable (and hey - they didn't pay for it!). For the rest of us, it's sort of good value for money if you like cheese, explosions, a nice love song, enough extras to repopulate China, and an indication that someone has spent an awful lot of dosh making a BIG movie to keep you awake long enough to work through one of those extra humungously big cartons of popcorn. Who cares if it's quality or not? Titanic won lots of Oscars and the critics didn't like that either. Pearl Harbor isn't up to Titanic standards, but it at least aims at that sort of scale. There's LOTS of big warships, LOTS of hunky naval officers, LOTS of beautifully made-up nurses-in-waiting, and OODLES of lovey-dovey triangular 'dilemma' stuff. Plus it's really easy to follow (quick synopsis - Japs bomb Pearl Harbour and bring Americans into World War II - geddit?) If you need to exercise your brain or artistic aspirations go and see Miss Saigon or read a book. Or you can always check out the Movie Gaffs websites to see some of the continuity errors and play spot-the-gaffe. (The bit where Ben Affleck makes his nose bleed with a champagne cork is cute - each time the camera cuts to his face the blood is there or has vanished or is back again!) If you want to go to the movees with a few friends who really aren't into films, go and see Pearl Harbor - they'll all think you're great for taking them to see a nice big blockbuster."
"Movie-12","6","0","1","6 June 2001"," This film does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. **1/2 (out of four)
","PEARL HARBOR / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" does not have the inspiration or perseverance like other war movies. It owes more to ""Titanic"" than most war films, however. The film makes the mistake of incorporating the events of Dec. 7, 1941 into an obvious, familiar love triangle. That worked with ""Titanic"" because its love story was convincing and passionate. ""Pearl Harbor"" feels labored, strained, and we can predict every twist and turn a mile away.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is yet another victim of commercialization. It's the kind of movie that tries so hard to please everyone, it feels contrived. The filmmaker's were under strict orders to keep the material PG-13; obviously the producer's thought an R-rating would keep its target audience away from the big screen. That has not been the case for other recent war movies like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Thin Red Line,"" or even ""Three Kings."" Granted, with its hot young cast and customary love story, this film clearly aims for an under 25 crowd. It is very depressing to see studios sacrificing their cinematic art for the MPAA's often ridiculous standards.<br/><br/>The filmmaker's changed the movie so that it would not offend other areas of the world. Although the alterations were very minor, it is a disgrace that the studio actually dubbed dialogue to please certain audiences. This action shows how gutless these filmmakers are. They also submit to the usual audience pleasers-in the first ten minutes, the film already displays sappy emotions, failed attempts at humor, easy to swallow dialogue, and music that determines the mood of the scenes. There is even one of those mournful goodbye scenes at the end where one character pleads ""stay with me,"" as the dying character states his final request to ""take good care of [name here].""<br/><br/>The major subject of the film is an American love story centering on two childhood friends named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). They enter the Army Air Corps where Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is called to duty in another country. Soon after he leaves, the reports print he is dead, leaving the scene to Danny. A few months pass and before we know it, Danny and Evelyn are under the covers. What happens next comes to the surprise of nobody in the audience- (SPOILER) -Rafe is alive and comes back to America with visions of Evelyn in his mind. He is furious that his old best friend has fallen for his girl. This conflict really should have spent more time on the emotional struggle Evelyn experiences-but instead leads to predictable bar fights and shouting matches. Then those pesky Japanese go and drop bombs on Pearl Harbor, interrupting this bamboozling love triangle.<br/><br/>The historic aspects of this movie are also quite cloudy. There is no sense of history or strategy. Did Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply, and they were down to an 18 month reserve? Would war restore their fuel reserve? At the end of the movie, where Jimmy Doolittle's Tokyo raiders crash-land in China, Japanese patrols attack them. Why are there Japanese in China? There is a brief explanation that the Sino-Japanese war was already underway. As a critic, however, I am all for filmmakers taking creative liberties with a historic account. The events in this film do not have to take place exactly how they really happened.<br/><br/>The casting of Ben Affleck was a mistake. He is not an actor who can inject instant chemistry into his characters. The film does not give him enough time to develop any charisma, so the casting directors should have gone with a more versatile actor. Josh Hartnett is fit for his role, however. He does a good job with the limited material. Beckinsale, beautiful and lush, is also quite the treat. Hartnett and Beckinsale blossom from an involving chemistry, making Affleck's miscasting even more obvious. Unfortunately, neither male lead convincingly portrays his character with enough charm or affection for us to believe they are childhood best friends.<br/><br/>I really liked the segments of the film where the Japanese conspired about the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film depicts them to be the smartest characters here; unfortunately, it also paints them as depressing, mournful individuals. They are people too. They can smile when they drop a bomb and hit a bull's-eye. ""Pearl Harbor"" tires so desperately to make the Japanese look grim and evil, it never really gives them enough dimension. Equally as interesting is the American suspicions of the Japanese attack. But the movie does not focus on these interesting aspects, instead buries itself in an ignorance and pride.<br/><br/>Most war movies are developed, vivid, and intuitive. ""Pearl Harbor"" proves to be immature and childish. It certainly has a lot of fun with the attack, but that supplies us with yet another problem. Movies glorify almost everything they touch-many, many war movies can pride themselves in making war look graphic and disturbing; we want no part of it. While ""Pearl Harbor"" doesn't make war look fun, and I do not think it glorifies war, this movie is not repulsive in its illusion of war. This movie focuses too much on developing a sense of commercial satisfaction. The film's centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, not a horrific account of the attack on ""Pearl Harbor."" This is more of an action movie, not an account of a major US military battle.<br/><br/>""Pearl Harbor"" is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, arousing incredible audience interest with a budget of over $150 million. A lot of people will go see this film; it will most certainly be one of the biggest hits of the year. This is a simple special effects extravaganza-made with the intentions of grossing millions and millions of dollars-which probably explains why there are so many things wrong with it."

The Storyline was strong and the Graphics were incredible. It truly kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through. It was well balanced and showed amazing Acting from John Voit, Cuba Gooding Jr, among others. The movie, in no way, tried to be a historical documentary on Pearl Harbor, thus the inaccuracies displayed can easily be overlooked. It was good clean fun worthy of the budget spent on it. I rank it a 4 out of my personal 5 point scale.<br/><br/>Now some people compare this to Titanic, saying that ""it's trying to be another Love Story set in historical times"". I have to disagree. For one thing, there was no ""cheese factor"" in it, which Titanic overflowed with. The whole story didn't revolve around the romantic situations going on with the three main characters. And, quite possibly the most important...This one didn't make me fall asleep. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a decent ""Hero"" movie."

"baumer","9","0","2","4 June 2001"," A grand epic of a movie
","I can't help but to scoff at people that criticize films like this.  You don't have to look far to find them either.  They all have reputable names like Ebert, Travers, Siegel and some home grown synthetic wannabees like Pevere and Braun ( man she is numb ).  These people come off as silly, vacuous, desperate to sell papers, grasping at straws kind of morons that no one really takes heed to or even listens to but are employed and well paid because of the car wreck scenario.  You know, you just have to stare as you are driving by....Same thing.  I read people like Braun, Pevere and Ebert because I just want to see what assinine comment they are going to make about the film next.  There are very few things in this life that are apodictic, but reading a slew of bad, ostentatious reviews ( that are sometimes well written, but ostentatious and wrong nonetheless )by the aformentioned is now becoming one of them.  For people like Liz Braun, it is just accepted that she is a little caustic and shows no real knowledge of film but what disappoints me is how people like Ebert, people who I at one time respected are now so deteriorated in their opinion that they can't tell the difference between what is a well made film and what is just flat out entertaining.  Pearl Harbor is a marvellous amalgamation of both.  It is incredibly well made and it is entertainment at it's finest.  By the time this film has finished it's domestic run, it will probably end with close to 200 million and you can add another 200 or 300 million in foreign receipts. The film has to be doing something right.  I don't know many people ( not paid critics that seem to have a personal vendetta against Jerry Bruckheimer ) that have not enjoyed this film.  I happened to love it.<br/><br/>I think by now everyone knows that this is a film that is based on a historical event and it is surrounded by a love story.  And you can probably guess what is going to happen to the main characters about ten minutes into the film.  But that doesn't matter.  What does matter is the execution. What you have here is a film that takes time to develop a love story and then it surrounds it by the imminency of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  This effectively keeps you interested and a little tense about the film.  You know the attack is going to be devastating, we have all read the history books, but what you can't be prepared for is how well it is done. <br/><br/>Michael Bay showed his flair for the absurd when he did Armageddon.  He also showed that he was a visionary icon when he did the same film.  Bad Boys was also very well done, in particular some of the chase scenes involving Will and Martin.  But this is a film unlike many others hat I have seen.  The battle scenes are realistic and scary.  The airplanes coming in what looked to be just feet from the ground was nothing short of brilliant.  Michael Bay has some kind of eye for detail and some kind of balls for attempting some of the stunts and shots that he did.  The effort that must have went into every shot in this film is tantamount to it's success.  The audience that I saw this film with was in awe, just as I was at the battle scenes.  You had the feeling that you were there.  There was so much going on at one time that it must have taken the efforts of four or five directors to keep everything in synch.  <br/><br/>I don't really have much more to say about the film except to say that it epitomizes what the summer film is all about.  It is big, brash, grandiose and loud.  What more do you want?  When you have nothing but captious critics committing deserate acts of temerity when they critisize films like this, it sometimes makes you want to see these films even more.  You should see this film.  It is a fantastic piece of work and one that will entertain you and enlighten you over three hours.  Judge for yourself.  Don't be led astray by someone that sees 3 films a day and has developed a sense of mendacious storytelling and has become a cynic.  This is a great film!  <br/><br/>9 out of 10- Highly, highly recommended."

","**Maybe a spoiler** So, it's not the best movie in the world.  These days none of the movies made are.  Yes, it can be compared to Titanic.  I have this feeling that tons of people will see it because Ben Affleck is in it.  They saw Titanic because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it.  They'll see it again, because it made them cry and women love to see those types of movies again.  Then, we'll all rush out to buy the movie only watching it for a month before we let it collect dust.  But, unlike Titanic it will forever be imbedded in our mind. Whenever we think of Josh Hartnett we will think of his character Danny. Many people say the movie was no good, the same way they said that over Jurrasic Park 2.  Of course they say this.  They go into the movie expecting it to be something it is not.  It is a movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, but the whole movie is not the actual bombing.  Sure, you can make an almost three hour movie about it, but it would be boring.  Think about it--Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett--two cute men--of course they are trying to attract the women, so why would the whole movie center around the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  There has to be a love story to keep the women interested. I believe this movie was good.  The acting was good.  The story was good. It is a movie I would like to see again, maybe I won't buy another ticket to it, but I will buy the movie, occasionally on rainy days putting it in the vcr or dvd player to relive the story of Rafe and Danny. This movie may not be the best movie in the world, but it is a good one. You would not be disappointed.  If it doesn't live up to your expectations then your expectations are too high. After reading all these comments and you think the movie is not going to be good remember you are the only judge of what you like.  I enjoyed the movie and if you want to be able to trust my judgement as your own I'll tell you that I like war movies and I like romances that are not trashy.  I also like period pieces, so I would be a big candidate to like the movie.  I will tell there were alot of sad, teary eyes in the crowd and when someone cries at a movie it means they got wrapped up in the story and started to ""fall in love"" with the characters. All I'm saying is I enjoyed the story of Rafe and Danny and their battle in WWII and I want you to be your own judge on whether you will like it."

","This movie goes beyond disappointing, and is downright disgusting.  A friend of mine who was a history major laughed all the way through it.  It tried to show the Japanese as the ""honorable enemy"" who regretted their attack, but thought it was necessary.  Ha!  The movie did not show all the motivation behind everything.  We showed that the US intended to block oil shipments, but not why.  We did it because Japan had invaded China (which was apparent at the end of the movie, but the link wasn't made clear).  Does anyone really think the Japanese didn't want this attack?  If they wanted a fight, why not call us out and face us down?  It was a low-life dirty attack, and the writer should be fined for presenting such a ridiculously ""politically correct"" joke such as this.<br/><br/>Oh, but the hour-long massacre of men, women, and children had great special effects."

"donlopedeaguirre","Null","0","1","31 May 2001"," Pearl Harbor: What's up with it?
","I've been reading a lot of the current reviews, praising the film, while many bash it. I can understand and agree with some of the valid points that are brought up while nailing the film for numerous mishaps. I walked into the film with utterly low expectations after reading numerous reviews describing how weak the core of the film was and how awful this turkey really was. I found myself amazed after I walked out of the theater. It sounds like usual clichÃ©s you'd hear from anyone, but ever since that film began, m eyes were glued to the screen and for the next three hours straight. 3 hours have never gone faster in my life before. I had no back aches or body aches at all. This was the first film, as far back as I can remember that I saw in a theater without taking my eyes off the screen. I really loved this flick, and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the film succeeded at all levels, yes yes, including the love story which was obviously Hollywood and cliched, but hey, it beats Titanic by a long shot! As I said before, the complaints brought up are valid. But all the documentaries I saw on Pearl Harbor looked exactly like the manner the film was made in, the veterans agree that the films accurate. Sure I'm sure the film's not accurate word-for-word, such as I don't believe that the Japanese sat down in one setting and planned the entire surprise attack out. But hey, you really want authenticity, see a documentary, and you will not find as many differences as you seeked out to do so. About the love story: Ok, remember Tora! Tora! Tora! It was interesting and all, but essentially, it was an empty hollow historical story. We need this love story and Hollywood characters to excel the story. But the love story does not bombard the premise of the film, unlike Titanic, which is the bombing. The relationship rather stays in the backdrop, not hogging the film time. The acting was fine; I liked the way numerous characters stepped in and out, like Cuba Gooding Jr's. If they had stayed longer, then the film would have become what many accuse it of. Story was fast moving, and timing was just fine. People say that the movie could have been cut an hour. Sure it would have been shorter, but there would have been no tension leading up to the attack, hence an entire part of the film would be missing. The movie is cliched, it is Hollywood, but what is everyone complaining about? Last time I checked, Titanic had cliched Hollywood written all over it, much worse than this, and everyone surprisingly loved it, including the critics, and it walked away with an entire 11 Oscars (Why that happened I'll never know). And I thought everyone likes Hollywood flicks! Films I thought were used by most as a tool of escapism, now all of a sudden, everybody's changing. You don't want Hollywood, then check out a great movie by the name of ""Autumn Sonata"" or Affliction. But if you want Hollywood, this is it! And there's nothing wrong with liking Hollywood type films! After all, all movies are made in Hollywood. But now everyone accuses this movie, for what reason? The critics make up false accusations like the film is ""horribly historically inaccurate"" or ""a 2 hour movie made into a 3 hour movie"" for one reason: they only hate this flick for the same reason they hated Gladiator: the public loves it. And for some reason, that gets to them, so they make up things like that mentioned above. Another reason people ""say"" they hate this film is because of the whole Bay/Bruckheimer production. I didn't like Armageddon or the Rock, but I didn't hold those against this for a simple reason anyone could notice: This isn't wither of those films. It's not a sequel, it's not a prequel and is not connected to either of those films in any way. Some people seem to have a hard time figuring that out, including the critics. Lately I've been disappointed by the numerous films that have been hailed by critics as a beautiful departure from our cookie-cutter movie era (I could list some examples, but I'd probably never stop). Don't get me wrong though. I agree with a lot of them. Thin Red Line is one of my favorite films, as are many underrated gems such as those from Paul Schrader, and many more. But I have had so many hopes crushed with praised films, so I find it relieving to see a film that would guarantee entertainment. But once again, I saw much more to this than just entertainment. This film is a great one, and though many may disagree, much better than the so-called ""masterpieces"", and a lot of films that have been hailed by the public and critics, such as Titanic. It's worth it. You want an ""ultra-real non-phony Bay/Bruckheimer depiction of Pearl Harbor,"" see a random documentary, and you will, deny it or not, find similarities running parallel with that ad the film. But if you don't want a documentary and want a film that doesn't ""have a cliched stupid romance,"" rent Tora! Tora! Tora! And in about 10 minutes you'll be gazing out the window. I, myself, being an avid film lover, was quite surprised at how this turned out to be. I understand the criticisms that the people who've seen the movie bring up, and can see why they thought that. But at least see the film if you plan to bash it."

","Michael Bay's films always split people into two categories.  They either like them, or hate them.  One thing both parties can agree on is the fact that his films move.  There is always a pan, a dolly, a zoom or some other camera trick that takes you farther than other films would.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay takes you back to Dec. 7, 1941 and puts you there as the Japanese begin there attack.  What leads up to the attack however, is a somewhat cliched first hour.  We are introduced to Danny and Rafe, two Tennessee fly boys who have designs on the same nurse.  We also are introduced to various other characters that enter into the grand scheme of things.  Through this hour, we learn who they are, what they want from their lives and begin to make a connection with them.  All of this may have been taken care in a little less time, but it's there on the screen, and like it or love it, it's not going anywhere.  Once the attack on Pearl Harbor begins, the first hour fades into the background and you are thrust into the confusion, the horror and the insanity of the early morning attack.  Planes dive in, strafing ships and people. Bombs scream through the sky and explode on their targets as the smoke gets thicker with each passing second. You witness the death of the Arizona, you watch as Dorie Miller mans a machine gun and opens fire on the attacking planes.  You get caught up in the moment and you feel charged as the American forces retalliate against the Japanese.  You then feel the pain and anguish as the wounded pour into the hospital and you see the fear in the faces of the nurses and doctors as they struggle to save their patients. <br/><br/>True there may be some historical inaccuracies, and some facts may have been left out or combined into others.  Overall, Pearl Harbor achieves what it's makers set out to do. They wanted to capture the essense of what it was like to be there on that day.  In that regard, they have succeeded."

","Because this movie has a love story, comedy, action, explosions, a story line that you can actually follow, you don't really care that some of the things in the movie weren't entirely accurate. This wasn't one of those movies that are either all serious, all funny, or all sappy.  It was like what real life would be like, them all mixed into one, which makes it easy to get into.  Overall I liked it.  There were predictable parts but I guess that comes up in movies sometimes. I would absolutely commend you to go an see this movie (the theater has the best effect)and if you don't like war type movies you should go just to see the superb acting done by Josh, Ben and Kate."

","Well, no spoilers here.  Usually, I'd complain about a film with as many technical errors as in this film.  Lets face it, 1970-80's 'Spruance' class destroyers and 'Knox' class frigates were seen getting bombed in the harbor and carriers had angled flight decks not seen until well after WWII.  Even the use of the Missouri was an anachronism since it wasn't commissioned until 1944, but the film was great.  It played out not only the brutality of the attack, but also displayed Japan's ambivalence towards initiating the strike, our own side's lack of preparedness, and the efforts of a few to warn of the impending attack.  Finally, it displayed our preceding generation's ethic and bravery.  Though a few ships may have been out of place, the historical significance of the event wasn't lost.  Not to mention there were nice action scenes and a love story.  Now, if you want to see what would have happened had those 1980's destroyers been there go watch ""The Final Countdown""..."

Michael Bay does a wonderful job directing the awesome cast, and the screenwriter did a marvelous job of making the characters seem real and alive.  You need the full 3 hours to get the complete impact of what happened before, during, and after Pearl Harbor. You need to sense the idealism of America before the bombing, the terror during the attack, and the rage mixed with fear and denial following the attack!  The movie also gives me my new favorite young actor, Josh Hartnett. Handsome, but not flawless in a Brad Pitt kind of way, with a voice that could melt butter and eyes that see to the soul.  I'd go sit through it again, just to spend time watching Danny Walker.  The movie gets the reality of war across like Saving Private Ryan but without the massive amounts of blood, guts, and gore.

If people want history the way it was, then they should rent ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", but if they want a story, then they should see Pearl Harbor.  The characters such as Dorie Miller, Admiral Kimmel and Col. Jimmy Doolittle aren't exactly like the actual people, but I really couldn't tell since I'm not a true expert on history.  I know people expected it to be more about the history, but that's why ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is around for. Pearl Harbor followed the fictional characters like Rafe, Danny and Evelyn. I liked how they put these 3 characters into this time, it wasn't a perfect fit, but it was flawless to me. Pearl Harbor to me...took the audience on a trip back in time...when America was still innocent...and it took the audience to that Fateful Day...on a Sunday Morning."

No, but who cares.  That's not say that there weren't a hundred Rafes and Dannys out there doing the same thing.  And I thought the Japanese army was portrayed as the smartest people in the movie.  As they saw it, there was nothing they could do to prevent war and this tactical strike was their best hope for victory.  The most intelligent and best line of the movie was ""A real genius would find a way to prevent war.""  I do not particularly like love stories, especially those that take away from the historically significant story.  However, I really liked this love story because I thought it provided meat to the story, instead of just battles and statistics.  Showing how war affects real lives.  Admittedly, I could have lived without the love triangle, but it's not a perfect movie.  It does a great job of showing the loss of innocence. Great movie and I highly recommend it."

It was the right combination of chick-flick and guy movie so that it could have universal appeal.  I don't know if it was the actors on screen or the superb theme by Hans Zimmer (""Tennessee"" on the Pearl Harbor soundtrack), but something actually made me feel for the characters. The action sequences were awesome, which goes to show what $150 million can do.  I liked Tom Sizemore in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and wish that he had a larger role in the film, but I suppose that would have detracted from the focus of the story.

"Starks","Null","0","1","29 May 2001"," An Open Letter to Michael Bay
","Dear Michael Bay,<br/><br/>I saw Pearl Harbor this past Saturday and based on reviews and some word of mouth I was determined that your film would be a dog (very disappointing especially after some of the best trailers I have ever seen in the theatre). Well after sitting through the movie for 3 plus hrs I must say that it was not as bad as some people made it out to be. Sure the dialogue is a bit syruppy at times. Sure the romantic triangle seems a bit forced.  Sure you do a disservice to Cuba Gooding and his character (a real life pearl harbor hero) by giving him a bit role (I'm assuming most of Cuba's lines will be in the Pearl Harbor DVD).  And sure you bring smiles to the political correct fans by turning the Japanese into reluctant attackers (riiiiiight!!!).  But Michael Bay, despite these flaws (there are several others) you created a film that kept me entertained for the duration with several scenes/lines (some intentionally funny - some accidentally funny) that I will spend the rest of the summer reciting to my friends along with 2 pretty intense battle/action sequences. And really, despite people howling about how there is no soul to your film or how the story stinks, this is really why everyone went to see the movie - to see the battle sequences - and these do not disappoint.  So Michael I think your ""sin"" is not creating a storyline (much like in Titanic) that would make audiences feel better about going to watch a film about a huge disaster.  As far as I'm concerned, you did pretty well and didnt feel the movie was half as bad as critics are making out.  You and Bruckheimer keep making pictures that please the masses.  PS: Whenever you make Pearl Harbor 2 I think you can handle the Japanese/political correctness issue in a much more subtle fashion than you did in this movie. Instead of making the Japanese commanders out to be reluctant attackers, follow a young Japanese pilot as he prepares for this mission (go watch Saving Private Ryan to see how Spielberg focuses in on a ""sympathetic"" German soldier).  That would be a much easier way to build ""sympathy"" for the Japanese, rather than having Japanese commanders going around saying how war stinks, etc, etc"

The care and perfection put into this work of art is astounding.  Yes, the love story may be drawn out, and yes it may be a bit traditional, but it works BEYOND well!  Without it, the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the terrific surprising finally would not have worked nearly as well.  All the movie critics complain about the love story--if it wasn't for that love story, during the last half hour the entire audience would not be shaking with fear for the lives of the cast, which they were at the theater I was in.  I could go on and on about this film and how well it works on each and every level, but I will end on this note---if you love movies, if you like movies, if you take pleasure in getting lost in movies, and if you are a human being with a heart, see this film on the big screen."

","""Pearl Harbor"" was more a comic book than a serious movie.  I ignored it when it was in the theaters; however, I finally broke down and wasted three hours to watch it on the Starz channel last night.  This movie is so disjointed and wrong-headed it's hard to know where to start.  First, the special effects were okay; you can do a lot with computer animation these days.  The problem with the special effects was that they lent to the comic book atmosphere of the movie; all those planes crammed into such a small space.  Then there was the plot itself.  If you're going to do a movie about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, why do you start out with the Battle of Britain and the Eagle Squadron?  In fact, how many movie goers actually know what the Eagle Squadron was?  The Doolittle raid on Japan was as out of place as the Battle of Britain.  A better opener would have been the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and then China proper.  The story of the Chinese suffering under Japanese oppression would have been a far superior lead-in to the events that culminated with the Japanese launching their attack.  Leaving the story at the aftermath of the attack would have been far superior to what the director cobbled together.  The odd little bits, for example, the fiction of FDR (Jon Voight) pulling himself to a standing position, had no place in a real movie about Pearl Harbor.  If they wanted detail they should have shown those radar operators having to walk to a pay phone to report what they had just detected on their system.  From what I have read, that was authentic.  The bomb's-eye-view of the plunge into the Arizona's forward magazine was plain stupid.<br/><br/>If anyone wants to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor they should book a flight to Honolulu and go to the Arizona Memorial.  The National Park Service can give you more detail and authenticity in twenty minutes than this movie does in three hours.  The plane ride to Honolulu is a bit pricier than admission to a movie theater, but you would learn more, would have some fun, and wouldn't feel as if you had been cheated.<br/><br/>I took my daughter and her husband to see the real thing a couple of years ago.  They were awe-struck.  Then I took them a few miles south, down to Hickam Air Force Base, and showed them the pock-marked dormitories that still stand as a memorial to that day of infamy."

Also I would guess that most are written by people who were not alive when it all happened.<br/><br/>Compared to Private Ryan and Titanic, this is better.  It is better entertainment.  It does not grind your nose in the gore.  It does portray rather accurately the moods and feelings of the time, and I know because I WAS alive then.  A little too young to have participated but old enough to be seriously affected and to know what was going on.<br/><br/>Yes, Tora and Midway are great documentaries and the more personalized 30 Seconds over Tokyo were good movies for their time.  But this combines the best of all those films with the movie technology of today and I found the results outstanding.<br/><br/>The love story was much better and more likely than Titanic's contrived unlikely pairing of a steerage passenger with a first class passenger. And Fatso Kate of Titanic does not hold a candle to Pearl's Kate.  Leanardo DeCrapio also is not in the same league as Affleck and Hartnet.<br/><br/>The concept of two people getting together after thinking a common person has been killed is very real. A close personal friend of mine was shot down in Viet Nam and after four years was presumed dead.  His wife was granted a divorce and married one of his squadron members.  When the POWs were released in 1973 he was among them. He subsequently married the wife of a squadron member who was killed in action.<br/><br/>Compared to CTHD or all the other forgettable films of 2000, this is a real crowd pleaser from my point of view, certainly the best of 2001 so far!"

I was worried that Bay was not mature enough for a film like this, and that he just figured that the formula (""Titanic"" + ""Saving Private Ryan"" = $$$ and OSCARS) guaranteed him recognition and a box office hit.<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, this movie was surprisingly coherent.  It also seemed to me that the quick cutting ""style"" (or enormous flaw) characteristic of Bay was rather absent in this movie, or at least severely lessened.  But ""Pearl Harbor"" is not inspirational or creative filmmaking; it is a standard reliance on what has worked in superior films of similar subjects.  Every camera angle, shot, line of dialogue, or stunt in this movie has appeared in a better film already.  However, this didn't ruin the movie for me.  I have a weakness for movies like this, so I found much to like.  I went along with the romance between Rafe and Evelyn, even if I forced myself to, in an idealistic fantasy way.  This is also applied to the look, feel and cinematography of the period piece; the movie looks more like it was filmed at a 1940's theme park than actually in the 1940's, but this also helped me lose myself in the romantic fantasy of the film.  The dogfights are also spectacular, and the planes probably move faster and maneauver much smoother than WWII era aircraft, thanks to the flawless CGI.  <br/><br/>There were moments during PH where the movie would lose my attention--surprisingly enough, this happened quite a few times during the actual attack.  The footage is always impressive, but never involving enough to shock or horrify the viewer.  This was one of the consequences of Bay's directing, and not the only one (I really dislike his style of montage).<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to the final act, which depicts the Doolittle Raid, however it was rather disappointing.  It really seemed as if the production was rapidly running out of money and had to speed through the entire sequence to get it done.  As a result, much of the suspense and interesting aspects of the bombing raid are lost on us, and they are much better presented in the classic, ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo."" <br/><br/>
Other flaws (that I had a problem with): I wish there was more of a ""it just happened"" feel to Danny and Evelyn.  Instead, Danny nervously (and rather guiltlessly) follows Evelyn around and practices pick-up lines on her.  Is this an admirable (or believeable) way for him to act around the girlfriend of his presumably dead best friend?  Come to think of it, isn't Danny kind of a JERK?;  WHY are the Zeroes painted green!?  Other Japanese planes in the movie are photographed in silver, so why would the filmmakers, claiming that they are striving for accuracy, paint the legendary and infamous planes incorrectly?;  The climax (in occupied China) of the movie comes off as really convenient, yet it ads a great awkwardness to the aftermath and conclusion.<br/><br/>I guess what is most offensive about ""Pearl Harbor"" is the rush that people will get from watching a bunch of explosions and carnage, when what we are seeing is based on the deaths of over 2000 of our citizens.  Michael Bay and even Jerry Bruckheimer may have held intentions to make a respectable movie to honor the veterans (entirely secondary to the big bucks, of course), however in many ways it makes mindless summer fun out of an absolutely horrible, murderous tragedy, and that is what makes me feel guilty about enjoying this movie.  Grade: B-/C+"

","Pearl Harbor didn't disappoint me. The actual bombing sequences took my breath away, both with the enormity and severity of it. The images of these soldiers, seemingly in paradise, suddenly & inexplicably slaughtered by the Japanese was mind-boggling.  Ben, Kate & Josh really gave excellent performances. There were things, though, that stuck in your mind for a bit, distracting you.  For one, the makeup on Jon Voight (who played President Roosevelt) was obviously an appliance... not very convincing at all. Kate's lipstick NEVER rubbed off on either Ben nor Josh. Josh Harnett looks SO MUCH like (either) Treat Williams or Tommy Lee Jones that you're sitting there trying to figure out where you know him from.<br/><br/>The movie itself was excellent, and it truly was appropriate to open on Memorial Day weekend.

"norbie1","10","0","2","28 May 2001"," A lot of publicity, but not enough about the film.
","This movie has been previewed before almost every movie I have seen for the last year.  The problem with the previews is none of them give enough information about the movie to determine what it is about.  The only information given about the film is the title ""Pearl Harbor"".  From that, I could only guess that it was a remake of ""Tora Tora Tora.""  But it is not. This movie could conceivably be made into two movies, maybe even three (and quite possibly many more).  Before I go on, if you haven't studied W.W.II some of the following may give some of the movie away, but not much, mainly the info on what happened after Pearl Harbor in reference to Doolittle's raid.  Now then, The first movie would be the docu-drama of the bombing of pearl harbor.  The second movie would be the story of Doolittle's raid.  The possible third would be the romantic underlying story line that runs throughout the whole movie, the whole soldier and nurse fall in love then he goes off to war...  Additional story lines for other movies to be made from this would be the story of Dorie Miller.  Not to mention the stories of other AVG. groups that were in the war before the rest of the US, for instance the eagle squadron mentioned in the movie and the flying tigers of the Asian theater.<br/><br/>All the hype for the show just lets you know that Pearl Harbor is bombed, and give some hints about a love story that goes along with it.  Let us know what we are spending $7 of hard-earned cash (plus the trip to the snack bar) and 3 hours of our lives to see.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. But all the hype, advertising, and other various promotions did not do it justice."

","After reading all the bad and mediocre reviews for PEARL HARBOR, I've got to say I wasn't too keen on seeing it. I'd heard the acting was wooden, romance (love-triangle) boring and tacked-on, and the subplots forced... That was not what I believed after I'd left the theatre.<br/><br/>True, this movie is 3+ hours long and you may glance at your watch once- I did but that was 2+ hours into the movie- but Pearl Harbor delivered exactly what I wasn't expecting from a movie that was so poorly rated. I got heart-tugging romance, believable and enjoyable performances by the talented cast and a suspenseful and heart stopping war scene that had me biting my nails, gripping my seat and filling my eyes with tears. I don't know if it will have the same effect on ALL moviegoers- but I sure hope so. This movie was so much more powerful than titanic which I felt was good- but much overhyped (and undeserving of that oscar).Indeed it is very different from WW2 pix like Saving Private Ryan or ENEMY at the Gates, but those were WAR movies- those were about the coldness, brutality and utter annialation that is caused by such Global Feuds. PEARL HARBOR was about Patriotism, Love, Honor, and Sacrifice. It was more a big picture on the human spirit and an eye opener on the travesty that is WAR. Those who felt the romance was too much a part of the movie- it was NEEDED to show the characters warmth, weaknesses and love for each other. How do you expect to care about someone if you haven't got the chance to know them- I assure you that you will feel for each and every individual that inhabits this island. If you can't see the EPIC that is the movie- then I suppose you were one of the many people who enjoyed SHREK. PEARL HARBOR-was a movie I was happy to give 8 bucks too- Shrek... well I should've waited for the video. Pearl Harbor transported me back to 1941 where innocence was shattered and ignorance was severely punished... I was visually and emotionally blown away (pun intended:)<br/><br/>I went in with the lowest expectations and dry eyes, and I came out as a stunned and speechless American, so proud... so sad... But so Happy I'd seen this movie after all. Don't beleive the reviews or the critics- see for yourself and you'll see what I mean."
"bjones","10","0","3","27 May 2001"," Tora Tora Tora meets 30 Seconds Over Tokyo
","I have seen and appreciated more films than anyone else I've ever met. I generally have a preconceived notion of what a movie is going to be about before I go and I am rarely wrong. I had decided I wanted to see this movie the first time I saw a trailer for it many months ago. It looked like a well-done epic and I wasn't disappointed, even though I grew weary of the more than usual hype that preceded it. I was hoping to have a ticket price worth of entertainment, not a soul enriching experience of nirvanic proportions, as some viewers seem to expect based on other comments I've read. Get over it people, it's a film. The criteria should be, ""Does it entertain 'me'"". Well, this movie far surpassed my deliberately lowered expectations.<br/><br/>I think I have seen every action and ""effects"" movie ever made, having been a fan of such entertainment since the 1950's. I own copies of everything worth watching more than once. I went into this movie hoping it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as Saving Private Ryan. It was far far better. The improvement to me was the much-increased plausibility of the character's stories. While Ryan was a contrived and twisted premise from a single bare thread of a real example, this movie was rich with the examples from many real life people and very real events. For example, it has surprised every young person I have talked with for them to learn there really were two young pilots who tore to a remote airfield and flew alone into the sky to challenge the collective assemblage of the Japanese naval air forces during the attack (so little real history is taught in schools now days) and I am still rankled to know the one instigator as portrayed by Affleck was denied the Medal of Honor because of his commander's mean spirited rejection because he had not been ordered into the air (a very real life travesty to fail to recognize amazing courage). How's that for a missed story line?<br/><br/>I can also easily forgive the filmmakers in trying to present many stories in the form of the two main characters, Affleck and Hartnett, to tell a broader story of America. It saved time in trying to get the audience to buy into them emotionally. Sure some of the film wasn't historically accurate, so what, it's supposed to entertainment first and foremost. No historically based film I have ever seen has been completely accurate and those that have come close to that kind of reality have been roundly criticized for lacking ""action"", as laughable as that irony is. Sure, an excellent film could have been made in two hours of footage, but instead we are treated with a lot more visually rich entertainment for our money - a real bargain. I also got the unmistakable impression that this was an attempt at much more than just a film about the attack on Pearl. It was an ""hommage"" to America's efforts in the war - all of America.<br/><br/>The love story was actually an extra bit of realism many people are enjoying. It may have been added to attract more female viewers, but so what, aren't they deserving of some consideration by Hollywood too? I cannot begin to count the number of people of my father's generation whom I have heard while I was growing up tell how they met and fell in love during the incredible turmoil of that war. This is the telling of another story in it's own right, of the love and loss of the American women who endured it on the home front. The dull heartache of that kind of empty fear was the reality of their war as they loved and waited for their men to return home - if they did. Sure, a magnificent war story could have been told without the love interest entirely, but it would have been a different movie and far less of a moneymaker, so it may never have been made (this is called economic reality). The truth is one must attract a broader audience to turn a profit these days. I can say I was very surprised to see quite a number of unaccompanied females in the audience - almost unheard of for an action movie. Two teenage girls who came alone sat next to me in the theater and they were absolutely transfixed by the action and moved by the romance. I have NEVER seen another war film attract young female moviegoers this way. There were dozens of them in the theater.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films to ever impress me with it's combat special effects. Not the newness or originality of them, or of raising the gee-whiz level of what Hollywood could do (who really cares about that anyway except overactive immature males), but the accomplishment of something far more difficult; stunning realism. To achieve realism, sometimes, less is more. I worked within the Department of Defense for over 31 years. I saw and participated in 4 wars in the military and as a civilian. This film is the closest to the actual experience of the reality of combat I have seen to date, including the vaunted ""Ryan"", which was more of a presentation of the grit realism of war. Some detractions I have read clearly weren't paying attention or perhaps the closest they've been to this kind of real war is whichever film they last saw. This film achieved the mechanical realism of the machinery of war. It also contained, hands down, the best aerial combat photography I have ever seen (though much was special effects). The feel of reality was almost startling. Not all of it was completely real as it still disappointingly had some of the usual overdone Hollywood pyrotechnic explosions with tons of gasoline to awe the naive audience, but the most real thus far. Add together sequences from this film, Ryan and a few very chosen sequences from the Thin Red Line and you have quite a stunning collection. I can't include the Viet Nam era war epics as they are too close to home; all of those attempts miss the mark with far too much overdone Hollywoodistic pyrotechnic depictions of action.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the performances in this film. All of the younger cast members gave me my money's worth, but I felt Affleck did quite an exceptional job with the heavy task he was given: to make such an over-the-top character believable - he was. Beckinsale's character was absolutely charming and I could easily see several young men fighting over such a beautiful actress. She did a very good job with the American accent too. Cuba Gooding's character seemed almost gratuitous and difficult to dovetail into an already packed story line but I'm glad he was there as he always gives a great performance and he certainly didn't disappoint me in this outing. Also surprisingly entertaining was James King as Betty. She really came across well on the big screen and I'd like to see more of her in the future. I was suitably impressed by Voight as Roosevelt and by Baldwin as Doolittle. Likewise, Mako as Yamamoto and Colm Feore as Kimmel were a valued addition, worthy of praise for their craft. They were fun to watch work. All gave great praise to the historical character's they portrayed with an integrity of realism not easily achievable. The overall quality of the rest of the cast was near impeccable with the only character I felt obviously underutilized being Tom Sizemore. I'd like to see him in more films with meatier roles. I also realize this film was already getting long - approaching The Longest Day in its scope and the length of its cast. Come to think of it, with a little more work and with Disney coughing up some more bucks this could have surpassed even that epic in actual run-time. It sure outdoes it in quality of product. I am going to supremely disappointed if this does not get an Oscar for effects and cinematography. The camera work was a real joy to watch with the only exception being the strangely blurry-lens effects thrown in the hospital scenes when it was under attack.<br/><br/>Finally, in these types of films I always wonder how they are able to find enough Japanese actors to fill the cast. But those actors used here were quite excellent and gave heroic dignity to a very difficult task - to portray their historical countrymen without raising concerns of racism and engendering new nationalistic rancor against the Japanese. I would have liked to have seen more of Mako or Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who played Genda, but I guess that film was Tora Tora Tora, which should be seen for historic comparison."

Yes, it was very similar to Titanic in terms of scale, theme, and structure, but I felt that this was the superior film.  The performances aren't subtle, but they evoke the era beautifully.  When the inevitable assault begins, you know the kind of people that populated the 1940's because of the work that Affleck, Gooding, Baldwin, Hartnett, King, and Beckinsale have done.  I'm sure that all of the flyboys and Navy nurses who served in Hawaii in 1941 were not as impossibly gorgeous as Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett -- but at some point, you gotta lighten up; it's only a movie."

"siggyb","10","0","2","26 May 2001"," A bit of everything for everyone
","Pearl Harbor is the kind of movie that has something for everyone. It has romance, so you can take a spouse or a date with you. It has emotional moments of friends bonding as they realize that their lives could end at any minute, so, you can take a best friend. Actually, I'd recommend that you see it with a good friend - it will make you appreciate them even more. It has some GREAT war scenes - very realistic - so those who go see the movie looking for that are going to love the 2nd hour. Basically, Pearl Harbor is a whole lot of romance, war, drama, and patriotism all rolled into one. I noticed that there were a lot of war vets (in uniform) in the theater I saw it in, and I looked around at the end to see most of them in tears. Maybe this isn't the best movie of all time, but I wasn't bored at all during the 3 hours, and I found it as a fitting tribute to those who served our country and gave their lives. People tend to laugh at the romantic aspect of the movie, but let me ask you all three questions: Don't you think that all of those servicemen who fought in the war had wives or girlfriends? Don't you think that the nurses had husbands or boyfriends? Don't you think that every single person who served in the war was somebody's wife, husband, daughter, brother, mother, father, aunt, uncle, cousin, etc? Real, living people actually waited some 60 years ago to hear if their loved ones had lived or died. Pearl Harbor perfectly  captures the emotions going through America at that time. Anyone who is not at least *partially* moved by this movie must be made of stone."
"Wimer","10","0","2","27 May 2001"," ""Harbor"" to ride ""Titanic"" formula for success
","Much like the 1998 megahit ""Titanic"", ""Pearl Harbor"" uses the formula of placing a melodramatic love story with fictional or composite characters against the backdrop of and epic historical event. It even uses the same trick as to have the fictional characters interact with actual persons who were part of the actual event. The formula worked for James Cameron, so there's no reason to think it won't work here. The characters are likeable and well-acted, the story is somewhat plausible and the sheer size and expense of the production make it more than worth the price of admission. Any true movie goer owes it to themselves and the Hollywood establishment to see this film, if for nothing else, to encourage the producers of such monumental films to open up and make more films like this in the future. I can hardly wait for the sequel....""Hiroshima""....the feel good hit of next summer, maybe?"

"mermatt","Null","0","1","25 May 2001"," Lotta FX and a Love Triangle
","In this big action treatment of FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, TORA! TORA! TORA!, and THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO, the historical plot gives way to technical FX and melodrama. I didn't complain when James Cameron did that with TITANIC because the characters and the plot were integrated into the main story of the great ship's disaster, but here history takes a back seat.<br/><br/>The superficial character development of the romantic triangle doesn't justify the sluggish first 90 minutes of the movie. The characters played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are not in the same league with such great on-screen rivalries as those done by Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, but I fault the director and writer for that, not the actors. I cringed at some of the trite dialogue delivered with sha-ZAM faked accents. Much of the 1940s atmosphere before the Pearl Harbor raid is slick but is as superficial as the characters.<br/><br/>Then there are the unintentional laughs such as the mountains of Long Island, the US Capitol doubling as the Navy Department, and the classic Woody car clearly in view right after the sexual encounter scene. And isn't it convenient that we have two buddies, one for each major theater of the war? As far as the mawkish, repetitive music -- don't bother listening. We even have crucifixion imagery. I think there must be a kitchen sink in there someplace too.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that ultimately I liked the film. It works best when it starts focusing on the Japanese preparations for war, and after we finally meet FDR and see the Pearl Harbor attack followed by the Doolittle raid. I think the director and writer could have trimmed the opening sequences from 90 to at most 45 minutes, and the film would have gotten off to a much better start.<br/><br/>While I can't recommend the first act, the second and third acts are worth the effort. So sit back, relax, eat your popcorn slowly (get a big bag and take a good 90 minutes to savor the flavor), and wait for the real movie to begin."

","I'm not a fan of Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer (in fact, I usually laugh all the way through movies like Armageddon, The Rock, Independence Day, etc. at the sheer corniness of the dialogue and story.)  I actively dislike most blow em up movies, and am generally a fan of dialogue driven movies.  I went to see Pearl Harbor because of its awesome preview and to see the special effects.  That's it.  Going in, I had already heard how terrible the dialogue was and the weak plot, but Memorial Day got to me and I decided to risk my 5.50 at the matinee.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  (SPOILERS AHEAD!!) <br/><br/>
Maybe they caught me on a good day, but there was only one line of dialogue that I laughed out loud during, and it came from Ben Affleck during the bombing.  `Just get me to a plane!'  Or something like that.  Like Ben's going to take on the Japanese army.  But really, that was the only truly bad line that I spotted during the movie.  Even lines that COULD have been corny, from some reason didn't strike me as such during this movie.  Maybe it was the setup, the scenes, the directingwho knows?  But the dialogue isn't as bad as everyone is saying (and trust me, I'm a stickler for dialogue) and is light years above the dialogue in Armageddon.<br/><br/>People have complained about the weak plot in the love story.  The central point of this film wasn't the love story.  It was the bombing of Pearl Harbor, hence the title.  Although, the title could have been (Ben and Josh save the day by shooting down 7 Japanese planes in) Pearl Harbor.  Cheesy plot?  Yes, absolutely, but for some reason it works.  They needed something going on to build up to the bombing, nothing too deep or confusing, and they got it.  They couldn't just start the movie with the bombing.  We had to anticipate something, right?  I actually liked the love story plot, even though it was reminiscent of a soap opera.  (And I hated Titanic, by the way, so I'm not generally a fan of corny love stories.)   <br/><br/>
As for the lack of historical information, well, most of us, if we were paying attention in high school, learned about the history behind World War II.  Hollywood shouldn't have to spoon feed us information that we can get from any history book.  If there wasn't enough for you, go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book.  I'm sure there are plethoras about Pearl Harbor now. It was a movie, not a documentary, not a history lesson.  We got information relative to the bombing, and that was all we needed, not a primer on World War II.  If you need more, tune in to the History Channel.  They've been running Pearl Harbor stories all week.  I know some of the information was inaccurate, but it's a MOVIE!  It wasn't supposed to be a documentary. People are complaining about leaving out the Nevada.  The movie was 3 hours long as it was.  They couldn't include everything.  I think the desired effect was achieved.  <br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing.  It was emotionally wrenching to watch the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  If anything, I think this movie will provide a lot of people with some information that they didn't have before about Pearl Harbor.  Education of the masses is always a good thing.   <br/><br/>
As for the length, I thought the 3 hour running time of this movie flew by. All of the actors give wonderful performances, particularly Kate Beckinsale. I've never seen her in anything before this, but I'm a fan now.  And Jon Voigt is great as FDR.<br/><br/>I really have no complaints, except that Kate Beckinsale and Ben Affleck are both such good looking people that it's a little distracting at times. (Josh Hartnett's not bad, but I'm more of an Affleck fan.)  Oh well.  And that it's going to be months before I can own the DVD, which is sure to be packed with cool extras.  <br/><br/>Just don't listen to the critics on this one.  I think that expectations outweighed being able to accurately judge what they really saw.  You can't please all the people all the time, but I think Bay/Bruckheimer really did a great job with this movie.  Sure, it's a little corny at times, but it's still an excellent movie."

I am glad I did listen, because I saw a gorgeously filmed masterpiece.  Far as I am concerned it lands up there really close to the level as TITANIC.  I enjoy a love story any way, I like to cry and laugh. I was impressed by the entire film, including the film score.  No one got up and left the theater, everyone was glued to their seats, I heard people crying around me.  I got so engrossed into the film that I forgot to eat my popcorn.

However, once the real action began, this became a film to appreciate.  Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) again proves a master at huge special effects.  I felt sadness and sickness during the attack, as well as pride in the actions of the soldiers.  I bought Jon Voigt as FDR and thought Alec Baldwin was fine as the hardass flight instructor.  Veteran actor Mako had the necessary screen presence to pull off the portrayal of Admiral Yamamota, and I thought Dan Aykroyd provided nice work in his limited role.  My tidbit on this one is to check out Toru Tanaka, Jr (son of the 60's and 70's professional wrestler)as the bouncer in the bar.  Overall, breathtaking war scenes and 3rd rate love scenes."
"Dkish","7","0","4","23 May 2001"," The biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season begins.
","By Dean Kish<br/><br/>The biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season officially begins. Like the $139 million dollar juggernaut that it is, Pearl Harbor roars across the screen as Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett star as best friend aviators. Rafe (Affleck) has to leave his best friend behind when he joins the highly-respected `Eagle Squadron' out of Britain. The Eagles battle the Nazis as America still refuses to enter World War II. Rafe's beloved Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) is a nurse and is just getting  to know her fly-boy when he takes the assignment in Britain. Rafe asks Danny to look after Evelyn if anything should happen to him overseas. Danny is a man of his word. Tragedy brings down one of the three and the pain it causes brings their lives face to face with the horror that is the Japanese sneak attack of Pearl Harbor. That lone event changed the face of the world and America forever. Who will live? Who will die? And strategically, how will America overcome this disaster? There are so many ways to look at this film, that it's hard to narrow it down into one review. I basically see the film as three smaller films brought together as a huge 3-plus hour blockbuster juggernaut. The first film focuses on the love story of the three leads. The second is the actual events that transpire before and during the attack of Pearl Harbor and the third is the aftermath. Each of these sections of this huge film could have been its own actual film. Director Michael Bay really challenges himself a lot in the first hour of this film. The love story, subtle lighting and humor are really like nothing he has accomplished before. These scenes were great in that they show Bay is evolving as a director. I did find however find that the actual `love-story' plot was quite contrived and was an almost typical wartime drama scenario. Bay's CGI effects and rip-roaring attacks, throughout the second hour are amazing and very intense. These scenes are a marvel to witness. But the film seems to drag quite a bit as the attack dies down. The whole third hour seems like a sequel. Why didn't  screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) find a way to conclude the lead characters' story in the events of Pearl Harbor? Wallace's script had too much meat and did tend to flip-flop to a lot of different people not around Pearl Harbor. The script should have summed up the love-story in the first 20 minutes, trimmed down some of the flip-flops and narrowed the focus of the film to the actual events of Pearl Harbor. If this would have occurred the film wouldn't have been so long.<br/><br/>The lead actors are dashing, daring, beautiful and wonderful to watch. Affleck is good as the steel-hearted hero who faces a moral dilemma. Harnett is believable as the guy who falls for his best friend's girl. But of the three, Beckinsale seemed to release the most range as she seemed to be the one tortured the most. I really liked her during the hospital sequences when the siege was happening. These blurred moments reflect the stress both within Beckinsale and in the events occurring. I really liked this technique. My overall favorite performance wasn't even by one of the main leads. Jon Voight's performance as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Voight's grasping of the classic historical figure was incredible and it's amazing how he even resembles America's greatest president. I loved this performance and I do hope there is an Oscar nod here. Pearl Harbor's historical lay-out and  formula kind of reminded me of was how the mini-series `The Winds of War' was a set-up for `War & Remembrance' except they were two long and massive mini-series. Pearl Harbor may have included too much stuff in its story. The whole first hour could have been vastly trimmed to bring the actual event closer to the front of the film. `The Winds of War' and its sequel were the most ambitious complete World War II dramas ever conceived. Pearl Harbor may have been too ambitious. This American interpretation of the Japanese invasion is very respectful to the Japanese and doesn't show them as tyrants. I liked that the Japanese were perceived as doing a strategic thing and that they knew that they were awakening a sleeping giant. I am not sure if this is actually the correct portrayal of Japan during this time period but it definitely won't harm anybody today. Pearl Harbor is the kind of film that is meaty enough to spend those inflated theatre ticket prices on. It has something for everyone. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer."

The actors were horrible in their roles and the dialogue was uninspired and fake. Actors off the streets could have used more emotion than these ""so-called Hollywood stars.""  Goofs, such as showing ships from the 1980's, were just stupid and unbelievable. Does the director really think the audience is that stupid not to notice? The ""romance"" plot was so badly written it nearly made me sick. The only thing good about this film is when the credits appeared at the end. I almost felt like throwing my drink at the screen because the movie was so long, dragged out and just all together boring. Ben Affleck has got to be the most overrated actor I have ever seen.

","There is not much to be said about ""Pearl Harbor"". Perhaps there would have been, if director Michael Bay, and screenwriter Randall Wallace had been more concerned with substance, rather than style. Some scene's are rather impressive. Their girth and sheer magnitude could not be disputed. It is just a shame that such expensive images are void of depth, meaning or empathy. The dialogue is as thin as tissue paper, and the acting fares no better. The two work in conjunction, as all of ""Pearl Harbor's"" main characters get to spout sappy, cliche one liners, as fast as they can be written. The actors get by on their looks, and ability to blend into the many tightly framed closeups. They, in actuality, provide contrast to the tough natured battle scenes. The film is much to long. With such a big budget, you would have thought that the film makers of ""Pearl Harbor"" could have afforded good editors. The romantic story meanders and takes far to long to develop. By the time it does blossom, and the battle begins, the audience is already bored out of their mind. The photography, can be magnificent at times, but is essentially tired and cliche in construction. The war may look good, but it is also all to familiar."

","Like most people, I wouldn't rant about ""Pearl Harbor"" as a movie on its own merits. There are stunning visuals, but the plotting and acting is a little too syrupy.<br/><br/>However, because ""Pearl Harbor"" is a true story, at least in the big themes, I felt a deep connection with this film. I got the sense that even the cheesy bits were flashes taken from the real lives of real people. These were people I wanted to understand and empathize with. The film did that for me.<br/><br/>I've always avoided war movies because the basic point is usually, ""war is hell"". Of course it's hell, and I don't need to relive a horror and get the requisite trauma and nightmares. But Pearl Harbor, while it had plenty of the horrors of war, did a good job of presenting reality without bringing the horror so close that I couldn't bear to watch it (as in ""Black Hawk Down""). The film is rated PG.<br/><br/>So, while I would recommend ""Saving Private Ryan"" instead, Pearl Harbor in my mind is certainly worth watching and a good idea for anyone who wants an appreciation for war without a surround-sound nightmare of reliving it too closely.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- War film buffs with nothing better to do on a rainy day<br/><br/>-- Schoolkids and others who'd like to appreciate the sacrifices<br/><br/>made in WWII but who'd avoid the tougher, bloodier war films.<br/><br/>This one is safe and has something to say despite the<br/><br/>simplistic love triangle.<br/><br/>I'll give ""Pearl Harbor"" a probably-undeserved 9 out of 10 because it pays respect to a real life event whose victims deserve honoring."

","I recently watched the excellent, almost documentary-like take on the attack on Pearl Harbor ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and was compelled to view 2001's Pearl Harbor again just to compare the two and get a feel for just how awful this Michael Bay-ized version of history is.  Simply put, it's complete garbage and is insulting to those who served at Pearl Harbor and throughout World War II.  The audience that was the target for this movie must have been considered to be monumentally unintelligent.  I am amused by a previous comment written by someone who calls this the best movie of the decade.  Of course, in the span of one paragraph of effusive praise for this movie, this person misspells a half-dozen words, misspells every actors' names, and even incorrectly identifies this war as World War I.  This seems representative of the type of audience the producers were going for.   The only redeeming portions of movie are the battle scenes.  The airplane battles above Great Britain give one the sense of being an observer in a plane right next to the battle.  Much of the actual Pearl Harbor attack is well-done, too.  But, as Roger Ebert noted, it becomes '40 minutes of redundant special effects'. ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" was produced in 1970 (well before top-of-the-line special effects) and yet the battle scenes were more compelling.  What's even more compelling is the story of the buildup and mistakes that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which ""Pearl Harbor"" overlooks almost entirely in favor of D-grade romance that would not even cut it in today's soap opera's.  Without any 'character-driven' roles and almost a documentary-style feel, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" manages to be one of more compelling war movies of all time.  If you really want a good accounting of that 'day of infamy', rent ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".  ""Pearl Harbor"" is just an unabashed waste of time."

","Pros: Cinematography, Costumes, Sound, Special effects.<br/><br/>Cons: Historical innacuracies, Hammy acting, Sloppy directing, Unbelievable characters.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor represents everything bad a movie can get. It claims it was made for the veterans of pearl harbor but really it is a formulaic blockbuster whose purpose it seems was to beat Titanic at the box office. Ben Affleck thought this was the film that would make him a star after Armageddon failed to do so. The only star this film made was Josh Hartnett. The Girls including Kate Benkinsale were basically downgraded to giggling schoolgirls and the guys I guess was how every military men in thier days concucted themselves. I mean, who in the H**l gets drunk, wakes up the morning of the attack, flies a plane and shoots down enemy japanese planes, gives blood after the ordeal, then gets picked for the doolittle raid. This is physically impossible. Cuba Gooding Jr gets relegated to a token black guy's role and Jon Voight portrayal as Franklin Roosevelt is downright corny. The story isn't even told in the Japanese point of view and why did they have to show the doolittle raid. History shows that it was nothing but a morale booster for america. In fact the pilots hit nothing but hospitals and schools. Hollywood doesn't trust the audience to figure out that we won the war instead of the japanese so they decide to end the movie on a good note. At least if you dedicate this peice of dreck to the veterans, the least you can do is show at least 1/20 of the death's of thousands of americans who died on this day. The love story seems like something that would come out of Jerry Springer.<br/><br/>Premise: Group of friends experience disaster at Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Pearl harbor was nominated for four Academy awards and won one.<br/><br/>Grade: 1.2/10 (Bay's worst)"

","The majority of Pearl Harbor is a historically inaccurate, overblown, cliche-ridden piece of trash. Michael Bay should be banned from directing for all eternity; Randall Wallace should be tied up in a dungeon and forced to watch this movie over and over, listening to his own lines until he goes insane; and whoever greenlighted the script should get a CAT scan and a sanity hearing. The writing makes James Cameron's Titanic script look like a cinematic masterpiece.  The love triangle which takes up the first two hours is trite, flat, predictable, and completely without chemistry. Approximately five minutes is devoted to the war which is supposedly the focus of the movie.  <br/><br/>All of the above is why I was quite surprised that the battle scene was as effective as it was. Unlike the rest of the movie, it is affecting and has a ring of truth to it (probably because nobody was talking). If you rent this, get the DVD so you can just skip right to the attack scene and avoid the rest.

"svedupelle","1","0","1","30 April 2002"," One of the worst. Ever.
","Pearl Harbor is not a good movie. Unless someone pays you for enduring three hours of it, you'd better stay away from it.<br/><br/>What makes it bad? Well, first and foremost it is extremely predictable, not only in plot, but also in what the characters say. Watching the movie was a lot like watching, and listening to, cliches on parade, and poorly executed such. At the times when the plot is not predictable, it is strange, making far-fetched jumps in time and setting, never with a hint of irony. By the time of the Japanese attack I was so bored and bewildered that the blood and mayhem on screen seemed like a parody of an Eighties' zombie-movie. Not in technical respect, though, they are quite well executed. The similarity lies in the lack of emotion, which springs from the cliche-like build-up to the attack. The little girls watching the Japanese planes flying by was just too much.<br/><br/>The acting is not quite as bad as the script, though it is hard to tell. The oh-so cute nurses and the mucho macho pilots do not allow for much character-development, and one is left wondering why Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is in the movie.<br/><br/>Still another reason for the movie's poor quality is that the directors and editors made far too much use of slow-motion, probably making the movie twice as long as it could have been, surely twice as long as it should be. Instead of adding to the drama the slow-motion sequences make the movie nauseating.<br/><br/>This is, in other words, a bad movie, even for a blockbuster. Even 1 out of 10 is too generous."

","I feel this had the potential to be one of the great films with the subject matter, but it falls way short.<br/><br/>Firstly, the love triangle device is tragically flawed because Josh Harnett and Ben Affleck play the exact same character.  The beginning is totally cliched and the love story is mostly the same as well.  If they were well done, it might be passable, but neither is even close to that level.  Both the male leads and Kate Beckinsale have very poor chemistry together, so the love story is a complete dud.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the leads are so bad/hampered by directing/script because the supporting cast, especially Cuba Gooding, Jr and Jon Voight (as FDR) do a great job with their material.  Both turn in the only likeable characters in the movie, and it's sad Gooding's role contains only a few minutes of screentime.<br/><br/>Unlike other movies from the Bay/Bruckheimer duo (Armageddon), the actual ""friends"" (supporting characters) are the same and barely have any development (even though the movie is loooooooong).  Of note is a nearly unrecognizable Jennifer Garner pre-Alias star turn here.  Dan Aykroyd is miscasted and Alec Baldwin is only passable in his role.  No one really cares what happens to them, or who gets the girl in the end.  Most of the attempts at humor are surprisingly lame.<br/><br/>The bombing of Pearl Harbor is generally really well done, technically, and the 40-minute scene or so is worth a rental on its own (just skip to that scene, then turn the movie off).  The action scenes involving our heroes doesn't contain the necessary cliffhangers or intense action to carry the movie.<br/><br/>The last hour or so is blatantly tacked on and should have been another movie.  At this point, the sympathy the movie has tried to conjure up for the Japanese side of the story (which was well done earlier) disappears and suddenly they are evil stock villains again.<br/><br/>So in summary, we have a movie that fails to be an action flick, fails to be a drama flick, fails to be a comedy, and fails to be romantic.  The only thing left to rely on is to try to induce blind patriotism and hope that people think it's unpatriotic to call ""Pearl Harbor"" a bad movie.<br/><br/>Too bad this one didn't have a better script/direction, or it could have been great.  Instead, it's mostly bad with a few good things (Gooding, Voight).  A waste of potential, for sure.<br/><br/>3/10"

Is there a collective lack of imagination in Hollywood that someone there can't think of a more original central plot? The actual event is minutely documented in historical records, notes, books, eye witness reports, film and living survivors, so why and how could it ever become so innacurate? It's supposed to be about Pearl Harbor, so why try to soften the reality of this by tacking on a so called happier ending with the Doolittle raid. If the film kept going and included the rest of WWII, the allies won, so we would have an even happier ending there!! It's not acceptable to show people from the 1940s smoking, but its OK to show them killing each other? No-one calls the Japanese something naughty, we have comments like, 'the Japanese are just like us but with a different point of view'? Come on!!

How ever could the makers of this film plan to spend more on a movie than has ever been spent before, and be satisfied with this standard of writing?

I'm not sure what some of the lucky and courageous survivors think, but I would imagine the real story would have been enough for them.<br/><br/>One obvious truth which does appear with this movie is the use of modern technology. With the development of digital effects, CGI, is it?, means that absolutely anything can now be portrayed onscreen. This does should not mean, (but probably will mean ) that this is the reason some movies will now be made; cos' we can. Wrong reason!!! Hollywood please take note.<br/><br/>
One thing does bother me greatly, and this has already been shown by reading some of the other comments. This is that there will be a lot of ( probably young ) people who will think this film is a pretty accurate account of the Day of Infamy, and be completely mislead from the reality. It should not mean having to watch a documentary to get the true story, otherwise you might as well have made a totally fictional war movie.<br/><br/>
Also speaking as someone from England, ( who were part of the eventual allied forces ) America did not win most of WWII by themselves!! Why can't your film makers resist the temptation to make a comment in that vein? In Private Ryan, an absolutely brilliant film by the way, the only comment about the English forces at Normandy was an innacurate critisism of the leadership of General Montgomery. In Pearl Harbor it was the excruciating comment by an RAF Squadron leader to Rafe saying something like 'at first not being sure about the Yanks being involved but by God if there are anymore like you back home I pity the enemy if America ever gets into this scrap'! For God's sake Hollywood wake up,  get real, and remember we were, and are, on the same side!! By the way, someone serving in the US forces at that time could not apply to join the RAF, the US govermment and his CO would not allow it. You would have to try and resign or leave first. So Rafe turning up at an RAF station in full uniform, with the full backing of the US and his CO, is what we here would politely call a load of cobblers!<br/><br/>Final comments, could do better. 3 out of 10, only for the effects. Best thing was the sound which was truly good."

","Pearl Harbor has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is pointlessly drawn out and full of factual errors, the leads play this as if they were in a coma, and it just keeps going on... and on.. and on. The only way I could ever see this again is if they make it a MST3K feature. That could be great, since this film is unintentionally hilarious at times. Stay away from this one, folks.

","Pearl Harbor is not a good movie. In fact, it's not a movie at all - it's punishment. Any film critic telling you otherwise is like George W. Bush on Jeopardy - useless.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay is the same genius responsible for Armageddon. That opus concerns a group of wacky oil drillers sent to destroy an asteroid on a crash course with earth. So horrible, it makes you root for the asteroid.<br/><br/>Bay is the crown (clown?) prince of audience manipulation. It takes discipline and skill to create characters and scenes that honestly demand the viewer's attention. Instead of making an effort, Bay cheats . . .<br/><br/><ul><li>Slow motion shots of pilots strutting along. Gee, Mr. Bay how original. I haven't seen anything that spectacular since your last movie. Newsflash: screen heroes are not heroic just because they're moving at more frames per second.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When in need of comic relief, bring on the guy with the speech impediment. Are you kidding, Mr. Bay? You want me to point and laugh at a man with a stuttering problem? A character with a handicap can be funny. Well, duh. However, when the chuckles are at the inflicted's expense, it's more sad than humorous.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Mr. Bay, you are shameless. Can't generate suspense? Quick, put a doggie in a life or death situation. Can't elicit an emotional response through straightforward storytelling? Give us a scene with children.</li></ul><br/><br/>Michael Bay is a hack . . .<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is a long film. I'm not sure about the running time, but I think it is in the neighborhood of 9 hours. It's such a lengthy movie, the makers of Pearl Harbor lose track of plot points along the way.<br/><br/>Early on, Ben Affleck's character has severe dyslexia. After 4 hours, this trait conveniently disappears. Why? While stationed in Europe, this flyboy becomes quite the poet. The letters he writes to Naval nurse girlfriend, Kate Beckinsale, are impressive. However, the long-winded sonnets are a contrived mechanism for forcing the bulk of the story upon unsuspecting filmgoers.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is largely a love story - filled with unappealing people, uttering romantic drivel, doing stupid things. Since there is no investment in the live's of these characters prior to the fighting, it really doesn't matter what happens to them during the fighting.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the movie contains the Japanese attack on the titular naval base. Those moments are technically well made. Stuff goes boom. People run around and yell. The proceedings are slick and presented with ostensibly lofty production sensibilities. Still, the sneak attack is cold.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that at times Bay shoots the action in a hazy, soft focus. Maybe he was trying to be artistic. It doesn't quite work as intended. Like I said, Bay is a hack.<br/><br/>One last point: Why can't Hollywood have the courage to end a movie appropriately? The film is called Pearl Harbor. However, the Japanese aerial attack left thousands of Americans dead or wounded and the Pacific fleet in ruin . . . What a downer. The good guys have to win, right?<br/><br/>Well, in this movie they do. The victory takes the form of the Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle-led retaliation strike against Tokyo. Everyone can leave the theater happy. All is well.<br/><br/>Bad enough, right? Get this: the U.S. bombing raid took place only 131 days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Pilots launched from the flight deck of the USS Hornet. Upon dropping their payloads on Japan, the twin-engine Mitchell bombers continued to mainland China - then occupied by Japan. From there, these men alluded the enemy and marched to Allied territory.<br/><br/>In Pearl Harbor, all this is a means to wrap up the hackneyed love yarn. Who gets the girl - the intrepid Affleck or the daring Josh Hartnett? Who cares?<br/><br/>Don't get guilted into enjoying this clunker. Pearl Harbor is junk . . . If you agree, does that mean you don't revere the past? No - it simply says that you have taste.<br/><br/>This film is a three out of ten."

","Yes, I know. My tag line was very cheesy. However, I felt I should keep within the theme of this movie, which contained some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard. Everything about this movie is designed to make you feel something. The problem is that the movie tries so hard to jerk tears from your eyes, it ends up gouging them out instead. The first hour and half of the film is devoted to an excessivley slow moving rather boring romance. Actually, two romances. Ok, so they tried to copy the ""Titanic"" mold and frame the historical event within a romance, right? Yep. But it didn't work in ""Titanic"" either. There is almost no insight as to why the Japanese attack. We are subjected to a couple of one or two minute subtitled scenes that take place in Japan. I guess the filmmakers felt that was enough background on the event that forced the U.S. into WWII. The only redeeming factor in the movie, is the attack on Pearl Harbor itself. For about minutes or so, you watch in white-knuckled suspense, and you know what it was like to be there on that terrible day. There are some inaccuracies in these scenes, but overall, the effect is stunning. After the attack, it's back to the awful dialogue, and redeeming battle at the end of the movie, and an ending that desperately wants you to cry. If you have three hours of your life that are expendable, that by all means, watch this movie. Just remember, you will never get those three hours back."

","Just saw this film the other day, and it was a little better than I thought it was going to be which really isn't saying much (this was only due to the bombing of Pearl Harbor scenes).  I am a huge war movie fan and I usually flock to the theaters anytime an epic is released such as Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers or Black Hawk Down.    This movie, however, I boycotted due to the cast and the hours of romance that I heard were in it. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it, yet it had a few good moments.<br/><br/>First off, the movie has many historical flaws, but that is to be expected, and in my opinion, doesn't make for a bad war film (most of the time). The storyline follows Rafe (anyone know anyone named Rafe?) and his romance with the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, who plays a Florence Nightengale type nurse who falls for Rafe who is an American pilot who fought for Britain before America formally got into the war.  Basically, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, girl finds other guy, girl loses other guy, boy finds girl again...tried and true...a Hollywood formula that just won't quit.  Honestly, the whole romance in a war film doesn't necessarily turn me off, just two freaking hours of it does.  It was trying to be like Titanic way too much.  The war scenes, when you finally get to them, are spectacular, with explosions worthy of a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay title.  Tom Sizemore, one of my favs, was great in this film, along with Jon Voight as FDR.  Affleck, an actor who I go back and forth on, mainly b\c of his annoying cockiness on screen, did a pretty good job in this film, but could have been casted with a better actor.  Kate Beckinsale was great, and man, what a hottie...definitely would give you a reason to return back home alive.  And of course, there was Josh Hartnett, in my opinion, the most Overrated, undertalented actor over the past couple of years...his acting was horrible, and I did not sympathize nor like his character at all. It's a wonder where Hollywood is pulling all of these no-talents from...someone like Ryan Phillippe would have been a much better choice, an actor who is serious and charismatic.  Overall, this movie is long and dragged out.  It re-creates the Dec. 7th spectacularly, and features the Doolittle raid with equal splender, yet the movie as a whole is below average.  If you buy it, skip over the romance parts and watch the last 30 minutes, the only redeemable quality of this film.  4/10."

I found, however, a trivialized version of the same historical event with a weak, almost laughable, love story attempting to raise the interest of the viewer (without success in my case). Imagine a couple of pilots finding a couple of fighters not yet destroyed by the bombing, taking off and shooting down a number of Japanese planes, landing and on the way home shooting at a few more from a convenient anti-aircraft gun emplacement on route, then going to the aid of trapped sailors on the Arizona sinking in the harbour.

Now let's take a look at the plot: pilot falls in love with nurse;nurse thinks the pilot is dead; nurse discovers his boyfriend is alive and they lived happily ever after (or so I think)... What is that! I've seen better writing in ""Cow and Chicken"", not to mention that the dialogue has a number of cliches comparable to the number of mistakes the movie has (refer to the goofs list, I won't go further on that topic).  The special effects are very well done, but that doesn't save the movie from being so lame, and as if that wasn't enough, one of the worst events in U.S history is so sweetened in this movie, that a 5-year old could watch it without crying. Also, I would like to say that there's alot of disrespect to the courageous men who lived the real thing. It is obvious that this film was done solely to get money and before I'm done, If you want to see Dan Akroyd in a fine WWII movie, watch ""1941"", It's far better than this waste of precious film. final words: Shame on you, Michael Bay!!"

Normally, he is actually quite good at finding hit films, but not today Josephine. I'm glad Pearl Harbor was a massive flop, it just goes to show that it takes more than money to make a financially successful film. Maybe he should watch Lord of the Rings a couple of times to find out why. Don't rent this movie at the video store, it's very boring to say the least.

Even the best visual effects cannot save an idiotic movie like this.<br/><br/>2) Making a movie with cliches like ""If you are willing to take those risks, take one step forward"" make people wonder if you are idiots, or if you believe that the whole public are idiots.<br/><br/>3) Movies are played all over the world. Presenting the American army as the savior of the planet IN EVERY MOVIE THAT YOU MAKE, is an insult to the rest of the nations of the world.<br/><br/>4) Jerry Bruckheimer should stop wasting money on Michael Bay projects. Michael Bay should go to a film school and learn a few directing principals.<br/><br/>OK, the movie contains the best battle scene of all time. But this was done by ILM (good job guys), after they received a huge check by Jerry. The plot and direction are the worst (as usual, since we're talking about a Michael Bay movie).<br/><br/>The first hour is the funniest movie of all time. Seriously, there are soap operas that are more believable than this crap. People are having a drink and the next day they are engaged! How can this ever happen? And if it ever did, why did this happen? No real emotional exploration is even attempted, to explain this children's story.<br/><br/>I was hoping that after his first films Michael Bay would have learned from his mistakes and would eventually come up with a movie that has some substance, or even some style. Not with this guy! Every important gesture or movement is emphasized with slow motion. Every time! Once more fast cuts are the order of the day, especially in the first part, which makes those stupidly fake emotional moments even harder to watch.<br/><br/>Finally American patriotism. You can't escape a Michael Bay movie without a dose of US patriotism! He turned one of the most embarrassing moments of the US military into victory! Maybe Pearl Harbor should end with a slow motion close-up of the A-Bomb, with a ""Now you'll see"" caption. How uplifting could that be!<br/><br/>Bay/Bruckheimer are obviously terribly rich, which means that they can buy all the acting talents and all the visual effects they need.

Cuba Gooding's role is too small, and he disappears into the background quickly.

","Pearl Harbour received some of the harshest criticism I can remember any film getting for a long time. Panned by almost every paper, magazine or internet site in the world, I was never going to be able to watch this film with an open mind. However, despite the cliche ridden script and some debatable acting, Pearl Harbour was a film I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. There were plenty of good action sequences and edge of your seat excitement. I go to the cinema to be entertained and I found this film an extremely entertaining experience. I think that maybe one of the reasons Pearl Harbor was so widely criticised was the subject matter. I am sure many people were unhappy to see various people make vast sums of money from a historically innacurate version of a tragic event in which many people lost their lives. It also glossed over many of the appalling events that took place after the Pearl Harbour bombing and seemed to look at the entire war from an American perspective. The film was also far too long. After the spectacular action sequence where we saw the Japanese fighters attacking the American ships, the makers of this film, for some reason, decided to drag it out for another hour. This was rather pointless and I was beginning to get restless towards the end. The acting was not great either, but it cannot have been easy for the Affleck et al with such a poor script so abundant with cliches.

Personally I would choose Pearl Harbor, not because of the multimillion that was spent to make it real, but because of how well it was acted. I laughed at Reds stutter, cried all through the movie. I loved how well they portrayed Rafe's and Danny's brotherhood, despite everything, they still loved each other. I know it sounds fag, but it is just like a family, you love them despite everything.

","There are only three questions to ask in regards to movies: What type, quality of cinematography, and how many people paid to see it.  Every thing else, i.e. acting, plot, story, f/x, music, etc., is subjective to anyones preferences.  This was a Historical Romance set during 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor as the historical event the movie revolves around. The movie type tells you the purpose of the film. To tell a romantic story, to show how the romance was affected by war, and to give life to an important historical event.  The quality of the cinematography is excellent, this is undisputed.  And so many people have paid to see it that the mass appeal of Pearl Harbor is also undisputed.  So, Pearl Harbor is an excellent movie! Every thing else is just opinion. Some people on this site want to quibble over accuracy of historical events in movies.  Ask yourselves, what one story, or person, can tell all the facts accurately when the facts are not all known?  If the films' directors use actual footage and actual eyewitness accounts, then the accuracy is good enough!  Remember, everyone sees things differently, even the same things. Pearl Harbor is probably as close to reality as we are going to get.  So enjoy it!"

","Aside from some truly awesome visuals to recreate the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, this punishingly long movie ultimately fails. Instead of using any of the powerful true stories from the people who experienced the attack, a fictional, drippy love triangle story is formed (with no chemistry at any angle). Cuba Gooding Jr. is woefully underused. The script is filled with cliches and sappy dialogue, and the love scene between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett is just plain laughable. The visuals, special effects, costumes, and supporting performances by Gooding, Alec Baldwin, and Jon Voight are all high points. The three leads are not horrible, but the script lets them down.

This scene shows that the past 1 1/2 hours that you p***ed away was not in vain. Every angle is explored as the Japanese wreak havoc on the US fleet. The CGI Zeros look incredibly real and you are treated to Cuba Gooding Jr. fighting to find a reason why he signed on to do this film. Getting behind a dual .50cal AA mount would be enough for me but I'm straying here. Anyways, Jon Voight turns in the best acting in the movie as FDR. Unfortunatly the B twins figured we wouldn't be interested in seeing how the Japanese went about planning the attack. Minimal attention is paid to them in the film. A suitably sappy score underlines this sorry excuse for a war film and I felt cheated as I walked out of the theater.

","Pearl Harbor is the story of two best friends, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Harnett), and their lives as they go off to join the war.<br/><br/>The build-up to this movie was huge as it splashed across our big screens. Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer teamed up to bring us this blockbuster of a movie for young and old to enjoy, an all-time classic for the family for years to come. Based on a love story, this one blew Titanic out the water on its release in 2001.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor has this incredible way of wrapping you up inside the film from the moment the music plays. The movie starts with Danny and Rafe as children, and you share their bond as best friends from the start, so it's no surprise you feel for them both as events play out in their lives taking them to different places in the war.<br/><br/>Rafe comes across in the film as the ""wannabe hero"", the daredevil who thinks he's got the stuff to make the cut. You also get this feeling of Rafe as the father figure as he sets out to protect Danny in almost everything he does, even to risk his life for his friend. But Danny, well, he comes across as the guy who will go to war but do what is needed to keep himself alive. He's not the daredevil his friend is, though Danny would move heaven and hell for Rafe.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is the film you will watch again and again. Every time you watch it, it will open up a new door for you, giving you some little detail you missed the time before. Trust me, I know. I saw this at the cinema 23 times, and even now when I watch it at home, there's always something I missed the time before. Pearl Harbor was criticized when it came out for not being accurately based on the events and the build-up to them. Even so, Pearl Harbor made the events in the film real. You find yourself too engrossed in the film to even care if the events are in order or not.<br/><br/>It's amazing, it's fantastic, it's superb.<br/><br/>Bay and Bruckheimer know exactly where to hit you, and they hit you hard. You cry, you smile, you grip onto the edge of your seat, watching bombs fall from planes. A roller coaster of emotions overwhelm you during the three hours of this film.<br/><br/>The only downside to Pearl Harbor was the love triangle. There's no way you can do some of the love triangle scenes and have the audience think you're for real. It's a little difficult to approach this without totally giving it all away. But any filmgoer would find it predictable.<br/><br/>But it's more difficult to believe that they gave Tom Seizmore an award for just shooting planes for 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is the film that has basically taken Saving Private Ryan and Titanic, mixed them together with a touch of magic from Bruckheimer, and set it out to the big screens. It's got the cheesy romance from Titanic, and, on the other hand, it's got action-packed scenes of Private Ryan.<br/><br/>But no film is real without the music, and they got it just right for this film, set with the same melody for almost all the songs. It's the music that sets your mood. It's the music that forces tears from your eyes or brings panic to your face. That includes the amazing end credit music ""There You'll Be"" by Faith Hill.<br/><br/>I just can't brag about how good this film is anymore, so just take my words  get the DVD, get some popcorn (but two bags, as by the end the time the Amazing Jap Zero scenes come on, you'll have jumped up and down in your seat so much that most of your popcorn will be on the floor), dim the lights, bring a loved one to hold the tissues for you, and prepare yourself for December 7th 1941.<br/><br/>Join Ben Afflek, Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. for Pearl Harbor relived in modern film history."
"PrinceValium","Null","0","1","23 February 2002"," A great injustice to history
","When I saw the trailer for this movie, it made me cry.  Twice.  I never cried over a trailer in my life before.  It was so beautifully constructed and poetic, capturing both the terrible and heroic essence together, complimented by a sweeping musical suite by Hans Zimmer. Wow.<br/><br/>Then I saw the actual film.  I couldn't even begin to express my disappointment then, but I will give it a try now.  First, let's start with the concept of turning this monumental tragedy in American history into a slam-bang action spectacular.  Already, this is the worst way to approach this subject matter.  It trivializes this event and what it meant for those who died and still suffer to this day because of it, and no sense of historic consequences are even touched upon when it's all said and done. After all, this event, as tragic as it was, led the United States to become a Global Superpower.  That alone deserves a little more screen time than just a simple throw-away line of voice-over narration at the film's conclusion, and it wasn't even clear then that this is what resulted.<br/><br/>The movie's user-friendly premise of a love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale falls flat on its face because it doesn't have any context within the attack on Pearl Harbor itself.  It simply just exists to fill in between bites of popcorn.  Unlike here, the love story concept worked in a historical setting like ""Titanic"" because there were clear story ramifications between the sinking of the ship and the future of the love affair.  That's why we as the audience hung in there and were worried how it was all going to turn out.  In ""Pearl Harbor"", the Japanese attack has no effect whatsoever on the love triangle.  Yes, the characters take part in it, but they are not impacted by it, which is what successful movies do to involve their audiences.  It's called ""dramatic tension"", and is the basis of all storytelling.  Only after the attack is long gone does the relationship story come back into play.  Well, at this point, so what? It merely helps us to alleviate the painful memory that only about two-and-a-half thousand sailors just died.  But hey, who's gonna get the girl?  That's what this movie called ""Pearl Harbor"" is really about, isn't it?  Forget this war stuff, I've got my date here with me and I seem to remember paying to see three hours in the love lives of these three models... I mean characters.  Oh, and what about the President Roosevelt caricature... I mean character?  He looked like a puppet, a cardboard cut-out of one of our greatest presidents.  Sadly, this version of FDR came off as having no real personality, he just kept spouting cliched lines of wooden patriotic rhetoric, and seemed like he kept saying ""Our boys"" every other line.  Where's the human being in this man?<br/><br/>And what about the Japanese in this movie?  Where are they?  Besides all being in the Navy on the attacking planes and ships, I didn't catch many Japanese people in Hawaii at all.  Why the hell not?  Were the filmmakers afraid that it wasn't politically correct to show them there?  What a disservice to all those Japanese-Americans who were harrassed, violated and thrown into internment camps when the war broke out.  Now, I bet there are some great stories to be told there.  But certainly not here.<br/><br/>Forget this movie.  Watch it only to understand the err of its ways.  But if you want to see a real war movie with captivating plotlines, historical context, and involving, well-written characters, check out ""Glory"" and ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Now those are movies that can make us feel proud, and also walk away certain that war is really not all that youth-oriented and cool."

I know how it's done - I saw the 'Making of' docs!<br/><br/>There were a few bits that grated me, but they were mainly historical innacuracies like the colour of the Japanese Zeros (they should have been light-grey, not GREEN!!!!), the Eagle Squadron should have had Hurricanes as opposed to Spitfires (in addition to a few more American pilots!), etc... There weren't that many that I knew of, anyway, but they could have got some of it 'spot on' for the 'nit-pickers' amongst us.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor isn't bad, but it doesn't come close to depicting the day's events that 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'.  But then it's not meant to - it's meant to tell an action/love story in which the main characters are swept up in the events of the day and how it affects them and their lives.  It's not meant to be a big anti-war statement, people!!

Every shot is pleasing to the eye and uses advanced conventions of photography. The special effects are the next thing down the line. It contained some of the best digital editing I have ever seen. If you rent the DVD of this movie and watch the ""making of"" section, you'll see what I mean. The acting was decent too. Now, the problems of the movie are that the script and plot suck. If they had completely left out the love triangle it would have worked well. They could have even kept the love story in, but not the triangle. It contrasted the point of the film. No one wants to see war and the jealousy of love in the same movie, well, unless you're married and she wants to see a love story and he wants to see some blood. Although, people are too hard on this movie. They either absolutely hate it, or think it's all right. Now, the love triangle was extraneous, but the movie still had many strong points.

","CONTAINS SPOILERS I saw this movie on DVD (I thank the stars for that, since it gave me time to prepare for this movie, having heard the reviews and all) and have to say it was slightly, SLIGHTLY people!, better from what I was expecting. This of course is due to the so many times praised and unbelievable fighting scene. But that's it!!!!! The rest of the movie is completely lost. COMPLETELY. The whole movie, well let's face it, the whole chick flick(we've got everything here, the cute actor, the woman that has to choose, and of course the touching score), relies on the romantic triangle between the three actors. Kate Beckinsale is probably the only person that put everything she could into her role. The others just rode along. Ben Affleck, after Chasing Amy, deserves just an OK, and that Hartnett fellow is nothing thrilling, no new discovery as some claim. But this story is so immensely dumb and presented in such a way you get the feeling that the whole attack on Pearl Harbor was rigged so the ""third wheel"" (in this case the Hartnett boy) would be fairly and properly disposed of. Quite sad, actually. You will not find character development in this movie as it is too busy finding a way to get rid of Danny Walker.<br/><br/>I should say that I was, and still am a huge fan of Bay's movie, because I find them very entertaining and filled with energy and style. I am talking about BAD BOYS(8/10) and THE ROCK(9/10), while ARMAGEDDON(4/10)should be seen by thirteen year old's and extremely patriotic Americans only. The way he presents movie is amazing. The camera movements and the way he uses light and slow motion is unbelievable, it was the only highlight of this movie.This movie goes in the 2nd category of Bay's movie as it lacks just about everything there is to make such a movie. Bay should definitely stick to making pure action movie or get a capable and propper writer to write the romantic crap. Because that's what you'll find here. Whoever found the romantic development plausible is either a person I feel really sorry for, because he clearly possesses the IQ of a raisin or in the other case is a teenage girl, either with a huge crush with one of the male actors, or without a boyfriend hence not being able to understand these things(sorry, but it's true).<br/><br/>You'll recognize the female part of the commentators immediately; ""Great romantic movie"", ""People were so unfair to this movie"" and similar. They most likely cried at the end, every single one of them, and that's OK, but please, not because the Hartnett fellow died. I admit, I had a lump in my throat, you know the one you have when you are at the verge of crying, but I had it because I felt really sorry for Ben Affleck's character. He got the leftovers, so to speak, as the love of his life slept with another man (some special gal, huh, and with his best friend to be exact - it could happen, sure, but not on the first date and not so soon, that is, if she really was in love with Affleck's character, even though he was supposedly dead)got pregnant with him(Hartnett), told Affleck she would choose him(Hartnett) despite being ""immensely"" in love with Affleck, since he was the father of her unborn child, but since he(Hartnett) died, saving Affleck's life, well now, then she would of course ""choose"" Affleck. AAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHH. Even now I feel really sorry for Affleck's character. It really makes me cry. Sure, he could forgive his best friend eventually, but the woman, come on, she's the biggest slut ever portrayed on the big screen. I can't help but think that she would never have chosen Affleck if Hartnett were to live, and she says that to Affleck too, but why does she end up with Affleck, surely not because Hartnett dies. If this is the case, well, then this woman is just looking out for herself, not caring about others. How would you feel if the love of your life told you she couldn't be with you because of another man, but when he would die, she'd ""choose"" you.<br/><br/>She clearly doesn't know the meaning of being faithful to somebody.<br/><br/>As was the case in Titanic, the woman is guilty for screwing up the future of her man. In Titanic Kate Winslet is so selfish she doesn't even think of asking Leonardo to climb on the BIG piece of wooden raft. In this movie the woman ends up with a man, whose life and his relationship she ruins in the process. Disgusting. Sad. I was appalled.<br/><br/>I will not try to pretend to know the whole deal about Pearl Harbor and the stories surrounding it, but the way it is portrayed in this movie is offensive. A totally patriotic movie, elevating America to an even further ground(Independence Day anyone), showing others as negative and inferior. The line where an old Japanese man (just after they hit Pearl Harbor)says they have just awoken a giant, or something like that is a statement I will not even comment. I will however end this too long comment by, well commenting on the opening scene where the young Affleck and Hartnett are playing. Needless to say, they are shooting German bastards, or something like that. But when they say those lines, something like ""Nobody messes with America."" -""Land of the free"" ""Home of the brave"". MAN, when they said that I of course knew what a crappy movie this was going to be, BUT MOST OF ALL I WANTED TO KICK THEIR REDNECK, YOACKLE ASSES, THEY WERE SO ANNOYING.

One of the most momentous moments in our history, and brought America-rightly or wrongly-to be the most powerful nation on earth. It should make for a momentous film: the surprise attack, the suffering, the repercussions. Yet that frightful director Michael Bay-is he the worst of all time-has made this event into a love story. The frankly drippy Ben Affleck and whathisname battle it out for the love of Kate Beckinsale, using all the romantic clichés known to mankind. Aren't the events that took place enough?<br/><br/>Imagine what a talented director could have done with these events. Rather than one with a cynical attitude towards the public. One that is after our bucks and that's all.<br/><br/>I was warned before the film that the makers had a heavy-handed attitude towards history. Fair enough, some parts of the events have been completely falsified for two main reasons. Because American Patriotism means big bucks and also to please the Japanese public.  World history is the last colony of Western Culture that America has yet to control. Yet there is no need to be worried, because the way history has been changed in this film is laughable and could be read as satire!<br/><br/>My personal opinion is that the makers thought that the public would not be happy just to see historical drama and needed to dumb down the events to make money. This is a serious oversight: many of the public are sick of being treated like children. We can think for ourselves and I think the tide is turning against dumb down movies. People are starting to see through Jingoism, SFX corny romances and want something that matters. Something real.<br/><br/>Yes, the special effects are good. But so what? Are we children?<br/><br/>You may ask why I bothered to right this review, if I hate the film and had no obligation to see it. Well, the answer to that is, down my cinema in the United Kingdom we have no choice. On every screen, we are dominated by this American tosh.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Did I know Ben Affleck was still alive?  Yes.  Did I know there was going to be a barfight? Yes.  Did I know that Josh Hartnett was going to die and Bruce Affleck was going to raise his kid? Yes.

On another negative note, I though Ben Affleck's performance was terrible.

","I watched this movie on video after avoiding it on the big screen because of all the hype that went with it. A big mistake! This is a great yarn. The action scenes are marvellous and breath catching. The romance in this movie is also quite touching. It can be enjoyed at various levels. If you want a war movie with a sense of history about it this is the one for you. If you want a love story in the midst of war then this is for you. The only annoying feature of this movie was the non-reaction of the medical corps officers to the heroine's pregnancy. I have my doubts that a unmarried serving nurse would have been allowed to continue in her profession in the 1940's once it was discovered she was pregnant. Perhaps I am wrong. But I did feel that she acted too much like a 2000's type of person in an era when her behaviour would have been frowned upon. Having said this I loved the story! I enjoyed the twists in the plot and have recommended it to all and sundry. The attack on Pearl Harbour was a tragedy for the U.S.A. and this movie should get a modern generation to reflect on that tragedy and to appreciate the dramatic recovery of the nation after such a morale shattering event."

","Pearl Harbor is probably the most underrated film of 2001. I watched this movie on a bad TV and widescreen video (not a good combination) and I still loved it. I didn't know what to expect when I saw it. The trailer looked really good but because of all the bad reviews I expected it to suck. It didn't. Sure, some of it is a bit biased and some of the romance is corny, but what do you expect? Another Titanic? The special effects were at their best and the acting was good (not great, but good).

"JRGBUCS","Null","0","1","8 February 2002"," There's a good movie in here.
","I can imagine what happened when it all got to the editing room. Instead of actually editing the film in to a fast paced war film; they decided to leave the other stuff in. I sat there fast-forwarding through the first hour or so until the Japan started to attack. That's when the movie became interesting. My view on it is that they tried to do too much. The Soap-Opera love story failed big-time and the beginning with 1923. If they would have cut out say half the movie then it would be much better. They should have just focused on the attack and the two main male characters. It should have ended with Roosevelt asking congress to declare war on the Axis.<br/><br/>Also with a $135 million dollar budget; couldn't they hire someone to clean up the script. I mean the dialogue was just plain awful. Lots of funny lines that weren't supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>Suppose they had an editor with some guts and made the film 100 minutes at the most. It wouldn't have been considered the flop that it was. It would be short, yes, but to the point. I can't understand anyone who didn't like the attack scenes. The attack stopped my MST3K-like remarks and actually had me interested in the film for a while. And that's where the movie is good. My suggestion is to get the DVD and go straight to the attack on Pearl Harbor; when the attack is done turn it off; the rest isn't worth watching."

","Yet another sappy, ridiculous love story stuck in the middle of a bad movie of questionable historical accuracy. The acting is bad. The writing is well, bad. The direction is well... competent maybe. The thing I hate most about this is its need to ""humanize"" one of America's greatest  tragedies by sticking a love story in the middle. I suggest watching ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" instead."
"radio149","3","0","1","3 February 2002"," A dull movie with one shocking, tragic and incredible scene you have to see.
","The big problem isn't that it's a love story. The problem is it's a DULL love story. Despite the length of the running time spent on the love triangle, all three of the lead characters are handled far too sympathetically. Nobody is depicted as being particularly at fault. Everybody's nice. Where's the real conflict between these people? Affleck comes back from the dead to discover his best friend has been sleeping with his girlfriend. He should be incredibly angry at this. Instead, he just has a bit of a sulk and eventually has a little scuffle, after which they're the best of friends again. Hmm.<br/><br/>The net result is that you're supposed to care about these folks, but they're so colorless that you literally couldn't care less, not even at the climax. Ultimately the historical characters, like FDR and Doolittle, are far more interesting and better played, and deserved more screen time.<br/><br/> The Japanese are handled sympathetically, but perhaps to too great a degree,  coming across as simplistic, troubled stooges instead of the dedicated, enthusiastic warriors they seem to have been. Look at Tora, Tora, Tora's depiction of the Imperial Japanese Navy, for instance. There's a big difference.<br/><br/> And yet for all this, the attack, when it comes, is utterly shocking. The human suffering and awful destruction is presented with real skill and sympathy. It's the one emotionally involving part of the entire film, but it's lost in a sea of filler material. This is a vapid movie, and the horror and impact of this scene shows that up. The attack has nothing in common with the rest of the movie, and frankly looks like something spliced in from a much better film.<br/><br/>To cap it all, the whole thing is disjointed. It doesn't feel like a coherent story at all, just a series of events that abruptly stops at the end credits.<br/><br/> Positive points - the flying scenes are very good, the special effects are fantastic, the acting is in general good and in places excellent. But this still isn't a good film. If only the verve, skill and - crucially - the emotional punch that was applied to the attack sequence had been spread across the entire film, this'd be a sure fire classic. Instead, it's just a dull romance with a stunning sequence jammed in the middle."

I've watched it four times and even knowing what was going to happen, I could hardly breathe.<br/><br/>Each time I went up to switch the tapes, I could barely stand so it's lucky my VCR is close to the bed. The scenes with Danny (Josh Hartnett) and Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) make me smile uncontrollably and stupidly. Every time I watch it, I just want to again and again.<br/><br/>I loved Titanic, but I think Pearl Harbor is much better. Titanic was much more focused on the love story and had less characters. There were very few, besides Rose and Jack, likable characters. But in Pearl Harbor, there were many characters who had nothing to do with the love story. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is considered as one of the lead actors, but he only talked to Evelyn once and never to Danny or Rafe. Many of the other characters, like Betty, Red, Anthony, Sandra, Martha, Billy, and Barbara, were also people that I really connected with and loved. When Betty died I cried just as hard as when Danny died. Watching Titanic, there was no one like that.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing. I don't really know anything about special effects, but I was completly taken back by them.<br/><br/>Also, the music was incredible. I bought the soundtrack and just listening to it makes me cry. Most of the time when I sing ""There You'll Be"" I start crying so hard. A lot of this is making me sound like a big cry baby, but until very recently it has taken a lot to make me cry. after seeing Pearl Harbor, it's easier for me to cry, because if I get upset about something and think about Pearl Harbor, I cry because of both things.<br/><br/>The people who say this movie is horrible aren't very compassionate.

","Make no mistake about it, this film is one of the most execrable ever to issue forth from the Hollywood studio system. A complete absence of insight into the mechanics of war or the emotional effects on its participants (other than ""it makes them sad"") is made all the more obvious by the vapid visuals which give the whole enterprise the look of a holiday advert. Bay's Pearl Harbor, unlike the filthy trenches of Paths of Glory or the squalid, gut-strewn beaches of Saving Private Ryan, looks like a nice place to visit. Missing many opportunities to point an accusing finger at the American administration at the time, who launched the atomic arms race at Hiroshima as revenge and as the ultimate scientific experiment (Nagasaki was the control), and who allowed Japan to perform human vivisections on the Chinese in return for a share of the data. There were so many corruptions, degradations, lies and disgraces on both sides, but Bay feels $130,000,000 is better spent on viewing the petty squabbles between his two pretty boy leads, who so obviously want to screw each other but need to find a surrogate female through which they can achieve some kind of sexual union without compromising their ultra-hetero (i.e. over-compensating) image. To trivialise a national tragedy, without analysing its causes is not only a stupid waste of resources, but, in this day and age, bordering on evil. Historical revisionism is the tool of dictators, fascists and, on this evidence, Hollywood studios embrace those values enough to stump up the largest budget ever granted at the start of a project. If you want to do serious history, don't employ Randall Wallace. The Mummy Returns was an appalling film, but besides being a sad waste of money and time, it didn't matter. I dread to think what might have happened if this had been taken as factual in the same way that Schindler's List has been. Fortunately, this film tips so far over the edge into jingoistic fervour that it is impossible to take any truths away from it. Luckily, the Japanese, who are portrayed throughout as sour, humourless, heartless tacticians, have been able to laugh off the offensive nature of this film, and in Japan it is seen as a romance with a few explosions in it."

","Although I question whether or not this movie should indeed have been titled `Pearl Harbor,' the movie by this name was nevertheless a splendid one. I question the title merely because dozens of historical romance novels have put equal or greater emphasis on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, without using this title.<br/><br/>A fine evening of  entertainment on video, `Pearl Harbor' was no doubt a spectacular experience on the big screen. I regret now not having seen it at the theater. I would definitely recommend it. Little else can be said without revealing gradual plot lines. Therefore .<br/><br/>
SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!<br/><br/>
Whether to try and wed war and romance has been a quandary Hollywood (and other world cinema capitols) have struggled with for decades. Only a few - usually those set in submarines, like `Run Silent, Run Deep' - manage to avoid romance all together, instead focusing on rivalries or friction between commanders and subalterns, etc.<br/><br/>Inevitably, history and military buffs bemoan the insertion of any fictitious romantic plotline and characters into the script. Often these are plastic, irritating intermissions between the `good stuff,' such as in `In Harm's Way' and `Midway.'  At other times they tend to mislead the casual watcher and cause much confusion as to fact and fiction (i.e., `Titanic.')<br/><br/>Although I haven't gone back to double-check for historic accuracy, I don't think this will be a problem with `Pearl Harbor.' The main fictitious plot line surrounds pilots Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). McCawley and Walker are obviously based loosely on real life Lieutenants George Welch and Ken Taylor, who drove over 100 miles an hour to reach a subordinate airfield, from which they managed to take off and make some havoc for the attackers.<br/><br/>Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, a bizarre soap opera love triangle develops and dominates the film when bombs are not falling. Rafe and Danny have been best friends since childhood, with the apparently slightly older Rafe always looking after Danny. This relationship is turned upside down when Rafe is presumed by all (including the military) to have been killed while volunteering in England. Danny, sharing his grief with Rafe's true love, Evelyn, eventually falls in love with her - only to see Rafe return, as if from the dead. Sound corny? Well, I guess it beats seeing McCloud slap around Police Woman in one of the other Pearl Harbor adaptations.<br/><br/>In any case, the lovers of war movies and the historians (I count myself among both groups.) never get enough action footage or enough military strategy, amidst the kissing and betrayal. Still, about the only real negative I can say about the love theme is that it takes so long to develop. Still, by the time the Japanese finally get around to doing what the audience has waited for, most of us DO care about a few of these characters to some extent, including the boys' stuttering friend Red Winkle (Ewen Bremner) and his fiancé Betty Bayer (James King). Outside of the nurse-fly boy romance subplot is black USS Arizona cook Dorrie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), whom I believe is a real life character - or based closely on one. Miller, who had to box to earn respect in the white man's Navy, takes up an anti-aircraft gun on the stricken battleship and earns his own share of glory.<br/><br/>This brings us to the other debate on war movies. Is war sensationalized, trivialized or glorified? I would say `Yes and no' in this case. One cannot help but be inspired by the gallant effort of  the two friends and some of their fellow pilots (based closely on real life sequences) to get planes off the ground in the most deadly of circumstances. Col. Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) is inspiring in his candor and determination to avenge Pearl Harbor. And, while I have seem more convincing Roosevelts, Jon Voight at least captures the individual determination to strike back that FDR possessed in the black hours and weeks that followed the attack. The nurses, too, find their `finest hour,' after weeks of giving shots and meeting soldiers and sailors on the beach. Amidst flying glass, screams of the dying and gushing blood, Evelyn and her crew show that men weren't the only heroes of the day.<br/><br/>Yet I don't think war was glorified or sanitized here. In fact, the special affects, attention to historical detail and some new, brave looks at death and disaster may have given `Pearl Harbor' a leg up on many war films. As torpedoes and bomb hit, ships blow up and sink. Men burn; men bleed; men drown. Zeroes strafe the water for survivors; Zeroes strafe the hospital; Zeroes strafe the pilots racing to their waiting planes. I'm sure on the wide screen a fireman would be out of his seat more than once, as flaming plane fuselages and other debris fly right past the camera.<br/><br/>
Director Michael Bay does not shy away from the hellish aspect of war. The U.S. Navy was caught flat-footed and, even in times of preparation, men die gruesome deaths in battle. With `an entire navy at anchor,' in FDR's stunned words, the results are worse. We see men drown; we see men trapped inside sunken ships who will not get out; we see hideously burned patients in delirium as gallant clergymen try to give a last bit of comfort. Bay should be commended for balancing all of the components of the film and coming up with a cohesive and satisfying whole. My only complaint with the video is that the subtitles for the Japanese dialogue are MUCH too small to read on the small screen. (I had to put on my reading glasses and sit in front of the TV like I would my computer, to read them.) Still, that beats having Borris Badenov's voice come out of Admiral Yamamoto's mouth, as it did in `Midway!'<br/><br/>True, the Battle of Pearl Harbor and the subsequent Doolittle Raid were dramatic enough that they needed no fictitious love triangle to sell the story. With Hollywood, though, one takes what one can get. What you GET from this film are some spectacular and very accurate battle scenes from angles never before attempted, some earthy, brave portrayals of the agony and hellishness of war, and strong performances by the main characters. I would call `Pearl Harbor' a real winner."

","Imagine you've wanted to taste a new candy bar for about a year now. You've seen commercials on TV touting how good the candy bar tastes, and it sure looked great from what they showed.  You wait an entire year for this new candy bar, reading all about it online, in magazines, in newspapers.  You finally go to the store the day it comes out, you pay good money for it, and guess what, it tastes like sh**.<br/><br/>That is my experience with Pearl Harbor.  Never have I been so duped into wasting ten bucks.  The Pearl Harbor trailers gleamed with stunning scenes of war and emotion and tumultuous music (by Hans Zimmer, a self-stolen score from The Thin Red Line), and it ended up being the sappiest love story ever told with a half-hour of mind-numbing, seemingly pointless, sensationalistic violence.  Titanic seemed more historically accurate.  Titanic had a better screenplay.  And Titanic had better acting.  And Titanic is absolutely hands down the most overrated movie of the 90's, a corporate boob of pop culture's incessant urge to see pretty people say stupid but pretty things.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor is the same, only ten times worse.  The actors are like shiny dolls, not war heroes.  The direction is choppy during the violence, to give us a sense of desparation and confusion, but instead it gives us a sense of boredom and disgust.  Bodies falling everywhere may be historically accurate.  But Pearl Harbor doesn't take the time to make us care about the main characters, let alone the falling bodies.<br/><br/>This movie is an insult to veterans.  This movie is an insult to African Americans, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should be ashamed for taking the sloppiest representation of a token black male in cinema history.  This movie is an insult to film buffs, who have watched good war movies for decades.  This movie is an insult to humanity.  You'd spend your time better shoving the popcorn up your butt."
"pgoodall","Null","0","1","21 January 2002"," A missed opportunity
","To sum up Pearl Harbor, i will say that Titanic has been blended quite well with Armageddon. With this combination in mind, you can get a good idea how Pearl Harbor turned out. While trying to remain faithful to the history books and to attempt a stab at humanity over the loss of so many lives, producer Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have again gone for the glossy hollywood approach as well as the tried and tested slow-motion money shots and the stupid sequence which always occurs in their films - the bit where the heroes walk in slow-motion towards the camera. Why does Bay do this all the time? Are we meant to be wowed by this? Me thinks not. Pearl Harbor misses out on bucketfuls of heart in place of empty-headed, hollow-looking action, and makes the fatal error of trying to make its audience care more about three sad losers trapped in a love triangle than the lives of thousands of people who DID live and die on that fateful day in history. Admittedly, the battle is effective, but once FDR has made his little speech, the film changes reels completely in a awkwardly tacked on final hour when the inevitable death scene occurs to make the women cry and the men groan. Cue another slow motion scene of mawkishness and the obligatory pop tune as the credits roll. In short, a typical hollywood blockbuster messing up the history books. When will they ever learn? 6/10"

At the same time, it was not graphic enough to upset sensitive viewers.<br/><br/>I believed the portrayal of Evelyn Johnson, the nurse.  She was clearly a competent, mature person, especially in comparison to her fellow nurses. Evelyn was equally hard to believe in her portrayal as a girlfriend.  Both Rafe and Danny were ""out of her league,"" and she would not have either fallen in love with them or allowed herself to get pregnant.  The premarital sex appeared to be out of her character and more importantly out of step with the times.<br/><br/>It was hard to believe that Rafe and Danny would be alive after their plane crashes.  The fate of both Rafe and Danny was obvious long before the conclusion. <br/><br/>Despite the criticism about the botched love story, it was a movie that I enjoyed very much.  And enjoyment and the ability to get absorbed into it is the bottom line.  Score it an 8 out of 10."

This Movie was made by Americans about an American tragedy and this movie shows an almost completely accurate tale of what happened those 2 days.  A Must see for any Action Fan.

","This movie was brought up as a Summer movie. That is what I think hurt this movie. If this movie was made to get an R rating I think it would have been much better, but it was made for the wrong audience which hurt its' significance. If a more historical aspect was put into it, it might have been a better film. That said, it was still very entertaining. The love triangle subplot was a good plot to set up the attack on pearl harbor, but the historical information should have had a bigger role for the set up for the attack. The acting is really great in the film and has very entertaining characters which make us care about them. When the action starts it's incredible. ALl the explosions, all the pump up lines, make any guy excited when watching this film. The recreation of the attack is perfectly set up but the whole pump up lines that the characters say when there about to fight back ruin the dramatic affect of the film because it makes it too much fun to watch. In my opinion Michael Bay should not have directed this picture. A more experienced director like Ridley Scott or James Cameron should have made this because they would have done more justice to the attack and it might have garnered some big time awards. Overall it was a good job by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer, who tired their best in making a big time epic but failed unfortunately."

","For me, this film is hard to review.  Not that I can't do it, but I am a real history idiot.  I went into this film barely knowing anything about what happened at Pearl Harbor.  Yeah, I know I learned about all of it in History class in High School, but I never retained anything! The movie itself is extremely powerful.  The camera work, scenery, acting, special effects, and everying were phenomenal.  It is apparent a great deal of money was spent on this film.  <br/><br/>My big problem, however, is the same that I had with Titanic.  They (Hollywood) takes a Dramatic tragedy, and turns it into a love story.  Or, more so, they center the tragedy around this elaborate, soap opera style love story. <br/><br/>The first hour, however, did a have good build up.  The story moved well, and we really got a feel for our characters and the emotions they inevitably faced.  The 2nd hour was mind-blowing and gut wrenching.  To have the over abundance of reality splashed on the screen.  Now, I have never been in a war, I'm not old enough to have been alive during Pearl Harbor; but what depth was spent making that horrific scene.  Too much reality to take...War is simply evil. 9/11/01 is a perfect example of this.  However, we are the sleeping giant, and We will not be defeated..Sorry, rant over...<br/><br/>The end of the movie...to me was extremely rushed!  It seemed like they wanted to (SPOILER) kill Danny off, and get Affleck and Beckinsale together. Well, if one did not predict the outcome of the film...well, it wasn't like they made it impossible to figure out.<br/><br/>Now, I have been impressed with Josh Hartnett since he got onto screen with Halloween: H20.  He should have been nominated for something for the role he played in this film.  As far as I am concerned, he totally upstaged every other actor in this film.  His All-American look really fit into this film, and his acting was at his best.  I am looking forward to seeing Black Hawk Down.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was phenomenal.  Though flawed it getting the real point of the tragedy of Pearl Harbor out in the open.  3 hours and 23 minutes was a little too long to get this story told.  The love triangle was predictable and complicated.  Too complicated to be put in a movie with such a big plate to fill.  Telling the story of Pearl Harbor, as will Titanic, should have focused more on the lives and times of the people of the day...more a big-budget docu-drama feel.  Not a love story...<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"

","The first hour of this war epic is enough to make most intelligent people turn off in disgust. The script is hilariously bad, the characters are wooden and unbelievable while director Michael Bay's irritating habit of letting few scenes last longer than a second, intercutting every other scene with a crane shot gets on the nerves. <br/><br/>Randall Wallace's dialogue seems to have been inspired by war comics where chracters shout: Aiieeee! when the die. The British come across is incompetent without the aid of good old Ben Affleck while the Japanese only ever say crucial dialogue such as: We have enough information...<br/><br/>Everything is spelled out for the lowest common denominator which is a real shame as technically this is a fantastic movie. Great lighting and sets, costumes by Michael Kaplan and the hilarious habit that characters have of standing in front of design classics. Blood transfusions are even carried out with the aid of classic Coke bottles.

The movie starts off quite boring, where you are just waiting for the action to start because of the poorly written dialogue and artificial 'emotional' moments.

","Since there were 1161 comments before mine, I'm pretty sure they've covered most of the good, the bad, and the ugly of this movie.  Especially, that it is most certainly ""Titanic 2"" in many respects.  Historical & technical problems abound. . .but there are some decent points.  The much maligned love story is decent at times, and sometimes they do capture the 1940's atmosphere fairly well.  The music is good, although I did get tired of those same three notes after the 473rd shot of people drowning or otherwise suffering (Titanic-style). My main gripe with this movie is its inaccurate portrayal of 1940's sex mores.  I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this scene, but it's an early one where all the nurses are chatting and one says ""Sure, I'm here to do my duty to my country. . .and about 20 guys."" Call me crazy, but I can't see a woman in that era making that very 80's/90's/00's sexual proclamation. All right, maybe I could believe that a girl would say that. However, I do not believe that all the other nurses would giggle and laugh in agreement. At least some would be shocked and appalled.

Remembrance-To all the people that put their life on the line to save our country. Many people say that it was dull and too much love, but I don't think that people actually got the message that the movie was supposed to be. It wasn't just all about the love story. I think this movie is right up there with Titanic. They both gave a message. Many people died because of other peoples actions.I mean the love story added everything. It brought the movie together.

","The only thing the 2 main characters didn't do in this flick is fly the Enola Gay to Hiroshima.  Not only did they end up being the only 2 pilots to get off the ground on Dec. 7th, 1941, but they also became ""BOMBER"" pilots in the Doolittle raid, which would have been an insult to a real fighter pilot because bomber pilots were generally not the ""first line"" airmen fighter jocks were.  Not to mention that these 2 bozo's also found time to help rescue men on ships, when they would have been too busy preparing for expected further attacks by the Japanese.  If you somehow got emotional from this film, and now ""understand"" why Pearl Harbor is important to history, I suggest you need to read more and watch less.  <br/><br/>American's won't ever forget Pearl Harbour because they considered the attack a sneaky way to start a war.  But when America does it's own ""pre-emptive Strike"" to start an engagement, that's somehow completely acceptable.<br/><br/>World War II America considered the Japanese inferior as a people, and inferior militarily.  It was good old fashioned prejudice. That was why the attack worked out as well as it did for Japan.  The U.S. didn't ""know it's enemy"" at all, because they kept lying to themselves about their supposed invulnerability.  Just as the Japanese military lied to itself about their strengths in sustaining a long-term war.  <br/><br/>That's the one thing you won't see in this movie, nor any movie that comes out of Hollywood.

","I was born quite a few years after December 7th, 1941, but had I survived the attack on Pearl Harbor and then watched this movie today, I would probably react with a mixture of disgust and despair.  Then again, maybe I would have only been as bored as I was without the benefit of experience. ""Pearl Harbor"" is a movie that uses World War II as a backdrop for a love story of astonishing banality that contributes to one of the most witless experiences I've had.<br/><br/>The movie is three hours long, but it would have seemed long at two.  Hell, it would have seemed long at 45 minutes, which is the length of time at the center of the movie that is focused on the attack itself.  ""The day that will live in infamy"" still evokes strong emotions from those who lived through it, but from the movie's perspective it did little but provide a set piece for an action movie.  The special effects by Michael Bay are impressive, indeed; we see Japanese fighter planes divebombing the ships in harbor, flying between them at high speed, while those on the ground flee in fear or shoot from the decks.  Most of this is pitched at the level of a video game, especially when the two heroes, Danny and Rafe, climb into their own planes and proceed to start shooting down every enemy plane they can. Unlike Spielberg's earlier ""Saving Private Ryan"" which had convincing footage of the landing at Normandy but also a moral context, ""Pearl Harbor"" is completely lacking in insight.  Instead, the attack becomes nothing but appalling visions of slaughter for benefit of entertainment.<br/><br/>The dialog in the movie is truly amazing, but not for it's good qualities. Take Evelyn's consolation to Rafe, whom she loves, as she explains her motives: ""My heart belongs to Danny, but I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you.""  Thanks a whole lot.  Of course, that's after Jon Voight has woodenly tried to portray President Roosevelt standing up defiantly from his wheelchair after being told by his cabinet that a military assault on Japan is impractical, and stating, ""Gentlemen, do not tell me what cannot be done!""  As I understand it, history does record him saying something to this effect, but I doubt it came across as lamely as it does in this movie.<br/><br/>The Japanese are given the ""hindsight is 20-20"" treatment:  Admiral Yamamoto, who orchestrated the attack, muses anxiously that ""I fear that all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant.""  They act as if seeming unlikely to have attacked, had they not been called upon to do so in service of the plot.  It's as if the filmmakers were afraid of seeming callous if they depicted the Japanese as actually having Imperialism as a motive.  The Japanese continue to make movies about Hiroshima and Nagasaki without sympathy for the American perspective and justifiably so: it was a defining moment for them, just as Pearl Harbor was a defining moment for Americans. I cannot recall a film about the Enola Gay in which Truman is heard to say ""I fear all we have done is unleashed an apocalypse on an unsuspecting city.""<br/><br/>The movie pays token respect to African-Americans with its depiction of Dorie Miller, the black cook aboard one of the carriers who grabs the controls of an anti-aircraft gun during the attack and shoots down several enemy planes.  Curiously, despite the location being Hawaii, I did not notice a single person of Polynesian descent during the entire movie.<br/><br/>Nothing about the movie offers up any historical perspective on the events that take place.  I attended the film with a friend who afterward defended it as a ""popcorn movie"".  To describe this movie about the tragic loss of three thousand lives in the same terms as those used by critics in referring to ""The Mummy Returns"" is no less depressing for its accuracy."

"cutter-12","6","0","1","9 January 2002"," Fails miserably as a historical epic but...
","Maybe it's just my love of WW2 aircraft and uniforms but I found this movie to be not as bad as many people have said.  Sure, it IS a terrible failure in it's attempt to be a love story as well as a historical recreation of Pearl Harbor, drafting in both Yamamoto and Roosevelt as supporting characters among other things.  One is reminded of that dreadful TV Mini-series from the early 80's ""The Winds of War"" in its incompatible and grandiloquent narrative.  The central love story though is actually not that bad and, like From Here to Eternity, it could have succeeded on its own merit of light-tragic drama with a minimum of expensive explosions and, at times, completely incredulous aerial combat sequences.<br/><br/>Less is more and this film just goes for more more more, ultimately making it just another summer action blockbuster with little or no historical relevance aside from it's 40's look and feel.  A shame too, because if Bruckheimer and Bay weren't looking between every line for a mindless adrenaline rush this could have been a poignant tribute to the WW2 fighter pilot and Navy Nurse. Instead we get huge helpings of noise and action thrown at us, some of which is very realistic and fitting, some of which is as cheesy as any Star Wars dogfight over the deathstar, making you cringe at its phoniness.  When the dogfight and B-25 scenes are good they're very good.  But when they slip into unreal comic-book heroics they go way over the top.<br/><br/>On the ground floor this film is a slap in the face to every Pearl Harbor veteran wishing their story might have been told in the vein of Private Ryan or Yanks.  But at times, as a romantic drama, it is very thoughtful and human, with some great buddy interaction between the flyboys and some down to earth sequences. Then it skews off into another movie with Roosevelt (Jon Voight has dreadful lines) and the Japanese Naval command, Admiral Kimmel, Doolittle, and so on. And of course this isn't helped by the insistence on embellished action. Even setting this story at Pearl Harbor was a big mistake.  The writer should have realized it after the first draft and set it in a more low-key WW2 locale.  The story of two pilots is not suited to Pearl Harbor where barely an American fighter got off the ground that day. And then the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo? If one of the men had been a sailor assigned to the Arizona and the other a pilot maybe there would have been more believability and logic to the storyline.  <br/><br/>The title reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor, at 35 minutes or so, is just an exploitive money sequence and has really nothing to do with the plot.  It does not even remotely feel realistic and captures none of the imagery we have seen for years in documentary footage which should have been a reference point.<br/><br/>Overall, visually sumptuous and mostly well acted, Pearl Harbor has many redeeming qualities undone by its many excesses. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still, not as bad as the reviews.<br/><br/>

I pay the same to see any movie so I don't really care what it cost to make. I would rather see more thoughtful films with realistic dialogue, but, as it stands, Pearl Harbor does what it sets out to do. The history might be a little warped, but then again, I'm sure Braveheart was even worse on that score.<br/><br/>Worth watching. 7/10"

I was stationed in Hawaii and enjoyed seeing the places I used to walk (Palm Circle, for one).  I loved both Ben and Josh and would hate to have to make a choice between the two.  I have to admit, though, that the love scene between Josh and Kate in the parachutes made my knees weak.

"FlickJunkie-2","6","0","2","21 December 2001"," Another puff piece from the master of puff
","Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.<br/><br/>The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.  Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission.  But such nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the '40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all.  Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.<br/><br/>Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.<br/><br/>The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic than had one actually been there.<br/><br/>The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.<br/><br/>Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.<br/><br/>I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I despise Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).<br/><br/>Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.  Thanks Jerry."

","As I browse through IMDB (best movie site ever), I notice not a lot of people find this movie very favourable. The story sucks; laughable characters; overlong and boring. And 'Titanic' won best picture. Sure, the resemblance to 'Titanic' is strong throughout, but I believe it surpasses it. James Cameron and Micheal Bay are two minds that think alike. Can't develop characters very well but they sure can develop destruction scenes very very well. Yes, in 'Pearl Harbor' the love story is pretty bad, but arn't all Hollywood love story's bad?. I believe foreign films potray them best. But if there is one thing that Hollywood can do well, it's blowing up stuff real good. 'Pearl Harbor' has, in my opinion, one of the most spectacular action sequences ever comitted to film. It sure beats 'Titanic's sinking ship. So yes, I do recommend this film. One more thing... why is 'The Lord of the Rings' holding the top spot on the IMDB scale?."

","SPOILERS ALERT Pearl Harbour is the best film since Titanic. It is 3 hours long maybe a little longer, but in the first hour it lets you meet the characters in it. Theres Refe who is the father figure too Danny. Danny who is the person in the film who has a lot of feelings and he doesnt want his best friend to get hurt as he plays a bigger part of a pilot. Then theres the gorgeous Evelyn played by (Kate Beckinsale) who plays the women who is a nurse and she went out with refe some time back, and she happened to meet up with him again. In the second hour it shows you the complete bombing off Pearl Harbour and how terrible it was. In the third hour it showed you scenes like Danny getting killed. The funniest part i thought was when the pilots had to learn to fly off the edge of the boat, every time one person done it there would be an applause. I disliked the fact that the scenes off the bombing all happened at once which was a disappointment. this is truly a fabulous film because Kate Beckinsale plays the best parts, and she does it so well.

","I absolutely loved this movie! I thought the cast did a great job, but my favorite was Josh Hartnett. I thought Ben Affleck's character, Rafe, acted unfairly toward Danny after he showed up alive. Did he expect Evelyn to mourn his loss forever and never move on with her life? It's not every day someone you love comes back after being presumed dead. I found myself totally glued to the screen during the movie, but especially during the attack scenes, they were amazing. Usually I can't sit through war scenes because I get too squeamish. I don't cry at many movies, but I cried a lot at this one, especially during the last two scenes. I thought it could have focused a little more on the attacks, etc, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I personally enjoyed it better than Titanic."
"Mystery-Tramp","7","0","2","23 December 2001"," Fairly well done
","When PH came out, I thought I read somewhere about the differences between it and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Funny, but the stories mesh fairly well. Both include the African-American cook who heroically climbs into an anti-aircraft gun to defend his shipmates (in PH he's a central character; in TTT he's just a few seconds of film). Both focus on the bomb that sank the Arizona. Both focus on what the U.S. might have known in advance of the attack.<br/><br/>TTT has a more documentary feel, and as such, its information seems more reliable. PH has much greater visuals.<br/><br/>And PH tries to graft a love story onto history. I thought James Cameron pulled it off well in Titanic. Here, the love story seems out of place. In Titanic, the DeCaprio-Winslet tryst was functional to the plot -- it led the viewer to all parts of the mighty ship. The PH love triangle does little more than add a little spice to what would otherwise be a heckuva film. Or maybe without the triangle, the movie becomes TTT.<br/><br/>But what I think PH does better than TTT is in visualizing the heroism of the soldiers, sailors and nurses who were under attack. You can't walk away from Pearl Harbor without a deep, abiding respect for the men and women of World War II."

When I go to the movies, I dont go and criticize the poor script writing or lame cinematography. It's either I like the movie or dont. In my opinion Pearl Harbor is one of the best WWII movies ever made. The scenes were done really good. Michael Bay did such a good job on this movie. The music really moved me. I have no clue why critics put down this movie. I didnt think it was too long. Saving Private Ryan was long and so was Braveheart but no one complained about those movies. And so what if there was a love story. Dont get me wrong I loved Braveheart, and Saving Private Ryan are really good movies. The acting was really good too. I dont know why everyone is putting down this movie. But in my opinion I think you'll like the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes war movies or is patriotic to our country.

","No, it's not a great film, but it's a lot better than some would have you believe. Essentially, it's a 1940's style war film. This means patriotic verbal expressions and images, and a less than obsessive sense of historical accuracy. But (despite the marketing) that isn't the film's point. It's a romantic fantasy and a very good one at that. If you expect more from it, then you'll be disappointed in it. But I don't think this is a fault with the film. It's the fault of the expectations we bring to it, and a brow-beating marketing campaign. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to ""From Here to Eternity."" It's in that genre of films.  While not a great film, it is certainly a good, entertaining one. And for a long movie (183 minutes), it flies by very quickly."
"grahamsj3","7","0","1","15 December 2001"," Not as good as it should have been
","Read my lips - too dang long! The story is weakened mainly because of the length. It would have been much more intense had it been shorter. The acting is for the most part good, although I thought Alex Baldwin was asleep at the wheel as Jimmy Doolittle. This is countered by strong performances from Kate Beckinsale, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck and a truly outstanding job by Jon Voight as President Roosevelt. The ships used in the film were all wrong, with the aircraft carriers having angled flight decks, which were not developed until after the war (and then by the British). In addition, none of the Japanese carriers which took part in the Pearl Harbor raid had large portside island structures, which the ones in the film had. The ships shown at Pearl Harbor before the raid included modern US Navy Perry-class frigates. They should have used models for reality! But overall, the film tried to encompass too much of the war. It could have been a much more powerful film if they'd ended it as Roosevelt was declaring war. But they had to keep going and went way too far. The entire second half of the film occurred several months after the Pearl Harbor attack and therefore didn't belong in this film at all."

","For those of you scared of PEARL HARBOR because of the possible TITANIC and ARMAGEDDON syndrome - well, you have every right to be.<br/><br/>The CGI effects in the movie are stunning and the Japanese are portrayed pretty fairly as a country that felt like they had no choice.<br/><br/>For the most part, it does no harm to watch the movie.  Seeing Ben Affleck in another movie like this, rehashing the same character from Armageddon, gets a bit tedious.  Josh Harnett, as Affleck's bosom buddy, brings no real presence to the screen but dead pans his role well as a contrast.  Kate Beckinsale, however, as the love interest, presents a relatively interesting character but has most of her screen time during the full half of the movie that is a tedious bore.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie is the FX and the flying/dog fight/bombing scenes.  I do not usually like straight up action in a movie that claims to be more, but that is the best quality of this film and saves if from a 2 or 3 rating to that of a 5 or so.<br/><br/>If you have three hours to spare (I suggest renting the DVD Widescreen), then it will not hurt to sit down and take a look at this movie.  The first 90 minutes will frustrate and bore you, but the last half is at least worth watching.<br/><br/>If you find yourself yearning for a long war movie that is time well spent, I would suggest DAS BOOT or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.<br/><br/>**This movie is reviewed as a film and NOT as to the importance of the events portrayed.<br/><br/>6/10 - Watchable"

From then on till the end of the film I was pleasently surprised ! The attack on PH is perfect cinematographically and the following events right up till the end of the film fine. What is missing is a strong love story like there was in Titanic which complemented the impending disaster ! Here the love story seems less intense but I reserve my judgement on this matter having fallen  asleep for an hour !! I 'll have to watch from the beginning again. But the aerial combats and bombing scenes are second to none as are the sound quality and beautiful music from the soundtrack. Apart from that I was pretty sure well before the end how the film would turn out and it happened exactly as had imagined = predicable end.

","Pearl Harbor IS a good movie. The only problem was, i was looking forward to a movie about WW 2; I was NOT looking for a love story set in D-Day. The effects was awesome, but the movie would have been better if it had focused on Rafe and Danny's fight in the war, not their love life.<br/><br/>Affleck is a brilliant actor, and he shows depth for his portrayal of Rafe McCrawley. You just can't help but feel sorry for him for all the things he went through. You can't help but love him for being a loyal friend. Hartnett is a charismatic and talented young actor. He certainly gave a believable performance. You want to hate him (because he stole Rafe's girl), but you just can't (that's what i call charisma, baby!). Instead, you feel a trite sorry for him because you know he didn't plan on things to turn out this way. Beckinsale ,as Evelyn, gave a great performance. The girl in which both young men fell for. She was credible as a tortured soul, torn between two lovers. I also have to commend Alec Baldwin. When you watch him as he leads the men to battle, you feel inspired and heartened that there IS hope for vengeance... that America WILL win the war. Hmm... let me see, great acting, great script, great effects. The only thing that got me down was the misleading title. I said it before, and I'll say it again: I was looking forward to a war flick.... not a love story set in WWII! Anyway, when you think about it, it IS a war flick with a too much heart and sensitivity. I give this movie 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>PS. Does Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have to do everything exactly the same?!?! When they're not acting together in the same films, their individual projects are somehow similar.

","I feel sorry for whoever disrespected this movie.  I may admit that the love plot that was entwined may have been a bit cheesy and/or badly played but it wasn't just something to interest the viewers.  I believe that you people who decided to just rip this movie to shreads need to sit back and look at the bigger picture.  Everything in this movie had a point to it, even the first hour and a half that you deemed irrelevent.  It is a story, one of many, that can be told from this day.  It's a story of a random few that were involved in Pearl Harbor.  It may or may not be true who knows, but I garentee you this; there are more stories there than you think.  This is a story of what a group of people went through during this time and leading up to and following.  It's just a small far fetch of what a few people may have went through, and believe me, this is a glorified story at that.  Most people who have went through this and lived or that have been effected by this tragedy may tell a much different and very much more tragic story of their experience.  The scenes in this movie depict a viewer friendly, the hero wins type of approach.  In reality not all of the heros lived.  Maybe you should sit down with someone who has went through a war and watch this movie with them, and maybe then you will get a true feel for what this movie is all about and what it was made for.  If they will tell, just ask them how many of the things in this movie were true, ask them how many friends they saw die, ask them how many lovers they saw widowed, and ask them what the movie didn't show, the things that the movie couldn't cover in your supposed 3 hour waste of time.  This movie was great.  My final opinion.  Think about it."

","5/10 For the awesome bombing scenes and the detail to actual history.  Ben Affleck hands in a reasonable performance as the dare-devil pilot who always manages to save the day (not Dec 7, 1941 unfortunutely).  Superb FDR by Jon Voight - only wished more of his characterization made it into the film. Cuba Gooding, Jr and Alec Baldwin perfectly cast and also wished additional footage.<br/><br/>Josh Hartnett is too pretty to be a man and it takes from his character.  He is not believable as the dare-devil pilot wanna be.  This may not be his fault as the overall writing is fair to average and the inside plot of the triangle love affair is somewhat sit-com and poorly presented. Kate Beckinsale also works with poor dialogue and does her best as the woman caught between two men.<br/><br/>However, the overall film gets a special boost and is timely considering the other date that will live in infamy - September 11th.  Pearl Harbor stimulates our patriotism in these troubled times and provides the needed justice we currently seek.  I would rarely join a movie with current events but I urge everybody to experience this film with USA in their hearts and I think you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>Thank-God no sequel exists for this film."
"Disco Inferno","Null","0","1","9 December 2001"," Better than you'd expect
","Of all the popcorn movies of 2001, this one was probably one of the best. I have not watched any previous films that depict Pearl Harbour so I have no basis of comparison or bias.  If you want a film that is supposed to be historically accurate, you probably will be disappointed.  However, one usually goes to watch this type of movie for entertainment and not for historical significance.  If that is the case, you'd be better off watching the Discovery Channel instead.<br/><br/>This is probably Jerry Bruckheimer' best work.  I usually don't like much of his movies since most of his work is ususally over the top with nothing but mindless explosions and one dimensional characters.  If you are an action fan who has seen so much of this genre that big explosions are no longer enough to sustain your interest, but also need a good story and characters to make it worthwhile, then this movie is it.  Surprisingly, this isn't the same drab that Bruckheimer has been mass producing the past 5 years.  The characters are actually people that you care about, but I agree with the general consensus that the first hour was a little too long for character development.  Also the nurse falling for the other guys's friend was just too typical and not very beleivable.  The character development is not exactly original and probably has been done serveral times, but it works. However, if it is action you want, you won't be disappointed either.  The attack on the harbour and the dog fight scenes are probably nothing I have seen in any other movie (however, i did have a little bit of Star Wars deja vu, especially when one of the protagonists was trying to shake off an enemy plane).  The special effects and people falling off the ships are reminiscent of Titanic.  However, the characters are not as appealing as Titanic, and where that movie was equally strong in characterization and action, Pearl Harbour would not be so good if not for the action in the latter half of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, if you aren't looking for any historical realism but enjoy an action movie with a love story thrown in, then you'll probably enjoy this trip back into time.  The fact that it is also the 60th anniversary of the event might also make this movie a little more enjoyable."

","Pearl Harbor was easily one of the most anticipated films of the summer.It disappointed most critics, as well as most viewers. And after finally getting to see the film, I can understand why. Before I get to the review, let me just say that I think this film had a little more impact on me because of the events of September 11 (And also that I watched it today, on the day the Pearl Harbor was attacked).<br/><br/>The first hour of Pearl Harbor is terrible, and just so boring (Surprisingly, I think the only thing that kept me watching, was seeing the star of my favorite television show, ""Alias,"" Jennifer Garner). I was laughing at the love story, and I don't think I was supposed to be. It is so underdeveloped, that I didn't care about the relationship between the two characters at all. I mean one second she's sticking needles up his ass, and the next there dancing together, and acting like newlyweds. Did I miss something? Also, the romance is just not romantic, which is also partly due to the fact that the characters aren't developed in the slightest bit. Who cares about a relationship, when you know close to nothing about the characters in love? Another problem with the first hour or so of the film, is that it seemed to attempt to add some comedy to the mix. And the comedy just wasn't funny. I thought that at times, the film seemed more like a parody of war films, than an actual war film.<br/><br/>Throughout the horrid first part, I sat and prayed that the attack scene would come. And when it finally did, I was not disappointed. The scene was perfect. It actually had some emotion in it (Although I don't think I cared for the characters - the scene reminded me that this actually happened, that thousands of people died. And it also reminded me of the thousands who died on September 11. And that got me sad, and upset). I got into the film for the 40 minutes, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time (However one part of the attack scene seemed to come straight out of Titanic, and that bothered me). I also loved Jon Voight's performance as President FDR - It was right on the money. Was it just me, or did the second part of the film seem like a completely different film - a much, much, much better film. However the ending goes downhill. I didn't feel they gave us enough of the war storyline. The fight scenes seem to end, because something happens to affect the love story, not because the war is over. I think it should have dropped most of the first hour, and used the extra time to expand on the war.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the stars did fine, but nothing extraordinary. Josh Hartnett was my least favorite actor in the film. I didn't think he did the best he could for some reason. Something was missing from his performance. Ben Affleck did fine, but I also thought something was missing from his performance. I did, however, like Kate Beckinsale's performance. Alec Baldwin was annoying in his role. But that is thanks to the cheesy dialogue provided by the script. As I already mentioned Jon Voight was great, and stole the scenes he was in. Cuba Gooding Jr. was decent in his small role (I would have loved to learn more about his character). Now let me take a little time to criticize the laughably bad dialogue. My favorite line came from Ben Affleck, while writing a letter to Evelyn. He said something along the lines of: ""It's cold here. But there's one place I know I can go to keep warm. That is to think of you."" That line had me laughing the whole night. Does it get any worse than that. Alec Baldwin also had some unintentionally hysterical lines.<br/><br/>Overall Pearl Harbor is a disappointment. It fails as a romance, and fails as a war film. However, the attack scene was fantastic! Like I said before, it was perfect. Had that scene not been so well made, this film would be crap on a stick. I also think the film would have benefited from an R rating, and a shorter running time. Cut out the love story, add some more of the war in the film, and we would have had a great, great war film. I know that I will not be recommending Pearl Harbor to many people.<br/><br/>Pearl Harbor: 5/10"

","After seeing so many bad reviews for this movie, I hesitated renting it. Fortunately, one of my 99 cents rental places got it, so I took the chance. Well, I must say I really enjoyed it.  It was very similar (in style) to Titanic, but much better.  Yes, the plot was a bit hackneyed and soapy, but that's the way many, many war movies have been made.  So you just know what to expect and sit back and ride it.  Usually, I don't like Bruckheimer so much ;he'll all special effects and nothing else.  But, this time I really enjoyed it.  BTW, I also enjoyed Armageddon as well, so maybe this tells us something.  I didn't mind the length since the action was pretty constant. The (over) 30 minute sequence on the actually Dec. 7th event was fabulous."

"bsmith5552","7","0","2","8 December 2001"," Frighteningly Realistic Depiction of the Attack on Pearl Harbor
","""Pearl Harbor"" re-creates the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The battle scenes using convincing miniatures, blended in with the latest in state of the art computer animation, give us a frighteningly realistic depiction of the that attack. The effects are so convincing that you believe that you are watching the real thing.<br/><br/> But Hollywood makes the same mistake it made with that other epic, ""Titanic"" (1997)..it tacks on yet another syrupy love story. This time there is a love triangle involving Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett as gung ho pilots and Kate Beckinsale as a nurse. As in all love triangles with a war theme, you know that one of the principals will pay the ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>
 The love story dominates the first hour of the film and drags on far too long. Once the attack begins we are treated to some of the most realistic battle scenes ever put on the screen. We are also made to feel the pain of the men and women who sacrificed their lives that day.<br/><br/> The leads are OK however, the film would not have suffered too much had the love story been minimized. There also is a long list of familiar faces in small cameo type roles. Cuba Gooding Jr. stands out as the first black man to win the Navy Cross, Jon Voight does a good FDR, Mako is the Japanese Commander, Alec Baldwin plays the a pilot commander and Dan Aykroyd and Scott Miller turn up in other roles.<br/><br/> All in all ""Pearl Harbor"" gets a passing mark based on its awesome battle scenes, but looses points for the over-long love story. Imagine the film that could have been had they filmed the attack around a story such as ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953)."
"dee.reid","8","0","1","7 December 2001"," I think there's a slight disagreement here...
","because I myself found ""Pearl Harbor"" to be quite entertaining.  I'll admit that the first half of the movie is kind of slow and boring, but it gets better around the final twenty minutes leading up to the attack.  The actual attack was easily the best part of the movie.  It was amazingly shot and pulled off.  The love story I feel although it seriously messed up the movie in some spots, was necessary for the overall impact of the film.  The dialogue is kind of stupid too with lines like ""I'm not anxious to die, just anxious to matter"", but I won't hold that against the movie.  I do agree with one previous comment about Michael Bay not being the right director for a movie about one of the biggest events of the 20th century.  That should have been done by either Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann, preferably Michael Mann.  I can't comment on the historical accuracy of the film since world history isn't one of my majors.  The ending was kind of stupid too now that I think about it.  One last thing, didn't Michael Bay do a film with a love story like the one in ""Pearl Harbor"" three years ago?  I believe it was called ""Armageddon"".  <br/><br/>Overall despite some of the film's stupidity and some serious bashings by critics, ""Pearl Harbor"" is still a good film to watch and you'll probably see it at the Oscars next year.<br/><br/>8/10"
"runner-15","9","0","1","6 December 2001"," How Sad
","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>Yes that is my comment, but it is not a comment on Pear Harbor. It is a comment on the people who rip this movie to shreds.  How sad it is that many people have forgot that real people with real lives, real loves, real hopes, and real dreams fought and gave their life for them. I know this is a forum for reviewing movies and not a forum of debate. However after watching Pearl Harbor on DVD on a Big Screen TV last night with a good sound system all I can say is WOW! This has to be one of the great movies of recent memory, MUCH better in my opinion than Harry Potter could ever hope to be.<br/><br/>So why is it so maligned by many of the posters here? Normally this might be considered attempting to start a debate but I feel that I am addressing real issues that have been brought up again and again by past posters in this forum.<br/><br/>It's not historically accurate. HUH???   Please could someone point out one major historical inaccuracy. I consider myself to quite the history buff and can find no major inaccuracies in this movie. Omissions don't count as it is impossible to show every detail of an event on the big screen and not leave parts out. An omission is not an inaccuracy unless it changes the context of fact. Mr. Bay consulted closely with many people who were actually there and had their input and the input of many historians. My suggestion to those of you who believe this movie was inaccurate is, perhaps you should reexamine your knowledge of history from a more objective viewpoint.<br/><br/>The love story was not important. The love story was the movie. This was not Pearl Harbor with the love story as a backdrop, this was a love story with Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid as a backdrop. War is about people. When you forget the people you forget the essence of what we fight and die for. Real people real lives, people loved people were separated people died and families and hearts were broken, that is war. War is not just one country fighting another country, for every person who dies in battle there is a story, a life and family. This movie was about those people. <br/><br/>The love triangle was not believable. Another HUH??? This is a very believable situation. Often times a person who loses someone will turn to someone that is already close to both of them. I have seen this happen in real life. They both thought Rafe was dead. What is it more likely for Danny and Evelyn to do, forget each other or turn to each other?<br/><br/>The special effects were poor. Once again HUH??? These were some of the best effects I have ever saw in a war movie.  The producers went to extremes to make the effects look real, even so far as actually loading real B-25 bombers onto a real aircraft carrier and recreating the start of the Doolittle Raid. This had never been done since the real Doolittle raid nearly sixty years ago.  Many of the shots include REAL aircraft and ships with CGI being used to only fill in the background. I believe some people have been watching  special effects so long they don't know real when they see it.<br/><br/>In closing I say I loved this movie, and to those who hate this move, please watch it again with a open mind expecting a story of people and not a story of war.<br/><br/>There was four of us who watched this movie last night and afterwards there was not a dry eye in the room.<br/><br/>My rating 9 out of 10 (I've never Gave a 10)"

","The only real problem with this movie is it's title.If any other title were chosen,then it would undoubtedly be heralded and lauded over as a great piece of filmmaking.But since Pearl Harbor was to be its fait accompli,then many are offended and take it to task.Why,I don't know or care.It is after all,a movie.Not World at War.Or some submarine movie that can not submerge and take wind of its true potential.After reading some very naive comments and reviews over,I find many a film buff to be unable to appreciate what is trying to be accomplished by this movie.It is long,and sappy with love interest at  times,but that is the nature of the beast.To entertain through romance and buddy interaction because war is hell and one never knows,what is around corner.And anyone in the military can testify to the power of the opposite sex for motivation to go to war and battle for cause. And least we forget that many a military GI had romanced and married during his stay,whether home or abroad.<br/><br/>Pearl starts out nicely with eager relationship betwen 2 early gung-ho kids,just playing around a single prop airfield.Their enthusiasm is quite apparent,and for good reason.They will quickly go on to enlist and fight for country.The bond is set,and the competitive nature established.These buddies will be the focal point of story and plot.   Ben Affleck,looking dapper and crisp in uniform,takes me back to another  good actor with similiar qualities-Robert Taylor.Both men exuded confidence and a gung-ho spirit that was both manly and charming.Tough and yet tender enough to appeal to most every women.These are the kind of men we want as officers and leaders,who will compassionately and fairly go to battle,and do us proud with their sense of self.It is this sense of self that separates a worthy character and actor from just an ordinary GI or Mr.Joblo.It takes bravura and gusto,along with handsome charm to pull off. Affleck is almost perfect in role.Why some are offended by his performance is not my concern.There are some who would question Mother Teresa.Our world is undeniably fickle in its mentality,at times.   The gals are also very pretty and wholesome,giving off their sweet and wild-eyed sexiness,to the applause of most enlisted men and any GI worth his salt for appreciation of.Pinup girls and painted portraits of such were commonplace during the war and for good reason.An incentive to go to war and kick butt,thereby returning home for some Mom,apple pie and Girls,girls,girls.So the love interest aspect of Pearl is not only warranted but quite apropriate.I think it a good thing to establish some romance before fighting for one's life.<br/><br/>And if action is key to many a film nowadays ,then this film can float along on its merry laurels,with not so much as a hiccup to gather dust.The action is as fast and furious as humanly possible and state of the art in places,maybe a bit too overwhelming,for many eyes and ears.It was a bit too much for me personally,not giving in to action scenes very much.But its all in there,and done with great effect.<br/><br/>As for the overall length and scope of drama,it succeeds on many levels and is sure to cause a stir among former veterans of war and Gen Xer's who aren't used to all that much honesty and true felt discipline,being a cold war bunch of slackers.So,i welcome good discerning debate as to the merits and pratfalls of this epic and grand display of emotion,action and above all loyalty. 4 out of 5 star or 8/10 for rather long but big attempt to expose war and romance with straight forward emotion."

","I first saw Pearl Harbor on a field trip with my senior history class. I think it was one of the best times in high school I've ever had. None of us had ever really expected the Pearl Harbor attack to be as big as what was shown in the movie. We weren't very educated on it.<br/><br/>I must say, I have heard this movie compared to Titanic, and Pearl Harbor by far surpasses it. It was an emotional roller coaster from the first shot to the last. The music was a great help in that.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes in the entire movie was when they would show the nurses helping in the rescue efforts. It was great that it showed views from every angle, and as a woman, I appreciated that.<br/><br/>In the end, I was sitting in the movie theater, with tears soaked into my shirt, and all over my face. I looked around, and everyone else was too. I myself put this in my top 5 movies of all time. Great job."
"hcsponberg","4","0","1","29 November 2001"," Bad film
","The movie took the Titanic approach of throwing in a very cheesy love story into a film that should have had a historical obligation to do better. The movie goes to Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie should have never done this and stopped after the Japanese attack, unless of course the movie would have gone all the way to us dropping the atom bomb on a Japanese family that had been developed throughout the movie. But the makers didn't have enough balls for this.<br/><br/>Warning: The following discusses the end and may spoil the weak ending:<br/><br/>A particular funny part at the end is a plane goes down after Ben's plane, and there is a soldier in the glass gun turret on the bottom of the plane shooting Japs to save Ben Affleck. The soldier shoots that gun until the plane crashes, crushing the soldier.  I'm sure his last thoughts were, ""Well, I know I will die if I am in this turret when the plane crashes, but how else can Ben get back to his girlfriend if I don't shoot all the Japs."" I especially liked how Ben Affleck kills about 30 Japs with his pistol in the end, and how Josh Hartnett was killed as a weak attempt to make the love story work out. Good special effects though, as Micheal Bay will always deliver."

I have one advice for true lovers of cinema: don't go. don't buy it. don't even rent it. Just borrow it from some aquaintance of yours, fastforward up to 1h30', and then turn it off 20'before the clumsiest ending Hollywood has ever spawned on the face of this earth. That makes 40' of nice, not breakthrough efx, which efx don't make up for a three-hour cascade of cliches, stupid dialogues, stiff and unconvincing acting, ridiculous if existent screenplay, irritating music and I myself could go on spitting at it for three hours...for free.

The vintage planes look nice - the P-40 fighters especially but such stupid s**t happens in them you'll be groaning through the flying sequences.<br/><br/>Course it IS directed by a Brit and those who've not seen it (like me yesterday) might be tempted to think its being willfully idiotic - like a period ""DUDE WHERES MY CAR?"" but the seriousness given to the attack scenes undermines any comedy and on a small screen the ""spectacular attack"" looks like a computer game anyway. 1941's better for laughs AND action."
"VictorianCushionCat","1","0","1","11 November 2001"," More money than sense
","The big problem with this very expensive movie is that it's characters are terribly wooden and the lacklustre script is not helping much either.  The action scenes are all smart angles of bombs hitting targets and big budget explosions.  And the revenge raid after the attack is pretty pointless too.<br/><br/>War films tend to fall into two main brackets, the action adventure type that have of course little to do with the reality of war.  Then the somber type that attempts to deliver the horrors that war brings.  Pearl Harbor gets stuck unfortunately somewhere in between and it's not a good mix."
