","Occasionally when editors send reviewers a list of new and upcoming films, a kind a war-weariness can set in: even more so when one's gut feeling suggests an obvious divide between worthwhile cinema and the barrage of rather missable comedy. Even more so when a film in question has not risked journalistic censure by having an advance press screening. I am not one of the many people who thrilled excitedly to Simon Pegg's efforts in Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. And I was even less impressed the last time he joined forces with David Schwimmer in Big Nothing. So it was with a feeling almost of self-sacrifice that I volunteered to sit through Run, Fat Boy, Run. Which doesn't even have car chases or zombies to recommend it.<br/><br/>The surprise was that it is actually quite good.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg studied drama at university but earned his spurs in working life as a stand-up comedian. Which perhaps explains why his timing is so split-second perfect. The gags in Run, Fat Boy, Run are not that remarkable. At times you can even see them coming. But the performance and skillful delivery is so polished that they are entertaining anyway.<br/><br/>Run, Fat Boy, Run uses a formula that has served Pegg and his growing fan base well: he is the nerd who eventually turns hero. We feel sorry for him, irritated by him, repelled by him. He's the well-meaning hopeless case we just want to 'fix'. So the audience is relieved and rooting for him by the time he makes good. We are fully behind him by the time he makes his resolve that he is ""sick of being a 'nearly-man'."" In this present incarnation, Pegg (Dennis) has an attack of nerves just before getting married. He runs out on his gorgeous wife-to-be Libby (played by Thandie Newton) - literally - running off as she stands in the road in full bridal dress. And pregnant.<br/><br/>Five years later, Dennis is working as a security guard at a women's clothing store. The predictable jokes are spoon-fed us faultlessly. Pegg rescues any situation that threatens to become too silly by a look of open sincerity (rather like Ricky Gervais does with political humour). But Pegg seems to have an instinctual grasp of cinema that enables him to extract the best results from his material. On a hot Saturday afternoon, and with strong competition from much publicised movies, the auditorium was fairly packed.<br/><br/>The second theme from the film's title comes from Dennis' decision to run the London marathon. This is mostly to 'prove' something to Libby (for whom he has now discovered undying love) but also to win a bet for his mates and to prove himself equal to Libby's super-fit, super-rich, super-handsome suitor, Whit. His five-year old son provides the magic glue to pull all the elements of the story together.<br/><br/>In a wise choice, the filmmakers avoid anything that might belittle the Marathon (given that many UK viewers may have a deep respect for the institution). But they also bring in much underused and very photogenic shots of London en-route - particularly the Docklands area.<br/><br/>With such a vanilla story line, Run, Fat Boy, Run is relying on Pegg's reputation to pull in audiences. I suspect that many of his fans may be occasional movie-goers who simply demand something light and untaxing. He has the ability to make a futile chase after stolen women's underwear amusing. When he seems to be rubbing himself off against a shop mannequin it could be a pathetic or tacky sketch in any other hands, but his wide-eyed expression and fast pacing move us from one joke to the next before we have time to analyse.<br/><br/>I wasn't bored. And I had expected to be. In fact I was laughing loudly. It reminded me of when JM Barrie had planted children in the audience of his first performance of Peter Pan. It helps to be in the company of people who see the joke. Run, Fat Boy, Run has not made me a convert to Pegg's brand of humour even if I enjoyed the film, but I have to admit that he is good at his job. Sometimes it is the difference between a sterile press screening and an audience of fans. On this occasion, marketing gets the benefit of the doubt."

","This was a great film and had me and the rest of the audience in stitches. Well worth seeing and for those that have seen Michael Douglas in the Running [1979] the tale will be somewhat familiar.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg delivers the comedic moments superbly (doesn't he always?) and yet also convincingly parts a warm touch to, well, those warm touching moments in the film that he shares with his son.<br/><br/>Harish Patel deserves a very honourable mention as Pegg's landlord-cum-mentor-cum-trainer. The only problem with the film was that all the way through I was waiting on Nick Frost to make at least a cameo appearance - talking of which the David Walliams scene will bring a smile to those Little Britaners out there.<br/><br/>Great film."

","I loved Shaun of the dead and hot fuzz so i knew i would like this but it was even funnier than i thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>A strong cast, the storyline was obvious but then i think that was the point, it was supposed to be a cliché, that's why it seemed funnier. The direction and writing were very good and generally the pace of the film was perfect.<br/><br/>I adore Simon Pegg in these roles, his ability to play the straight, flawed individual but make him the funniest man on screen is great and you're drawn to his story, no matter how ridiculous his predicament is. His best friend was hilarious, the setting of the London marathon was a great idea and Hank Azaria played his part well as the whole way through i wanted him to not get the girl and lose the race.<br/><br/>It's not as funny as Simon's other films but i really enjoyed it and it was well worth paying to see, in fact i'd watch it again tomorrow as there was so many laughs throughout to hold my interest.<br/><br/>Overall i love the Britishness of this film, the good guy and his basic life, it's not showy, or Hollywood it's just a simple film with comedy stars doing silly things and making us laugh, a perfect pick me up if you ask me."

","I loved this film from start to finish!!! The story, the cast, the acting, the directing all of these things are bang - on hats off to David Schwimmer i say !! This is isn't exactly the most intellectual storyline and it isn't going to change your life, but it is very entertaining Pegg at his best offering some of the funniest lines and on screen hilarity iv'e seen in a while. Plus Dylan Moran is excellent and usually i find that Stand-Up Comedians don't carry into films very well but this didn't seem a problem for Moran.<br/><br/>the film is also riddled with cameo's from famous British Comedians! That really put the cherry on top of of this film.<br/><br/>If you want to see and honest comedy with a very heartfelt and original script Run,Fatboy,Run is for you!!!"
"hellokristen","9","76","111","27 August 2007"," Enjoyable British Comedy -- but not as zany as you might expect
","Simon Pegg leaves his pregnant bride at the altar and 6 years later is regretting it -- especially when he sees her new rich, handsome, perfect suitor (Hank Azaria's comedic talents wasted in a straight role -- you know he does 100 voices on ""The Simpsons"", right?).<br/><br/>Simon loves his little boy dearly and fears the new guy might take his place in the boy's heart. So he's going to try to pull himself together before it's too late.<br/><br/>There were only 26 people at my noon-on-a-Monday (!) preview screening, but we all were laughing a lot throughout this film. I even found myself wiping away a tear at the moving ending.<br/><br/>This film was written by Simon Pegg (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""-- which I loved) and Michael Ian Black (edgy American TV sketch-comedy) and I expected it to be a lot wackier than it was.<br/><br/>But maybe they wanted to make something more mainstream to reach a wider audience. Or maybe it was the tempering hand of new movie director David Schwimmer (""Ross"" of ""Friends""), who does a good job.<br/><br/>A quite enjoyable movie to go see when you want some laughs. A good date movie too, I think."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","28","38","26 March 2008"," Fun Run With Fatboy
","Simon Pegg is back, this time as a fatboy, with a new gang, in David Schwimmer's 'Run Fatboy Run'. Schwimmer has already gained recognition as a very talented comedy actor in the famous (and one of my all time favorite) sitcom 'Friends'. He tried his hand in direction with a couple of episodes of 'Friends' and 'Joey' and a few films. With 'Run Fatboy Run' he proves that he's a very capable director and does a brilliant job here. Being an American, I wonder how he studied the Brit humour as he does a great job giving the film the right Brit charm (of course with good collaboration from the actors and screenplay).<br/><br/>'Run Fatboy Run' fits into a category which I have freely termed 'Little British Movies' (other movies fitting into this category include 'Kinky Boots', 'Calender Girls', 'Billy Elliot' etc). These movies are about people from an ordinary background facing ordinary problems and tackling them with extraordinary results. Unlike the other films, 'Run Fatboy Run' relies more on slapstick (just think of 'Shaun of the Dead') but the dialogues too have the sharp wit and smart humour that make this a charming film. The story pretty much follows a 'tested' formula where the goofy guy tries to win back his ex-fiancée (whom he dumped at the alter) after the entry of a rival and when means fail, he decides to take somewhat drastic measures like run a marathon. But, what makes turns this formula into something new is that it is cleverly parodied (again, think of 'Shaun of the Dead').<br/><br/>Pegg stands out doing what he does best. His comic timing is impeccable and his expressions will surely draw laughs. The actor prevents any of the comedy that might have fallen flat (had it been performed by a lesser actor) by making his scenes amusing and entertaining. It's great to see the sensational Thandie Newton play a Brit after a long time. Even though her character is pretty much the typical love interest, she does a good job nonetheless. Hank Azaria is fits the bill as the nice-guy-we-should-hate. He brilliantly spoofs up his part towards the end. Dylan Moran is spot on as the cynical goofy friend. Harish Patel is hilariously phenomenal as the landlord-mentor-friend. Watch out for the pleasantly surprising cameos.<br/><br/>The camera-work is very good and the makers make good use of the photogenic park locations in London by making them look colourful and beautiful. The whimsical soundtrack too adds to the light-heartedness.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Run Fatboy Run' is genuinely funny. It has all the ingredients finely put together to make it a successful comedy. It works as a great date movie, a fun family film and a cool comedy to watch with friends."
"intelearts","7","44","63","16 February 2008"," David Schwimmer directs Simon Pegg stars: and this has running power
","""Big Nothing"" was a decent collaboration, but lacked punch. RFBR is much closer the mark - classic British humour all dressed up as a good comedy sports romance movie.<br/><br/>It looks and feels like it got Ealing Comedy in its genes - or more recently The Tall Guy from the 80's, or Steve Coogan's The Parole Officer rather than class based comedies like Four Weddings - a good small low-key British comedy, with a nice parade of eccentrics - not high concept, not too low brow, rather good old fashioned heart which it absolutely wears its heart firmly on its sleeve.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer seems comfortable behind the camera - our favourite scene in terms of camera was the bin fight - but overall you know what genre you watching and it doesn't require too much effort to relax and enjoy.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one - Dennis (Simon Pegg) gets cold feet and literally bolts on his wedding day from his pregnant fiancée, Libby (Thandie Newton). Five years on, and life has not been good to Dennis, he's suffering from middle-aged spread, working as a rent-a-cop for a lingerie store, and living below his Indian landlord (A wonderful Harish Patel, who deserves lots more work based on this).When his son starts bonding with Libby's new man Whit (Hank Azurius), whose everything Dennis is not, and American to boot, Dennis realizes the relationship with Libby is what he cares about and the only way to beat Whit is to run the same marathon as him. Needless to say Dennis is as fit as beached whale, but where the heart will, the body doth follow.<br/><br/>His best friend, and unrepentant gambler Gordon (A super cynical Dylan Moran at his absolute laid back best) urges him on, partly for financial gain, and partly, well, because he enjoys seeing Dennis flounder and succeed.<br/><br/>Like any competent sport movie we get the training etc; but here the emphasis is on the laughs.<br/><br/>Of course, like any romantic comedy the pay off is sweet, and uplifting.<br/><br/>It doesn't have enough bite to lift it up to the echelons of classic comedy - but it works well as a small comedy - there are lots of sweet touches that pay off - but not enough belly laughs to really satisfy.<br/><br/>We like it a lot - the camera tells the story really well - nothing too smart, just good narrative filming. David Schwimmer definitely knows his British films - this looks and fells straight out of the genre - and you'd never guess a Yank made it - all the nuances are there. Nice.<br/><br/>These guys obviously like each other and we look forward to seeing more from them in the future...<br/><br/>Recommended as a good small British comedy."
"CountZero313","8","32","46","17 February 2008"," strong debut from Schwimmer
","RFR hits all the right rom-com targets - I laughed, I teared up, I cheered for the little guy and boo-ed the buff villain. Pegg has some laugh-out-loud lines, especially in tandem with Moran as his Irish mate Gordon. Moran holds his own in the comedic moments - perhaps the funniest moment is when he appears in the dressing gown after some love drama, and asks, ""What did I miss?"". The fight between the two layabout friends is hilarious, the staging somehow reminiscent of a Friends episode (didn't Ross and Chandler once fight this way?). That's a compliment - Schwimmer has strong comedy pedigree and uses it to full effect. Also, good to see a US director move seamlessly through a UK film setting.<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for light, entertaining fare, Friday-night date stuff, then RFR won't disappoint."

","I saw this at the Toronto Film Festival (film not yet on General Release in Canada) and it was Funny with a capital F.

Well written, well directed, well acted, a really sharp film. Better than Sean, better than Fuzz :)<br/><br/>With a Q&A session straight after the film, David Schwimmer with Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton in tow entertained the audience with their little anecdotes, - I particularly liked Thandies improv!! Well done to all involved."

","There have been many British rom coms in the past couple of decades, many of them including Hugh Grant and his slightly off putting foppish hair.<br/><br/>I have personally found that the Simon Pegg take on romance to be far more personable and less likely to make you throw up over other people in the audience.<br/><br/>Yes it was predictable, yes it wasn't original but the humour was spot on, the characters were believable and the directing was brilliant in my eyes as it captured the English town vibe without seeming like a low budget British soap.<br/><br/>Although it contained every cliché in the book from the genres of rom com and 'training to win something' movies it didn't seem forced to me and was light hearted and genuinely funny.<br/><br/>It also had some of my favourite actors from Bristish comedy in it.<br/><br/>Basically if you like spaced (one of the best series ever) and you don't mind the obvious plot and just sit back and enjoy the movie then you may find, like me, that this is just a purely brilliant movie."
"luke-346","3","15","24","21 April 2008"," Been here, seen it!
","Directed by David Schwimmer, Run Fatboy Run is a warm hearted comedy that does nothing new for the genre but merely follows in the footsteps of previous offerings. The film tells of how Dennis (Simon Pegg) runs away from his fiancé Libby (Thandie Newton) and his unborn child only to have a sense of resolve five years later (now that he's grown up). And, here's the twist, in order to prove that he is now worthy of ex-fiancés hand he embarks on an attempt at the London marathon.<br/><br/>Regrettably any negative preconceptions of this film are confirmed from the outset, for example, in sticking firmly to genre conventions and expectation the film quickly establishes David as an unfit wimp by him being outwitted by a shop-lifting transvestite (clearly only a transvestite to elicit a smile), it also stereotypes his Pakistani landlord to the point of it being cringe worthy and it reacquaints us with the clichéd ""smooth boyfriend"" character - brilliantly played by Hank Azaria.<br/><br/>The film concentrates on Dennis and the struggles and pitfalls he encounters on his quest to win back his ex-fiancé, but in doing so it tiresomely emulates the media's obsession with sporting underdogs and how they are always winners on some level. Its chosen plot is something that has been played out, many, many times in cinema and it is disconcerting to see a contemporary comedy with bright actors and a fresh director regress to such tedious story-telling.<br/><br/>In a nutshell the film parodies modern masculine anxieties, from the worry of marriage, commitment and fatherhood to the ever more popular and relevant... ""am I getting a belly"". In satirising these notions the film epitomizes the generic conventions of all those films that have preceded it, from Big Daddy to the more recent Knocked Up. Run Fatboy Run is a film that could have quite easily starred Adam Sandler and have been based around the New York marathon; it tells a story that has no real relevance to its cast or locations. In addition I could imagine Hugh Grant playing the ""smooth talking boyfriend"".<br/><br/>Fans of Simons Pegg's previous offerings will not enjoy this as much as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, but will nevertheless gain some delight from the brief cameos of Stephen Merchant and David Walliams. Given that it centres around a marathon it is ironic that the film plods along at such a predictable pace, with the only sense of urgency evolving from the certainty that it has an end. There is no attempt at characterisation and the audience will not care what happens to the people on screen as no real empathy or identification with them is likely to occur.<br/><br/>Some scenes are funny, most notably his attempt to relieve himself of his groin rash, the moment he hits the wall and a blister popping in his friends face. The laughs are there (be them sparse), but given how they're executed and placed, it is clear they are gags that have been worked into the film to help make it funnier. Unfortunately the over worked idea and the clichéd plot devices take its toll on a film that would have been better if it the characters had been more distinctive, which is a shame because given the films short comings Schwimmer does manage to evoke heartfelt performances from his leads. Finally, the trait of predictability in a film will always pull an audience, as some viewers like well-worn ideas - the very notion proves they are a success. But if you're after something similar to Peggs previous work, that's inventive or off the wall, then this film isn't it."
"RogerBorg","3","14","23","16 April 2008"," Haven't we seen this film before?
","Not in sum, but every part seems familiar. It plays like a montage of previous rom coms.<br/><br/>There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either. It's blurb, a schedule filler, one in the bank.<br/><br/>Pegg and Moran just sleepwalk through the same parts that they always play, not expanding their range on iota. Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now. Thandie Newton just has to stand in doorways and look pretty. Her character is a prize, not a person. The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot. Azaria is the strongest actor, but isn't given much of a part. His character development goes: good, good, good... evil, with no reason given for the sudden transition.<br/><br/>Everything about it, Schwimmer's direction included, is just... adequate. There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track. Film making by box ticking. <br/><br/>The whole is instantly forgettable, and dreadfully disappointing given the collection of talent working on it."
"missrljane","2","15","25","16 May 2008"," Take Everything Needed For A Funny And Heart-Warming Film, And Throw Them Away. The Nothing That Is Left Is THIS.
","The problem with Dennis, the 'fat boy' of the title, is exactly that. What is his problem? He's a loser, a scumbag and utterly unlikeable, and at no point in the film does he become a nice, likable, or sympathetic character. So it is very hard to root for someone this self-involved. At no point is he ever nasty or pathetic in a funny way, he's just a jerk. And no matter how many 'emotional' scenes are rammed in, it has been five years since he left his pregnant fiancée at the alter. FIVE YEARS of seeing her every day. How is it only NOW that he wants to do anything about it? And it doesn't matter if he does. It's been FIVE YEARS. It's too late. Luckily for him, the people he wants to win back, the dull Libby and their duller son Jake, are so flat, the audience can't care about them either. Especially Jake. And the lazy demonising of Libby's new love Whit is obvious and convenient so Dennis can worm his way back in to Libby's affections after five years of being the most detestable and unreliable jerk she could hope to meet.<br/><br/>So, Run Fat Boy Run isn't funny. There are a couple of jokes that possibly could have worked as part of a sitcom, but never in a one-off film, but just to make it clear, this isn't funny. The serious scenes are even worse, falling horribly, uncomfortably flat, and the painful dragging out of a heart-warming ending is not heart-warming. There is no character development or motivation, so basically there is nothing here that is needed to make a film. Dire."
"Lejink","5","7","10","21 December 2007"," Not so fast
","Fair to middling Brit-com, centring on amusing ordinary, average guy Simon Pegg's attempts to win back his improbably beautiful girlfriend, Thandie Newton, from a slick yuppie American. Of course it's ""The Full Monty"" (maybe this subliminally excuses two shots of Dylan Moran's bare behind!) in running gear but the movie never quite gets out of the starting blocks. As indicated earlier, it's hard to accept Pegg & Newton as a natural couple and the rest of the cast are a bit too eccentric and haphazard too, taking in prominently the afore-mentioned Moran as Pegg's best pal who in between dropping his trousers, flits in and out of a minor league gambling den and also Pegg's long-suffering Asian landlord who again somewhat improbably becomes his assistant coach. My problem is that the characters don't mesh together and the narrative is painted in too-broad strokes. ""The Full Monty"" worked because the characters were believable and the ensemble acting so good, even if the basic premise, like here, seems unlikely. Pegg does garner some sympathy and amusement by turns as he takes to the streets (he is a sight in his tight running shorts!) but by the time his ""Tough of the Track"" performance has won the hearts of the nation as well, of course as Newton's, you're left not quite caring enough nor do you feel you've laughed enough on the journey. But a fairly pleasant undemanding watch all the same."

","I have followed the career of Simon Pegg for a number of years from his stand skits on the Steve Coogan tour, to Spaced to Hot Fuzz and yes, he is a fine talent. But I will never forgive him for putting me through an hour and a half of unadulterated, mediocre dross that was Run Fat Boy Run.<br/><br/>Run Fat Boy is a poorly acted and directed Brit Com that only serves to perpetuate racial stereotypes and an abundance of clichés. The jokes are appalling and regardless of the fact that this is clearly 'a bit of fun' the standard of the writing was insultingly bad.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer should Schwimm all the way back to New York because if this blight on our culture is anything to go by his ambition to be a Director are completely misguided.<br/><br/>No surprises that this waste of time did not Run and Run."

","Yes, it is predictable as anything but 'Run Fat Boy Run' is an enjoyable comedy, with Simon Pegg basically playing Shaun again as the amiable loser who comes good and wins the girl. Pegg's range is not wide but he is a very likable performer, and I personally found this film preferable to the somewhat disappointing 'Hot Fuzz'. There's also a decent supporting cast, with Dylan Moran (also from 'Shaun of the Dead') amusing as Pegg's friend and trainer, although Hank Azaria's nasty Yank love-rival character is a bit stereotypical. Director David Schwimmer, who must have become buddies with Pegg on the fairly obscure 'Big Nothing', has a blink and you'll miss him cameo towards the end."

"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","6","10","3 April 2008"," Seriously funny!
","I hate a lot of romantic comedies, I just want to say that right now, the movies like 27 Dresses and Fool's Gold where it's just the same predictable plot each time with different characters. When I first saw the teaser trailer for Run Fatboy Run, I couldn't stop laughing. Simon Pegg is seriously one of today's funniest actors and his comedies are always a blast to watch. So I got to see Run Fatboy Run this weekend and I was a little disappointed, while I was dying of laughter, the plot was a little weak. Now the jokes and script are very clever and the story is very heart warming, while it's predictable and sloppy in some area's. Like Hank Azaria's character, Whit, how he was this perfect boyfriend in the beginning, and then he just turns into a total jerk out of no where in the end, it just felt rushed and that the writers could've left him as a good guy, but instead turned into into a typical plot. But I have to say that I was impressed with Simon Pegg who made a despicable character very likable and held the story well.<br/><br/>Dennis is a man who has never finished anything in life, he's unfit, has a lousy job, smokes, drinks, and also left his pregnant fiancée at the alter. When he realizes what he's lost, he wants his son and ex fiancée, Libby, back, but she's already got a boyfriend, Whit. Whit runs marathon's for charities, so when Dennis finds this out, he wants to impress Libby, so he decides to run the marathon too. But it's going to take a lot of Rocky like working out in order to run this 26 mile ordeal.<br/><br/>Now I loved Run Fatboy Run, it has some incredibly funny scenes like Dennis's first running scene with those little blue speedo shorts, and him getting the rash from it and the way he handles it. Run Fatboy Run is a feel good movie that I'm sure will make you laugh and just have a good time as well. There are some minor flaws here and there though, like I said, it gets predictable and the characters are just let go and the ending is sped through a little bit. But I do recommend this movie if you get a chance, I think Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran were absolutely fun together in this movie and make it very enjoyable.<br/><br/>7/10"
"editor-424","8","6","10","24 September 2007"," Those who whine about Pegg's writing should learn to read
","First off, I thought this movie was quite good. But setting that aside, I just wanted to comment on a couple of the comments that were criticizing Pegg and putting this film in the same category as Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Spaced.<br/><br/>This film was directed by David Schwimmer. It was written by Michael Ian Black. This is NOT a Simon Pegg/Edgar Wright film or a Pegg/Stevenson series. Trying to compare them is akin to comparing The Royal Tenenbaums to Shanghai Knights; sure both featured Owen Wilson, but he was only creatively involved in one. Separating the faces from the actual creators is pretty important in this context...<br/><br/>So for those commenting on how Pegg is losing it or that this is a poor British film, I would point out two things--1) Pegg had nothing to do with its content, and 2) it is NOT a British Film, unless Schwimmer and Black have moved to the UK in the past year...<br/><br/>As to the creative team themselves, Schwimmer did a pretty decent job behind the camera, getting solid performances from both Pegg and Moran. Black, who if you don't recognize click the handy link under ""writer"", has a very, um, ""unique"" sense of humor and style that I personally enjoy, but in the same breath there is a reason that Stella was not a huge success. It's very specific, and you either love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Personally, I tend to fall into the former category."

The premise seems eerily familiar: Underachiever dad tries to win his son's respect and attention from the boy's stepfather by entering an athletic competition for which he's physically unprepared; in one way or another, he manages to succeed in his quest-- he earns the boy's affection, while also tarnishing his rival's image. At least the TV movie included some wild slapstick, with Conway barreling around town on roller skates, to make it mildly amusing. Unfortunately, the makers of this film rely on tired, would-be ""risque"" gags to get laughs--flatulence jokes, an old woman uttering an obscenity, characters giving each other the ""finger,"" naked men strutting around unself-consciously in locker rooms to the embarrassment of onlookers, and so on. The filmmakers seem to have loaded the film with as many of these overdone throwaway gags as possible, yet they don't add up to a very funny film. Actors Simon Pegg (from the far superior films SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ), Hank Azaria and Thandie Newton try their best with the weak, contrived plot and uninspired humor, but it's a losing battle. For a much better film with a similar premise, try THE FULL MONTY. Or maybe even ROLL, FREDDIE, ROLL."

","Amusing comedy thats better in its parts than as a whole concerning Simon Pegg who bails on his wedding day to his pregnant fiancé. Several years later as his ex becomes engaged to an annoying Hank Azaria he realizes that he really does love her and decides to run a marathon to prove his love to his girl and that he is a man to himself. Along the way he's helped along by his son and an odd gaggle of friends. I liked this I didn't love it. I think the odd mix of American (director Schwimmer and Azaria) and British (everything else) wobbles the film and keeps Simon Pegg trapped in a nether world between the two. There are these odd tonal shifts as you have say a finely crafted scene of Dylan Moran and his friends playing poker that works like a great Brit com, and then you have some of the scenes with Azaria where the film seems needlessly loud and boisterous in a decidedly American way. Its jarring and it prevented me from wholly enjoying the film. No its not a bad film but its not satisfying. there is much to love, most of the cast is excellent, with Dylan Moran as Pegg's friend a real stand out.For me it was a pleasure not to have him fade into the background as he has done with most of his movie roles. Many of the jokes are laugh out loud funny since all of the pieces are there but it just doesn't come together. Worth a shot on DVD or cable . Though DVD is probably better where the rewind will help you catch the choice lines"

","This film is an insult to the entire history of British comedy, and I'm mad at myself for wasting my time and money on this stupid little movie.<br/><br/>This is the first British comedy - indeed, the fist ""British"" film of any kind - I have ever walked out of. In fact, there are so many Americans involved in this movie that I'm not so sure it really is a British film. In any event, 30 minutes in and I just couldn't take it any more. If I had wanted to see a poorly written TV sitcom I could have stayed at home and rented an episode of ""Friends"", the hardly humorous US TV show in which this movie's director, David Schwimmer, was an actor - an unfunny one, at that.<br/><br/>Why in God's name would the maker's of this film have selected inexperienced American director Schwimmer, American writer Michael Black (Schwartz), and an American actor like Hank Azaria? Do they work on the cheap? Did they pay to participate? Were they hired in the hope of attracting an American audience? I can't imagine this film succeeding in Briain. Whatever the reason, they absolutely ruined the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is so bad that the British Government should cancel Schwimmer's visa. He represents a clear and present danger to British culture. If Schwimmer and Schwartz ever again show up at a British Point of Entry they should be turned away immediately. Perhaps France would take them; they could say they're related to Jerry Lewis. And Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran should be hauled up in front of the actors' guild and chastised for participating in this affront to British comedy. They should be made to watch Ealing comedies until they return to their senses.<br/><br/>There's not much left of the British Empire other than great wit. To lose that would constitute a crime against civilization."

I think there was only one moment when everyone gave a simultaneous chuckle. Other than that, there was an occasional snort ... although it may just have been someone blowing their nose.<br/><br/>It's slightly impressive, given the quality of the cast, that the production amounts to such a dull procession. Definitely goes in to the 'the sum of the parts is less than the total' category.<br/><br/>Ultimately the script is weak, the gags predictable and the directing is lumpen.

","I am genuinely shocked at the number of good to excellent reviews this film has received.<br/><br/>What hurts me more than the formulaic and juvenile humour, the market- researched casting and the slow pacing is that Simon Pegg, co-creator of the legendary ""Spaced"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" was involved in it. Is this really what he wants to do? I wonder whether the Brit-slacker- humour was all a facade for his desperation to become a Hollywood film star...<br/><br/>Take one pasty faced Brit. Add an unfeasibly beautiful baby-mother that he dumped at the altar (!), add a token American love rival, insert cameos from funny-blokes-off-the-telly-doing-something-like-that-thing- they-do-on-the-telly, clichéd Brit-cussing, a Friend-ly anglophile director, and what do you get? A bit of leaden humour, a bit of heartwarming nonsense, and another pitiful effort by the British lottery funding industry - sorry, film industry - to create an international hit.<br/><br/>Run, everybody, run.<br/><br/>That being said, I had to turn the film off halfway through, it was that shameful.

","Run Fatboy Run, directed by David Schwimmer and starring Simon Pegg, Thandie Newton, Hank Azaria and Dylan Moran. The screenplay is written by Michael Ian Black & Pegg which is adapted from a story by Black himself. The problem a film such as this has is that it's such a well trodden formula. Yet film lovers continue entering such productions hoping for something different each time, but rarely is that hope met. Such is the case with this amiable but unadventurous piece. The cast do fine with the flimsy material, Pegg is always value for money in a comedy and so too is Azaria. While Newton is ideal as a pretty love interest. But where's the surprises? Where is a veer from the norm of a guy trying to win back his one true love? Plonking the formula into the middle of a marathon running framework just doesn't cut it as being any different.<br/><br/>It's a safe directing assignment for Schwimmer, one that in truth could have been directed by any number of fledgling directors. If it's an attempt to cash in on Pegg's popularity post Sean Of The Dead/Hot Fuzz, then it's not an ideal marker. It failed to make back its $10 million budget domestically but limped to a Worldwide profit of $23.5 million. So if nothing else the film served as a reference point for how to make some cash relatively easily. One or two good visual gags aside, it's a poor film and frankly all those involved deserve much better. 3/10"
"the_naked_airplane","3","3","5","18 July 2011"," Pegg can do so much better.
","Whether it is or not, this seems like a cheap cash-in (no Wright and Frost here by the way). in order to capitalise on the success of the excellent Hot Fuzz and thus solidify the box office value of Simon Pegg. Unfortunetely Run Fatboy Run is a lazy comedy with none of the quirky pastiche evident in Pegg's prior work. The story is plain, as is the humour which propels it. In fact the void left by snappy rhetoric and knowledgeable parody is filled by gross-out; namely penis jokes and that blister (etc)! Run fatboy run is painfully run of the mill and the ending may as well be a stock Hollywood ending (aside from the 'Forrest Gump' run). It's a shame but it seems no one is perfect. Let's hope Pegg's next outing is a more memorable one."
"kyrat","6","4","8","23 April 2008"," a mildly amusing Rom Com for guys
","I watched this because I like Simon Pegg. It was OK, for what it is, a romantic comedy - aimed at guys.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was Gordon (Dylan Moran). Nearly every laugh I laughed was at /with him. His voice/manner reminds me a lot of Alan Rickman (who I think is fantastic).<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the diversity of the cast. For so long I've been used to an all Caucasian cast, but I've noticed their TV shows (dr. who, etc.) have started having a more multiethnic cast to reflect what the country is becoming.<br/><br/>The kind of jokes that we were supposed to laugh at were pretty stereotypical guy stuff(crotch scratching, groin kicks, and oh no, seeing another man naked!).<br/><br/>Libby, isn't that developed as a character. She's obviously beautiful and a successful entrepreneur. But this film isn't about her, it's about Dennis and his pining for her. I also can't believe any self-respecting female would make the choice she did at the end. (though luckily they refrained from going as far as they could have). Maybe the problem is that I could never have forgiven Dennis behavior at the opening of the film.<br/><br/>Simon's character, Dennis is a loser from beginning to the end. He has one small revelation while trying to explain life to a 4.5 year old and makes one small pathetic attempt to redeem himself. Sure, we can root for Dennis, he's a dork, but he's endearing. We can certainly understand his desire to get the beautiful successful woman (but from a female perspective, you can't root for her to take him back). Another problem I had was that his supposed ""change"" seemed to me more like a really stupid obstinate refusal to bow to reality. He chooses to risk permanent physical injury to do it. Yes, I know that's not how you were supposed to see it, but that's what it felt like to me.<br/><br/>The 3rd main character, Whit, supposedly Dennis's rival, is a great guy. He's sensitive, caring. He's established in life. He keeps himself in shape. He tries to bond with the kid and get along with his girlfriend's ex. He actually seems like a great boyfriend. I found his presence to elicit nothing but pity for Dennis because there's no way he can compete.<br/><br/>About 20 minutes from the end the director seems to realize that he wanted us to root for Dennis & Libby, not Whit & Libby. Suddenly Whit is portrayed as a jerk. (Suddenly you find out he plans to take Libby away forever, he acts in a dishonorable manner and then acts reprehensibly towards the kid). That was an incredibly big cheat.<br/><br/>I would have preferred to see Dennis grow up and move on with someone else (maybe the Indian woman?)<br/><br/>I also subtracted a star for the prominent product placement of footwear ads that encompassed the last section of the film."

","I really don't understand these films like 'hot fuzz' or 'shawn of the dead'. I think they are all pretty bad. And 'Run fat boy run' was even worse. For starters the main character isn't really fat!! It would have been much more funny if he was. My problem with these films is that they tell you something like a guy who never finishes anything, and then he douse. and thats the plot, thats not funny at all. It's all so simpel and boring and emotional like a really bad friends episode. <br/><br/>The directing was bad, Simon Pegg just was'nt convincing, Dylan Moran was alright butt not great as the best friend and hank azaria played a good antagonist. <br/><br/>Butt I much rather watch 'the black adder' or the 'young ones'. Thats real British comedy for you. I guesse its all about taste. I just don't get why people like these films and why they get the money to make these movies.

","As a big Simon Pegg fan, I must admit that this is probably my least favourite film of his. It just doesn't come close to 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', two of my favourite comedies of all time.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't your typical romcom, if you can even call it that. It's more like a comedy with a hint of romance for the sake of a plot. It still has the classic Pegg silliness about it, just not to the level of some of his other films. Perhaps they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>'Run Fatboy Run' is a funny but underwhelming comedy movie, especially by Pegg's high standards."

She then would have to make a real choice. As it is there is no choice.<br/><br/>2. You can't train for a marathon in 3 weeks. It would have been more realistic if the transformation took place over an entire year...for next year's marathon. It certainly would be more believable and demonstrate more of a dedication that would justify the transformation. Maybe transform the character in other ways: career, habits and lifestyle. I know its a comedy but this would have provided more depth and resonance to the story."
"MBunge","4","1","1","11 October 2010"," It's like Thandie Newton starting shooting this one day after she finished a Holocaust film
","This is a comedy made by some talented comedians who appear to have suffered some sort of humor amnesia and forgot how to tell a joke while making this film. I t's inconsistent, stuttering, shallow and doesn't understand that we've heard most of this joke before.<br/><br/>Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is a fairly big loser. 5 years ago, he ran out on his very lovely and very pregnant girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day. Now, he's a part-time dad to their son Jake (Matthew Fenton), a security guard at a lingerie shop, living in someone's basement like a college student taking his senior year for the 4th year in a row and sporting a pot belly like a Vietnamese pig. But when Libby starts dating the handsome, rich and seemingly perfect Witt (Hank Azaria), Dennis is finally inspired to do something with his life. In Dennis' case, that something is run and finish the London marathoneven though the race is in 3 weeks, the deadline to enter has passed and Dennis is in about as good of shape as a professional doughnut taster. Assisted by his best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and his fat, Indian landlord Mr. G (Harish Patel), Dennis sets out to prove to Libby and to himself that he can see something all the way through.<br/><br/>That's only a basic outline of the plot of Run Fatboy Run but just off that, you could probably describe to me about 80% of what happens in this movie, scene by scene and almost word for word. This is an underdog story we've all seen many, many times before and there is absolutely no imagination brought to this version of it. There is not a single unexpected moment or surprise in the whole thing.<br/><br/>Even a formulaic movie can be enjoyable if the formula is well executed, but it isn't in this case. Run Fatboy Run is waaaaaay too long, veers haphazardly from broad slapstick to quieter humor, screws up either the set up or the punch line of too many of its jokes and even messes up the big, heartfelt ending these films are always supposed to have. There are some funny moments but most of them are so disconnected from the story, they could be transplanted into dozens of other movies and be just as funny.<br/><br/>There are so many elements that are simply ""off"". The film can never decide if Dennis Doyle is supposed to be funny or if he's supposed to be the normal point that funny stuff happens around. The movie starts with a guy leaving a pregnant woman at the altar, but then skips ahead 5 years and never shows us any of the real anger and heartache such an act would have produced. The script also piles one incentive on top of another for Dennis to finish the race to where you can't believe for even a second that it won't happen. There might as well have been subtitles on the bottom of the screen saying ""Here's yet another reason Dennis will have to overcome that moment of doubt we all know is coming and accomplish his dream"".<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that Thandie Newton is quite beautiful, but she's also rather disconcerting because she appears to be constructed out of pipe cleaners and toothpicks. She seems to be a naturally thin woman who's lost that 10 to 15 pounds they always ask you to lose in Hollywood, with the result that she looks like a fashion model who just escaped from a forced labor camp.<br/><br/>Run Fatboy Run is a walking, talking cinematic cliché. It desperately needed filmmakers who would try something unconventional with it. Instead, they churned out another generic, empty, Hollywood concoction."
"robertallenandersonjr","9","3","6","9 April 2008"," A wonderful movie all around
","Run, Fat Boy, Run was a pretty funny movie but not the funniest. It was more of like fighting to get back what you cherish the most. In Simon Peggs case it was the love of his life Thandie Newton. This movie did deliver enough laughs to last the movie. The movie was pretty predictable and a little bit corny but passable. The acting was very well played. I thought that Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton did a great job together. Their son was great for the role he played to. I loved where this movie was filmed in London. It was pretty unique making Thandie Newton have a London accent. I thought that the story was pretty cool and very funny. This was definitely original. Their has never really been a story close to this. The story was also pretty cute having Simon Pegg try so hard to get what he loved. This movie was actually surprisingly a little bit sad. Some people that cry very easily I think would cry in this. It had some really meaningful parts in it between him and his son. I thought this movie was very fun, funny, original, and entertaining. This movie inspires me to never give up at something no matter what the case may be. I think for anyone that loves running will especially like this movie. Im sure this movie will inspire you and make you feel better about yourself after this movie is over with. I honestly didn't think it would be all that good since it only made like 2 million dollars the first weekend. I surprisingly really really liked it though. You actually find yourself toward the end cheering for Simon Pegg. The first half of this movie was a little boring but then the last half was amazing and made up for the whole movie. Overall this was a great movie in many different ways. Go see it and just enjoy yourself."
"gregsrants","6","3","6","23 March 2008"," Film that plays like a BBC television comedy
","My guess is that mentioning the name Simon Pegg doesn't generate any face-to-name recognition. As an actor, he has a resume that includes some 45 television and movie role credits. As a writer, his career seemed stuck in video hell with the exception of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz  two recent films that he both wrote and starred. But my bet is that if I put Simon Pegg into a police lineup, most people would be unable to identify the godfather to Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter, Apple. <br/><br/>This is likely to change as Pegg has been cast as Scotty in the J.J. Abrams' Star Trek prequel due to be released this Christmas. In the meantime, Pegg has kept himself busy writing and starring in the David Schwimmer (Friends) new comedy Run Fatboy Run. <br/><br/>Run Fatboy Run's story is your run of the mill comedy plot. Guy gets girl. Guy loses girl. Guy tries to impress girl to win her back. Guy gets girl. Easy ka-cheesy. <br/><br/>This time 'round it's Dennis (Pegg) who left a pregnant Libby (Thandie Newton) at the alter five years ago. In the half a decade that has passed since the groom ran down the street with the wedding party screaming his name in the background, and Dennis and Libby's lives have taken different directions. Libby seems to have done alright for herself. Granted, we never really find out what career path she has taken, but her home is quiet quaint and her lifestyle seems relaxed and at ease. On the other side of the fence there's Dennis. Dennis works as a security guard for a woman's clothing store. He lives in a basement apartment of a Mr. Ghoshdashtidar  a rotund, Indian man that later becomes integral to the 'win-back-Libby' crusade. Dennis doesn't have enough money to pay his rent and his excursions with his son usually command imaginative thinking like climbing a tree and scaring the beejeezus out of unsuspecting visitors by throwing sticks at trashcans when the walk by.<br/><br/>It takes the introduction of Whit (Hank Azaria) to push Dennis into action. Whit is the new boyfriend of Libby. He is everything Dennis is not. He's successful. Seemingly intelligent. Well dressed and spoken. And, most notably for the films plot, he is entered into a Nike 26-mile marathon for charity.<br/><br/>Dennis is obviously jealous of Whit's involvement in his family's life and in an effort to win back the respect of his ex-girlfriend, Dennis also finds a way to enter the marathon and begins training three weeks before the event. <br/><br/>Most of the comedy accompanies his training. There is his jogging outfit that looks like something Mr. Bean would wear to a public pool. There is his first attempt at running that gets him to the end of his street before cramping up and calling it a day. And then there's the foot blister that caused most of our audience to squirm in their seats and many to watch the scene through the slots in their fingers covering their eyes. This middle section to the film provides a few chuckles without the belly busting laughs.<br/><br/>By the time Dennis finally takes to the starting line alongside nemesis Whit, you can write the ending without having viewed the final reels. Sure, it was touching but the ending was never in doubt and you can draw from countless films of the same ilk to find endings of similar fashion.<br/><br/>As a directorial debut for Schwimmer (theatrical debut, as he has done television work), Run Fatboy Run showed his inexperience. The entire experience played like a BBC television program including some bad cuts between scenes that you could imagine ending abruptly for commercial placement. The pacing was consistent, but that's what we want out of 30-minute comedies. In theatrical events where we pay a good dollar to experience, we want large highs and just enough lows to catch our breath. <br/><br/>Instead we got a 'safe' film where the laughs are produced through our main characters reactions to the situations and people around him. Most notably are the second tier characters, Gordon (Dylan Moran) and Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel). Gordon plays Dennis' best friend and Libby's cousin and does his best to inject some humor into lines and situations that wouldn't warrant these results if the film was based on actual characters. And only the British can make lines such as ""The only serious relationship I've been in ended in a broken collarbone and a dead meerkat."". Not classic, but the audience did render a unanimous snicker. <br/><br/>Mr. Ghoshdashtidar steals a few laughs by acting as Dennis' Miyagi with a spatula. Together with Gordon, the two provide us with the laughs when Dennis is busy trying to get serious again with his plot objectives.<br/><br/>The end result for Run Fatboy Run is that it is a safe and intermittently funny film that will provide you entertainment and have you forget almost everything except for a blister popping scene in the morning. It is a film that does have a heart  it just doesn't have a regular heartbeat and that what keeps it from being more than just another comedy that collects in our viewing catalogues like ties on Father's Day.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"mrtimlarabee","7","3","6","11 March 2008"," Enjoyable, but a little predictable
","""Run, Fatboy Run"" succeeds almost entirely on the strength of the comedic performances here. First thing the viewer needs to keep in mind is that this is not ""Hot Fuzz"" or ""Shaun of the Dead."" That's not to say Pegg's performance isn't key to this film. It is. But it's a different kind of humor, including more broad physical comedy that we don't see in the aforementioned films.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the film is that Simon Pegg's character, Dennis left his pregnant bride, Libby, at the altar. A few years later, his girlfriend has hooked up with Whit, played by Hank Azaria, who Dennis learns runs marathons. Wanting to prove himself to Libby, the out of shape Dennis decides to run in a marathon.<br/><br/>The film is a fairly formulaic romantic comedy. Pegg, who co wrote the script relies not so much on dry sometimes subtle humor, but rather a broad physical humor. He's really good at it and reveals himself a more versatile comedian. The scened where he's working out and actually running attest to that.<br/><br/>The other high point of the film is Gordon, played by Dylan Moran. Gordon is Dennis' friend and Libby's cousin. Dylan Moran has a way of inserting his own comedic personality into things, usually providing some sort of torment for others. This is no exception as he uses various means to urge Dennis to run. Moran is another performer with great comedic timing. He also gets some of the best lines.<br/><br/>Hank Azaria plays Whit. Oddly enough, funny man Azaria gets the straight man role. That doesn't stop him from being entertaining as Dennis' antagonizer. He especially shines when he's trying to take jabs at Dennis' desire to run in the marathon.<br/><br/>Overall, Run Fatboy Run applies a familiar romantic comedy formula. The story itself is rather straightforward and seems a little sophomoric. This film succeeds largely on its actors, especially Pegg and Moran. One strength this has over other rom coms is that despite the outrageous circumstances in the film, it does seem to have a genuine heart that gives the film a brief break from the usual rom com nonsense. It's worth a look, and enjoyable if you're willing to accept that this is a different kind of film than what Pegg has been doing."
"glennsouthall","8","3","6","28 February 2008"," Entertainment is underrated
","Now let's not get technical here. We are not looking at a complex work of art, or a movie with lofty Oscar pretensions, the title alone gives that much away. No. Rather, we are talking about a clean, simple package of fun, neatly wrapped and competently delivered by director David Schwimmer, who comfortably (i'm tempted to say expertly, but i'm not sure it was intentional) provides an American flavour to what is essentially a British farcical comedy and it works very, very well.....sort of Four Weddings meets There's Something About Mary and has a lovechild.<br/><br/>Mind you, DS did have some help. Simon Pegg must be, by a country mile, the best comedy actor out of the UK at the moment. Hank Azaria is so flexible it's untrue and, for me, his portrayal of an obnoxious ""Mr. Perfect"" was the key to where our sympathies lay throughout the entire movie and he nailed it spot on. Then there was the support of the forever-laconic Dylan Moran who provides his usual laid back delivery to some of the best lines in the film. Add to all this a host of cameos from some of the best that British comedy has to offer at the moment and it was hard to fail.<br/><br/>Altogether, this is great, heartwarming fun and 90 minutes of pure, unpretentious entertainment that is well worth the entrance fee. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>but if you are still undecided, then you must try it for no other reason than the performance of Harish Patel as Pegg's landlord, Mr.Ghoshdashtidar. Every scene with him and Pegg is a delight and guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Go see what I mean."
"real_hiflyer","7","3","6","21 February 2008"," A n enjoyable comedy to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy.
","Why are people asking where was Hugh Grant? I mean is he the only comedic British actor they can think of? Suggesting he replace the Simon Pegg Character would be gross miscasting of the first order. Okay, this movie isn't rocket science. And sure it's predictable, how many story lines can you think of right off the bat that haven't been done to death already? Once you've accepted this as a given instead of a complaint - chill out, relax, sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>If I could be a fly on the wall while they were filming this movie, I'm sure there was more than one trade-off as to whether which type of humor, British or American, would crossover best. As a fan of British comedy series - Spaced being one of the best of many - I realize there is a large section of the American market that just don't get it. There's no comparing American Pie, a crass, gross, brain dead offering appealing to the basest of gross and sordid humor, to this. That type of American humor is like a punch in the face which is dummed down for the audience type it's designed for. And it sells.<br/><br/>So okay, this wasn't a masterpiece. Neither was it a dud. It was a humorous middle of the road movie good for what it was meant for. An hour or two of light entertainment unfolding in it's own manner, in this case a pretty funny and well-paced timeout with laughs built in. I enjoyed it, and part of that enjoyment was in not faulting it for being something different than exactly what it claimed to be. Now Hot Fuzz was a hilarious tongue in cheek comedy of a different order altogether. I really can see why Americans would sit down at that movie and say huh?"

","Now I'm not an ideal audience to review this movie. I don't like Simon Pegg, I don't find him funny and I've never enjoyed one of his films yet so this review might be just a slight tad biased against the film.<br/><br/>I'll try my best to be objective but it won't be easy. Pegg plays Dennis who jilts his stunningly beautiful bride to be (played by Thandie Newton, is he insane?) on their wedding day.<br/><br/>Don't you already hate him? NO? Did I mention she's heavily pregnant with his child? Do you hate him now? Yes? Good!<br/><br/>Now I truly don't understand why they chose this title. At the start of the film he's not fat, 5 years later he's not fat either. That's just a bit of a paunch, and as he's a smoker it's not a surprise.<br/><br/>Pegg is an exceptionally pathetic character who is hard to root for. There aren't many laughs in the film (the little boy giving Pegg the finger on the night bus is hysterical!) and the running ""joke"" (because it is never funny) of Pegg locking himself out of his flat isn't even funny the 1st time it happens.<br/><br/>The whole training sequence is totally wrong. I've run 2 marathons myself and been a road runner for more than 15 years, you NEVER train by running in the middle of the road. It'll get you killed really quickly. Also for man who just had a nail jammed into his foot he isn't limping when he goes to see the Nike people.<br/><br/>Whats even worse is he's still training in the same stupid plimsols that gave him a gigantic blister in the 2nd training sequence, I also don't see how skipping or running up steps is going to help train for running on mostly flat roads. The whole drinking raw eggs thing is a total myth too (and tastes disgusting!). I understand their parodying the original Rocky training sequence but that's only funny if your making a movie where Dennis's end goal is a boxing match, which it isn't.<br/><br/>Now as kind as his landlord may think he's being, giving Dennis a brand new pair of running shoes less than 3 weeks before the race is a really stupid idea. He'll have no time at all to break them in, it takes at least 2 months to break in new running shoes fully.<br/><br/>The chances of them televising a Marathon thats only in it's 1st year is pretty low to be honest, especially one that's only got 10,000 runners (that's not a very big field at all).<br/><br/>Also them putting a drinks station away from the actual route of the race would never happen. Likewise the shots of cars behind Dennis, most Marathons keep the roads closed for at least 5 hours for slow runners & stragglers so that wouldn't just happen either. It's stupid that they wouldn't know who Dennis is, they can see his race number, its a matter of minutes to ask who registered under that number.<br/><br/>The TV guy says Dennis broke his ankle, I'm sorry but no matter how fit you are, your not going to run even a metre on a broken ankle let alone another 9 miles like Dylan Moran told Dennis he had left to go. Anyway, the race organisers would have stopped him and pulled him off the course after a certain amount of time (especially after the report of his broken ankle) due to insurance reasons.<br/><br/>Once Dennis spots Thandie Newton & his son past the finish line he suddenly ""forgets"" his broken ankle (he doesn't even limp or hobble like he was before, highly unlikely).<br/><br/>It's never said exactly when the next scene takes place but Dennis is walking OK so I'd have to assume its at least 6 or more weeks later (thats how long a broken ankle would stay in plaster). This is an incredibly weak ending, nothing is resolved.<br/><br/>Has Thandie left Hank Azaria? Has Dennis got his flat back? Are Dennis and Thandie getting back together?<br/><br/>Far too many questions left unresolved. A really weak ending in a pretty bad film."

","Simon Pegg jilts his pregnant fiancée at the altar, but comes to regret it five years later when he meets the new man in his ex-girlfriend's life, a successful American hedge fund manager. Pegg, worried that the new man will supplant him in his five-year-old son's affections, plans to win his former girlfriend back by running the London Marathon. With a fortnight's training. And entirely predictable results.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, I was really looking forward to this one. But sadly, it falls well short. It's difficult to muster much sympathy for Pegg's character, and Hank Azaria (voice of Moe the Bartender, Apu and Chief Wiggum in The Simpsons) is wasted as Pegg's rival. Dylan Moran is dull, too. Thandie Newton looks gorgeous, but that's not really enough.<br/><br/>I'm amazed that this has done so well at the British box office. But if I were you, I wouldn't bother."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","16 April 2008"," Predictable underdog story; entertaining British humour
","Simon Pegg is probably the main draw for me, after I've seen what he can do in ""Hot Fuzz"", taking black humour and outlandish farce to the very limit. It's a different role he plays here in Fatboy, a pathetic underdog, but with enough fire in his belly to flare up in the critical moment. Pegg has certainly done it again.<br/><br/>The plot is predictability personified  a lazy loser who abandoned his impregnated girlfriend five years ago comes back to win her back, together with their son, from the present suitor who outclasses him in every department. If you have watched enough movies, you can probably write the script yourself after watching just the first couple of scenes. Some of the humour is really right down low but seem to be more effective in a British context than Hollywood. And despite the absolute predictability, the finale can still get you aroused and have you cheering.<br/><br/>It's been 8 years now since MI-2, but 35-year-old Thandie Newton still has that charm of melancholy, girlish vulnerability that makes a guy throw down his life to her rescue at the drop of a hat. And, as usual in this kind of movie, there is an assortment of oddities of a side cast to have you too busy to worry about weak plots, limp stories and all that - and a good one here."

","I have seen this 20+ times and it is still a 10 in my book of feel-good movies. Pegg, Black and Schwimmer did it and should do it again. A good movie is a movie that give you some thing to go when it ends. One of the best actor turning director debut. Not a Friend's fan so did not expect much from this. Totally surprised. Some times I laugh at the characters, like when Pegg and Moran fight on their way out from the crocked piano dealers. Most of the time one laugh at the things that hit close to home. The recognition is spotted here and there. It is not a deep movie with extraordinary acting performances. It is in the more plain depiction side of the art where we find ordinary characters being ordinary end experiencing extraordinary ordinary circumstances. It feels effortless but it is the key to its magic. It pulls the audience in instead of just exposing its content to them. There is no threshold between the story and reality. For one and a half hour the audience and the characters story is the same."

","For his pedigree as a prestigious theatrical director, it's somewaht odd that David Schwimmer's directorial debut is an innocent popcorn comedy. Then again he's best known for a sitcom role, but it would have been nice to see Schwimmer try to escape that reputation.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, ""Run Fatboy Run"" is a perfectly watchable popcorn comedy about an aimless man in arrested development (Simon Pegg) who runs a marathon as a hail mary pass to win back his ersatz ex-wife/baby mama (Thandie Newton). The backstory (mercifully expositioned out of the way in the film's first three minutes) is that the protagonist left Newton's character at the altar on their wedding night out of fear. This sets up a rather obvious but serviceable character arc: The man's a loser because he's a commitment-phobe so finishing the race will represent his ability to commit.<br/><br/>The film is set in London with a certain British whimsy in terms of many of the side characters including Harish Patel as a quirky yet sweet downstairs neighbor, Dylan Moran as the opportunistic best friend, and Nevan Finegan as a sexy no-nonsense landlady.<br/><br/>The film can be firmly divided into two halves: Before Simon Pegg's character runs a marathon, and the marathon itself.<br/><br/>In the first act, it's pretty typical with obvious foreshadowing and comedy that seems a little overly reliant on grotesque physical in a manner reminiscent of the ""Three Stooges"" (or what I'd imagine the Three Stooges to be): In one scene, Pegg's character gets a nail in his toe in an effort to pop a blister; in another, he and Moran's character get into a fight that's played for humor based on the pain that the two are in. If you've seen the Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern be repeatedly bludgeoned in ""Home Alone"" you'll get the picture.<br/><br/>What really elevates the film is when he starts running the marathon and the subplots merge into more of a kinetic frenzy. The humor of bodily pain starts to segue into the tropes of a feel-good movie.<br/><br/>This is one of the few wide-release running films and there's a lot of relatable stuff here in how annoying other runners can be, how some of the good running tips don't make sense until you're on the track, how will power will only take you so far without practice, and how running a long-distance race is often about the light at the end of the tunnel."

","I get the feeling that Simon Pegg, after building up such a huge following from Spaced, and Shaun of the Dead/Hot Fuzz, seems to be trying to sell out almost as quickly. Like Ricky Gervais & Hugh Grant, he just keeps appearing everywhere.<br/><br/>First two strikes for me were for Big Nothing, a meandering mess of a film with gormless David Schwimmer reprising his 'Oh gee whizz' countenance through a film with too many ridiculous twists. Strike two was for Free Jimmy, an computer animated cartoon featuring a junkie elephant, and utter rubbish...so, strike three for 'Run Fat Boy, Run'? ...No...not really. I kind of liked the film. Simon Pegg seems to be doing the best he can with the material he's presented, (and I guess that goes also for Big Nothing, and Free Jimmy too). OK, the plot came right out of the Brit-com by numbers formula script writing (One downtrodden but lovable guy, one quirky beautiful love interest, one oddball best friend, one slimy rich cad, one cute kid, and one disgraceful old lady with a foul mouth, a lot of the London skyline, and a fair bit of shmaltz) - Well, Run Fat Boy, Run contains all of those to varying degrees, so anyone who loved 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jones' or 'Four Weddings' will not be displeased.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, I was a bit surprised to find Dylan Moran's character so badly underused. Dylan, a rare gem of a stand-up comedian, does nothing more than deliver his lines in the film, and, as an embarrassing (and pretty weak) running gag, has his bare bottom shown. - Using Dylan Moran for a cheap sight-gag like that is like hiring a cordon bleu chef to microwave a pizza. It's a huge waste! The rest of the supporting cast are credible. Frank Azaria's villain, to be honest, was still, too nice. Likable, even! However, the pacing of the film was all wrong, and the 'nastiness' factor of Azaria's character was ramped up too little too late. The Indian landlord was another staple of the 'britcom by numbers' formula, but he did add a fair degree of humour to the proceedings, instead of just being stuck in there for the hell of it....<br/><br/>...and OK, maybe I've painted a bad picture of this movie. It's not bad, there are moments of genuine laughter to be had, amid the shmaltz, pratfalls & lame running gags, but don't expect to leave the cinema clutching your ribs, or with a profound sense of witnessing something amazing. Run, Fat Boy Run won't hasten Pegg's transformation into a 2-dimensional Ricky Gervais wannabe, but it does him no favours. However, it does prove one thing. David Schwimmer's post-Friends humour & star appeal is dwindling...!"

","If you're looking for a good romantic comedy to take a date to or something right now, go to see Run Fatboy Run. Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame (along with other comedies and Spaced, a popular British TV show) co-writes and acts in a movie about a man who, five years after running out on his pregnant fiancée on the day of their wedding, attempts to win her back by beating her American boyfriend at a marathon--no easy feat as he's lazy, overweight, out of shape, and generally lacks the whole discipline thing to really make something of himself.<br/><br/>The majority of the proceeds is straight-up rom-com fare: the at-appearances wonderful successful boyfriend (Hank Azaria) is actually a jerk, the underdog flies his way up the presentability ladder to become someone the female just can't resist, and he proves himself to the greater of society as well. Conflict is in the form of romantic feud, people who obviously don't believe in him, and a general unimpressed world to contend with. Nothing is unexpected.<br/><br/>But the point of these fares are really to entertain and beget optimism, and hey, Simon Pegg is GREAT at that. He's honestly a really good actor, and does his role with aplomb. Meanwhile, he's backed up by Shaun of the Dead supporter Dylan Moran and an attractive and lovable Thandie Newton. Whether for a night out for some good escapism or maybe a rental for friends, it serves up a well-known and well-made dish.<br/><br/>Just... don't see it with anybody in the medical or athletic health profession.

"movedout","6","2","5","2 April 2008"," Broadly funny, just lacks the wit to take it to the next level
","It's strange to see Simon Pegg go from subverting clichés to embracing a film so riddled with them and even more surprisingly, with his tongue nowhere to be seen near his cheek. Somewhere along the way, Pegg and his fellow scribe, one of the funniest people in the world (in my very humble opinion), Michael Ian Black forgot that they started writing a parody of rom-com/underdog/sports films and instead just went through the motions of making yet another trite and thoroughly conventional feel-good sapfest. And to be fair to Black, his script was rewritten by Pegg to take place in London instead of its original Los Angeles setting and anglicised to follow suit. Take a closer look and you might see director David Schwimmer's name nestled between Pegg and his co-star Thandie Newton.<br/><br/>""Run Fatboy Run"" begins as if it was the day after a Happily Ever After in an unlikely romantic comedy. Deadbeat Dennis (Pegg) is moments away from getting married to Lovely Libby (Newton), a smart and ambitious beauty way above his station who he's gotten pregnant. What does a spineless buffoon do other than run? Literally, away from her, the presiding minister, friends and family. Six years later, the shame from that moment of cowardice forms the very fundamentals of Dennis's life: unhealthy, insecure, broke, undependable and without prospects. The one bright spark left over is a cordial relationship with Libby and a relatively affectionate one with their young son, Jake (Matthew Fenton). Dennis's life on the precipice is shaken when Libby introduces her seemingly perfect new American boyfriend Whit (Hank Azaria) who's successful, financially secure, considerate and ready for a long-term relationship. Faced with a future without Libby and Jake, Dennis attempts to prove to those around him that he can follow through with his promises by running the same marathon as Whit.<br/><br/>Pegg gives a strong showing here and shows that he's not only naturally funny and self-effacing but a decent actor. Schwimmer does well to frame his shots at Pegg by showing his face and expressions as he reacts to things around him that he's shown to be powerless to control. We start to believe him when he finally understands that Libby is the love of his life, as opposed to being someone he hopes to selfishly possess, and in these very small ways, we get a main character that's real enough to root for. Pegg also knows the score when he's in his element. He's fearless when it comes to the paunchy physicality of the role  the schoolyard chases, the training montages as he heaves and hos  but is also verbally adroit enough to deliver some genuine zingers.<br/><br/>Pegg doesn't get to have the only laugh here. The film populates a sleazy best friend, Gordon (Dylan Moran) and an ingratiating Indian landlord, Mr. Ghoshdashidar (Harish Patel) around Dennis's objective of completing the marathon. Moran is a scene-steal by all regards. He delivers the best lines and is filled with the unpredictable, wacky comic energy that's conspicuously left restrained in the rest of the film. While a riot, Patel always stays one joke shy from being an offensively stereotype and slots in well the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Perhaps a victim of the rewrite, the film finds its way close to pandering double takes and uneven characterisations, most conspicuously in the handling of Whit who's at once faultless and perilously villainous at others. The tired scent of mediocrity rears the closer the film inches towards its hokey pay-off and you've suddenly got a film that's so much lesser than the sum of its parts."

","I loved the leading actor in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, and then I heard that this was directed by Friends star David Schwimmer. To be honest, though I was a bit disappointed, and completely agree with the critics' two out of five stars. Basically Dennis (Simon Pegg) ran away from marrying his pregnant fiancée Libby (Crash's Thandie Newton), and five years later he has become a slightly overweight security guard. Libby of course allows him access to his son, and Dennis everyday tries to persuade her to take him back, but fails. He finds out she has found a new partner in the form of American showoff Whit (The Simpsons' Hank Azaria). When Dennis hears about the upcoming London Thames River-run marathon, he vows that for once he will finish something, so he starts training. As you'd probably expect there is a point where Dennis gives up when Libby is proposed to by Whit, but he recovers and the marathon begins. Whit unexpectedly turns on Dennis, by purposely tripping him up, causing him to sprain his ankle, but he is still determined to finish and get Libby and his son to support him, and of course, his plan to get them back succeeds. Also starring Dylan Moran as Gordon, Harish Patel as Mr. Ghoshdashtidar, Matthew Fenton as Jake, The Fast Show's Simon Day as Vincent, EastEnders' Ameet Chana as Taxi Driver, Chris Hollins, Denise Lewis, David Walliams as Man in Bakery and Peter Serafinowicz as TV Commentator.

"jaredmobarak","6","2","5","21 March 2008"," A son? Did you know he had a son?!Run Fatboy Run
","Do not let the Hollywood marketing machine fool you. Yes Simon Pegg stars in Run Fatboy Run and yes he has co-writer credit on it, however, this is not a Pegg/Wright/Park production like Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, and ""Spaced."" No this is a story from the warped mind of Michael Ian Black, he of ""The State"" fame. It appears from the ""story by"" credit to Black that maybe Pegg came in late with some tweaks and rewrites after he was cast. There is a bit of him on displaysome British humor and the use of cyclical stunts to add some funny as an incident hearkens back to earlier in the filmat the end, though, this is a different kind of comedy. While I won't go as far as some reviews I've read that being a fan of Fuzz and Shaun means you will hate this, I can see where they are coming from. Not quite complete physical humor nor subtle rhetoric; this falls in a niche of most generic comedies coming down the pipeline. It has some fantastic parts, though, and I am a fan of Black's work, so I will admit to having a smile for most of the duration. As long as you don't expect genius, (or a cameo from Nick Frost), you should still have a fun time despite your comedic predilections.<br/><br/>The synopsis is that a common Joe, with low self-esteem, let the love of his life go due to a fit of nerves and self-loathing. Five years later and his life is at an all-time low, getting his son arrested, watching a successful American make the moves with his ex, having money problems, and just going through the motions of a life he has resigned himself to living. With all odds against him, Dennis, (Pegg), signs up for a Nike marathon to show that he's not a quitter. Don't let that tried and true gimmick to win back his love fool you; the race is actually a somewhat small part of the whole and serves as a springboard for more situations in which he can get into trouble with during training. I'll admit that the broad comedy got old and was way too obvious, making me yearn for the humor I know Pegg is used to delivering, but I kept reminding myself that ""Friend"" Ross Gellar himself had the reins, so I took it for what it was. Sometimes a little crassness can be fun when used sparingly.<br/><br/>I would say that the film had heart, but those moments are too sentimental to really praise. The music has a tendency to swell and the script starts to pull at the heart-strings before fading back as a new joke emerges. If handled a bit more deftly this could have been a much better film because the makings are definitely there. Story threads like that of the son and his first crush during the time his mother is dating a new man are glossed over too easily, used for dramatic emphasis in the life of our lead rather than a way to flesh out the characters around him. With so many supporting roles, I wish we'd have been given more of a complete story instead of using them as props to have Pegg bounce off of. That said, the other actors are really good with the one-way story arcs they are given.<br/><br/>I have always been a Hank Azaria fan. The guy is so likable that he can play the jerk to perfection. I felt bad for him at times being reduced to acting some of the situations scripted, (the lazily written locker room scene comes to mind), but he is perfect for the role, laying some sharp jabs at the right time and always being genuinely happy to see someone willing to go through a marathon, an obsession of his own, while inwardly laughing at the absurdity of Pegg finishing it. Thandie Newton does well as the woman caught between these two men. With not much to really do, she is still effective in showing the emotional back and forth happening. We also get Harish Patel as Pegg's Indian landlord and friend, but the role comes off too much as a caricature to really praise, other then a good word for the man playing it. The saving grace to everything, though, is Dylan Moran. Maybe it is because I have begun to watch his fantastic British series ""Black Books,"" but he warrants a laugh each time he is on screen. From his relationship with Newton (cousin) and Pegg (best friend), to his gambling lifestyle, to his self-hiring as fitness coach, Moran is absolutely priceless. His dialogue and actions at his cousin's birthday party are worth seeing the movie by itself.<br/><br/>Run Fatboy Run end sup being more for the Farrelly Brothers crowd than the British humor ones. That may actually hurt it being that so many Americans hate English accents and find them hard to understand. Hopefully it will find its audience, though, because despite its watered-down execution, any way to get UK faces like Pegg and Moran some time in the Hollywood limelight is a good thing. I just wish they'd market it for what it is, a comedy by David Schwimmer, not a new masterpiece from the people that brought us a couple of modern-day classics. It's funny and it's entertaining for an evening out, but it's not necessarily something I'd seek out to see againwell except the race at the end, some real good stuff does go on there."

","Run Fat Boy Run is predictable. In the last half hour or so, there is an immense amount of clichés. There is also a lot of laughs in this movie, the first to be directed by David Schwimmer.<br/><br/>Dennis Doyle ( Simon Pegg ) is a down and out security guard. He left his wife Libby ( Thandie Newton ) at the altar 5 years previously pregnant. Suffice to say that he is not the most reliable nor up and coming man on the face of the Earth. However he is galvanised into action when Libby gets a new boyfriend Whit ( Hank Azaria ) who seems like the perfect catch: rich, sincere and who runs marathons for charity. Dennis declares his intention to run in the marathon as well, in order to prove to Libby he can commit. He is helped in this enterprise by his friend Gordon ( Dylan Moran ), who also has an ulterior motive as he has bet all his cash on Dennis completing the race.<br/><br/>Run Fat Boy Run has got a cast that all works well together. Simon Pegg reprises the sort of slacker role he played in Shaun of the Dead, while Thandie Newton is lovely as the torn Libby. Hank Azaria plays the affable but somewhat irritating Whit very well and Dylan Moran excels as the seedy Gordon. Add to that a hilarious cameo by David Walliams who looks like he just walked off a Little Britain set as well as Harish Patel as the landlord/assistant coach and there isn't a moment of this film that the cast seems to be slacking.<br/><br/>Run Fat Boy Run is a great film to watch, despite of its formulaic structure. David Schwimmer may have found a new career."

","This film is about an unsuccessful man who walked out of his wedding. Five years later, he tries to win back his woman by participating in a marathon.<br/><br/>Instead of being a ridiculous tale of a man doing silly things, ""Run Fatboy Run"" is an inspirational and moving tale of a man who strives to achieve his goal. Dennis' enormous determination and perseverance shown in the film is deeply touching. Libby and Jake are also very likable characters, providing Dennis a reason to live and fight.<br/><br/>The scenery is remarkable, and every London outdoor scene can be on a postcard! The marathon scenes by the Tower Bridge are quite amazing, as I am sure it took a lot of effort to organise such a massive shooting in the centre of London.<br/><br/>Another reason to enjoy ""Run Fatboy Run"" is the light hearted delivery of the material. Many funny jokes are thrown in as the backdrop of a moving tale, which successfully entertains without making the film cheesy or less credible. ""Run Fatboy Run"" is surprisingly entertaining and engaging. It definitely is a runaway success."

","For someone who felt let down by the overlong mess that Hot Fuzz turned out to be, I didn't hold out much hope for another Simon Pegg comedy that, on paper at least, looks as if it is merely reheating a load of tired old comedy clichés that we've all seen countless times before. Well, while this film is just a rehash of old plots, it does have a sweet nature at its core that just about makes it worth watching.<br/><br/>Pegg plays Dennis, a thirty-something everyman-cum-loser whose only exercise in recent times was a sprint away from his pregnant bride (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day five years earlier. When we meet him in the present day, Dennis is a chain-smoking security guard living alone in a tiny flat, still ruing the mistake he made, and half-heartedly attempting to get back in his ex-'s good books. When he discovers she has embarked on a relationship with super-smooth US businessman Whit (Hank Azaria), Dennis determines to run a marathon to prove he can both change as a person and finish what he has started.<br/><br/>What doesn't look too promising on paper is saved largely by a likable cast and a relatively high gag-quotient which stops the viewer from getting bored, even though you can see many of the gags coming a mile off. Pegg and co-writer Michael Ian Black hammer the running metaphor into the ground until even the dimmest of us understand the movie's 'message' and, like those runners portrayed on the screen, the film is ushered along a pre-determined route that precludes any possibility of unexpected twists or turns. Stand-up comic Dylan Moran gets most of the best lines as Dennis's gambling-addict best friend, and could conceivably have been a better choice for the central role."

","Well, after Hot Fuzz I thought that Simon Pegg might have burnt his boats. I found it hard to see any one beating Shaun of the Dead - Just brilliant buffoonery..<br/><br/>So having seen R.FB.R. I can wholeheartedly recommend this gem to connoisseurs of fun, stupidity and absurdity. A touch of romance too! Of course it will probably not stand the test of time and will probably be forgotten by the end of the year, but who cares! Those wanting to be entertained with laughs that occasionally cause stomach pains will be pleased. But you need to 'get' British humour. Those expecting any intellectual immersion should go to bed early and avoid this! <br/><br/>It was so er, 'pleasant' to see Thandie Newton ( sigh!) again. Who can forget her in those skin tight frocks in 'Chronicles of Riddick'. But I was even more pleased to find Dylan Moran in there too. He does ""I can't control the world for you...you idiots... I cant do it for myself!!"" so well. If you have watched him live or in 'Black Books' you will know this.<br/><br/>Excellent movie see it!"
"jonnyk12","7","2","5","27 February 2008"," Funny Average
","This is probably one of funniest films I've seen at the cinema for a long time, and plus it's British (I think) and that's always a good sign. It stars Simon Pegg (star of Hot Fuzz and the cult classic Shaun of the Dead) who does another flawless performance playing a guy called Dennis, who has run away from all the difficult decisions in his life, this ends up with him running the marathon to win back his ex-fiancé, Libby (Thandie Newton), who is going out with a fit, rich American bloke celled Whit (Hank Azaria, voices of loads of the Simpsons characters). Most of the film is Dennis training, but that's the best part so it doesn't matter. There are a lot of great and memorable moments, like when Dennis and Gordon (Dylan Moran) his best friend have a hilarious fight, which leads to both of them in a lot of pain. You maybe thinking how I gave it 3 stars with all these good comments, well the fact is that it is an average film, average humour and average romance. The best feature of the film is the cast defiantly, Dylan Moran doing a brilliant performance as Gordon, Simon Pegg doing same as always and Hank Azaria doing a great job acting like an average American rich snob, this film also contains some little scenes with David Walliams and Stephen Merchant."
"trovster","8","2","5","14 January 2008"," Great collaboration between Schwimmer and Pegg
","David Schwimmer is at the helm in his theatrical directorial début, Run, Fatboy, Run: a story of love and perseverance but with a heavy twist of humour. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Dennis, the hapless protagonist yearning after his ex-fiancée, who he left pregnant at the altar five years ago! Now a washed-up, unfit (but not fat) security guard for a lingerie store, he is trying to win back the respect of his son and the love of his life.<br/><br/>This isn't the first time Simon Pegg and David Schwimmer have collaborated. They starred alongside one another in the overlooked heist-gone-wrong comedy of confusion and betrayal, Big Nothing. I highly recommend both Big Nothing and Run, Fatboy, Run if you're a fan of British humour and sarcasm."
"mako-24","7","2","5","29 November 2007"," The performance is halfway decent.
","Ever since The Pallbearer, David Schwimmer has nestled quietly in a limbo of Friends vs. Friends. In Run, Fat Boy, Run, you can feel the same Schwimmeresque hopelessness that carries throughout this light yet dark comedy. <br/><br/>And unfortunately, Simon Pegg is not at his game without the direction of his longtime companion and virtual director, Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>In essence, Schwimmer totally understands the nuance of British Life, but fails to intertwine the magic that both Shaun and Fuzz permeate throughout the film. The vignette of Simon Pegg's plight is notable and worthy of the American try, but the simple nuance of things like Ricky Gervais' performance in The Office brings the stark reality between an American imitating BritCom, and Brits doing their thing.<br/><br/>So directly, when you watch R, FB, R, be sure to accept that we Americans truly appreciate the vein of nonsensical British humor, but still, as the expanse of the Atlantic, really just don't get it just yet.<br/><br/>David, you are the King, I wish you'd do more."

","A jolly good jape - in the Notting Hill/4 Weddings mould. In fact if Hugh Grant were playing the lead role it would be a typical Hugh Grant film! The plot holds together nicely and you can read the details in other reviews, but there are some brilliant performances including one from Dennis's (Pegg) Asian landlord Mr Ghoshdashtidar (Harish Patel) who completely steals the wheelchair scene. There are cameo performances by Stephen Merchant and David Walliams which add nothing special other than to give the film a certain ""street cred"".<br/><br/>David Schwimmer's debut as a director is a wholesome family effort, pleasing harmless fun, and should be viewed as such. If you are looking for deep meaning and plot twists - forget it. It does exactly what it says on the tin."

","Ever since I saw Shaun of the Dead a few years back I have become a fan of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright. All three have produced some very good entertainment in their careers so far.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is great at playing ordinary people, and Run Fatboy Run proves just that! His performance is probably the best thing this film has to offer, and it is worth seeing this film just to see him in his role!<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, well it's pretty good too. OK so it does feel a little predictable and americanised for a British film, but then that's obvious since this film is directed by David Schwimmer (of 'Friends' fame). Nethertheless, it's a pretty good film with one or two humorous moments. The other actors and actresses in the film also play their roles well, and is a very well made film despite the low budget they had."

I guess I didn't expect too much more from Schwimmer (I'm sure he'll get better with experience), but Pegg really should know better. <br/><br/>This is a pretty feeble effort by all concerned, which, at times, is so cloyingly smothered in saccharine that you almost expect an irate Richard Curtis to appear, demanding royalties and screaming about breach of copyright. <br/><br/>3/10"

It's not that the comedy isn't juvenile -- (I mean, American Pie was juvenile) it's just that's it not very funny.<br/><br/>Ealing this ain't. More like a blown up sitcom.

","After seeing the trailer a few times, a worrisome feeling could not be ignored. Not only is this a romance comedy, it also seems to be incorporating ""American humor"" (Body jokes and people acting stupidly). However, this film also have witty dialogues, quirky British humor and a meaningful story.<br/><br/>The story isn't anything new. Dennis, played Simon Pegg, abandons his pregnant fiancée right before their wedding. Few years later, he is working as a security guard and he visits his son. His fiancée is now engaged with another man and are planning on getting married soon. In an attempt to win her back, he decides to participate in the London Marathon humorously sporting a Erectile Dysfunction Awareness shirt.<br/><br/>The film is actually very funny. Although some of the jokes weren't that funny, there are plenty that will make you laugh. Also, I am not a fan of the Will Ferrell type humor and although some comedic scenes are influenced by such type of humor, there are plenty of British humor that kept the humor diverse.<br/><br/>Despite this film being a romance comedy, I think that many guys can enjoy this film. The character Gordon, played by Dylan Moran who played a minor role in Shaun of the Dead, Dennis, and Dennis's landlord keeps the laugh going. He was the best character in the film. With all of its laughs, the film has its heartfelt moments too. The lesson of not running away from problems is discussed throughout the film. The ending is perfect for a romance comedy and it can be seen from way from the beginning. Despite its predictability, it is a very nice one. Overall Run Fat Boy Run is a thoughtful movie that is perfect for dates and will have plenty of laughs."

","Run Fatboy Run (2007): Dir: David Schwimmer / Cast: Simon Pegg, Thandie Newton, Hank Azaria, Dylan Moran, Harish Patel: Hilarious comedy about encouragement yet the title also symbolizes fear of commitment as well. Simon Pegg stars as Dennis Doyle who flees from the alter leaving his pregnant fiancé behind. Five years later he is an out of shape security guard threatened when someone else takes his place. He decides to run in a marathon in hopes of proving himself. Director David Schwimmer does a decent job at getting viewers pumped up and behind Pegg as he embarks upon this challenge. Simon Pegg shines as a deadbeat just as he did in Shaun of the Dead. Here he realizes his mistake and sets out to correct it by correcting himself. Thandie Newton plays his forgiving ex-fiancée, Libby who has moved on to another relationship. Hank Azaria plays her new boyfriend who puts on a fake front and tries to call out Pegg. He is successful and looks down upon Pegg all the more for not being so. Finally Dylan Moran plays Libby's cousin Gordon who is also Pegg's best friend. Moran steals moments particularly when betting on Pegg with this marathon thus adding more pressure. Harish Patel plays his landlord who takes up the task of training him and uses odd methods to do so. Wonderful inspiring comedy about self worth that should have viewers cheering. Score: 10 / 10"

He's not so up his own backside that he can't make fun of himself and in this - as with a lot of his films - he doesn't paint himself well, but comes good at the end.<br/><br/>Dennis (Pegg) is a bit of a loser, a ""nearly man"" and someone who never sees something through including marrying love of his life and mother of his child Libby (the beautiful Thandie Newton), leaving her 'at the altar' so to speak. Five years on and he's in a dead end job, and seeing Libby get it together with good-looking, rich, fit American hedge-fund manager Whit (Hank Azaria) who has the best of everything, and so the competition begins for both the favour of Libby and the attention of their son, Jake. The competition between the two is padded out by funny interactions between him and his landlord (Harish Patel) and Libby's cousin/his friend played by the timing-genius Dylan Moran. Spot Stephen Merchant, David Walliams and Floella Benjamin to name a few familiar faces dotted through the film.<br/><br/>Whilst there's nothing particularly outstanding in Run Fat Boy Run there are some great comedic moments (the lingerie shoplifter and the spin-class portion were particular hoots), some heart and the take home message about how the underdog can win if they work hard. It's predictable to a certain extent but it's just a nice film typical of Simon Pegg's oftentimes cringeworthy sort of humour; always well executed and cleverly written. Sadly no Nick Frost in this one!"

Simon Pegg (yes, that is the guy from ""Shaun of the Dead"") plays our hero, Dennis. Dennis makes a lot of really bad decisions, but don't we all? We are easily able to laugh at him and cheer him on. As his best friend says to Dennis, ""You left her at the altar when she was pregnant."" Dennis: ""But that was ages ago."" Gordon: ""Women tend to remember that stuff."" We do. It's comedy though when it happens to somebody else. The always funny Hank Azaria plays Libby's new beau, Whit. Azaria is the type of great actor that when we need to root for Dennis, he makes it okay for us to hate Whit.<br/><br/>This is a fairly typical comedic romance - not a romantic comedy since its comedy first and slightly more male-oriented. You will know exactly how the movie is going to play out, but it's so funny that the jokes distract you from the fairly lame plot.<br/><br/>For those turned off by the title, the writers do know that Simon Pegg isn't exactly fat. As Dennis says, ""I'm not fat, I'm just unfit"".

","Perpetual loser Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) has never finished anything in his life - and that includes marrying the mother of his child, Libby (Thandie Newton). He runs off on their wedding day, and their relationship has been strained ever since.<br/><br/>Five years later, his son is growing and now he has to deal with Libby's perfect boyfriend, Whit (Hank Azaria). He learns that Whit is a runner for charity, and decides this is the chance he has to win back Libby's heart and actually complete something - by competing in a 26 mile run.<br/><br/>The only problem is he is completely out of shape. He enlists the help of his friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and neighbor to help him out, with hilarious results.<br/><br/>Finally the day comes, and it's the biggest day in Dennis's life. Will be complete the race and win back Libby's heart? Simon Pegg is one of the most underrated comedians of our time (see ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" if you don't believe me). Once again, he delivers comedic gold with ""Run, Fat Boy, Run."" Directed by David Schwimmer of ""Friends"" fame, not only does the film deliver on the laughs, but also on the importance of finishing something important in your life, despite everyone's doubts. A truly hilarious and heartfelt film, one that shouldn't be missed."
"Spaceygirl","7","1","2","2 September 2008"," One of the better Rom-Coms out there
","Okay, I don't DO Romantic Comedies. I have an absolute aversion to anything even remotely resembling a love-story with laughs. There are notable exceptions however, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" being one of them, and now ""Run Fat Boy Run"". For a start, Simon Pegg is in it. As an actor he's hilarious. He manages to play his role with a self-deprecating air with a character that in less skillful hands would have been completely unlikeable. Thandie Newton is also in it, and as usual, she's luminous and turns out a star performance. Hank Azaria pulls a performance out of nowhere. Usually I can't stand him, but in this he's actually funny, and girls, check out those abs! OMG! The best thing about ""Run Fat Boy run"" is that, unlike most Romantic Comedies, there is no lag in the middle. It's played for laughs all the way and hilarious throughout. Thank you Mr Schwimmer for restoring my faith in romcoms!"
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","19 August 2008"," Follows a few conventions, but a good natured funny comedy
","In David Schwimmer' s direction debut, Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) stars as Dennis, a man who left his fiancé pregnant at the alter. 5 years on, Dennis still loves the same woman, and wants to prove his love by competing in the Nike river run.<br/><br/>After the delightful Shaun of the dead and the even more brilliant Hot Fuzz, I was all geared up to see Pegg in another comedy, and though enjoyable and fun, doesn't live up to his other classics.<br/><br/>Following many comedy and romantic conventions, Run fat boy run is predictable in some ways, but quite unique in others. The ending may surprise some critiques, but the formula of the plot, the guy and the girl routing won't surprise anyone.<br/><br/>Nonetheless Pegg's lovability and the comedy encoded keeps the film intriguing, not to mention Schwimmer's excellent direction, which was a nice surprise as direction is very tricky, and especially hard in comedies but the Friends star pulled it off and there isn't a fault which will go a long way in his career.<br/><br/>Having comic geniuses such as Pegg, Dylan Moran (Black Books) and Hank Azaria (The Simpsons) does help. The on screen relationship between all is brilliant to watch, none more so than Pegg and Moran, who are easily the funniest people in the 100 minute film.<br/><br/>I prefer British comedies more so than American as there is always more realism to the jokes and the story, and though following romantic conventions, this rom com delights with a different approach to the genre.<br/><br/>Many comedies can lack at certain points during films, especially towards the end, but Run Fat Boy Run keeps the comedy alive all the way through, which makes it unique and enjoyable throughout.<br/><br/>Though following romantic conventions, this 2007 comedy is sharp, funny all the way through, and extremely well directed, which makes a worthwhile watch."
"ichocolat","Null","1","2","12 May 2008"," Funny Brit Comedy !
","Boy oh boy oh boy ! This movie is simply fantastic ! Alright, I might get carried away with the comment, though. I've just finished watching it and II just cant wait to post my comment here.<br/><br/>But first, let me admit that I seldom watched British films, because I don't quite understand the humor and the British slang. And I admit that I didn't have any expectation as some might have for this film. Heck, after Simon Pegg starred in two very successful films before this (Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead), one would have high expectation for this film.<br/><br/>Thank God the film didn't disappoint. To me, this is more than just a no-brainer, brain-dead film, like those s**tty films the producers churned out every year. This film is funny, witty, and contains moral values. It touches my heart (and many others) deeply. It proves that how bad you've been before, how stupid you were, or th b**lock you used to be, with a sincere heart & sincere determination to prove that you can change, you can make up for the wrongdoings you've done.<br/><br/>There are some comments that says this film is utter crap, and just a copycat.While there is some truth in that, I don't see why it justifies the notion that his film is not worth the watch.<br/><br/>The storyline has been used in many films before, and it certainly is a tried-and-tested formula. So my question is, why change it?Any changes made would make the film of this genre less likable. A case in point; would you rather see Denise failed to finish the race? I doubt that.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this is a heart-warming film, and certainly a good film to watch with the whole family. And no, you don't have to be a runner to like this film."

","This struck me as a good film to watch with teen-aged cousins or other younger relatives. This is not nearly as funny, intelligent or well-timed as Mr. Pegg's other films, but it has enough redeeming qualities to be worth watching.<br/><br/>I found the ending to be just realistic enough to be enjoyable. The protagonist undergoes a transformation, but not so much of one as to seem hackneyed (I'm looking at YOU, Bell, Book and Candle!).<br/><br/>The shining star of this movie is Mr. Azaria's performance. He manages to portray a hateful character while still being an absolute delight to watch."
"theyounglion","4","2","7","29 March 2008"," An American sitcom in a ""British"" feature film's body
","My friend and I went into this with somewhat high expectations, and unfortunately we were both fairly disappointed. At first I thought that describing the movie as ""sitcomish"" would be too obvious and simplistic, especially given the fact that David ""Ross from 'Friends'"" Schwimmer directed it.<br/><br/>But no, that's EXACTLY what is it. The pacing, the comedic beats, the characters...it all comes off like an American network TV half-hour sitcom transported into an-hour-and-forty-minute movie's body and randomly thrown onto the streets of London.<br/><br/>(I read an article on the movie and Schwimmer that said it was originally set in New York City...but when the bulk of the film financing ended up coming from England, the money people insisted it be a London story with mostly U.K. actors.) The biggest problem with the movie is that it is SO predictable. Very early in the film you know what is going to happen, and what each of the main characters is going to do. And sure enough, the movie plays out that way with no variation at all. Moreover, it feels like the plot and the characters are being forced into following the template laid out for them. When Thandie Newton's character makes the decisions she does late in the film (especially as it pertains to Simon Pegg's character), they don't feel like natural decisions. It's like she does what she does because the script says she has to. When Hank Azaria's character is revealed to be the type of person he is...well, I'd like to sell a bridge in Brooklyn to whoever didn't see that coming. And no, I don't blame any of this on the acting. It's the material and the direction.<br/><br/>I said to my friend, ""If this film had come out in the 1980's, it would be a lot funnier and feel somewhat fresh."" She said that sums up how she feels about the movie.<br/><br/>The film has its moments. Dylan Moran as best friend Gordon is the best thing going. Thandie Newton is solid and charming. Harish Patel takes what could have easily been a typical Indian stereotype and turns it into a fun and likable character. On the other hand... Simon Pegg is someone I like. But he appears to be reaching that Steve Carell-stage where he does the same shtick in every movie. Hank Azaria is also someone I generally like, but here he feels very much out of place. (And no, not because his character is an American in London.) Basically, I think this is the kind of movie that's good for watching on cable TV on a lazy Saturday/Sunday when a mediocre, unnotable film is just what you need for comfort."

","I loved this film, it was funny, had its nice moments, and overall represents the type of comedy which i really like in movies. It could be better, but after all the crap comedies that come out recently it is a shining diamond and without any doubt i will suggest it to all that like a bit more intelligent comedies.<br/><br/>But while watching the film i got the feeling, that this film is a huge Nike commercial.

"DICK STEEL","8","1","3","13 April 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Run Fatboy Run
","I've only recently been converted to a Simon Pegg fan after the riotously funny Hot Fuzz, and can't wait for him to be in the upcoming JJ Abrams reboot of the Star Trek franchise. While squeezing time out to devour Shaun of the Dead, here comes David Schwimmer's Run Fatboy Run, where he piles on the kilos to play an unfit security guard Denny, who does the despicable because of self-doubt and unceremoniously dumps the pregnant love of his life, Libby (Thandie Newton), at the altar.<br/><br/>So fast forward to today, his routine of fetching his son to and from Libby's home gets interrupted by the arrival of her new boyfriend Whit (Hank Azaria), the corporate type who has everything going for him, and of course we're off to a show of one-upmanship between the two men, and the marathon being their arena of battle, for the love of both the woman and the kid.<br/><br/>The laughs come courtesy of the usual training sessions that Denny has to whip himself into shape given three weeks, thanks to good friend and Libby's cousin Gordon (Dylan Moran) and his landlord Mr Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel). Visual gags are plentiful, as are the conversational ones, but there weren't any that could elicit tears from joy from me, which is usually my personal gauge as to whether the comedy is effective, or not. It's a simple tale of rising against the odds, believing in oneself, and being the man who's always there for his kid.<br/><br/>Run Fatboy Run fortunately doesn't trod the conventional finale for a sports related movie, and though cheesy as expected and can be, still has its moments. Goes to show that every underdog has its day, if only they possess the never say die attitude. And speaking of which, I'm piling on the kilos, and need to run too!"

","First of all, I am a huge fan of the seminal series Spaced. It was, to my formative mind, as significant as This Life. Nothing much has impressed me more since then.<br/><br/>However ..<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz simply wasn't funny. Shaun of the Dead reminded me of a Final Year Project for a Media Studies undergrad.<br/><br/>This latest offering is truly dire.<br/><br/>Its not that it doesn't try to entertain, it does.

You'll wish you hadn't bothered."
"MartinHafer","6","1","4","27 June 2009"," Full of clichés but enjoyable
","If you are a fan of Simon Pegg because of films like SEAN OF THE DEAD or HOT FUZZ, then you might be a bit disappointed in this film. It isn't that it's a bad film but that the style is so different and it really isn't nearly as funny as these two previous films. In addition, this is certainly not a movie I would have wanted to see in the theaters, but it's more of a movie to rent or watch if you happen to have Showtime. In other words, it's a pleasant little time-passer...just not much more.<br/><br/>The story is about a cowardly jerk that left his pregnant girlfriend at the alter. This and the first 1/3 of the film really make you hate Pegg--he is very unlikable. Selfish and whiny--as well as cowardly. It's also hard not to turn off the film because he's such a jerk. However, soon after his ex-girlfriend introduces her new boyfriend (Hank Azaria), Pegg is filled with jealousy--especially when Pegg's son seems to perhaps like the new guy more than him. So, just to keep up, Pegg announces that he, too, will be running in a charity marathon--even though it's only two weeks until the race and Pegg is really out of shape.<br/><br/>What happens next and how Pegg's character grows is all straight by-the-numbers. There are absolutely no surprises here at all, though the ride along the way is pleasant. And, when ""Mr. Perfect"" (Azaria) blows up near the end and shows his dark side, this, too, seemed quite predictable. But, the characters are endearing (particularly Pegg's Indian neighbor) and the film has a nice feel, so you can't help but finish the film--and perhaps end it with a smile. However, don't expect any magic or major surprises."
"chisibell","10","1","4","27 June 2008"," Exceptional!!
","A definite 'Must see' film even if you have never watched another film with Simon Pegg or any of his TV appearances such like 'Spaced'.With clever script writing and a top cast i have to say that this film will keep you glued to your sofa for the duration of the film. Sometimes when you see a trailer of a film that interests you you find out that when you see the film you know that the whole trailer is full of just the good bits of the film (Which is disappointing as that means there is about 60 seconds of just good bits in the entire film) but with 'Run Fat Boy Run' this is not the case. From the start of the film to the very last second the word 'Entertaining' does not cut it, Exceedingly funny, Very very humorous and Rib crackingly comic may just give you some sort of idea how good this film is!!

"bentaylor121","3","1","6","9 March 2008"," embarrassingly bad
","i should have realised that this film was going to bad just by looking at the director. David schwimmer who was good when his scripts were written for him but how he thought he could write a British comedy when he has never lived here before. Simon pegg and Dylan Moran have highly accomplished themselves as great comedians but the americanised poetic element of the film was laughable. it was obvious from the moment that we met hank azaria that he was going to turn out to be devious and how Simon pegg ended up with his ex is beyond me. the comedy was very poor and you do have to wonder how much Simon pegg really was involved in the script and the final outcome was a complete farce. the reality that the film is supposed to mirror i.e. running the marathon and the troubles of this was also completely trivial. how Simon pegg was able to walk those last 9 miles in about 5 mph while it was still dark and I'm not sure when i was supposed to laugh as its very poorly written with a small poetic plot. David schwimmer should maybe go back to the drawing board before dragging down his, Simon pegg's and Dylan Moran's name."

Surprisingly he pulls it off just by being himself. 5 years on, Dennis tries to win back Libby's affection by taking part in a marathon, and competing with her new man, Whit (Azaria). Director David Schwimmer (yes, Ross from Friends!) has spent time developing Dennis, but no one else. Whit has all the appealing traits (money, power, mysterious man from another country), but not the personality. He's the cocky American all us Brits are destined to hate. Newton and Azaria are underdeveloped characters. Schwimmer's potential gets bogged down by laughs and the cameos which don't quite hit the spot they're aiming for.

The actors seams to have played their parts with such ease that it almost feels under acted. Not said in a negative way, the opposite. The whole production comes out as a genuine warm movie that brings that sweet feel to the audience without becoming Disney ultra sweet. It is nice but not in the negative way. This is a story about ordinary people with ordinary problems, pieces missing from their life puzzle. It is the tale about how small pieces of the puzzle can make things so much brighter even if it is the smallest ones that one by one is fitted in place. It also points out that most of the times it is up to our selves to do what is needed to get the pieces in place. The Marathon race becomes a perfect, easy to relay to, metaphor for that. Brilliant acting, good direction, many well shot scenes and a perfect sense of British humor brings out a movie well worth it. It is a joy to see Pegg work, his interaction with the other actors and the script. He has a complete grip of the personality of Dennis and brings him to life in a balanced way. Despite some scenes that could have been left out that did not bring anything to the movie or the story it is telling, this movie gets 10/10 from me.

Well, not all its charm, because Simon Pegg definitely deserves some credit as well. He does the same schtick he already did in ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (even the love subplot is eerily similar), but there's nothing wrong with not changing a winning team. A good underdog movie always has you cheering for the anti-hero, and this one drags out its finale so long that the obligatory corny euphoric moment lasts for roughly twenty minutes. Just picture the decisive homerun from ""Major League"" or the winning touchdown from ""Remember the Titans"", this movie's entire third act feels like that. Not the definitive sports comedy, but undoubtebly one of the funniest."

First of all I must say that this flick is utterly hilarious. Thought it doesn't have this one huge moment of laughter it will just keep you laughing from start to the end. Every move and word comes out of Dennis has something sarcastic, funny or towards the end more seriousness and caring.

","Run Fatboy run doesn't really set out to be anything more than a simple silly comedy that has a bit of heart running through it and thankfully it achieves this aim due to some likable performances from Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton.<br/><br/>With David Schwimmer at the camera the pace moves from one comedic set piece to another with all the skill that Schwimmer acquired during his 10 years working on Friends. He knows when to go for the joke and when to sit back and let the relationships of the characters develop. <br/><br/>No it's not going to be a film that will be looked back on in 50 years as a masterpiece but it is a simple piece of entertainment that can be enjoyed by everyone and in this day and age of silly 3D and outrageous sequels and prequels quality entertainment is very much needed."
"DemiRonin","4","0","1","16 April 2011"," Marathon's are long, tiring, and require lots of effort, unfortunately that's just what Run Fat Boy Run translates to.
","Simon Pegg plays Dennis, a slightly overweight, live alone security guard at a women's lingerie store. Years ago Dennis left the pregnant love of his life Libby at the altar for fear of commitment, not the most original idea but a start nonetheless. Dennis sort of waffles around his life somehow hoping to that in the long run he'll win back Libby and his son. Libby is now dating Whit, a rich American man who is successful and extremely fit. Realizing that chance may be slipping away Simon attempts to prove to Libby that he can change by running the charity marathon that's Whit's entered. Thus ensues the hilarious comedy that is about to unfold as Dennis and his band of funny and goofy friends help him get in shape to Run! Yay! <br/><br/>Now in real life I bet a marathon is a extremely difficult task to train for but in a film this can all be solved by a montage. The fact that the main obstacle for Dennis is running is fundamentally why the film is so boring. Running, jogging, walking with a strut is not something we go to the movies to see, especially when the main antagonist is not a competing runner but merely finishing the race itself. In something like Rocky, Rocky is put up against a the towering, championed, best heavy weight fighter in the world. An opponent that is not only intimidating but also clear and photographable. A marathon is none of this and at the end of the film this creates a problem that is apparent when the film has to break some of its own rules by adding an imaginary obstacle. Now I don't want to ruing what this obstacle is just in case there are some of you bursting to see more Simon Pegg but this trick in the end of the film is something films do when they an idea was not properly fleshed out. They realize the climax of the film is not set up to be quite as exciting as it should be and they have to ""add flash backs of the previous hardships"" to reiterate and add to main obstacle, which is simply running more. <br/><br/>In terms of comedy it's fairly lukewarm, there's one gem I thought was funny that involves a blister but other than that I didn't find myself laughing much. The dialogue is not really all that sharp and actors are given a lot of leash to work with. In the small instances Simon Pegg is quite a good actor, I do think he has a lot of talent but he works much better when he's the normal one and everything around him is crazy, like in Shawn of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. The cinematography is mediocre but has a lot of color, especially orange. The color choice I find sort of strange. Why did this film need such vibrant and uneven colors? <br/><br/>Overall this is fairly forgettable and almost a bad film. Taking a jog would be a much better use of your time. On a completely random and uplifting note: OH my Godz India de Beaufort is so Hot!! she plays the Indian landlord's daughter.... smokin hot....."

","Hmmmmmm. Well firstly, this is definitely a film directed by an American. The sickeningly sugar coated view of life in London could only really be portrayed so naively by someone who wasn't bought up here. The friendly cup cake shop on the corner of the pretty litter-free street is a prime example of this. However, moan over, Run Fatboy Run (which is now mentally set in London mark 2) is a pleasantly entertaining film. There are some cheap laughs- the brilliantly stereotypical character of Mr. Goshdashtidar offers up some amusing one liners. What else is amusing (another moan) is the plot of this film. It takes an intellectual genius to predict this storyline..... If only. The one dimensional characters plod slowly to the films' ending which (believe me) does arrive eventually. Though admittedly,this is a guilty pleasure, but I don't recommend for anyone wanting anything remotely challenging. Not Pegg's finest hour- but it could be worse."

Loved Dylan Moran, the same mad genius as always, in fact found out about the movie looking for things he had starred in. Together with Harish Patel, the guys form a nice buddies group.

There's the self-admitted loser (Pegg). The beautiful lady who is his object of desire (Newton). There's the off-kilter best friend (played superbly by Dylan Moran). And the too-good-to-be-true nemesis played by a surprisingly buff Hank Azaria.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is its heart. The character of Doyle is a loser but as the film progresses he gains back some of your respect - bit by bit. The acting by Pegg is superb with his physical comedy being one of his strengths.<br/><br/>Newton isn't called upon to do too much. Azaria gets the thankless role of being Mr Perfect and he does the transition from Knight in Shining Armour to A$$hole of the Year very well.<br/><br/>The direction by Schwimmer is a surprise. It never seems forced. the pacing seems just right. And London never looked more bright and cheery.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Run, Fatboy, Run is David Schwimmer's (yes the guy from Friends) first and only film that wasn't made for TV. It centers around Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg), a mall security guard who, ""isn't fat, just unfit."" The movie begins at Dennis' wedding where he is having a nervous breakdown. Dripping in anxious sweat, Dennis jumps out of the window and bolts off, leaving his pregnant fiancé, Libby, (Thandie Newton) at the altar. Jump five years into the future and Dennis is now an out of shape mall cop living in a flat run by a rude Indian man (Harish Patel). All the while he is regretting the decision he made five years ago to leave his fiancé, who now has a well-to-do new boyfriend named Whit (Hank Azaria). Whit is seemingly the perfect man who has everything he could ever want. Dennis is immediately jealous and wants to prove to Libby that he can also be the great man Whit has established himself as. He decides that the best way to do this would be to run a 26 kilometer marathon that Whit is also running. He has to prove to Libby that he can follow through with a promise and finish something he started.<br/><br/>All in all the film is your typical underdog story of a man who isn't perfect but can pull through to overcome his personal issues and earn what he wants. The story is very predictable and often times cheesy, yet it has a warm heart and an overall entertaining story. It is led by great actors that can make the story believable and enjoyable, despite the predictability. The movie is a simple minded comedy that has its fair share of laughs and thankfully doesn't bank on the over-the-top ridiculous humor. It does have a lot of physical humor which isn't my personal taste when it comes to comedy but it doesn't hurt the film itself. There is one very cringe worthy scene and if you watch it I'm sure you'll know exactly which scene I'm talking about.<br/><br/>What really holds this film together is the characters. Each main character brings something funny and new to the table. Simon Pegg is the straight man who just wants to do something right for once in his life. His best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) is the eccentric and ridiculous buddy who always has the best intentions just never quite knows how to follow through with them, often getting himself into trouble. Then there is Hank Azaria who plays the role of pretentious and egotistical businessman/boyfriend very well.<br/><br/>Run, Fatboy, Run is a fun film that's worth the watch if you like a good laugh and an easy to follow story that will at least make you smile. I always enjoy watching Simon Pegg act and while this movie doesn't even compare to the likes of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz it is still a decent film."

","Simon Pegg the amazing and funny actor most known as Shaun of ""Shaun of the Dead"" back again in another great comedy with no zombies but playing almost the same lazy and confused character. And that's the great deal of the movie. <br/><br/>In ""Run Fatboy Run"" he plays Dennis Doyle a man known for running (literally and not literally) away of his problems or his duties. In the case of the movie he walked out of his own wedding leaving behind his pregnant bride Libby (Thandie Newton). After five years he wants a second chance with her and wants to live with his young son Jake but she's already involved with a man, the American and sportiest Whit (Hank Azaria) a guy who loves Marathon. Dennis thinks that this is a competition and he'll do anything to proof to Libby that he's a different man by joining a marathon that's going to happen in London. <br/><br/>If you remember Simon playing Shaun, well things are quite the same here too. His character is fat (not that much), lazy, playful, without any discipline and worst he can't barely run for few blocks without getting easily tired but he's going forward, training with his best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran, very funny) and his landlord. <br/><br/>OK here comes the criticism. It's not as brilliant as ""Shaun of the Dead"" but it has it's good and enjoyable moments. Simon Pegg is always great to see, and you become deeply involved with his mannerisms much because, I think, everybody has something in common with his character here, people always trying to proof something to themselves and to other people but instead he only makes silly and funny things. All of his attempts to run are comical (Wheter running after a travesty robber who stole things of the shop he works as security guard, or whether his first training steps on his street).<br/><br/>The casting is good particularly Dylan Moran and Hank Azaria and the guy who plays the Indian landlord. The screenplay is quite good, the writers (Pegg himself included) came up with a good idea (especially towards the ending with the marathon). Very entertaining and with a good soundtrack (songs of David Bowie and Kaiser Cheifs included). But the biggest surprise is to see who's behind the camera directing it: Actor David Schwimmer (""Friends"") is the director of this great Brit comedy and he does a marvelous job (he has 2 cameos along the movie but you almost won't find him). 10/10"

Than after 5 years later she is with some other guy so in order to win her back, Dennis tries to finish the marathon that her boyfriend enters in order to win his love back. This movie really wasn't that funny for me, and just about every character in this was not believable to the point it really wasn't that engaging, which is a shame cause you can really tell Simon Pegg tried his best with what he had. Almost everything about this movie is predictable and not that entertaining to watch, it's not a bad British romantic comedy but it isn't that good either.

"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","2 March 2010"," ""would it be weird if I took a bath?""; Enjoyable, just nothing special
","I think there are three reasons why people would want to check out Run Fatboy Run: as a normal movie going, or just viewing, experience (certainly mostly if you are a fan of comedies), to check out what Simon Pegg can do without Nick Frost and Edgar Wright (I belong to this ""category"" as a fan of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) and to check out the first feature film of David Schwimmer (fans of the show Friends that are curious to see freakin' Ross behind the camera). <br/><br/>First of all, Run Fatboy Run is one of those pictures that any director could have made. I mean, if you're interested in this film because of David Schwimmer well, there's really nothing that sort of indicates how Schwimmer is as a director. In other words, Run Fatboy Run is, simply, generic stuff. It follows the same old structure, and it is sort of aware of its very predictable storyline. I mean, the film places Simon Pegg's character (Dennis, the ""fatboy"" of the title) as a guy who, simply, wants to win back his old fiancée (played by Thandie Newton) the rich and athletic Whit (played by Hank Azaria) is the rival. So we have that Dennis wants to win her back doing what a movie character would do: beat his, athletic, rival at a marathon. I say that the film is aware of being generic since Newton's character is like ""so you win the marathon, and then what? You think I will forget that you leaved me the day of our wedding just because you win a marathon? This is not a movie"", towards Dennis' plan. I guess you know how this movie ends, here the issue is that no matter what Dennis will run the marathon to prove that he can finish something and everybody will see the a****** Whit is, no matter what he will win back the woman yes, the film knows that its storyline is the same of always but it doesn't really care, it goes for the usual. Still it's enjoyable but not very memorable (just like Simon Pegg's performance) Dylan Moran, as Dennis' buddy Gordon, delivers: ""Who's gonna want to buy tickets for something that happened yesterday?"" ""Time travelers"". ""Would it be weird if I took a bath?""."

The story, though slight, is perfectly serviceable, the dialogue is funny, the characters are enjoyable and (mostly) believable, and Pegg is his usual entertaining and appealing self.<br/><br/>My concern here is the language. The F word is used on a few occasions - not many - and with one exception it achieves nothing: it could have been omitted with no loss. On one occasion it has dramatic purpose, but this could have been achieved by other means.<br/><br/>I have nothing against bad language used with valid purpose - I'm fine withe the almost constant bad language in Zack And Miri Make A Porno, for instance - but here I felt it was entirely unnecessary and, as such, I objected to it."

","To start off with the obvious - you cannot start training for a marathon three weeks before the race (having never run - not having never run a marathon but having never run competitively) - and expect to have any chance in the world of actually finishing the race. So, right off the top there was a general lack of credibility here. I had to couple that with my immediate distaste for the ""hero"" of the story (Dennis, played by Simon Pegg) who, in the opening scenes, skips out of his wedding to his pregnant fiancé (he later tries to weasel out of the responsibility for that by telling Libby that he chose to ruin her day to avoid ruining her life - except that the opening of the movie clearly portrays a Dennis who is scared sh****ss at the prospect of marriage. In other words, he wasn't thinking of Libby - he just ran away to avoid living up to his responsibility.) Dennis then becomes a sort of sympathetic character thanks only to the introduction of the truly obnoxious American Whit (played by Hank Azaria) who steals Libby's heart, and starts to replace Dennis in the eyes of his son. To bring Whit down to size, Dennis ends up running against him in a charity marathon (running for erectile dysfunction - yeah, pretty typical of the level of the humour here.) Filled with an assortment of other strange characters, this movie ended up being a major disappointment to me. 4/10"

It's a particularly disciplined pairing of the two funny writers who keep the movie grounded in reality (or something close to it) as the film moves into the more outlandish second and third acts. Several times, the stakes are raised and supporting characters take center stage, stealing scenes with surprising and delightful frequency.<br/><br/>Comedy is a genre notoriously overlooked by nominations and awards. Many critics quibble that performances in broad comedy is unrefined; I for one flatly disagree. Further more, I can't help but think that if there was an ""Oscars of Comedy"" award show, Run Fat Boy Run would have been neck and neck with Juno in every category in 2007. <br/><br/>By the time the film and Simon Pegg's character Dennis near the finish line, it becomes clear that hard work and persistence is the foundation to achieving personal goals.

","I have a newfound respect for that unfunny dork, David Schwimmer, after RUN FATBOY RUN.<br/><br/>Schwimmer directs Simon Pegg as Dennis, a man who ran from his pregnant bride at the altar five years ago and now decides to win her back by beating her current boyfriend at his own game - marathon running.<br/><br/>The plot only seems ludicrous until the performances take hold. Once Pegg (as the titular ""fatboy"") and Dylan Moran (as his friend, Gordon) find their comedy stride, so to speak, there are no stops for any pisses by the roadside in this quirky buddy flick disguised as a romantic comedy, where one buddy betrays the other while getting naked at every opportunity.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton is the jilted ex and Hank Azaria (gloriously body-shaved) is the current rich, athletic - yet shallow - boyfriend. (Azaria's roles sweep the gamut - from his Guatemalan housekeeper in THE BIRDCAGE to his French scuba instructor in ALONG CAME POLLY - and amazes here by showing he can actually play straight.) Written by a solid American comedian, Michael Ian Black, and tightened up by Simon Pegg himself, RUN FATBOY RUN is very much a ""British"" movie (set in Britain, peopled by Brits) with very little dumb American slapstick; only rarely do we feel Schwimmer's stupid FRIENDS fingerprints sullying the production.<br/><br/>In the Training Montage (which involves tiny short shorts and spatulas), the filmmakers tip their hat to Trey Parker and Matt Stone by having a TEAM America poster in the background (a movie in which The Montage is satirized wickedly by the SOUTH PARK team).<br/><br/>Though the movie foists its poignant messages and silly character arcs on us (Dennis has never committed to or finished anything in his life; with the marathon he has the chance to change his destiny!), it actually ends on a note of possibility rather than blah marriage blah Hollywood. Like I said, ""British"" sensibility, regarding the audience as marginally intelligent, rather than popcorn automatons.<br/><br/>Why do women regard a man running from the altar as cowardly and impotent, but a woman running from her responsibilities as a bride ""adorable""? Answer me that and stay big-mouthed, Julia Roberts.<br/><br/>The irony is: the best aspect of Dennis's shiftless character might actually be the one thing they all vilify him for - running from that altar!<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy the Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

","I was recently introduced to the Pegg-Frost movies which began with Hot Fuzz which I loved and then Shawn of the Dead which was nearly as good. I started watching all of Simon Pegg's movies and have to admit, Run Fatboy Run was arguably the funniest of the lot.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer does a great job as director and has put together a highly entertaining flick that will have you begging for more. It's one of those movies where you keep checking your watch in hopes that the movie won't end.<br/><br/>Schwimmer has taken a fairly vanilla plot (loser irresponsible boy leaves girl girl at altar, spends the rest of his life wondering how to win her back) and created a set of characters cast to perfection.<br/><br/>Dylan Moran as Gordan and Harish Patel as the hilarious Mr. Goshdashtidar make for an ensemble with great on screen chemistry.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this yet, you've laughed a little less this year :)"

","...then you will be sorely disappointed by this, nice but virtually completely different comedy.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg shows that he can be the new Robert Carlyle (remember him from The Full Monty). He is funny, sad and touching but unlike that other brilliant film there doesn't seem to be enough of a comedic hook to sustain interest. The fat man running a marathon seems like a good premise but the director, David Schwimmer's love for drama rather than comedy gets in the way of making this truly memorable.<br/><br/>On the plus side, you get a truly great performance from both Simon Pegg and his antagonist, Hank Azaria. It's truly amazing how Azaria can play both nice and really sleazy with equal skill. His turn comes quite unexpected and it's one of the more pleasing aspects of this otherwise ordinary movie.<br/><br/>Schwimmer does seem to have a British sensibility and the scenes between the Indian landlord and Pegg are the best moments because they feel so true. You do believe that they could strike up a friendship unlike an American movie where most interracial friendships are severely restricted.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah. I almost forgot Thandie Newton. She deserves the most credit since she plays a rather thankless role. The unwed mother, jilted by the Pegg character at the altar (can you feel the cliché machine grinding). Schwimmer wisely makes her a person and not a vicious shrew out for revenge.<br/><br/>The end is a bit too unbelievable and you sort of wish it would have ended without showing the actual race. It seems to drag on and on and the wall is really too much."

","Hmmmmm.....There are a few laughs here, but loads and loads of clichés. An interesting conglomeration of actors: David Schwimmer directs (who knew?), Thandie Newton, whose most memorable role to date was in ""Mission Impossible II"", Simon Pegg, who coincidentally also has a ""Mission Impossible"" (III) on his resume but perhaps is most recognizable from the British comedy of a few years ago ""Hot Fuzz,"" and even Hank Azaria takes part as a smarmy American with suspect intentions.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is a London Loser by the name of Dennis Doyle. Having left Thandie Newton's character, Libby, at the alter, pregnant no less, his life spirals downward from there. He's now an overweight, cigarette-addicted security guard in a women's lingerie store who perpetually locks himself out of his basement apartment where he is also (surprise!) behind in the rent. One wonders what Libby could have ever seen in him in the first place. Hank Azaria plays Whit, a suave, rich American whose plan is to woo Libby and her now 5-year-old son, with whom Dennis still has a good relationship. The son Jake is played by an almost pathologically cute kid named Matthew Fenton with just the right number of missing teeth. Every movie cliché you can imagine is played out. Dennis tries to redeem himself in Libby's eyes by training for a marathon that Whit will be running in. His Indian landlord and ne'er-do-well best friend become his trainers for reasons of their own. Improbability abounds. Dennis transforms into the lovable, hapless anti-hero, Whit into the heartless villain. Thandie Newton's Libby is a study in stagy, overwrought facial expression. You could make a flip-book of the hundred or so faces she makes......she doesn't so much act the part as grimace it.<br/><br/>Rent only if all the other B movies are checked out, or if you really want to see some great shots of modern-day London."

","This could have been much better. Simon Pegg has done much better films than this. And where is his partner at? The fatter guy that was with him in his two previous films that made international waves? I guess Simon Pegg thinks he can do it himself. Boy is he wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man who tries to run. He tries to run from his troubles, from love, from the woman he knocked up (Thandie Newton), and from his dreams. Dreams be being a man and a respected one. Until Simon realizes he needs to do something drastic to keep his woman around Occasionally it has something worth of value. The antics before and during the race are OK, but they don't make it into a cult classic. And that is disappointing.<br/><br/>Overall, its a slight miss. Better luck next time Simon and Thandie.

","I think that Run, Fat Boy, Run is an underrated gem. Friend's David Scwimmer's directorial debut is a heartwarming rom-com that isn't just your average fare. Updated for the generation of single parents and reconstituted families, RFBR has a unique premise that is deeper than it first seems.<br/><br/>The film portrays security guard Dennis Doyle's struggle for the respect of his ex-fiancé Libby and from his friends, who all claim he's never finished anything in his life, and coupled with a rivalry between him and Whit, Dennis sets out to prove himself by running a marathon and completing it. He's under further pressure from his best friend Gordon, who's bet all his money (which he doesn't have) on him completing the marathon.<br/><br/>Pegg's performance is different from anything he's ever done before - while in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz he's portraying a straightforward character, Run, Fatboy, Run sees him portray a father and a man who secretly pines for his ex-fiancé and he does it with some very good acting. For example, after Whit proposes to Libby, Dennis, obviously broken-hearted, stumbles back home in a drunken state and looks through some photo albums. A simple scene, yet you can sympathise greatly with the character and therefore his reasoning for deciding temporarily not to run the marathon. Also, his scenes with his on screen son provide a fun insight into the character and what motivates him in his life.<br/><br/>The comedy is generally strong, though not as strong as Pegg's previous screenplays for his works with Edgar Wright. Strong scenes include scenes at the gym, Libby's bakery, Dennis' cup of tea with Mr Goshdashtidar and Gordon inviting several characters to ""come right up then!"" Overall it's a decent film that's underrated and the one in which Pegg gives his best performance, possibly until the new Star Trek film comes out."
"joestank15","6","0","2","13 November 2008"," Cute movie elevated above the mediocre by Pegg and Moran
","Run Fatboy Run - Dennis Doyle (the wonderful Simon Pegg) with commitment issues runs away from his pregnant fiancé (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day and, 5 years later, tries to win her and his son back by running a marathon. <br/><br/>Anyone hoping for a Edgar Wright style riff (not an unfair expectation, as this has two cast members from Shaun of the Dead) on the sports genre will be disappointed. This is directed by David Schwimmer, and scripted by Michael Ian Black and Simon Pegg himself. Schwimmer's direction is adequate, and the story is pretty cute, though really by the numbers. Could we just freeze the use of the sports montage for, like, two decades? Pegg is very watchable and his presence is more or less what breathes life into the film. Thankfully he also has Dylan Moran (change of pace from Nick Frost), who lights up any dull moment and steals many scenes from under Simon Pegg's feet. Moran plays a near-do-well friend with a gambling addiction and a strange (but funny) lack of pants.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Thandie Newton has pretty much nothing to work with in the material. And Hank Azaria has the virtually thankless task of being the uptight nemesis of Pegg's character (trying to steal the woman Dennis ditched on their wedding day. *What* an ass). God, why do we always have to have a reason to hate the other man (or woman, depending on the film)? Is the theory that any man who is nice and decent on the outside has to be a monster on the inside? God it's such a cliché.<br/><br/>In conclusion, see it for Pegg and Moran. B-"

","I will first start off by saying that I try to never let myself get hyped up before watching a movie for the first time. I could not help but get hyped for this movie though. With Shaun of the Dead and Hott Fuzz, I could not wait to see Simon Pegg again. This movie did the opposite of letting me down. IMO it had everything a movie needs to be great. The acting was fantastic and the sexual innuendos were hilarious. Awesome, AWESOME film!!! It had the laughs, and the sighs. I found this movie a bit more serious than Pegg's other films, but it was still without a doubt fantastic. Whether you are a fan of Pegg or not this is a movie that you must see!"

","David Schwimmer in his directorial debut,proves he is as good a director as he is an actor (Friends). Micheal Ian Black & Simon Pegg wrote the screenplay which is basically a screwball comedy.This is no where like the screwball comic farces of the 1930's, It is however a screwball comedy 2008 style.<br/><br/>This was a 2008 release in the USA.<br/><br/>Please do not expect a plausible, realistic story line, Screwball comedies are never plausible or realistic, They are just funny & silly.<br/><br/>Run, Fatboy,Run is a is both funny & silly & at all times enjoyable. At no times is it supposed to be taken seriously, Just sit back & enjoy these talented actors having fun.<br/><br/>The talented actors are Simon Pegg, he is a physical comic whose facial expressions,make his somewhat unlikable character seem real. Very few can do this well, Simon Pegg does this superbly.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton, what a beauty & what an actress, she can handle comedy as well as she does dramas.<br/><br/>Hank Azaria can do roles where he can switch to being a villain very easily, here he does it perfectly. Hank & Simon have locker room scene that is a quiet laugh riot.<br/><br/>These are the 3 main members of the cast, I must mention others as they sure add to the fun.Dylan Moran an Irish comic who was in a few other Simon Pegg films & is quietly very humorous.<br/><br/>Haresh Patel an actor from South Asia is very good & he know how to use a spatula for other things than cooking.<br/><br/>Mathew Fenton a lad about 5 is perfect Thandie & Simons son.<br/><br/>Much of the movie was filmed in beautiful North London,with fantastic scenes of London in the background. The last part of the movie is a Marathon race, with both Simon & Hank participating, they both love Thandie. Which one will get her, Will one of them win the marathon, Hank is fit enough to win anything, Simon however (he is not fat, just not in shape.) I will not tell you the ending. This is a screwball comedy, & not reality, & thats what made it so enjoyable for me,<br/><br/>Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 10)95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)"

","This movie is rather funny, not up there with ""Shaun of Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz"", but still once again Simon Pegg does a great job and makes you sympathize with his character. Thandie Newton is rather good too as is Hank Azaria...though my favorite costar was Moran as the rather laid back and a bit strange cousin to Newton's character. What is the story? Man makes a run for it on his wedding day and leaves his pregnant wife behind at the alter. Flash to five years later and our runaway husband to be is now an out of shape security guard for a women's apparel store. He still is in his ex fiancé's life as he does try to do stuff with his son, but there is now a new man in her life in the form of what initially seems to be a really nice and well off man. Let's just say he changes throughout the course of the film and he begins to get a bit more obnoxious as the movie precedes along. Well Dennis (Pegg's character) decides to show his ex that he has what it takes to change by agreeing to run in a marathon. A twenty-six mile marathon that is only three weeks away and yes our hero is not in the best of shape. Thanks, however, to a bet made by his ex's cousin and a landlord who seems a tad off, but seems to really like Dennis, he is trained very hard to reach his goal. Let's just say there are some very funny scenes that ensue during the training. The marathon itself while not the highlight of the film is good too. A few serious scenes damper the mood a bit here and there, but for the most part it is a rather funny film and I rather like the London setting too."

I laughed constantly watching this movie. I was impressed by the choices they made making this movie, not to sell out by offering a cliché rom com, but one that is true to life, its hardships, and its triumphs!!! Highly recommended, and in the digital age of constant availability, I will be buying this DVD!"

","In many ways has most of the typical British comedy elements, but much fresh material and very enjoyable entertainment.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg is Brit, Dennis Doyle, who we learn at the very beginning of the movie got very cold feet 5 years earlier at his wedding and just ran away, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton is the girlfriend, 'Libby' Odell, and in present time has a cute, 4-year-old son Jake. Dennis and she remain cordial, as he picks up their son for scheduled outings.<br/><br/>But on one of those occasions, Dennis is thrown into a mild state of shock as he meets American, Hank Azaria as Whit, Libby's new boyfriend. Things get mush worse eventually as Whit proposes marriage to Libby.<br/><br/>But Dennis never gave up on Libby, even though she has apparently given up on him, a perpetual screw-up who never undertakes and finishes anything. He just barely exists, and is even in trouble with his Indian landlord of his small basement flat.<br/><br/>It turns out that Whit runs marathons to help raise money for charity, and everyone thinks that is an admirable quality. So Dennis, ""Fatboy"", decides he will get in shape and run in the next one just 3 weeks away.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: When Libby accept's Whit's proposal Dennis gets discouraged and decides not to run the marathon. But friends, including one who has bet 5,000 pounds on his finishing the race, basically force him to run, reminding him that he has to start finishing things. He gets injured, but decides to keep on anyway, even on a bad ankle, finishing late at night. His grit captures the fancy of a whole TV news audience, plus his son and Libby, who show up and wait at the finish line. As the movie ends some time later, Libby has ditched Whit, and agrees to go on a date with Dennis. Maybe they will make it work this time."

","Run Fatboy Run <br/><br/>Directed by David Schwimmer.<br/><br/>Starring Simon Pegg, Thandie Newton and Hank Azaria.<br/><br/>Making his motion picture directorial debut, David Schwimmer shows that he is surprisingly adept at pleasing audiences with ""Run Fatboy Run."" The former ""Friends"" star remembers a few things from his sitcom tenure, most important of which is the trick of injecting life and energy into a predictable story. If it helped ""Friends"" for ten popular seasons, why shouldn't it work for ""Fatboy""? <br/><br/>When everyman Dennis Doyle (Pegg) knocks up his girlfriend Libby (Newton), he chooses to do the right thing and leave her at the altar on their wedding day. Dennis fears that his future is bleak, and decides that his desertion will ultimately be what is best for Libby and their unborn child. With that glimmer of selflessness buried underneath Dennis's self-centered act, Schwimmer has the audience rooting for his leading man instead of cursing him. It's a smart move, especially when the leading man is someone as effortlessly likable as Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>After a few years have passed, Dennis's prediction of an unfulfilled life has been fulfilled. He is working as a security guard at a local clothing store, which would be fine if he didn't have to occasionally get off his butt to run down shoplifters. Everything that he does is half-assed, except for his devotion to his son, Jake. The type of parenting that Dennis employs with his son is sometimes chaotic, but always loving.<br/><br/>When an American hotshot named Whit (Azaria) moves in with Libby, Dennis is forced to realize the consequences of his inaction. He attempts to compete with the new boyfriend, entering a 26-mile marathon in hopes of beating the American. Essentially, Dennis needs to do what he does best in order to fix things: run. But this time he is running to show his responsibility, instead of trying to avoid it.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Fatboy"" is enjoyable, but don't expect it to reinvent the wheel. It can be very funny at times, which is perhaps why its failings are so disappointing. There is potential to be great, but the film ultimately settles for just being good.<br/><br/>The movie mingles with the same clumsy clichés that plague most romantic comedies, and has its share of corny moments. Schwimmer is smart to keep the focus on his actors, because they are the ones who really keep the viewer engaged when the movie sinks into predictability. And seeing Pegg clumsily running around London in a fat suit ought to be worth something.<br/><br/>Final Grade: B"
