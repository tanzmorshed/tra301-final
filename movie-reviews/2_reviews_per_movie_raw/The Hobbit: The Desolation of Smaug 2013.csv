","The second entry in the Hobbit franchise improves on everything he first film got wrong. It doesn't waste any time and gets right into the action packed sequences. My only problem was the setting change at the end of the film. I felt like it didn't suit the climax. Overall, The Hobbit the Desalation of Smaug is a solid follow up to the first film building on the ideas the first film started."
"tlotr_tloz","6","1067","1445","12 December 2013"," Decent fantasy-action slightly inspired by The Hobbit
","Most reviews will tell you what's so great about this movie and why it's worth watching, but I figured you should hear the other side of the story.<br/><br/>First of all a small note for Tolkien fans. If you thought An Unexpected Journey strayed a bit too far from the book: The Desolation of Smaug looks like the script writers didn't even know there was a book. The movie tries hard to change the story wherever it can, reducing fan-favorite chapters to 5 minute scenes and writing new content that feels out of place.<br/><br/>But it's not only bad if you've read the book. I really wonder what the target audience is, because it feels like it's written for 15 year old boys. There are random action scenes every 10 minutes and 'funny' decapitations every 30. The worst thing here is that the action comes at the cost of character development. You have a band of 13 Dwarfs and a Hobbit, yet you rarely see them interact.<br/><br/>Now I like Elves more than Dwarfs, so I didn't mind seeing so much of them in this movie. But having them show up in every place to save the day feels wrong. Perhaps Peter Jackson thought his cast of Dwarfs wasn't good enough to create an enjoyable movie? Gandalf's scenes in Dol Guldur were an interesting addition in concept, but they are just too slow. I feel his scenes mostly serve as an attempt to raise The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings' level of epicness. And that just doesn't work.<br/><br/>The story is full of illogicalities. How does entering the mountain to steal the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs to kill the Dragon to enter the mountain work exactly?? And remember that heartwarming last scene of An Unexpected Journey, where Thorin finally accepts Bilbo? Well, that's all gone again. Even though he keeps outsmarting all the Dwarfs, Bilbo is back to being an unappreciated 5th wheel of the party. And did the writers really think viewers would be so desperate for a love story that they'd enjoy an Elf and a Dwarf flirting it up? Their scenes feel forced and are painful to watch.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman's acting is top notch again, but sadly he hardly gets any screen time. He only shines in his scene with Smaug. Now Smaug as a character is awesome, no complaints there. Yet most of his scenes are way too dragged out. There's a 20 minute scene with the Dwarfs running around thinking they can defeat him. Only at that point the movie already hinted at the only possible way of defeating him. Perhaps the worst aspect is that these scenes make Smaug look like an unintelligent creature. Dwarfs luring a Dragon around by going ""Nana-nanana you can't catch me!"" is not only silly and cliché, it's an insult to Smaug's character.<br/><br/>Final complaint: the whole movie builds up to a scene.... that's apparently going to be the opening scene of movie 3. Nobody in the cinema was sure if the movie had ended, or there was just an awkwardly long pause when the screen went black.<br/><br/>A movie like this you'll want to see, no matter how good or bad it is. You can't miss out on such a huge release, especially when it looks gorgeous in HFR 3D. But where I watched each Lord of the Rings movie 3 times in cinema, watching The Desolation of Smaug just once was enough for me.<br/><br/>In the end, most problems of the movie seem to stem from the decision to turn the cute Hobbit tale into three epic movies that have to live up to the Lord of the Rings hype. It doesn't work."

","I watched this film for entertainment. I had no expectations. I don't mind if a director deviates from their source material, provided that the film works. However, I felt, as I watched, as if someone was patting my back, and picking my pockets.<br/><br/>There are some beautiful scenes: butterflies flying from the treetops of Mirkwood, Smaug gradually revealing himself, etc. Nevertheless, the visual virtuosity is wasted, because the scenes have no emotional impact. The characters are undeveloped, and barely interact with each other. There is no tension, no texture, no warmth. The story feels as fake as the over-the-top special effects.<br/><br/>The screenplay is insultingly bad by any standard. If you consider that it was adapted from the masterpiece of a world-class philologist, it's a crime against culture.<br/><br/>If I had to summarize the film, I would call it a juvenile, tasteless, video game-like action sequence. Take the barrel riders scene. A dwarf rolls along the shore in a barrel, knocking orcs off the screen, exactly like in the Donkey Kong Country games. Meanwhile, Legolas and Tauriel, in god mode, with unlimited arrows, and a perfect aim, are slaughtering hundreds of orcs. I felt my brain cells dying as I watched.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I left the theatre feeling violated. The film, to an even greater extent than its predecessor, embraces three things I despise about Hollywood: catering to the lowest common denominator, showcasing special effects at the expense of storytelling, and blatantly treating filmmaking as a business rather than as high art."
"helge-fauskanger","7","521","744","11 December 2013"," The word you're looking for is ""reimagining""
","I won't ""review"" the content of the movie in any detail, but provide some thoughts about how this film should be approached. I consider myself a Tolkienist (in fact I saw this movie on opening night because I secured a promotion deal with the local cinema: I spent four hours until midnight writing people's names in Elvish writing!) It is to be expected that many fans of of the original book will perceive this movie as a bloated, garbled monster version of the written story they loved. It is important to realize, before going in, that this is not simply ""the movie of the book"". This is Jackson's The Hobbit, not Tolkien's, and they are best appreciated as independent works. They represent different media, come from different centuries, and have partly different target audiences. The children's book was written before Tolkien had any idea of the grand trilogy to follow; Jackson had already produced his Lord of the Rings trilogy and somewhat understandably tries to make the prequels resemble it, in tone and scope.<br/><br/>One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, when complete, will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. (The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced, even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR.) Incidentally, Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished, Jackson's six Middle-earth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology.<br/><br/>To be sure, Jackson's Hobbit trilogy is ""based on"" the 1930s children's book in the sense that the characters have the same names and visit much the same places in somewhat the same order (though new characters and places are also added). Their basic motivations are also the same. But beyond that, one should not expect much ""fidelity"". There is hardly anything that isn't greatly embellished and vastly elaborated, mostly so as to allow for a FAR darker tone and MUCH more fantasy action (i.e., fights). The spiders of Mirkwood here approach actual horror, as compared to their rather more children-friendly literary counterparts (where we have Bilbo insulting them with silly ""Attercop"" rhymes).<br/><br/>The wizards' conflict with the Necromancer of Dol Guldur, which in the book happens entirely ""offscreen"" and is just briefly alluded to when Gandalf has returned near the end, is here actually shown. This is understandable; Gandalf would otherwise be completely absent for much of this movie. Also, Jackson's audience will already know that this is the start of the war with Sauron, and the all-important Dark Lord could not well be ignored. Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just ""a fleeting shadow"" over the pages of The Hobbit; in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.<br/><br/>Entire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none, and have at least ONE strong female character (no concern of Tolkien's when he wrote a story for children in the 1930s).<br/><br/>The continued survival of ALL the protagonists despite their endless brushes with death doesn't just strain credibility -- it utterly and completely banishes and eliminates credibility. We are left with FANTASY action in the truest sense, to be enjoyed for choreography, not plausibility. If cats have nine lives, a Jacksonian Dwarf clearly enjoys a three-digit number of lives.<br/><br/>So, viewed as an independent work, is this a good movie? Technically it is nothing short of brilliant, full of detail that can only be appreciated on the big screen. Smaug is, hands down, the best-designed movie dragon the world has yet seen. If I were a teenager instead of a ripe old 42, this wealth of fantasy action would probably have exited me no end. It is nice to see Legolas again, even if he is not in the book. I liked the sequences with the amorphous Sauron. Poor Evangeline Lily would however look better without those silly ears, which are simply too big and look just as fake as they are. Also, I'm not sure the hinted-at Elf-Dwarf romance adds much to the story. All things considered, I'll award Jackson's re-imagined ""The Hobbit"" seven stars.<br/><br/>There were also seven stars in Durin's crown, for those of you who can understand the literary allusion ..."
"lornloxor","4","506","741","11 December 2013"," The Desolation of CGI - the Hobbit trilogy continues to disappoint
","I saw the movie in 2D because I hated the 3D HFR in the first Hobbit movie. I thought the HFR just made the movie sets look like sets instead of being part of the movie universe. I much preferred the 2D experience here and it was easier for me to try to immerse myself in the movie. Regrettably there were too many things that were wrong with the movie for me to achieve that. <br/><br/>This movie had a budget of something like 200 million dollars, over double that of any of the individual movies of the original trilogy. Where did all that money go? To that mostly horrid CGI? There was just bloody too much of it like in the first movie. Everything looks so damn fake with the CGI slammed front and center with no artistic attempt to hide its shortcomings. For example, when Legolas starts chasing Bolg out of Laketown, even his horse is made with CGI. Why? Couldn't you afford to rent one horse? The orcs were mostly made with CGI and they weren't menacing in the slightest. The few scenes with actual actors with makeup playing the orcs were far superior. Erebor looked quite good in general with its mountains of coins and treasures but the melted gold looked unbelievably bad. Many of the actual sets in the movie were very well done and I'm really puzzled why they didn't use them more. The CGI in LOTR looked far more convincing and epic, the large establishing shots looked like grand paintings come alive. What happened here? I don't get it. It felt like I was watching a video game and I don't want to feel that way when I'm watching a movie. Granted, the original trilogy did have a bit of silly looking CGI here and there but at least it was constantly grounded by real sets. <br/><br/>There was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example, when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up, the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf, it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor, I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also, the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes, it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely. <br/><br/>The action could've been cut down significantly too. There was no real context or meaning for most of it anyway. Also, after Legolas has killed his umpteenth orc in yet another physics-breaking and miraculous way, you simply lose interest. He can apparently do anything. My feeling is that in the original trilogy the ""laws of physics"" so to say were merely bent somewhat, here they're completely shattered. All of this may sound nitpicky but I'm essentially doing this because the movie didn't get me emotionally invested in it in a positive way at all.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't particularly funny either despite its lighthearted source material, I laughed much more heartily in many parts of the original trilogy. The Gimli joke was quite funny though. There was also absolutely no memorable music in this movie and none of it moved me like much of the music did in the original trilogy. I didn't get shivers at any point of the movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't all bad or mediocre though. Smaug was magnificent and Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job voice acting the dragon, definitely something to witness in a theater. Smaug's discussions with Bilbo were also great. Gandalf's venture into Dol Guldur was also interesting though that is mainly because Ian McKellen is such a fine actor that he can catch your attention with ease. The cameos by Peter Jackson in the beginning eating the carrot and by Stephen Colbert as the Laketown spy were fun even though I think they might've been too distracting had I loved the movie. The pacing in the movie is a bit of a mixed bag. The first movie had bad pacing because it was overly long without anything really happening. Desolation of Smaug swings the pendulum to the other end with endless action sequences pasted after another. Sure it's more exciting to watch but it was dearly missing some slower sequences to digest everything. <br/><br/>I'm a massive fan of the original trilogy but the first two Hobbit movies simply haven't captured the epicness and magic of those movies at all. And if the Hobbit wasn't intended to feel epic, then why make it into three movies? There's also something else I don't get. The original movie trilogy adaptation established what the LOTR universe looked and felt like. Is the Hobbit trilogy still supposed to happen in that same universe? I didn't ever feel like anyone was in any serious danger because they survive crazier and crazier encounters after the next and because of that there's no tension. This wasn't the case with the originals. Huge spiders were very dangerous in LOTR, here Bilbo is just killing them off left and right. I just wish they'd taken much more liberties with the material and really placed this story into the grittier universe that was established by the original trilogy. Or maybe they should've done something completely different instead of trying to imitate the originals and coming short of them. Anything but this."
"patrick-wittman","1","342","504","16 December 2013"," If you are a fan of Tolkien you will be disappointed
","This movie is so far from the story found in the book that Peter Jackson wouldn't have needed to get the rights from the Tolkien estate. I disagree with many of the naysayers who think this shouldn't have been turned into a three part series. There is plenty of story, action, and character development in the book to make three reasonable length films. The issue with how Jackson has handled this ""adaptation"" is that they have truncated most of the important elements to the original story simply so they could make up drawn out action scenes for the sake of action.<br/><br/>The film immediately came off the rails in what should have been the queer lodgings chapter. I was fully expecting another fun scene like An Unexpected Party; where Gandalf lures Beorn into letting a company of Dwarfs stay in his house. What we get is a rushed scene where the entire company barrels their way into his barn-ish house fleeing from Beorn and locking him out of his own house. Then without explanation Beorn is fine with all the dwarfs piled in his house just because he hates orcs more then he hates dwarfs. This was one of my favorite scenes in the book and I was really disappointed with how awful it was done.<br/><br/>Next we get to the edge of Mirkwood where Gandalf seems to suddenly discover he needs to go to the south. In the book you get the impression that Gandalf with his great foresight planned to leave the party at the edge of the forest long before they got there. With Gandalf gone the rest of the company immediately become a bunch of morons who simply get lost in stupidity. The entirety of Mirkwood takes them less than 15min to traverse which really kills the feeling that it's a great and massive forest. There was no black river, not once did Bilbo say attercot to taunt the spiders while luring them away from the dwarfs. The Elves come in to save the day killing the spiders and then take the company of dwarfs to their prison cells. No twinkling lanterns, no fires in little glades that go poof when Bilbo or a dwarf tries to approach.<br/><br/>They are in and out of the Elvin prison in the blink of an eye with no sense of time that it took Bilbo to wander around learning his way around, scrounging for food and concocting his plan to escape. All of this was rushed through so we could have another action sequence of orcs chasing the party while elves chased them both but kinda helping the party of dwarfs. It makes no sense. Something that should have been done in a few cuts got extended to a 5min+ action sequence so they can show off their CGI.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I'll skip ahead to the last part that never happens in the book. The last 15 minutes of the film is a drawn out action sequence of the Dwarfs and Bilbo battling Smaug inside the Lonely Mountain. In the book the Dwarfs never engage Smaug at all. The long straight secret tunnel leading to the hidden door is not long or straight at all in the film. To top it all off, the ending was cut as Smaug is flying away toward Lake Town. There is no battle, no burning of the city, no Smaug getting shot in the breast by Bard and thus falling into the lake causing it to billow up in a cloud of steam.<br/><br/>In summary this is not The Hobbit. It is some film that Peter Jackson made up as he went along with what (conservatively) is less than 40% parts of the books story. If you are a fan of Tolkien you will undoubtedly be let down by this excuse of a movie.<br/><br/>-Patrick"
"KbUCSyqmGk","2","373","564","13 December 2013"," The Hobbit: The Desolation of Literature and Film-Making
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is more of a bad Steven Seagal clone than an adaptation of well-read literature. The first film in the new trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, was very good, with one problem I'll mention later. If the worst decision Director Peter Jackson made was to include Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly, which seems to be the case for the professional praise-givers, this film would be fantastic. However, it just so happens that there's this little thing Jackson and his fellow writers forgot to do: make sure the movie resembles the book.<br/><br/>I'm sure most people who saw the first movie remember the leading villain Azog. Well, in case you haven't read the book, page 251 of my 1997 Houghton Mifflin copy states ""Bolg of the North is coming, O Dain! whose father you slew in Moria."" In the section on Durin's Folk in Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings, it is stated that Dain Ironfoot, who is supposed to appear in the next film, slew Azog in the big Dwarf vs. Goblin battle we see as a flashback in film one. This means that the entire Azog subplot is just one big fan-fiction. It is one thing to include the son of the Elven-King (Legolas) even though he is not mentioned in the book, after all, is it so inconceivable that Legolas would be near his father? It is an entirely different matter when a character is included even though he has been dead for over 100 years!<br/><br/>Continuing with our game of ""What is timeline consistency?"", we come across Gandalf. Gandalf ends movie 2 in a cage at Dol Guldur. Beyond the fact that there is no rationale for such a decision, we know from Appendix B that Gandalf reports the existence of Sauron to the White Council and then takes part in the attack on Dol Guldur. After that battle, he proceeds to save Bilbo's life right before the Battle of Five Armies. Based on this film's timeline and what part of the original timeline still remains, Gandalf has but a handful of days to accomplish all that I have listed.<br/><br/>My copy of The Hobbit is 271 pages long. The US edition of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 310 pages. Why in the name of Eru do you need three movies for this story? I understand and would have gladly stood behind two films, therefore allowing for extended action sequences and a limited reduction in content. Three films should be more than enough to cover the entire book but apparently not for Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Beorn is trimmed down to the importance of Celeborn, then we watch a ridiculously long giant spider sequence, then the dwarfs are captured for maybe three hours Middle-Earth time, then we watch an overly long fan-fiction chapter about Azog's friends being killed by our two elf heroes. Note that Bolg is able to attack the dwarfs because Jackson changed the escape from Mirkwood scene in order to allow for more combat. <br/><br/>After our craziest bloodbath yet, we have an overly long scene introducing another Jackson creation: Bard, the Barge-Sailer who apparently got mixed up with Bard, the Captain of the Guard. You see, the former makes a whole bunch of claims that are actually true about the latter. Why do we need to mess up the Lake-Town sequence? If you guessed ""To set up another impossible bloodbath"", give yourself a vacation to a combat zone. This round of combat is only after we leave four dwarfs behind because one of them got the Witch-King's knife disease that Frodo got in Fellowship but this time it came from an arrow fired by Bolg who has absolutely nothing better to do since Azog took all his screen time. Of course, Kili is saved by Tauriel, Captain of the Guard of the Woodland Realm who somehow has the same healing capability as Lord Elrond Half-Elven, wielder of one of the three Elven Rings of Power and a direct descendant of the Kings of the Noldor. It is rather fortunate Tauriel is there, because otherwise, Kili would have to wait for the next movie to have his deathbed dialogue, provided Jackson even sends Fili and Kili to Erebor where they're supposed to be. I'm all for the suspension of disbelief, but this doesn't even make sense in the fantasy universe.<br/><br/>And don't forget the dragon. In Lake-Town, the viewer is reminded multiple times that Smaug can only be killed by a special ballista-bolt, strangely called an arrow, and only in one tiny spot on his stomach. In the mountain, Bilbo points it out again. But Peter Jackson apparently pays no heed to the script with his own name on it and gives the viewer a 30 minute ""Let's Kill the Dragon Sequence"". Take a guess who doesn't die in this sequence. If you said Smaug, the Fire- Breathing Dragon, you are more qualified to direct this movie than Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>I loved the Rings film trilogy and, with the exception of Azog, the first Hobbit film. This film though, has almost no plot development, almost no consistency with the timeline given by Tolkien, almost no attention paid to its own script, and entirely too much combat. I remember Jackson being criticised for the warg battle in Towers but that did not require any plot change except for the location of the death of Hama (a very minor change) and the whole Aragorn-cliff- dream-thing which serves to heighten the tension before a battle that is done far better in the film. The warg battle helped to make a good fantasy film. This film seems like it is trying to see how many people can be killed before it gets an R rating from the MPAA. Deviations from the book are good if it enables better cinema but not when it allows for ""Let's Kill Everything We See: The Movie""."
"bob the moo","Null","99","144","28 December 2013"," Improves upon the first one just about enough to cover the weaknesses it shares with it
","After seeing the first Hobbit film I must admit that I could have cared less about seeing the second and indeed it took me a minute to get back into it and I was grateful for the film giving me a ""12 months earlier"" scene to sum up what I am supposed to be following. It wasn't that the first film was bad (it is too expensive to be bad) but more than constant action and movement with no consequences or realism to engage me, really left me looking at a video game that I had no investment in (and I say this as a gamer). I didn't hope for much better when I went to see this sequel and, as Theo Robertson has said, perhaps this helped me enjoy the Desolation of Smaug more.<br/><br/>The plot has more to it than one encounter after another and connecting it to the later films was a good move that made me feel there was more content here – although I think that was artificial, I will not deny that it worked. The action sequences retain the same problems as the first film, which is that nobody ever feels like they are in real danger no matter how long the fall, how low the odds or what is happening. The good thing is that because the film isn't one escape sequence after another, I didn't feel this so often – although it is undeniably still a problem in these films. The characters were a little better than before although perhaps I was just more interested in them. Smaug in particular is a great creation – visually and stylishly; just like the first film where my favorite parts were the still and tense sequences with Gollum, so too here the high point of the whole film is where Smaug is toying with his potential victims and it is such a shame that this was not done longer.<br/><br/>Visually the film remains a feast – although, befitting the time of year, it is a Christmas feast where everything is good but it is endless and eventually just feels indulgent and gluttonous. This remains the case because the film almost never feels like it was shot wholly on a location. I remember the LotR films impressing me with their natural beauty but here even a shot of people walking across a field seems to have been digitally enhanced and, as good as it looks, it does remove me from the film somewhat. Visual effects are impressive but it does really hurt to see Jackson leaning towards the George Lucas ""if we can do it then we should do it"" school of effects management. The cast do solid jobs – I liked Freeman and McKellan when they were allowed to be more than just special effects The dwarfs made more of an impression on me this time but the elves not so much – Bloom remains stiff while Lilly sports the only unconvincing effect in the film in the shape of her ears. Cumberbatch was strong as the voice of Smaug and I enjoyed Fry and McCoy in supporting roles (shame the latter missed out on more time due to his Doctor Who efforts during the 50th anniversary year!).<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is a solid blockbuster; lots of action, a decent story and strong special effects – this is not the same as saying it is a great film though, but it does still entertain. The story remain distant due to the invincible characters and consequence free (but very seriously presented) action, which does prevent one being drawn into it. Of course I'll be there for the final film, but I really do hope than they focus on danger rather than spectacle and build the tension instead of just increasing the noise."
"sapphireblue_13","1","86","125","6 January 2014"," Miraculously unkillable elves fight endlessly with badly CGI-d orcs
","A large proportion of the film is over-taken with elf-orc fight scenes: two elves that aren't even in the book manage to heroically slaughter hundreds of orcs in scenes that aren't in the book.<br/><br/>The ridiculous 'not in the book' love interest between the female not-in-book elf and dwarf culminates in her healing him from a wound that didn't happen in the book, which separates him from the others (again, not in book) using magical powers that it is really unlikely she would have even if she did exist as only a tiny number of elves have that power.<br/><br/>Then at the end, in more 'not from the book' drama, it would seem that hiding behind a sliver of stone will shield people completely from nearby dragon-fire. DRAGON FIRE which apparently doesn't get you if you turn the corner or jump off the cliff in the nick of time.<br/><br/>This lies at the heart of what is wrong with this film, it is trying to turn the Hobbit into an action movie complete with totally unbelievable escapes from danger. This is (theoretically) based on a children's book, it should be more Narnia and less LOTR. Just because they are in the same world should not make this a prequel to LOTR.<br/><br/>Also, all of this inserted stuff really grates and is mostly boring as it has no substance. I don't believe films have to slavishly follow the book but any changes should be justified and these most definitely are not.<br/><br/>Finally, the new bits are given precedence over the actual story and original content. How can they turn a single book into three films and yet cut-down or skip or rush through loads of really good bits from the book? How can they expand the fake characters at length and yet the real characters are barely used? Only a couple of the dwarfs are even distinguishable from each other.<br/><br/>No real attempt has been made to dramatise or flesh out the Hobbit book at all. This is a completely different film. And not even a good one."

","We all remember how George Lucas created an amazing trilogy called ""Star Wars,"" then went back later to do a prequel trilogy and tried to destroy the franchise by focusing on ridiculous visual effects and neglecting the story entirely; so too has Peter Jackson fallen.<br/><br/>The five points I have given are purely for the visual aspect of the movie. It is amazing. But we all expected that.<br/><br/>0/5 for story. Tolkien wrote an amazing little (LITTLE) book called the Hobbit. Jackson could have fit the important and relevant parts of ""An Unexpected Journey"" into about an hour. It is the same here. There is a ridiculous amount of filler, needless side-plots, and a stupid (for lack of a better word) love triangle that makes a Ryan Reynolds romantic comedy seem deep. And I mean OK, I expect filler if you're going to turn a tiny book into three three hour movies, but at least keep what happens in the book if you're going to make stuff up. A few times scenes that were actually written by Tolkien feel rushed and cut short, while filler scenes seem to drag endlessly.<br/><br/>Smaug had the potential to be great, and started out that way, but the gross on screen overuse of his character makes you think of a brainless rat running through a maze searching for cheese rather than the majestic dragon we all grew up reading about.<br/><br/>I could keep on listing things I did not like (like bringing Legolas into the film to draw fans, and then overusing every cool thing he ever did in LOTR until you're sitting in your seat begging him to stop {ex, he surfs on EVERTYTHING}) but I am going to stop.<br/><br/>Go see the movie on principle, but don't go looking for the nostalgia of LOTR like I did. Because even though it should be there, any chance these films had of greatness was lost in the desperate attempt to turn what should have been one great film into a three year money making machine."

","Admittedly, I am biased from having read the wonderful book, but it looks like Peter Jackson has been writing his own story. He keeps making up pointless crap as an excuse to add more CGI and more fighting scenes. If you are looking for mindless fighting, zero dialogue, an overuse of CGI that would leave James Cameron shaking his head in disbelief, then sure, this movie is probably for you! However, if you are looking for the same emotion and magic that the book brings out in you, prepare to be disappointed, over and over again.<br/><br/>Beorn is in the movie for about a minute and has the eloquence of a donkey with autism. Mirkwood before the elves appear is barely five minutes long. Which means the spiders disappear before they even got the chance to appear, and there is no Bombur falling in the water, and nothing to lure them off the path, they just get lost because they are extremely dumb dwarfs. Orcs are chasing them wherever they go, and the barrel- ride out of Mirkwood is a 20-minute long scene where nothing really happens, except a lot of orcs die, and Kili gets shot with a poisonous arrow(?). Then they bribe Bard into smuggling them past the guards into Lake-town. Apparently Bards ancestor shot off a piece of dragon scale under his left wing, so Bard already knows of the Dragon's weakness. No thrush has to tell him anything... All the dwarfs race into Smaug's lair and go on a rat-race in which Smaug is too brainless to actually kill anyone, and when he has an absolutely obvious shot at it, he suddenly has a change of heart and decides to let them live. Also, four of the dwarfs are still in Lake-town tending to the poisoned Kili and fighting orcs with the elves. Make sense? Not really, no. The book has been torched, and Peter Jackson has rewritten it the way it was (probably) intended; as a fighter-book with cool environments, cool people who say cool things, cool dwarven caves and cool statues. The things I have pointen out are only a few of the many changes and disappointments from the movie. Who needs a good story with all this CGI?<br/><br/>The acting is dreadful, the dialogue is dreadful, the CGI is dreadfully overused, the plot is dreadful (it's not the same as the book, believe me.) But the dragon was pretty cool. So therefore: 2/10."

","I loved the LOTR movies despite the liberties Jackson took with the story (especially in The Two Towers) and I found the first Hobbit movie tolerable but this one stinks. Jackson seems to think that we like his story-making over Tolkien's. He has used his gratuitously added action scenes from those movies as the basis for almost the entirety of this 3+hour movie.<br/><br/>There is maybe 15 minutes of this movie that is from the book. The rest is stuff that Jackson wrote and never-ending CGI action shots that have such fast moving elements that you can barely tell what is going on and the characters perform feats that stretch belief so far that even the fantasy-world of Middle Earth cannot overcome. The character of Bilbo is diminished almost to a supporting one. The main characters of this movie are Tauriel and Legolas (the former made up by Jackson, the latter never appears in The Hobbit) and Bard. The character of Bard is totally changed from the noble protector of Lake-town to that of a ruffian on the margins of Lake-town society. The dwarfs were portrayed in the book as being a little cowardly, very greedy and bumbling. In the movie they are like a pack of Jackie Chan's with beards, even taunting the dragon to chase them through the halls of Erebor to try to catch him in a trap. From a cinematic critique Jackson continues his habit of massively exaggerating the scenery vertically so that as the party is making there way up the side of the Lonely Mountain it seems like they are climbing the Matterhorn.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. Bottom line is this movie is lousy. I have watched each of the LOTR movies several times; I don't think I could sit through this movie for a second time."

","First, I want to say that I loved the LOTR trilogy. The spirit of the movie is close to the spirit of the books, even though the action scenes are more dominant in the films.<br/><br/>The Hobbit has a completely different spirit than the LOTR trilogy. Though I am adult, and the Hobbit is considered a children's book, I enjoy it a lot. I have read the book a couple of times and listen to it (as an audio book in Swedish, with a very talented reader) and it is just a wonderful journey.<br/><br/>Both the story-telling and the story itself has a great number of intricate and humorous moments. With Peter Jackson's talent of making the LOTR trilogy into the three movies I had great expectations of the Hobbit movie. Unfortunately, PJ has just made another LOTR-movie which has very little to do with the Hobbit.<br/><br/>In my point of view, the greatest moment of the book was when the dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf visited Beorn. For the movie, I just couldn't wait to see how PJ had tackled the big hassle Gandlaf had to introduce all the dwarfs to Beorn. In the book, he had to introduce them two by two, during a long period of time. Just to make Beorn comfortable with so many visitors. PJ left this wonderful scene and changed it to an action scene, where the company just sieged Beorns house and didn't let him in. That makes the film story to something completely different than the book.<br/><br/>Then, I was curious whether the company would be served by animals, as they are in the book. That could have been a challenge, and PJ didn't take it, but placed a normal cow and goat in the kitchen and living room.<br/><br/>If you are around 13 years old, never read a book and obviously not the Hobbit, and love to play Grand Theft Auto - this might be a decent movie to watch. Otherwise: skip it.<br/><br/>The only positive thing with the PJ:s movie being so bad and so far from the book, is that there is room for a REAL The Hobbit movie in the future!"

","If you were thinking about seeing The Desolation of Smaug, do yourself a favor and stay home. It's close to 3 hours of your life you will never get back. The plot has almost nothing to do with the book. There are completely fabricated characters and there is NO character development. In fact, I had to go stand in the hall for a minute because my brother & I were laughing so hard about the fact that the third movie could be 3 hours of the cast members literally destroying copies of The Hobbit and it would probably be a better movie than this. The last 30 minutes are completely made up, insulting to Tolkein, and painful to watch. I would actually pay more than I paid to see the movie to get those 3 hours of my life back. I am at a loss for words at how Peter Jackson did so well with the Lord of The Rings movies and then seemingly had a seizure while holding a pen and decided to call it a script and go with it. I think they thought that bringing back Legolas would help the movie, but in fact they only detracted by going ahead & writing him as a bland character who is now, instead of being primarily an archer, a ninja swordsman of some sort. They also opt to attempt to squeeze in a love story instead of actual events that happened in the book, because dull romance sells. If you love the book as much as I do and have any sort of positive expectations for this film, you will be severely let down."

","Tolkien's works mean a great deal to me. I spent my childhood reading and rereading The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and whatever else I could get my hands on published posthumously. The Hobbit is a gentle story. Bilbo, with some help from Gandalf and the Dwarfs, is able to accomplish amazing things, despite his small size, because of his luck, wits, and strength of character. The other characteristic of the book is the vastness, diversity, and beauty of the world, filling one with curiosity for what is just around the corner, but also taking just enough time to linger a while in every place.<br/><br/>These Hobbit movies don't linger, characters and scenes are abridged in all the wrong places in order to make time for pervasive and repetitive chase scenes. Even where there isn't a chase scene, they are added. Jackson seems to have taken every scene in the book and asked the question ""how can I make this into a battle/chase scene?"" Bilbo's power and strengths, are greatly usurped in this film by the intervention of Legolas saving the day each time. Beorn is truncated. The magic and mystery of Mirkwood is particularly lacking. The gentle escape from the elves in the barrels is turned into a farce obviously designed to tie in with a future theme park ride.<br/><br/>Don't see the films nor allow children to see them before reading the books. You should exercise your brains and imagination, creating the images yourself, rather than letting someone else imagine for you, causing you to be stuck with the images from these mediocre films.<br/><br/>Jackson seems to know nothing of the poetry of the book, of mythological archetypes, language and history, nor the unique, gentle fantastic quality of Tolkien's work. Its very sad."
"Hausmannsgate","5","244","394","11 December 2013"," The worst installment in the series thus far
","About three minutes in to The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug we find ourselves back in the company of our merry dwarfs, a wizard and a hobbit as they yet again find themselves fleeing from Azog the incompetent orc, who is attempting to kill them. The scene is fast, action packed and not particularly exciting. When the scene is finally at an end we are served with some forgettable dialog where the company discusses the danger they are in, accompanied by some dramatic background music. It's a sign of things to come. This is basically how you will spend the next 150 minutes or so: long, drawn out action scene, short futile discussion with dramatic background score, new drawn out action scene. Throughout the movie I found myself desperately searching for moments of silence. Scenes that would allow the audience a break from this video game like narrative, but it was almost never to be found. <br/><br/>Now let me shoot in that I like to enjoy brainless action in movies and video games for that matter, but that doesn't mean that it's right for this movie. The Hobbit is an adventure film and should play out like fairy tale. But this fairy tale suffers from a lack of restraint. It has too much action, and amazingly, too much score. It has never been an annoyance in the past, but really, does every piece of dialog have to be accompanied by score? The source material for this film; the passages of the book which describe the long walk through Mirkwood forest, the escape from the elves and the arrival in Lake town are some of the funniest, most memorable and imaginative from the entire book. To my disappointment, all the charming little scenes where Bilbo runs around invisible with his ring to help the dwarfs out of new trouble, are cut short and hastily rushed through. You get the feeling that the director is short on time and has to get it over quickly, but to make room for what exactly? How on earth is it that a trilogy consisting of three 160 minute films, all based on a short book, doesn't have the time to fully delve in to the most memorable passages from said book? Especially when these passages would have given the film some much needed pacing and comical relief. The answer came towards the end. The reason for why the film needed to move quickly was to make room for new elaborate and drawn out action scenes - all of them completely unnecessary for the plot. Now, I am no Tolkien purist, and I don't mind a little creative freedom if it serves a purpose. In the Desolation of Smaug, the only purpose seems to have been to satisfy anxious producers that the film would have enough orc on dwarf/elf/human action, which they obviously see as the only factor that made the three first films a success. <br/><br/>There are no peaks and valleys. Only a succession of ever higher peaks. Every scene seems more action packed or dramatic than the next, with hardly any humor at all, leaving us completely numb to everything that happens. The criticism is one I could also direct at the first Hobbit movie, but it was nowhere near as unrestrained as this one. The Desolation of Smaug is more related to Peter Jackson's King Kong than the original trilogy, and one is left to wonder how the Fellowship of the Ring would have looked like, if it had been made with the same creative philosophy as the Desolation of Smaug. In all likelihood the most charming scenes would have been cut short to make room for an hour-long battle in Moria. Let us only hope that the next film manages to show some restraint in the build up the battle of the five armies. <br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities in this film are the set pieces, which have been wonderfully put together in the same manner of which we have come to expect from the previous films. The polish and color filters could have been toned down a bit, but visually the film is still a masterpiece."
"eanhernandez","2","61","91","27 December 2013"," I walked out
","This movie really blew it for me. Here is why, in increasing order of distastefulness.<br/><br/>1. Not taking the time to properly tell the many little stories in the book. This is too bad, because they were good stories. Beorn, Mirkwood, Elf fires, Bilbo and the spiders, Bilbo and the dragon, etc. are all abbreviated or simply left out.<br/><br/>2. Developing sub plots which were only alluded to in the book. These added depth to the world around the story, but fully played out they are irrelevant and obsessed with the LOTR plot. Radagast, the Necromancer, etc. are distractions, and doubly so with their relentless focus on premonition of events from the next 3 books. This also assumes that the director has more interesting stories to tell than the author did. He does not.<br/><br/>3. Adding characters and plots that were never in the book. The Pale Orc, Legolas, Tauriel, dwarf/elf romance, etc. These force the plot to change, distract from the story, and are weak compared to the original. Again the director demonstrates that the author was a better storyteller than he is. Plus, this allows for cringe-worthy scenes such as the one where the hottie-kungfu-elf-she-warrior saved her love interest dwarf from a morgul arrowhead with magic spells and herbs just in time to kill a bunch of orcs who ninja-style invaded lake town. <br/><br/>4. Doing another Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom style roller coaster ride. This was cute in the 80s, but is simply insulting at this point in time, and particularly in this story. Does one of the great stories of the 20th century really need a roller coaster ride to make it interesting? The moment I saw the dwarfs sliding down to waiting coal cars, I realized that I'd had enough. This was where I walked out shaking my head.<br/><br/>I'm sad about this movie because I loves these stories, and I doubt they'll ever be told in film again. This was almost as bad as the John Carter movie!"
"geolot1256","1","54","80","30 December 2013"," This is NOT Tolkien's ""The Hobbit""
","This movie MIGHT make a decent typical action CGI cartoon-like modern flick (by today's low standards), but it was supposed to be so much more. I think I might have somewhat liked- or at least tolerated- it if it was a story cooked up by Peter Jackson without claiming to be based on the great historical tale of Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". But, it claims to be ""The Hobbit"", and not ""Peter Jackson's Wacky Tales from Middle Earth"" so I looked at it against the true Tolkien story. From that viewpoint, this movies fails so bad that it is hard to write a review at all. And it failed even worse than ""The Hobbit Part 1"". <br/><br/>Where to begin?.. The Dwarf Kili who looks more human than the human characters in this film (you would think with PJ's love of special effects, they would not have overlooked this). He doesn't fit and what is worse, they have him playing puppy-love games with a female elf who is not even supposed to be in the movie. This female elf has a very large and completely fabricated role. It's like PJ plucked the idea from the ""Twilight"" films where the girl is torn between the werewolf and vampire boyfriends- only this elf is torn between the human looking dwarf and Legolas. Oh, and Legolas wasn't in the real story either. His role here would have been OK if kept minor, but an entire contrived subplot that gives him an action hero role is unnaturally injected into the story in order to give Orlando Bloom way too much screen time. I write this having actually liked his part in Lord of The Rings. Radagast is almost as bad as he was in Hobbit 1 and Gandalf is worse. A MAJOR snafu on PJ's part is that the one plot point that carries through all the real stories is the journal Bilbo started keeping at the start of Mirkwood that eventually becomes Bilbo's & later Frodo's life work is totally left out (and this plot point is prominent in PJ's LOTR films and the book is handed down to Samwise). I could go on, but anyone who knows Tolkien gets the idea. I loved the PJ's LOTR movies, but I hate what PJ & crew have done with ""The Hobbit"" >:(<br/><br/>One more point: PJ claimed that he used material from the LOTR appendix to get the filler to make 3 Hobbit movies, but that's not what he put in the Hobbit movies. The filler is made up from the mind of PJ & crew, not taken from the LOTR appendix. PJ must think he is better write than Tolkien. He is NOT.<br/><br/>Edit: Peter Jackson ruined the Lord of the Rings with this movie, how? The whole of the beginning of Fellowship was Gandalf unraveling the mystery of Sauron and the Ring, but now Jackson wants to spoon-feed every connection to the audience, so shows Sauron to Gandalf in Dol Goldur, thereby making the whole opening in Fellowship mute. The more I think about the Hobbit 1 & 2, they worse they are to me. If I had the stomach to watch them again, I am sure there would probably be dozens, if not hundreds, of more errors in these hashed plots."

You've got to be kidding!!! The Hobbit is all of about 300 pages versus nearly 1500 pages for the Trilogy. This is simply gross money-mongering at the expense of the audiences.

","I am a big fan of LOTR and whilst I thought AUJ was poor, I was willing to let that one go as a blip. With that in mind I had high hopes for TDOS which appeared from the trailer to be darker and grittier that the first instalment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what was presented was an absolute shambles. The plot is truly terrible and a mere shadow of the original book; the HFR 3D serves to visualise most of the film as a cheap, made-for-TV soap opera; there is virtually no character development and the CGI fight scenes are so bad it's just laughable.<br/><br/>In AUJ I found HFR 3D passable. It didn't distract me too much and maybe even enhanced parts of the film. However, in this instalment it was awful. The very first scene is almost unwatchable it's so bad and this is a theme that continues throughout most of the film. The character closeups are like watching a badly made TV show with all the limitations of costume and make-up clearly visible and the large-scale CGI scenes are like watching a computer game intro sequence. It just does not work.<br/><br/>The plot is only loosely based on the book. The great character of Beorn is just glossed over and the gorgeous Murk Wood is presented as a mere triviality. I was looking forward to a sinister spider scene but all that we got was some Disney-style nonsense that was not in the least bit scary.<br/><br/>The entire thing is conducted as if a child has written it... ""...and then the dwarfs go into beorn's house and then beorn tries to kill them and then he's not bothered and then he hates them and then he doesn't and then we're bored of beorn and then they go to murk wood and then gandalf goes to find the necromancer and we don't really know what that is or why but just cos and then there are spiders and then the dwarfs are stuck in the webs and then they're not stuck anymore and then they box the spiders and win and then some really really good looking elves come along and one of them is legolas and he's not really a wood elf but we'll just pretend he is cos he's really really good looking and the other elf girl who's really really good looking gets the hots for one of the dwarfs erm yeah erm hmm and that probably seems a bit weird so then the dwarf tells her a story about the moon and then and then...""<br/><br/>And now for the the fight scenes. Oh my god. Please just stop it. Please. If I see Legolas surfing around like some deranged beach bum with a bow and arrow one more time I think I'll throw up in the theatre. ""Pathetic"" doesn't even begin to describe the nonsense that is on display here.<br/><br/>And why, when PJ or GDT or whoever started saying ""... and then the dwarfs bait Smaug into lighting the furnaces and then hundreds of tons of solid gold melts in a few seconds and then the gold is made into a giant gold dwarf and then the giant gold dwarf splurges all over Smaug and then that's pointless anyway cos Smaug just shakes it off and then Smaug doesn't want to kill the dwarfs anymore just cos and then Smaug just flies off instead..."" did someone not just stand up and slap whoever it was very hard in the face and say: ""No. In then name of Gondor, I will not let you defile the work of the great Tolkien such""?"

","After a disappointing AUJ I really wanted to like this film. Unfortunately I've now lost complete faith in PJ's magic. <br/><br/>There are so many flaws in this film I don't even know where to start. From characters that are invincible (fighting barehanded giant spiders or Orcs !) which removes all tension from the film to utterly incomprehensible and unconvincing scenes (creation of giant dwarf gold statue in 5 minutes while a fire breathing dragon is on a rampage) this movie is just awful. Dialogues seem to be written by a 10 year old and the behavior of the protagonist contradicts what is expected from them (Why does the king of dwarfs threatens Bilbo despite their bond in AUJ? Why do the dwarfs leave one of theirs sleeping in the village? Why do the dwarfs leave so quickly the mountain once they realize that they can't find the keyhole?). The village scenes add no value to the story (fillers) and the love triangle is forced and unconvincing. <br/><br/>Worst, Smaug which seemed to be an eloquent and highly intelligent character in the first five minutes of dialog with Bilbo is then transformed into a stupid creature who can't find slow-paced and pudgy dwarfs in his lair. What a waste of material - Smaug could have been one of the best villains coming out of Hollywood. Now it's just a dumb dragon which likes to talk like a posh Englishman. <br/><br/>The 3D doesn't add any value to the film (contrary to Gravity) and the CGI was poor (why make a horse in CGI?). LOTR was more convincing. In the end neither my wife or I cared for any of the characters (existing or new). This film was an insult to our intelligence. We deserved much better.<br/><br/>I've put 2 stars. One for the first five minutes of dialog with Smaug (only real moment of the film with some tension) and one for the fine acting of Gandalf and Bilbo as usual."

","It can't be much fun being an Orc, can it? Not only is your acne so bad you're unlikely to get a girlfriend, but you spend your whole life trying to kill hobbits and dwarfs who are, for all intents and purposes, immortal. Maybe it's only bad ugly Orcs that do the chasing. Maybe there some more appealing Orcs running an organic farm in Orcshire.<br/><br/>Even when they manage to give one of the dwarfs a nick on the leg which, of course, with Orc poison means certain death, he only needs a bit of rub with the special green stuff and he's right as reign. What happened to certain death? Being a dwarf is only marginally better. None of them are allowed a discernible character, and, apart from the clashing accents, they're entirely interchangeable. It might have been better to call them something like Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy and Sneezy. That would at least have given them some sort of character and a potential character arc. Sneezy might benefit, for example, from a lesser known property of the Arkenstone, which is clearing up sinus problems.<br/><br/>Apart for the main dwarf (who wants to get the Arkenston, but will its power turn him evil? - anybody care?) and the good looking normal-size dwarf, who gets the fatal cut on his knee, but survives in order to get off with the only woman in the whole of Middle-Earth - doesn't this lack of women suggest a bit of population renewal issue here. How is Peter Jackson going to be able to produce his next trilogy when everyone's died of old age? I'm not sure the whole small-size thing ever worked in any of the Hobbit films. There was some stuff between Gandalf and Frodo at the beginning that almost did it, but after that the dwarfs never seemed very small, and nor did the hobbits. And of course the Hobbit hairy feet thing never convinced – they just look like a pair of unconvincing hairy slippers from the Pound Shop.<br/><br/>Wizards would seem to have the most going for them. They are old and they are wise – apart from the bad ones of course who are old, wise and nasty. Wizards present a slightly harder issue plot wise, because, put them into any seemingly impossible situation, for example, I don't know, hanging off a tower in an iron cage, and all they have to do is go, 'Piff Paff' and they're away. You can't even kill them. Gandalf gets killed by the Balrog in LOTR1, and, Piff Paff, he's back as Gandalf the White in LOTR 2. If he gets killed again he's still got green, red, and blue to go. No wonder Orcs are so bad-tempered – it's like England playing Australia.<br/><br/>Smaug the Dragon does look pretty impressive at the cost of a few million dollars although Ray Harryhausen did better with twenty quid and some plasticine and wire. Still, at least the dragon looks good. Trouble is, he never stops droning on and, even though can blast fire out of his nostrils with the power of six flame throwers, he's a totally useless shot and nobody gets so much as a flaming bum.<br/><br/>And I have to say the dwarfs idea of killing the dragon is a bit convoluted considering they're making it up as they go along. The plan is, to get the dragon to fire up to the old furnace by standing in front of him, so when he totally misses them AGAIN he accidentally starts the fire burning. Then they have to channel the molten gold into a mold of a big warrior and then they're going to melt him down again, and cover the dragon with the molten gold. 'Couldn't we just stab him?' No you can't, 'cause we've need at least another fifteen minutes of the dragon totally missing everyone.<br/><br/>And even after all that he doesn't die, just flaps his wings a couple of times and off he goes – he's worse than Gandalf. It's almost as if Peter Jackson said, 'Oh no, we've killed the dragon and we've got another three hour film to make before next Christmas.<br/><br/>'But we've just buried him in molten gold.' 'Never mind that, I need him back. Oh I know, maybe he can just jump out of the molten gold and shake it all off like water off a wet dog' 'Yeah, that'll do it.' <br/><br/>And there's an awful lot of stuff that seems just tacked on to fill time: For example there's the boatman bloke, who Steven Fry doesn't like and neither does his a cockney assistant. Lake Town is full of extras going, 'I really hope his kills the dragon don't you.' 'Gosh yes. Hurray for the Dwarfs!! 'Shall we do a little dance. People might do that if they were sending dwarfs off to fight dragons off, mightn't they?' <br/><br/>Not wishing to put you off next year's The Hobbit: Three More Hours of Rushing About Pointlessly but, on top of the town hall at Lake Town, there's a giant catapult thing and the Boatman has a special arrow: The-Only-Thing-That-Can-Kill-Dragons-Special-Arrow. I wonder what on Middle-Earth is going to happen in Episode Three? But before that, we've got the four and half out extended edition of The Hobbit: The Despair Of Smaug At Ever Hitting Anyone on Blue Ray to look forward to. In this version, the dwarfs do some more running, and the Orcs do some more chasing, and Smaug does some more missing, and when the dwarfs come back in the boat, there's a real tiger on board, and maybe they can go to this island when there's a huge monkey or where meddling scientists have created real dinosaurs I tell ya. I can hardly wait"

With ""Desolation of Smaug"", he's over the tank and has crash landed hard on the other side.<br/><br/>The first movie took a lot of liberties with the original book and changed the tone entirely. The second one might as well not have claimed to be based on the book at all. It races through the few scenes that actually came from the book at breakneck pace just so it can get to the overlong scenes with characters who weren't in the book, or the scenes that beat the viewer over the head with the idea that this is a prequel to Lord of the rings, or the many, many, many ridiculous action scenes. For example, the chapter from the book that tells of the company's stay with Beorn comes and goes in what feels like about three minutes at the beginning of the movie, and bears (no pun intended) almost no resemblance to the book. Meanwhile, there's at least ten times that much footage of elves who weren't in the book beheading orcs and goblins throughout the film.<br/><br/>As many others have stated, I watched the Lord of the Rings movies many times in the theater and on DVD, but I have absolutely no urge to re-watch either of the first two Hobbit movies, and probably won't even bother seeing the third one.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd like to see films taken away from Jackson and given to a decent editor to see if he could make a two hour movie that's actually based on the original book."
"nicole-vandybogurt","1","56","86","26 December 2013"," Worst book to movie adaptation EVER
","For those of you who have never read the Hobbit (first off, shame on you) then you can disregard this review. You, like my husband, will probably enjoy this movie very much with the only complaint that it might be slow. <br/><br/>However, for those of you who love the book as much as I do (it is probably one of my favorite books) you will be horrified as you watch this terrible film. The only good part about his movie is the beautiful rendition of Smaug and his interactions with Bilbo. Those are probably the most accurate parts portrayed in the movie from the book even though they are not exact. <br/><br/>Major things that went wrong in this movie: -The overall feel of the book that was slightly present in the first film is gone. They tried to make it to much like the Lord of the Rings saga. The Hobbit is a different type of book and has a completely different feel that made the movie just feel not right. -I just cannot get over the creepy dwarf and elf love triangle that was set up between Legolas, Tauriel, and Kili. First off, a relationship between a dwarf and an elf would be completely unheard off and very unlike dwarven and elven characteristics. It goes very against the characteristics of their ""races"" and made me almost want to just stop watching. Does every movie need a love story these days to be interesting? -There are parts of the book that are blatantly changed for no apparent reason. Some changes that were made were understandable to condense the book into three movies. However, some of the changes made the movie longer, boring, and were just plain idiotic (here come the spoilers, you were warned!). For example, at the end of the movie the dwarfs lead Smaug around in a game of cat and mouse that takes up a good deal of time. This never occurred in the book and it was a waste of time. Another example would be much of the ""adventures"" the dwarfs and Bilbo had in Lake Town. Literally none of the boring material was in the book and it didn't lend anything to the story especially when a handful of the dwarfs were left in Lake Town because of Kili being hurt (again, never happened in the book and aided nothing to the story line). I could list dozens of examples of ways in which the movie strayed from the book. -One thing that was disappointing was how Beorn was played. He almost had an idiotic giant feel to his character which is not at all how he was portrayed in the book. At least his ponies made an appearance in the movies. -The extra material not included in the Hobbit with Gandalf's travels to seek out the Necromancer was a little slow and, at the end, very corny. Trust me, you won't be able to miss that they are trying to make sure you can see the connection between the Necromancer and Sauron. It was a little much. -I was looking forward to the song that Bilbo sang to taunt the Spiders in the forest. When it wasn't in the movie I was very disappointed. It was a part in the book that aided to Bilbo's character and it was left out. I could go on forever about how terrible this movie was but I think I will end it there. Overall, go and see it just to say you have. However, it is definitely not a movie worth seeing more than once and I am not very excited to see the final film."
"lighterthanairflight","1","106","174","13 December 2013"," Stunningly Bad.
","This movie is unwatchable. Peter Jackson takes so many liberties with the characters and plot that you would never have known this was based on the Hobbit. I would expect a film like this to come from George lucas. the action sequences were too many, and too unrealistic (if you loved the obnoxious scene in LOTR when legolas single handedly brings down an entire massive elephant you will crap yourself when you see him standing on the heads of two dwarfs in separate barrels in a raging river, firing an endless number of arrows into the heads of orcs and the barrels don't separate. <br/><br/>you will not recognize the characters you loved from the book. you will leave the movie wondering if any directors have any interest in making movies that have any sense of meaning or wonder, rather than making masterbatory action films with no meaning or actual feeling."
"joshcawthorne","1","85","140","17 December 2013"," This isn't the Hobbit I know
","I went into the cinema with high expectations. I loved the first Hobbit film as I thought it was a superb film which kept true to the book and the slight deviations which did occur were harmless. However, when this film finished I was shocked and outraged. This film was absolutely nothing like the book. I am a big Tolkien fan and a know-it-all when it comes to middle-earth and its history so after seeing this film desecrating the story it completely infuriated me. I just don't know what was going through his head when he decided to leave four of the dwarfs behind, and what on earth was the whole sequence of the barrels about and Kili getting shot. This film had absolutely 0% accuracy to the book. Did he have a knock on the head or something? Why did it? The Hobbit is one of the most beloved children's books of all times and Jackson goes a completely changes it. The CGI for Smaug was impressive but he just wasn't portrayed as cunning, devious and intelligent as in the book. Legolas again was portrayed as a super-elf defying the laws of physics. But the thing I don't understand the most is how they got some of the fundamental ideas wrong. They portray Tauriel, with her healing powers, as a high-elf. like she is one of the Noldor. Which is complete nonsense. <br/><br/>They portray Thranduil as a potentially corruptible elf king as he is interested with gold.<br/><br/>Also the nonsense and made up material for how Gandalf goes into Dol Guldur by himself is just absurd, didn't they bother reading the appendix and silmarillion.<br/><br/>Something else I don't understand is why for the named villain they didn't use Bolg instead of Azog. Azog was killed before the hobbit took place by Dain Ironfoot and Bolg (Azog's son) was still alive, why did they resurrect Azog?<br/><br/>I don't think I will buy the film on DVD and I definitely won't go and see the last one. Undoubtedly, he will change the battle of five armies and probably have Bilbo kill Smaug. <br/><br/>Overall I think this film was a complete failure and actually nothing like the book. It was one of the most disappointing films I have seen. It was more disappointing than the inaccuracy of the LOTR trilogy. Jackson is a dreadful director and how he came to direct such fantastic books is beyond me."

","After reading a lot of critic reviews over the past week I was really hopeful that this movie would be better then the first Hobbit film, which essentially was LOTR 1 with different (useless) characters. They said the action was going to be a lot better?? WRONGGGGG!!!! More garbage that Peter Jackson threw together and added CGI to. I could honestly care less about any of the characters in this movie, which is something I felt the opposite about in the LOTR trilogy, which I loved!! I actually sat there in the theater hoping some of those stupid dwarfs would just die. None of them are meaningful and honestly who wants to see a cast of all dwarfs in an action movie? They are short, fat and ugly and none of them are as good as Gimmili was in the first trilogy. Then they finally get to Smaug, this bad ass Dragon who should be able to kill them all in about 2 seconds, but instead create a 30 minute chase scene where somehow all them survive!! Are you kidding me, pointless! THen there's the ring....he uses the ring sometimes, but others when you think surely he will use it, its like he forgets he even has it in his pocket. Idk how this movie has an 8.4????? It deserves a 6 and be down the the B Rate movies, so hopefully more people will give a lower score so others don't waste their money. Which btw two tickets for 3D...29 dollars??? Movies like this will be the demise of the theater as I wont be giving Hollywood Directors my hard earned money for crap my 5 year old could put together better. You have been warned!! Don't see this movie, unless your one of the thousands of teenie boppers who obviously rated this too high and have no care for character development or plot."
"RealDuality","8","181","319","9 December 2013"," A Fun Film, Particularly in 3D
","The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the ""whitewater rafting"" scene. That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non-King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film. <br/><br/>Besides Richard Armitage leading the way as the King under the Mountain with his great chemistry with fellow castmates, there are three actors who give specially noteworthy live-action performances. Lee Pace is one of the true highlights as Thranduil, who is an Elf King that deals with foreboding in a way that is different from Elrond. Ian McKellen's acting is comparable to him in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as he takes advantage of Gandalf getting his own storyline and heart-pounding action scene. Martin Freeman is good once again as the brave titular character, and actually slightly better. <br/><br/>The confrontation with Smaug is very enjoyable. It is a long movie, but the finale is the high point. Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job with the arrogant beast's voice, and the dragon looks really cool in 3D. I personally think that they ended it at the perfect place. When they divide a book up, it will inevitably result in a cliffhanger feeling. But, I am satisfied with how they handled it."
"chrisncamera","1","36","56","25 December 2013"," Terribly disappointed!
","As a huge fan of the original trilogy, who not only watched it in the theatres but purchasd every iteration of release, I'm shocked at this movie. I've watched the original 3 movies dozens of times, never feeling bored or lost in the storyline. They all had flow and connectedness through all the subplots and character development. This movie was all over the map with erratic editing and the feel of a made for TV soap opera. There are only so many times we need to see Legolas surfing on something while shooting arrows with an endless quiver at his side. Personally it would have done homage to the original 3 to maintain their cinematic construct and elements instead of jumping on the 3D high CGI bandwagon and losing the audience and storyline along the way. I wanted to leave 20min in but kept giving it the benefit of the doubt much to my segrin. Other members of the audience did leave. Highly doubt I will buy it on Blu-Ray either."
"neil-476","8","44","70","19 December 2013"," Great fun, but forget the book
","Bilbo Baggins and assorted dwarfs continue their journey to Erebor, overcoming various obstacles on the way (including hostile elves) before Bilbo has to try to fulfil his engagement as burglar under the fiery snout of antisocial dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>The second Lord Of The Rings movie suffered from Middle Film Syndrome: Hobbit 2, despite occupying the same position in a trilogy, does not suffer to the same extent, and perhaps this is because it is exciting all the way through, yet follows on from a film which was pretty slow throughout its first half.<br/><br/>It also contains large chunks which do not come from the novel - I'm pretty sure Legolas wasn't in the book. He is great fun here, as a much angrier soldier in the Elf Army. And new creation Tauriel is hugely enjoyable, resembling nothing so much as Uma Thurman's character from Kill Bill, albeit attractively played with the hint of a smile by Evangeline Lilly.<br/><br/>Apart from being a more engaging movie than part 1, pretty much everything I thought about that movie still holds. I still have reservations about the dwarfs - their faces and hair feel obviously prosthetic and wigged, and it's still pretty difficult to tell them apart from each other except for the old one, the one wounded by the orc arrow, Thorin, and James Nesbitt's Irish one. I still have reservations about CGI orc faces - the prosthetic orc faces work noticeably better. I still have reservations about some of the action sequences, where more is not necessarily better (one sequence, in particular had the audience laughing because of the extent to which the Elvish derring-do was over-derring-done). And there are times when Bilbo looks cut out and pasted into a scene. And, once again, the 3D is indifferent.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this was great fun. Loads of action, some nice character work, an excellent and nasty spider fight, a well-voiced and visually realised Smaug, and not the slightest yen to look at my watch.<br/><br/>And a cliff-hanger. You swine, Jackson."
"erikpelicaen","2","29","44","26 April 2014"," Peter Jackson: From Admirable Director To Capitalist Pig
","This is my first film review, and I am writing it down mainly because I need a way to get a load of hateful feelings off my chest... <br/><br/>Firstly, I apologize for the harsh review title, for insulting is an easy way to criticize, but it is quite an accurate way of summarizing this review and a manner of expressing my feelings. Secondly, this is a long review but I hope you take some time reading it, especially if you have the same sensation as the title expresses. Thirdly, I am glad to see that a lot of people share similar impressions from a film that by far does not deserve three Oscar nominations and an 8.1 rating, even though lately these are seldom to be considered valuable. Finally, I will approach this film basically on its cinematographic aspects and less on its content or on its relevance with Tolkien's work, for the disrespect to film as an art form is in my opinion even greater than the disrespect to the book – which is clearly out of proportion. However, maybe the greatest scandal of them all is the one Jackson does to himself.<br/><br/>THE THREE PARTS<br/><br/>Concerning this decision, diversified discussions exist. Many find it a dull idea because the book's content does not permit such a film length. Personally, I think it is an interesting idea to involve other elements from Tolkien's creation of Middle-Earth (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Children of Hurin), but Jackson totally ruins its potential. Instead of what he claims to do, he mostly fills it with ridiculously long and comic action scenes, an invented character – which happens to be really hot – and a cheesy, irrelevant love story. <br/><br/>These Hollywood clichés are the perfect recipe for capitalism, the compromise between art and business, even the complete neglect of art. What I find even more frustrating is how he then manages to make a 161 min. film with an overdose of fast moving cameras and less than one second during shots. Moreover, I am still unable to distinguish the dwarfs from one another and most of them barely even have lines. It also feels like Bilbo is disappearing behind Legolas and Tauriel. There are nearly no emotional connections being developed between the audience and the characters, compared to the LOTR trilogy, where strong bonds of empathy are constructed. <br/><br/>THE SOUNDTRACK<br/><br/>In An Unexpected Journey, the music is tolerable, although it certainly does not attain the magic of the LOTR soundtrack. However, here it seems as if Howard Shore ran out of inspiration, or does not find a way to bring the music to the front instead of letting it murmur in the background. And for Christ's sake, why in the world would you choose a sissy voice as Ed Sheeran's for your end credits, after a cliffhanger with a mighty dragon? Simply to expand the target public to teen girls and gain more profit.<br/><br/>THE ACTING<br/><br/>Actually, I cannot remember any of the actors acting well, except maybe for Martin Freeman. For almost all of the other characters, a general failure is the unbelievable overacting, which is sometimes almost worth crying for. OK, the acting in the LOTR is also very theatrical, but it perfectly fits in the Middle-Earth atmosphere and it is always convincing and emotionally provoking. However, in this film, almost every line is exaggerated and edited in a way the deep male voices sound 'really cool' (think of Beorn and Thorin). I am even disappointed in Ian McKellen, who throws some extremely overacted lines as well. <br/><br/>A brief attention goes to the two love scenes between Tauriel and Kili. It reminds me of Jackson's The Lovely Bones, which is maybe the worst film I have ever seen. I thought he would not dare making such a mistake again. I was wrong. I could not believe my ears when Tauriel started saying meaningless, cheesy rubbish about the universe and it continued for at least five minutes. However, that was not enough The scene where she is healing Kili's leg and an aura of white light appears was just making me sick. On the other hand, Benedict Cumberbatch's voice for Smaug is very convincing. <br/><br/>THE ACTION AND CGI<br/><br/>A simple thing I don't understand about modern CGI is that it is meant to make look things very realistic, but it often results in the contrary. There is a huge difference with the LOTR, especially with the Orcs and Wargs. I also have the feeling Jackson rarely went looking for a good setting and he just added everything with CGI. There is no more time for admiration of the magnificent landscapes from the LOTR and even from An Unexpected Journey. The only CGI that blew my mind was Smaug's appearance. <br/><br/>Another important thing is the action, in which Jackson completely loses himself making the impossible combat experience, which ends up in a very computer game-like sensation. He forgets Middle-Earth is an imaginary world, but with realistic physics. The river scene, Legolas' and Tauriel's scenes, it is not even worth discussing<br/><br/>I could go on for hours, but sadly there is a 1000 word limit. I hope you now agree with the choice my review title, because Peter Jackson is a perfect example of one who is consumed by capitalism – what I consider to be a severe illness – and therefore does not take time to think of a worthy completion of his previous artwork. I find it really hard to imagine him watching his premiere, and thinking he has made a brilliant piece of work.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings really made my teenager years and I was really grateful Jackson existed, but now he just ruined every single bit of respect I had for him"
"cadillac20","8","295","533","10 December 2013"," A Fantastic, Exciting Adventure
","While I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.<br/><br/>Before I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.<br/><br/>While the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.<br/><br/>While this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon."
"halomugen2","1","23","34","2 January 2014"," A travesty.
","This movie was a slap in the face to Tolkien and his book. The movie diverges so far from the story that real fans of the book will be outraged. Characters and plot are added at random and certain elements from the book are altered for no conceivable reason. Aside from it's terrible representation of the book it is not a very good movie. Some scenes are even filmed with a go-cam. The CG can be bad at times and the action is filled with over-the-top antics. If you want a mindless break from reality then go see this atrocity. If you are looking for a proper retelling of the book then stay away. Some of us have been waiting for years for this movies and Peter Jackson has strayed so far from the masterpiece that was The Lord of the Rings."
"oskari-ratinen","2","20","29","14 January 2014"," Feels thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.
","The Hobbit is a simple and straightforward children's book about finding a dragon, killing it and going back home. How can you possibly mess that up when you start making a film adaptation with abundant resources? Well, let me tell you how they managed.<br/><br/>Poor J.R.R. Tolkien, he's probably spinning wildly in his grave right now. The man that you could with justification call an absolute perfectionist when it comes to the presentation of his work would have never approved of this silly bore fest. Honestly, during some of the fight scenes I was expecting Graham Chapman as Colonel to come on to the screen and tell us exactly how silly it was that we just saw. ""An Unexpected Journey"" was promising enough to assume that the trilogy would probably not be a complete flop after all, but ""Desolation of Smaug"" is where everything goes wrong. There's little left to redeem in the end.<br/><br/>OK, the bottom of the barrel first, fight scenes. In Lord of the Rings trilogy fight scenes passed two critical tests: they were (at least if you exclude Legolas) somewhat realistic, and they served a purpose from the viewpoint of the story. Here, we have none of that. Legolas is back with sillier stunts than ever but that's not all. This time, EVERYONE is doing silly stunts, except the orcs of course, who are there solely to get hit, usually in the groin by an axe that has just passed through several pairs of hands of dwarfs that are going down rapids in bouncing, shaky barrels that somehow refuse to sink despite taking in water all the time. Another thing: whenever a central character is threatened in any way, you'll soon learn to ask yourself two questions: which part of the baddies' body is the arrow going to pierce, and who will shoot it? <br/><br/>Need I even talk about the absurd love story between one of the dwarfs and the elven warrior played by Evangeline Lily? It's probably enough if I say it's one of the most forced and implausible love stories ever put on screen. Besides from this romance that kick starts immediately without a viable reason, everything in this movie is so drawn out and slow that Bilbo's quote from Lord of the Rings fits perfectly. You wait and wait for something meaningful to happen, and when it finally does. It. Goes. On. For. Ages. There are good things as well, most notably Martin Freeman does good job as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as the voice of Smaug. Unfortunately, with a script like this even talented actors can only do so much.<br/><br/>The script. Oh god, the script. I refuse to talk about it. If watching the movie was this painful, how awful must it have been to actually write something so boring? All in all, this movie is bad. Really, really bad. It's not because the crew and cast don't know what they're doing, it's because they're doing too much of everything just to squeeze out as much money as possible from source material that would've been enough for one feature film and no more. Also, the spirit of the source material is forgotten. This is no kids' movie, this is a movie that tries its earnest to be Lord of the Rings without ever having a chance to achieve that goal.<br/><br/>A friendly word of advice to you Peter Jackson: since you clearly wanted to make a movie trilogy that was like LotR, start filming Silmarillion next. There's enough gritty source material for ten movies for you there, and it's all action if you so wish. Drop the silliness you have brought in in The Hobbit though."
"liderc","1","63","105","19 December 2013"," Plan 9 from Outer Space?
","To start with, I think ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is a highly underrated movie. But watching this movie I really couldn't help thinking of watching the worst movie of all time.<br/><br/>First of all, the direction. Peter Jackson's cheap and uninspired made-for-TV style hasn't improved at all since the first part of LOTR. Nor has his poor script writing. Time and time again the actors have to dramatically mumble silly one-liners like ""The war is coming!"" and stare into the camera as if they were in pain. They probably were, since all the actors generally seemed to be decent. The script also is just a loosely connected series of fights and battles time and time again containing pseudo-dramatic situations of the kind ""all is lost"", but since it's all so overdone, you know it will be all right and of course the story has to go on, too.<br/><br/>Particularly the queeny elves with their perfect hairstyles annoyed me, their king is more of a queen, anyway. At least that leader of the dwarfes, the guy with the black long hair and the beard, was super hot.<br/><br/>It all ended with lenghty conversations with a dragon high on coke, I hoped he would kill them all, especially since the Hobbit looks like a German trash comedian (Bully Herbig) whom I detest. The dragon flew away in the end, my buddy, who knows the book, said this actually more or less is the end of the book, the next part probably will be filled with more battles and with more silly dialogue.<br/><br/>It's actually very sad that a great work of literature is reduced to such silly and trashy film making and script writing. If they had just made a fantasy movie based on their own script where you know it will be a superficial action fantasy movie with perfect hairstyles flowing around that would have all been well and good. But now Mr. Tolkien will have a very uneasy rest, shame on Peter Jackson! Ed Wood would have done a better job with all the money Peter Jackson had available!"
"addietomic","9","362","676","7 December 2013"," No desolations here!
","Even though I formally thought ""An Unexpected Journey"" was a bit chipped off by quality from the original ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, due to its certain lack of seriousness the former Jackson Middle-Earth films had, I wasn't really disappointed by it. It was a different, more softer storyline, and under it had to have a different directorial approach. Going to see the second one, I had my worries if it's going to be on a dose less of action and excitement and more centered on the characters, which I always kind of felt myself, was a mistake for a purely adventure film, a road that many movies have taken on in sequels. Fortunately, it was nothing of a sort. ""Desolation"" gives a stronger adventure and enjoyment than the original Hobbit movie. Faster pace, beautiful sets, lovely score, costumes and most impressive CGI than ever before, with the comeback of one of the most beloved character of the original series, Legolas, will surely win over the audiences both fans of Tolkien's book and not, over the globe again this Christmas season. If anything, I'll definitely go catch it again. Thumbs up!"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","38","61","20 December 2013"," Some disappointing things, many good things and one magnificent asset- liked it very much
","Having really enjoyed An Unexpected Journey, though it was a long way from perfect, last year, a family cinema outing for this was guaranteed. And it was worth the wait, Dad and I liked it a little less than my brother, sister and godparents(die-hard LOTR and Hobbit fans by the way) but all of us found a lot to enjoy, more so than An Unexpected Journey. Desolation of Smaug also shares imperfections, Azog is still a very one-dimensional villain and doesn't add a lot to the story(Bolg is no better either actually); the love triangle felt forced and shoe-horned in for the sake of it, including a bit that is like an inferior copy of Arwen and Arogorn; Beorn is criminally underused and any signs of development with him is rushed; the Mirkwood scene is far too short though the atmosphere was good; Gandalf deserved more to do with only his encounter with Sauron and perhaps the beginning really standing out for him; and the ending is very abrupt with a pointless, too long and really overly-silly battle between Smaug and the dwarfs(Smaug's final line was incredibly chilling though!).<br/><br/>Moving on from the debits, the film does look amazing. I liked that we saw more locations and that the film has a softer, darker yet more storybook-like feel to it than An Unexpected Journey. The attention to detail in the costumes, make-up and sets(Laketown is fantastic) is remarkable, the photography is beautifully transitioned and atmospheric and most of the special effects are great, especially with Smaug, Sauron and the spiders and excepting the flowing gold and maybe Azog. The music in equal turn is ethereal and haunting, not the most memorable stuff that Howard Shore has written but it fits perfectly within the film. The script has a better balance between the comedic and dramatic, in fact the humour is subtle while taking much more of a serious approach than to An Unexpected Journey without being too morose. It's thought-provoking too, and Smaug's lines especially in his taunting of Bilbo and when Bilbo implores him from not attacking Laketown are just chilling.<br/><br/>The story gets much more to the point than in An Unexpected Journey and the pacing is swifter with generally more dramatic tension(if not always consistent). There are some great set pieces too, Bilbo's encounter with Smaug is the highlight of the film, tense and brilliantly written, though the spider scene is appropriately sticky and matches it in tension, Gandalf's encounter with Sauron was brief but visually stunning and the barrel-on-the-river scene while on the over-exaggerated side is a lot of fun, inventive and thrilling. The acting is good, Martin Freeman is still appealing in a curmudgeon sense, Ian McKellen is still perfect as Gandalf(even doing things that you do not expect someone of his age to still do, but he should have had more to do), Richard Armitage is a brooding presence and succeeds in showing Thorin's worse qualities and Ken Stott stands out among the dwarfs, he is fun and wise here. Orlando Bloom has some charisma, Lee Pace plays the morally ambiguous character of Thranduil just right(he does come across as a douche but from a moral perspective he is an interesting character) and the astonishingly beautiful Evangeline Lilly brings some real heart as the most likable character of the film.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry chews the scenery amusingly, Sylvester McCoy does respectably with Radagast wisely being given a backseat and Bard is well played. The best asset of the film though is Smaug. Right from his design, the best-looking dragon design since that for Dragonslayer. To how cunning, manipulative and physically mighty he is. And to Benedict Cumberbatch's(one of the most talented actors to date) booming, sly, sinister and really quite phenomenal voice-work in definitely the most evil role he has done to date. The film absolutely nails the scene between Bilbo and Smaug, and Smaug and Cumberbatch have much to thank for that, as well as the writing being the best it is. While the film is not faithful at all really to Tolkein's The Hobbit apart from some details- it's often more Lord of the Rings-feeling(though not as good) than The Hobbit- the first half of the scene between Bilbo and Smaug does show clear evidence of fidelity, with the dialogue almost straight out of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, judging it as a stand-alone- which in all honesty it deserves to be, one of those things that I'm getting sick of repeating but it's necessary because of how much of a problem it seems to be(not quite as bad as people having no regard for other people's opinions and making out they're the only ones that are right, there's a lot going on here too)- The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug was a flawed but very entertaining film and superior to its predecessor from personal opinion. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"
"cparkin2012","1","16","23","20 January 2014"," Complete Tripe!!!
","This is not the Hobbit, this is a film based very loosely on the book by Tolkien. Lots of action scenes added for no other reason but to stretch the films out. They have changed major plot lines of the book and I cannot see for what reason except but to detract from what was a masterpiece. The Story of Beorn the skin changer was completely messed up and destroyed, the Mirkwood scenes was also a complete mess and missed the target by miles. Dwarfs fighting Smaug within the lonely mountain....what's that all about?? Some of the dwarfs staying in the village and fighting Orcs?? Elves fighting dwarfs and Orcs during the barrel ride?? Elves fighting Orcs in the lake town?? Was there some addition to the story behind all these added fighting scenes, they lost all of Tolkien's important and legendary story telling ability with this movie. Also some of the movie looked so unreal I don't know why they didn't just make the entire film animated.<br/><br/>They lost the entire feeling of this adventure, this is one of the worst translations from book to film I have ever witnessed, whereas the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a very good translation from book, the Hobbit has so far been the opposite, and The Hobbit had the potential to be one of the best fantasy adventures to ever be put onto the big screen.<br/><br/>A complete failure and has been destroyed by some big wigs who used it as a money cow. I can only assume that anybody who rated this film highly is not actually familiar with the story of the Hobbit.<br/><br/>Some of the dwarfs didn't even look like dwarfs??!...How on earth did they think they were going to get away with that? and what all this about an underlying love story between an Elf and a Dwarf??<br/><br/>The biggest load of tripe I have ever had the misfortune of watching, its painful."
"kingjulian164","2","13","18","6 May 2014"," A Paradoxical Film in the Worst Way
","I just watched The Desolation of Smaug for the first time since I saw it and disliked it in theaters. It's still highly unlikeable. The entire movie is such a weird paradox. So bloated yet so anemic. So flashy and chaotic yet so utterly boring. The most important and weighty scenes play out like cartoons while the silliest, most contrived nonsense (like the Kili/Tauriel love story) is excruciatingly played out and takes itself far too seriously. <br/><br/>Beyond these problems, the film is clumsy in its pacing and has no flow to speak of. There's no structure, no rising action, climax or descending action; just stuff happening. Smaug feels like an afterthought when the film finally makes it to him, and beyond his cool design and Benedict's fantastic voice work he's a total failure. There's no sense of danger with him, no foreboding or menace. He practically plays tag with the dwarfs in a ludicrously silly action sequence that serves no purpose. Then the movie just ends. It's confusing and a bit pathetic. <br/><br/>The film does feature some nice bits of cinematography and Smaug does have his cool moments, but beyond that this is nothing more than a shameless cash grab that feels more and more irreverent to Tolkien with each passing minute. I despise the fans who demand that a film adaptation hold strictly to the novel, but ""Desolation"" is in a league of it's own where films seem to go out of their way to disregard and tarnish everything the novel set out to do in the first place. It's a lousy movie made by a now-lousy director."
"smithofwoottonmajor","4","13","18","3 February 2014"," The Hobbit: all Hollywood filler, no substance.
","As a lover of all things Tolkien, I'm vastly disappointed with the 2nd installment of The Hobbit. It seemed like ""filler"" and thankfully my ticket was only $8.00. In fact it had very little substance from the actual book. Apparently the film relies on special effects, characters, and scenes that are entirely superfluous. It's a pity that producers are more concerned with box office returns than actually making a true work of art. No attempt was made to be true to the written word of the literary master that was J.R.R.Tolkien. <br/><br/>That said, one thing I must say in Peter Jackson's favor; introduction of materials from the appendices can be pertinent and interesting. I don't mind him doing this at the time of his choosing either. <br/><br/>The earlier installments of The Lord of the Rings had their detriments as well but taken as a whole, they far surpass the first and definitely the second installment of The Hobbit. <br/><br/>Basicsally The Desolation of Smaug is a romp for an ADHD modern audience. I'll stick to the book."
"utr37","2","20","30","3 April 2014"," This Movie Stinks: Anecdotal Evidence
","By presenting just a handful of illustrations, I'll explain why this movie is no fun for anyone, unless you're a four year old.<br/><br/>Let's start off by saying that I'm not considering the books here, or how accurate the movies are. I'm just in it for the way overdone Peter Jackson Hollywood experience.<br/><br/>Having said that, this movie stinks. It makes very little sense, plus it looks like crap. Here's why.<br/><br/>1. Legolas' magic robot horse - First of all, there's the Legolas vs. bald orc leader boy who looks like Angela Merkel supposedly epic boss battle scene. The two get into what has to be the most uninteresting fight in Peter Jackson history. However, luckily for the viewers, it's over quite soon as the bald Merkel dude decides he's got better things to do and rides away on a warg. This makes sense when you consider the fact that the area was crawling with troops of orcs on wargs. But then, out of nowhere, Legolas ends up on the back of a golden boy horse in hot pursuit of Merkelboy. So first off, where on earth did this magic horse come from (and why don't I have one)? But most importantly, PJ includes this 'cool' Legolas on horse filmed from the front shot, portraying Legolas as the hair in the wind hero saving the day, but the only thing you can really look at in that particular scene is a horse that looks like a robot on steroids. Swingin' a miss, PJ.<br/><br/>2. Look, behind you - I'm almost embarrassed to say this, but you know the classic Hollywood trick where the bad guy almost catches and finishes off the good guy but then someone comes around the corner and yells ""Hey bad guy, I'm behind you"" and then the bad guy turns around and forgets what he was doing and leaves the good guy to run off and save the day? PJ must love that convenient little trick because it's in this film as well. And the funniest part is that when the distracting group of dwarfs calls out Smaug to turn around, they are at the opposite end of a huge hollowed out mountain and, in fact, in no position to harm him or do anything important to help the group of dwarfs that Smaug was after in the first place – unless, of course, distracting Smaug and having their friends run off. So, our cute villain dragon has absolutely no reason to turn his attention to the distracting group, but of course he does because PJ can't do anything right in this movie.<br/><br/>3. Lame go pro action - In what can only be described as the most nonsensical scene in Hollywood history, the cheeky dwarfs (who look like regular sized people in 90% of the movie) work their way around their enemies by floating down a river in barrels, all the while filming their nerdy action with go pro cameras attached to the barrels (go pro cams, really PJ?). They have neatly lined up the exact number of barrels to fit every dwarf. Then, after the most unbelievable scene of a dwarf jumping from riverbank to riverbank and killing an entire army of orcs just by rolling over them in his barrel, he decides he wants to get back in the water with his dwarf friends and so he jumps back into the river without even looking. As it turns out, even though there was only one barrel per dwarf just one minute ago, out of magical nowhere, an empty barrel ended up floating between the other dwarfs. Needless to say, the jumping action dwarf lands right into it without a scratch (even though, as anyone knows who ever tried to jump into an inflatable ring when he was a kid, this is the hardest thing to ever pull off). Where did that barrel come from and how often has the dwarf practiced jumping into inflatable rings as a kid? And since when are there inflatable rings in the Dwarf regions of Middle Earth?<br/><br/>4. Smaug's to do list - OK spoiler up ahead: this is about the movie's ending. So, the seven dwarfs are facing Smaug and undo this huge golden dwarf statue from its rocky prison. Then, as the gold melts (which, as all the streams of gold in the movie by the way, looks like a milkshake gone bad), it covers Smaug and, oh heavens no, Smaug is hurt and angry. However, just before this happened, Smaug had decided to fly over to some village to release his reign of terror. This makes sense, because even fire breathing dragons need activities to fill the day. But, at this point he had just been attacked and put through this cozy looking, but certainly life threatening golden shower. So shouldn't he be angry and like, attack the seven dwarfs and their Aragorn rip off leader, who, by the way, is hanging in mid air right in front of Smaug. I mean, in one five-second move he could easily wipe out all these dwarfs. For instance, he could pick up a rock from the huge pile in front of him and throw it at them. Or he could, you know, use his fire spewing abilities. But none of that, because Smaug has a to do list to attend to, so he leaves the dwarfs behind (amid all his treasures and riches - !!) and just flies off. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?<br/><br/>5. Legolas is the coolest guy in the movie even though Legolas is in fact the suckiest character in film history, you know, always ending up in scenes he doesn't belong in, staring off into the distance.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is stupendous and you should not waste your time watching it. Ever."

","I really enjoyed ""The Trilogy of the Ring"" and I liked reading ""The Hobbit"", so I was very disappointed when I saw ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013).<br/><br/>There is no compelling plot. There is no character development. The dialog is uninspired. There is not a single character who connects with the audience; or with any other character, for that matter. Gandalf appears at the beginning of the movie and then reappears at the end... he was missing throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>The entire film consists of ugly orcs (they all look a lot alike) who are hypo-testosteroned half-wits who love fighting anything they see, even rocks. They're bulked up and covered with war paint and they have fearsome weapons. Fortunately, they are no match for two elves and an unarmed hobbit! Every fight scene looks like every other fight scene, which look like the worst fight scenes from the trilogy... swarming orcs somehow being defeated by the greatly-undermanned but truly-inspirational hobbit community.<br/><br/>The special effects are not bad.<br/><br/>Here's the thing: Peter Jackson is running a scam on us. Groupies like me come running back and we contribute our money in the hope that we will see a good movie, hopefully even better than the trilogy. What we get is... (What? I can't say that?).<br/><br/>You might be able to watch this movie and enjoy it, if you prepare correctly.

"benisof","7","6","7","23 February 2014"," Too rushed, wrong emphasis
","I liked the movie overall, but in the end I felt that everything was rushed and little was presented...<br/><br/>1. I don't understand how a book presented in three 3h movies can seem so rushed... The meeting with Beorn was quick with no tension, no detail, no nothing. The journey through mirkwood was dull, a mere 2 minutes of wandering and then they jumped directly to the spider fight... The barrels escape came from nowhere. In the Lake town they were caught and they were gone. The search for the keyhole was stupid... Why the need of the light of the moon if they had a staircase which led to a wall smaller than one wall in my room where all they needed was to search a little for a hole? The story from inside the mountain seemed a totally different thing than the book... What was the story with the Lake chief? What is Gandalf doing, and why are the orcs here better armored (in the end) than in LOTR? <br/><br/>2. Fighting scenes are overly exaggerated... Probably influenced by LOTR. They get overly creative with all angle arrow shots and creative decapitations by Legolas.<br/><br/>3. The CGI is disappointing... There are a few scenes which seem taken from a video game. The orcs do not look real. There Is a scene where the orcs run over a lake bridge and Legolas follows ahorse when the riding doesn't seems at all natural. <br/><br/>The best thing the movie did was to make me read the book again, to remember the real details..."

How sad.<br/><br/>New characters, dialogs and plot twists are introduced constantly. Existing characters (those from the actual book) are bastardized and dumb down to the level, where there're hardly recognizable, and impossible to relate to.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for the movie to end, and left cinema disappointed, almost in disbelieve that what I saw, was actually The Hobbit.

","The switching between CGI and non CGI shots was painful at times (The river scene with barrels specifically, flashing between overhead CGI shots and point of view shots from inside the barrel that were live action was a joke. Also the title screen looked like it was from 1985. The rest of the movie was simply long and uneventful with too many attempts at ""ah-ha"" moments instead of quality (The naming of Sting was as cheap as you can get). And the attempted jokes/humor were abysmal failures. If you try to compare it to any of the LOTR movies you just can't. It is an entirely different movie, has none of the same feel and isn't nearly as good. But Leaving it to stand on it's own it still fails miserably.

"anderalexx128","2","14","20","20 January 2014"," The Peter Jackson team, triumphantly wielding the Ring of commercial success, miss their footing and plunge headlong into the fiery depths of Mount Doom artistic fraud.
","One of the central themes of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings is the manner in which different personalities are affected by the corrupting effects of wealth and power. Some, like Bilbo, are completely able to retain their integrity. At the end of Tolkien's novel he accepts only a small parcel of treasure for his part in the quest, such as one pony can carry. When he finds the Arkenstone he does not claim it for himself but bestows it in a manner that he deems morally fit. Thorin Oakenshield has a fatal attraction to the dragon's hoard of gold, but on his deathbed is able to retrace and find himself again. Smaug the dragon is hugely greedy, use his great powers aggressively, and is undone by his vanity (believing himself invulnerable).<br/><br/>It's quite clear, and ironic, that the makers of this trilogy were similarly blinded by the lure of gold.<br/><br/>Tolkien's novel is a literary classic, written in beautiful prose, and illustrated by himself. His special gift was to depict a magical world where characters are nevertheless wholly believable and realistic, and their actions faultlessly motivated. My question to the filmmakers is: why change anything? Why was it necessary to change the story in so many, many, many ways? And whence the presumption that they are entitled to do this? Overweening arrogance ... And embarrassing, actually.<br/><br/>The makers evidently felt they needed to pad out the original, but in the process they have lost so much. I'm still waiting for a definitive version. I imagine something animated, and faithful to Tolkien's original illustrations."
"tomgillespie2002","4","14","20","11 January 2014"," The sounds of Tolkien shouting ""Fool of a Took!"" from his grave won't be worrying Jackson
","When we finally get to meet the magnificent dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, at the climax of Peter Jackson's second instalment of his The Hobbit trilogy, we find him curled up beneath an enormous stash of gold coins and jewels, blissfully in the land of nod. After sitting through over two hours of this slog of a film, it's precisely where I wished I was. The Desolation of Smaug is yet further evidence that 9 hours worth of movies is not needed for Tolkien's delightful - and slim - novel. It feels like - to quote Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins from The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) - thin, like butter scraped over too much bread.<br/><br/>The story picks up as the dwarfs evade capture from the orc general Azog (Manu Bennett) and seek refuge in the home of Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), a skin-changer who often takes the form of a giant bear. Setting of again towards Erebor to reclaim the dwarfs homeland, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) et al reach the Elven forest of Mirkwood. Gandalf departs to further investigate the strange goings-on at Dol Gondur, where the mysterious necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch) seems to be building an army of sorts. In Mirkwood, the dwarfs meet the Elvenking Thranduil (Lee Pace) and his son Legolas (Orlando Bloom), who imprison the dwarfs following an altercation.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is simply a collection of things that happen - not much has a relevant impact on the story, nor does it develop any of the characters or make much of the film particularly interesting to watch. It's a near-3 hour film that barely has any time for its characters, preferring instead to repeatedly throw them into situations that apparently call for an extended, CGI-laden action sequence. It felt very much like a Middle Earth Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) - vacant and almost soulless. The Lord of the Rings trilogy used CGI when it had to, and chose instead to welcome the natural beauty of the New Zealand landscape. And thanks to some gorgeous set design for the interiors, it felt like you could reach out and touch Middle Earth. Here, everything feels digital.<br/><br/>There's also too much padding. When the dwarfs arrive in Lake Town, smuggled in by the revolutionary-type Bard (Luke Evans), it develops a strange love-triangle between dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), elf-warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas. This can be argued as character development for one of the much underdeveloped dwarfs, but its portrayed so blandly that it's nothing more of a distraction to Bilbo and Thorin finally encountering Smaug. Bard himself is also relatively one-dimensional, not much more than a rugged face that has been spawned by destiny - a reluctant hero that has chosen a different path to the one that seems lined up for him. Sound familiar?<br/><br/>It's not all bad of course, so although Peter Jackson has been caught up in the special-effects machine, he still shows his talent for the spectacle with one action scene that sees the dwarfs escape Mirkwood and a micro army of rampant orcs in barrels down a river. It is a silly, overblown set-piece, but it proves funny and thrilling, a genuinely exciting highlight within one of the film's most drawn-out chapters. Also, Smaug himself doesn't disappoint. Although he's entirely CGI, the giant beast is entirely real and, thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch, uncomfortably menacing. His exchanges with Bilbo are the movie's best moments, as they both try and outsmart each other with words and tricks. Which makes it all the more disappointing when the film movies into yet another overwrought action scene.<br/><br/>I'm sure the obvious lack of heart and storytelling quality won't worry the producers (the film is already the 49th highest-grossing film of all time), nor will it Peter Jackson. This adaptation is now so far removed from the book's original vision that I don't think the sounds of Tolkien shouting ""Fool of a Took!"" in his grave will be giving Jackson sleepless nights. I remember in 2003, when The Return of the King (2003) was reaching its first climax at three hours, my bum was glued to the seat and my palms were sweaty, hit with the tragic realisation that this film trilogy would soon be over and all I had to look forward to was the Extended Edition DVD. At the 2 hour mark of The Desolation of Smaug, my bum was numb, I was shifting in my seat, and I was wondering what food I had in the fridge for later.

"bobbayer3741","1","14","20","4 January 2014"," This Movie is based on an original script, not on any book ever written, certainly not one written by JRR Tolkien. Why, it is not really even about one hobbit!
","Peter Jackson did let us down. The fact that there are a lot related writings to the Hobbit can in no way be used as a reason to justify 3 movies since the changes are for the most part completely different from the other original writings. Look .. I get that a movie director should have some leeway in changing the story .. I even like the elvish warrior lady Tauriel  but so many of the changes are simply stupid  Gandalf goes off to this mountain to meet Radagast?! Because? Did they really need to go there to decide to go to Dol Guldur? And what exactly does Gandalf hope to accomplish? In the book there was an actual battle, an attack by the forces of the White Council. Why not do just that?! It would be far cooler than Gandalf getting stuck hanging in a bird cage.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has transformed the story of the Hobbit so much that it scarcely resembles the original. It is not that none of the changes do not work, many in fact do, but for every 1 that does, there are 3 others which are simply laughably stupid. And it is these stupid ones, and there are scores of these, that basically ruined the movie for me. <br/><br/>So Smaug is fighting 10 dwarfs and 1 hobbit, all unarmed, and cannot kill a single one? So he goes to Lake Town rather than simply continue the fight with these unarmed foes? Why in the world would Smaug leave the dwarfs and Bilbo in possession of the Erebor and its staggering treasure so he could make an attack on Esgaroth, a place he could attack and obliterate any time after he kills and eats the dwarfs and one hobbit? There are so many of these staggering dumb plot devices like this that it is just shameful that Tolkien's name has to be associated with this pile of golden dung. We can only hope that someday some director with a bit more class and common sense and artistic integrity, will give a far better interpretation of a classic fantasy story rather than mangling one into something absolutely pathetic. And I won't even go into the Hanna Barbara cartoon physics that seem to operate every time the dwarfs encounter foes, destroying any last vestige of dignity or parallel real world Tolkien intentionally created over 6 decades of his life. <br/><br/>And there has to be three movies to tell this story because .... ? Three movies and so many characters never are even fully developed like over half the dwarfs and Beorn.<br/><br/>The truth is this trilogy is more about more money than anything else, and never about getting it right or otherwise Bilbo would actually be major hero in the movie rather than an afterthought. It is basically a glorified, cheap cell phone video game.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson does not understand nor care about Tolkien's work no matter how much he professes otherwise. I only wish the real JRR Tolkien were here to shred him personally into ""quivering ribbons"" verbally with his razor sharp wit. See The Letters of JRR Tolkien for a sample review of Tolkien's for a proposed movie script during his lifetime."

The Desolation Of Smaug however is a disaster. I came out of the cinema in shock at how they have destroyed such a beautiful story. I wonder if they have even read the book as this was just so different.<br/><br/>Sure they added certain things in from the book but overall it was a completely new take on the book. It is like they said to hell with the brilliant story lets just make this into an over the top special effects extravaganza. <br/><br/>I was very excited for this film, as a huge fan of LOTR and The Hobbit but now I kind of feel very angry and upset that this was allowed to be made. The only people who will like this Film are people who have not had a chance to read the book. Fans of Tolkien will be upset I am sure. The barrel escape was embarrassing and well so was the whole film.<br/><br/>I can't believe I am saying this but I am certainly not looking forward to the third and final part.

Trust me, I'm pretty mad about it all. Anyway, I loved the first Hobbit, I loved it for the parts they changed (artistic licence right?) and even more for the parts they kept. I certainly wasn't expecting to see the dwarfs wash the dishes and riddles in the dark blew my mind! This second installment left me feeling like someone had destroyed something I had been waiting for since I was 10. They hurried through the scenes from the book, changing everything they could and cutting huge chunks out. They made everything with CGI (even Legolas' horse. What, they couldn't afford a real horse?) and added as many characters as they could. They did all this so that the second half of the film could be taken up with completely fictitious battles against the Orcs and Smaug that never took place in the book. I don't understand. I thought Peter Jackson loved this book? Why would he want to change it all? Book aside, I thought there was too much action and no indication of the time passing. Everywhere the characters go is rushed through and the film would lead you to believe they just pottered over to the lonely mountain in a matter of days! It's probably great for action lovers, especially children who have never read the book and I hope that Peter Jackson inspires the next generation to fall in love with Tolkien but after the non stop roller-coaster that is this film, I think anyone reading the book for the first time would be confused and disappointed by how different the book really is. There was easily enough material for this film without adding so much new material, and the only way they could fit that new material was to remove and change the original story. I feel so sad, this can never be fixed. As a Tolkien fan, I feel this film is not 'The Hobbit' at all."
"Barky44","1","237","455","16 December 2013"," Jackson's a kid in a candy store -- and we get the diabetes
","Peter Jackson's 3-episode interpretation of The Hobbit is turning into a sticky, gooey mess. What a horrid series of films.<br/><br/>This isn't about book purism or Tolkien loyalty or any of that. I understand the difference between writing and filmmaking, and why one can never translate directly into the other (especially when the latter occurs 75 years after the former). My contempt for the Desolation of Smaug concerns filmmaking itself: storytelling, dramatic tension, character development. Even the framing, action and stuntwork do not work in this film.<br/><br/>The root of the problem is PJ does not have an internal filter. He dreams up ideas of increasing ridiculousness, and throws them on the screen whether the story benefits or not. He dreams up wonderful elvish combat maneuvers: they're in the film. He dreams up various orc prosthetics: they're in the film. He dreams up goofy, hammy character appearances: they're in the film. He dreams up immense set pieces and constructs unbelievable battles in the midst: they're in the film. But you can't do filmmaking that way! Good films, even good action films, need to be built on a solid core of character and story. <br/><br/>In fairness, the Hobbit itself is not particularly meaty in those areas: it's a bit goofy, a bit sparse. It was a children's book, after all. But that's what a good screenplay needs to reinforce in such cases. It's what PJ and his writing team did in LOTR! They beefed up the story and added emotional context to the characters to make the audience care about what was happening. When Frodo was confronted by the Witchking in the Two Towers, you were afraid for the guy because the film, up to that point, made you care! <br/><br/>In the Hobbit, however, they are not shoring up the character and story in this three-layer cake at all. Instead, they are slathering on such a heavy coating of empty frosting in the form of goofy action sequences, sticking on gumdrops of forced slapstick comedy, and pouring on a thin crust of chocolate sprinkles in the form of CGI (much of which is poorly done and pulls you out of the film). In the end, you have a cake that's inedible because of all the sugary crud slathered on top. All this ""stuff"" totally overwhelms the cake in the center, completely obscuring the overall storyline, and smothering the characters of Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin, and the rest of the poor dwarfs (who mumble along in complete obscurity for the duration of the film). Even Smaug gets short-shrift (he is a marvel of visual magnificence, but is also reduced to a slapstick fool before too long).<br/><br/>What PJ does not have is a filter. You can tell he's gained so much power as a filmmaker that no one is challenging his decisions. He gets away with everything no matter how ridiculous, no matter how distracting, no matter how smothering. He has no sanity check, no capacity to self-edit. And the film suffers for it: it's so overdone in action and set pieces, you become bored with it. I was praying for the movie to be over by the end.<br/><br/>When you engage in any creative endeavor, it's important you get all your ideas on the table, no matter how outlandish. But then you ALSO need to learn how to edit, how to scrape away everything that is not helping you tell your story or portray the vision. It can be a hard thing, giving up that great idea, but if it helps you reach your goal, you drop it by the wayside, and focus on what's important.<br/><br/>PJ did not do that, and as a result, we have a sticky, gooey, sickly-sweet mess of a cake that will surely give us all diabetes."

This is NOT The Hobbit. The second movie (and I thought it was bad enough when I thought there were only two films) is Peter Jackson's attempt at writing Tolkien and it fails miserably. Furthermore, some reviewers have mentioned Smaug as if he single handedly saves the movie. He does not. Instead I sat there wondering why he hadn't burnt the burglar and the dwarfs instead of talking to them on and on, obviously to stretch the movie out. The biggest mystery now is how will Mr Jackson come up with enough plot for another movie? Maybe Smaug will do a lot more talking?"

Rather he spends 20 minutes stupidly smashing into stuff like a fat dog on a slippery floor.<br/><br/>Another thing that plagues this filth is that it can't decide if it is trying to be a kids movie with stupid fat dwarfs bouncing around like basketballs or if it's trying to be a edgy movie about angsty elves decapitating and stabbing orcs in the god damn neck. <br/><br/>Then the movie ends with a soft pop music song with slight influence from the movie.<br/><br/>This mixes like oil and water.

","Just saw ""The Hobbit 2: We Already Ran Out of Material."" It's a bloated, poorly-paced mess of a film with dramatic lack of loyalty to its source that doesn't know what it's trying to do. Is it a comedy? An action film? A fantasy adventure? No, it fails at all three.<br/><br/>I can accept that sometimes a movie adaptation of a book is different from its original source. That's just how adaptations work, and if Hobbit 2 were a good film on its own, I could forgive a lot of the seemingly-arbitrary changes. But it isn't. It's filled with inconsistencies, with stupid action scenes that don't make any sense (fire will still burn you even if you're six inches away from it, guys), with humor clumsily dropped in. <br/><br/>I loved Lord of the Rings. I found the first Hobbit movie acceptable. But this mess of a film shows a complete lack of regard not only for the book it's supposedly based on, but also for film-goers who just want a good movie. It's silly, it's badly written, and it's bloated to the point that I was praying for it to end about an hour and a half in.<br/><br/>Let's face facts: The Hobbit doesn't have enough material for three movies. The reason we're getting three is that the parent corporation shelled out big bucks for the sequels, so they had to find lots of needless material to shoehorn in. Friends don't let friends attend midnight showings of this terrible movie."

This movie is all about selling tickets. No respect for the original work. Let me point some of the outrageous things: 1.Beorn- a wise and fierce protector pictured as mindless beast 2. She Elf - that is a laughable plot. 3. Love triangle - Silly dramatic sequence. 4. Journey through mirkwood - main attraction of novel left out untold. 5.

"guy-faulkes2012","3","170","327","17 December 2013"," The Hobbit Suited Best for Video game Enthusiasts, not Tolkien Fans
","This is not a movie for devoted Tolkien fans. Or even for true fans of ""The Hobbit."" This is Peter Jackson's fan-fiction ""re-imagining"" of Tolkien's first book. He's known for taking liberties with the source material. It worked well 90% of the time in the extended editions of the LOTR films. But the reverse is true with this prequel series (so far.) His changes and additions are jarring, annoying, and pointless.<br/><br/>Like Lucas with his digital tools at ILM, Jackson has taken the Weta CGI SpFX and turned Middle Earth into a cheesy theme park full of action rides for adolescents. The overuse of 3D computer graphics in place of actual real-life sets and characters resembles a Pixar cartoon more than a fantasy-adventure epic. The orcs and villains in LOTR looked solid and believable. They were played by actors on-set. In The Hobbit, the goblins, trolls and orcs are video game characters with no substance. It's a shame what can happen when directors like Jackson, Lucas and Shyamalan, who held such promise, are given carte-blanche and huge budgets to feed their inflated egos. They lose all restraint and the ability to edit themselves. Every crazy idea is implemented. Nothing is too far-fetched or ridiculous. <br/><br/>If you thought some action sequences in King Kong (2005) went overboard and on screen for too long – the dinosaur stampede being an example – that's nothing compared to what Desolation of Smaug has in store. It's mostly one implausible, dizzying roller-coaster ride after another. I'm all for thrill-rides, but enough is enough. At some point you need a break from the constant camera shots weaving in and out, up and down ad infinitum. Loses its impact after the first 4 minutes, then proceeds to make you nauseated or bored, or both. Whatever happened to story, character development, and emotional involvement? Marginalized in favor of Saturday morning cartoon fare. Battle sequences galore.<br/><br/>By now, my initial joy at hearing that PJ had taken the reins of The Hobbit has been replaced with a regret that it wasn't directed by the first choice, Guillermo del Toro. He could not possibly have ruined it any worse than Jackson. Did somebody pull a switcheroo on us – exchange the fat, talented PJ for this new thin hack masquerading as the guy who gave us the beautiful LOTR trilogy?"

","MAJOR SPOILERS: I loved The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. I loved it because, despite straying from the story some, it captured all the characters and the most important scenes perfectly. This changed a LOT though in the next one. <br/><br/>Of course, we have the same great actors that everyone loves, but watching the movie makes you wonder if Peter Jackson read the book at all. Absolutely none of what happened in this movie was like the book. Now I liked how they added the elves, but making them show up everywhere and constantly saving the day was ridiculous. Also, they added in a big story with Bard helping the dwarfs, which I wouldn't have minded if they done this part terribly. Gandalf's battle with the Necromancer and the Orcs would've been good if it wasn't so slow and drawn out, and it made it worse that they stuck these scenes in the middle of Bilbo in the Dragon's cave, which made you just waiting for Gandalf to be done.<br/><br/>Now I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought Fili and Kili were the best dwarfs, and then Jackson went and took them out of the whole second part of the movie! They stayed in Laketown while everyone else went to battle the dragon. There was also a romance triangle between Legolas, Tauriel, and . . . Kili.<br/><br/>OK, I'm done ranting about what they added in. Now for a short part where I rant about what they didn't.<br/><br/>I think I can speak for all hobbit fans when I say that, aside from Bilbo's convo with Gollum (riddles in the dark), Bilbo's convo with the dragons and the spiders were probably the best parts of the book. And they took BOTH of these parts out! I spent a lot of the movie anticipating Bilbo's encounter with Smaug, and they botched it. The only thing they seemed interested in was having the dragon fly around blasting fire and knocking over the pillars, and also making him look stupid while trying to catch the dwarfs and the hobbit. OK, I'm not gonna pretend the dragon didn't look cool. But looks is about all he had. He was slow, clumsy, and not at all clever like in the book.<br/><br/>ONE LAST COMPLAINT: Does anyone agree that Beorn's scene in the book was possibly the funniest? Well it didn't happen. All they did is made him look like a scary jerk, and again they were more interested in making this looking like an action scene rather than the funny, witty scene it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie any stars was because 1. I love the characters, and 2. The movie had great visuals. No matter how bad they did the spider scene, it still looked cool, and no matter how bad a character Smaug was, the treasure room was gorgeous. Thanks for reading."

Jackson made brilliant decisions about what to add to, and what to skim over in the film. The scene where Gandalf confronts the Necromancer, and his true identity is revealed through a succession of a never ending eyes within the great eye made my hair stand on end. Benedict Cumberbatch was a perfect choice as Smaug. His booming, growling voice really impressed Smaug's ego to the audience. And, Weta absolutely blew me away with their design for Smaug. He was enormous and frightening, yet beautifully so at the same time. I saw the movie on Imax 3D, and it was beyond impressive. My husband and I left grinning from ear to ear, and wishing the next installment of the trilogy was already available. As a fan, I honestly could not wish for more.

","I got back from seeing the midnight premiere of The Desolation of Smaug. In all honesty, I thought the movie, down to its core, was bad.<br/><br/>I came into it with pretty subdued expectations, having not taken well to the previous installment An Unexpected Journey (2012), but TDOS reached a new low. This is probably Peter Jackson's weakest directorial effort, even more so than the disastrous Lovely Bones.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially a CGI cartoon, implementing laugh out loud action sequences and special effects. The pacing is sluggish and disjointed. About 30 minutes in, I found myself taken out of the experience completely, trying to guess where the movie would end.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman gives another wonderful performance as Bilbo Baggins, but is severely underused, being more or less shuffled into the fold of events.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, it is hard to believe that this movie is grounded in the same Middle Earth seen in Jackson's Lord of The Rings trilogy. This interpretation of Middle Earth is bright, and lacks physical depth and any sort of fantasy realism. Visually, it looks like a very unfortunate mixture of the film adaptations of Eragon and Narnia.<br/><br/>Like the last time around, the 48 frame rate is hyper-realistic, looking like an uncanny set piece or a feverish soap opera. Most of the CGI effects are pretty poor, I don't want to give anything away, but there is a sequence with molten liquid that looks like Nintendo water.<br/><br/>This movie amplified everything I didn't like about the previous installment: poor pacing, fabricated and exaggerated content, cheesy imagery, and a lack of practical effects (particularly with creatures and miniatures).<br/><br/>It seems that this Hobbit trilogy is being executed as an artificial prequel to The Lord of The Rings, full of ominous forebodings that amount to little more than painful nods and familiar musical cues. The events of The Hobbit are almost incidental to the story, which is a real shame, particularly for people just being introduced to Tolkien and Middle Earth, it's a gross misrepresentation.<br/><br/>There were some good things, like the design and performance of Smaug, but overall, this movie was a real bummer."

It added no depth to any scene that could not have been accomplished with proper lighting and cinematography, it only served to distract and obfuscate as soon as anything moved across the screen.

At least the first movie of The Hobbit trilogy had some interesting moments despite its many flaws. But now the Hobbit has been turned into a cartoon with mostly boring two-dimensional, cardboard characters. The acting was so poor at times it ruined the illusion. But worst of all, there's very little heart, unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is the epitome of passion and adventure and good storytelling.<br/><br/>I also think part of the problem is that director Jackson is trying to turn The Hobbit into another The Lord of the Rings, which is quite stupid. They are very different stories. From what I have read, Tolkien wrote The Hobbit essentially for fun and wasn't even going to have it published until his friend, the great writer, C. S. Lewis convinced him otherwise. The Tolkien family should have went with a different director. Since when does one man own a storytelling giant like Tolkien? <br/><br/>Then I was forced to watch this awful movie in 3D or drive elsewhere. I noticed about 30 seconds of special 3D affects. How can that be called a 3D movie? I call it a rip-off and I wish the Federal government would call such a claim fraud, so filmmakers would think twice about ripping off the public! <br/><br/>Hollywood pulled the same stretching-out-the-story-stunt with Harry Potter, but at least I was smart enough to never have watched the last film. I eventually became so disgusted, I could care less what happened to Harry Potter. The same storytelling destruction non-sense has now captured the Hobbit.

We shan't mention the vomit inducing Dwarf/Elf touchy feely segment.<br/><br/>The film fails on all but the most basic of levels; it is an action film, very loosely based on a JRR Tolkien novel. What it certainly is not is The Hobbit, a tale of adventure and personal courage. had this been made before LOTR then it would have rightly been laughed out of the cinema, but audiences are so hungry for more of the same that Jackson has been allowed to do whatever he likes, even, once again, adding a knob gag to a children's story.<br/><br/>For his next project I fully expect him to remake the story of Jesus, only this time he'll be a prize fighter who has to beat Pilate to win the life of Mary Magdelene, who has been taken prisoner by the evil drug lord Satan.<br/><br/>Utterly appalling."
"maxastree","5","10","14","10 November 2014"," ""big"" CGI movie with technical issues, lack of central character
","Peter Jackson, now referred to as ""Sir Peter Jackson"" initially didn't want to do the Hobbit story idea, but later proposed ""the Hobbit"" as a three picture story arc. Incidentally, at the first film opening he stated that he hadn't actually seen a finished edit of the picture and as people found out in following months, the movie was a massive disappointment compared to the New Line franchise he directed a decade earlier.<br/><br/>This sequel is intended to a be a return to form, but it's still a disappointing movie, largely for two reasons; firstly because Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and the other main players here just don't seem to know who, or what the main character is about very much, and because they don't the audience doesn't feel terribly involved either. Bilbo Baggins, the central character, never feels pivotal to the story, doesn't feel either like a leader or a hero or even much like a pitiable victim in the movies numerous set pieces.<br/><br/>The second reason is because the film is fundamentally flawed in the way its produced and distributed. Audiences wearing grey 3D glasses lose color value, and an attempt to restore the proper luminance in 3D theaters led the film company to release the movie at twice the standard frame rate; as a result, makeup, costume detail, and background elements look obviously fake, instead of the magical, poetic sequences that made the original films such great entertainment.<br/><br/>The script feels like well-combed fan fiction, which suggests that, really, ""the Hobbit"" should have been one powerful, lyrical sort of movie that recreates the vibe from the original Lord of the Rings environment, and remains faithful to the source material. It feels a bit pointless explaining this but the idea of a dragon guarding gold under a mountain has been a staple of European folklore mythology long before Tolkien created 'the Hobbit'. <br/><br/>If you get to the end of this movie, as suggested in the trailers, the dragon is a massive and spectacular beast, but doesn't save this picture from the feeling that its illogical, over-padded and overproduced. <br/><br/>I guess the best you can say about the trilogy is that it actually got completed, despite the fact that it's clearly impossible to create a worthwhile product with zero pre-production schedule. The film system and the projects handlers are to blame for it's poor quality as much as Jackson's bloated ideas about ""running length"" . . ."

","I couldn't force myself to watch this film for more than 30 minutes. I had watched An Unexpected Journey, so naturally my expectations were extremely low, but at least I was hoping I could bare to watch it until the end. Nope. It was enough for me to see the scene with Beorn, to realize how bad this movie is going to be. Beorn is a bloody joke. I mean no offense to the actor, but his performance seemed extremely unconvincing to me, and the visual style that they chose for him is so... different from the book, I just couldn't get into it. The point where I stopped watching was in the halls of the elven king, where the king and Thorin have a conversation. The king's face suddenly turns into an ugly, disfigured shape and then turns back to normal again, apparently to stress the idea he was expressing at that moment. My question is - why? Why would you do that? It just feels out of place, like one of those one-too-many cgi things that are there only for the purpose of being CGI and looking ""cool"". The performance of the actor, who played the king, was also lackluster, in my opinion. I don't get why elves can't act like elves - immortal beings, that are wise and ancient. In this movie they act more like teenagers who have just reached puberty. There's even some romantic implications between a female elf and a dwarf... I mean, I have no words for that. This movie blew me away with how little it has in common with the book or the Tolkien's universe in general. It's an abomination of the work towards which the author had devotes most of his life and it's sad to see that it's so popular and will forever be engraved in the minds of the masses as The Hobbit - a film based on professor Tolkien's book."

","Greetings all, <br/><br/>I am afraid to say this is exactly what I have come to expect of this franchise, something that is mediocre and nothing more. Admittedly an improvement tenfold on it's predecessor, yet somehow it manages to deliver the same disappointing aspects.<br/><br/>The first installment was overly long and this is no different, we're treated to some rather lacklustre performances through both the generic cast of dwarfs and the repetitive action sequences.<br/><br/>It comes to pass that we're watching a film where we as a viewer, predominantly, care not for the characters of which it is comprised. Save for a few convincing portrayals in Martin Freeman, Luke Evans and Lee Pace to be exact, who gallantly redeem the feature with their utmost ability.<br/><br/>The clarity and visuals are one aspect that most definitely deserve praise, but then again it's a small feat to make something look good, while leaving it devoid of any other defining trait.<br/><br/>If you've watched the first, you might as well give this one a try as it is, if nothing else, a slight improvement. Unfortunately I suspect you'll be left with a bad taste in your mouth, especially when you reach the climactic act and namesake of this film arises as a bumbling, egotistical fool.<br/><br/>Oh Smaug, the enormity of the mistake it was to churn out a little more gold instead of letting sleeping dogs lie is becoming apparent. I can only hope the final chapter is more exciting and less yawn inducing."

That would have been enough to ruin the movie for me, but there was more, some of which other reviewers covered. It seems we must be subject to gymnastic special effects from creatures clearly incapable of them, video game death, and unimaginably odious ""love"" scenes in every movie or Jackson's world is not complete.

And why does he have to demonstrate over and over that SAURON IS COMING! THE DARKNESS IS LOOMING! Please, we already know that this story precedes the Lord of the Rings (a great movie trilogy, by the way--you should see it).

The first Hobbit film was weak, but tolerable and full of atmosphere, but The Desolation of Smaug is downright awful.<br/><br/>I am not against making changes to a film's source material, that is, if it benefits the film or makes for a solid, entertaining story. The screenplay here is a big mess, with too many conflicting subplots which take away from the central story about the dwarfs making their way to the mountain. Why do we need that subplot with Azog? Or a bunch of needless tie-ins to the original trilogy? Or a silly love triangle which does little to contribute to anything? It's a shame that so much screen time is taken away from Martin Freeman, who without doubt gives the best performance.<br/><br/>The CG is especially horrendous and had me laughing aloud at several moments. The action sequences are so overblown and cartoonish. And why does Legolas' horse need to be CG?? Really? Does everything need to be a special effect?

The scene didn't just veer from the story like most movies do, the plot entirely was changed and not for the better. It slightly changed the whole premise of the movie. Thorin and the dwarfs should have NEVER entered the cave and the attempt with the gold made no sense. Not to mention they completely slaughtered Smaug's speech by breaking it up and destroying the power that should have been portrayed. Also, Smaug was not to even see Bilbo until the very end of the speech, instead Bilbo's location was known the whole time defeating the purpose of the ring aspect and Smaug never smelling hobbit before. It's absolutely ridiculous how ""creative writing"" is used so loosely and can ultimately ruin a movie that had such great potential."
"weigelhu","3","7","9","9 March 2014"," This portion of the story is completely misguided
","I have and always shall be a Tolkien Lover.<br/><br/>I use Mr. Spock's to show my solidarity to legacy of the The Hobbit story. I have two perspectives in which I'd like to share.<br/><br/>As a teacher: This volume of the story deviates so much from Tolkien's text that a lot of the themes that I want to convey- the difference between perception and reality (the value of Bilbo's transformation) and the politics of the human world (leaving out Elvish derivations; I did not know of the caste Elvish system short of Thingol's value of his daughter's hand). I find that the connections of the story make MUCH more sense in terms of holding a realistic and thoughtful discourse on the actions of the Elvenking and the Master of Laketown.<br/><br/>As a fan of the series: I cannot believe the minute (minute as 'small') treatment of Beorn and the importance he will later play in the saga- this is just a singular case in how this 'movie' treats the seems to minimize the real drama in this portion of the text (the epic traverse of Mirkwood, the stealth needed to escape the Woodelves' Realm and the feelings of hopelessness on the northward journey from Laketown and most importantly the journey of Bilbo toward the innermost chamber). I can think of a dozen endings better then the 'foe' (spoken literally) ending of the dwarfs fighting Smaug himself (my gosh, could they not have left it where Bilbo first meets the beast or where Bard slays him?) The need to develop Azog is misguided- they do not need a tangible need of his influence in every scene. AND FINALLY WHY MY GOSH ALMIGHTLY DO THE NEED ANOTHER LOVE STORY TO MINE? I was able to deal with the Aragron-Arwen saga because at least there was backing text to support it, but this fabrication stands as just a disgusting way to drub up a plot-line.<br/><br/>The Verdict: I feel that The Hobbit, as a three-part is just a way to maximize ticket-sales and pimp out a beloved and moving story that could serve (tastefully edited) a compelling and interesting story. This movie is a joke and I cannot believe that The Tolkien Society or other real fans would enjoy this installment of the story. IT IS A SHAME!"

I read it when I was young and I know many others who did or at least tried as well. They only criticism I'd ever heard was that Tolkien could be a little dry. But it was a good story and there was no need to change it so drastically. I understand that they were trying to develop subplots in order to extend the story and stretch it into 3 movies, but please. I wonder if the people responsible for writing the screenplay ever actually read the book or just the Cliffs Notes version. If they had actually read the book, they would have seen that there was plenty of story there for 3 movies without ruining the story. But they didn't. So yes, they ruined the story. I don't post a lot of reviews, but in this case I couldn't resist. I guess we'll have to wait for someone else to come along perhaps 30 or 40 years from now to do it right. Until then we can watch the animated version and pretend this movie doesn't exist.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 because the visuals and effects were very cool. The dragon was great. 6 might be generous.

I had high expectations after LOTR but Jackson writes his own stories and leaves out much of the story I loved. The road through Mirkwood was supposedly a major road from the past, not some winding trail. There was no feeling of the amount of time that was passing. Mirkwood is over 200 miles wide and should take weeks to cross, not hours. I was really looking forward to Bilbo taunting the spiders only to be disappointed. The stay in the woodland elves prison was for many days not a few hours. And to make Bard a barge man and not the captain of the guard makes no sense.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","7","9","5 January 2014"," Not getting better unfortunately
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is the second of three films depicting Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"". It's directed like the Lord of the Rings films and the first hobbit movie by Peter Jackson again and also features many of the actors from the previous movies. I have to say I enjoyed the first Hobbit film quite a bit, so I was certainly eager to see this one. Unfortunately, it left me slightly disappointed. It's not much worse than the first and has certainly a handful interesting sequences, but as a whole somehow I wasn't really wowed. The usual criticism about these films is that the book is simply too small to justify three very long movies and while I have been so far of the opinion that it's actually possible to make three good films, this movie has gotten me closer to really understanding the previously mentioned criticism. Also I wouldn't have minded if Jackson had included simply additional characters or story lines to fill the time or just kept the films below the 100-minute-mark.<br/><br/>The first 100 minutes of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" really really dragged a lot and none of the characters were interesting enough to keep me particularly interested. Had it gone on like that, my rating would have been considerably lower, but thankfully the film really gained steam the moment Smaug wasn't only talked about, but actually entered the picture from the very moment Bilbo stepped into the treasure chamber. This was also a Sherlock reunion for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman and easily the highlight of the film. The visual effects were fantastic, the treasure chamber with all the gold and coins and jewels was the perfect setting for this very one-sided face-off and I enjoyed every minute of it. I just wish the other parts of the film could have been equally good. However, the love story, the sickness parts or even the motivational moments such as the dwarfs trying to get their home back didn't seem convincing to me at all, sometimes even cringeworthy sadly. Not even Gandalf could really win me over with his scenes although they were certainly among the better ones from the film just because the character is so memorable. The goblin creatures were scary, but I felt they could have been even more intimidating. One really big problem I had with this film was the change of Bilbo. While Freeman did a solid job in portraying him, I just couldn't believe the transformation he took so quickly, even if a lot of it came from the ring, how he rescues everybody from the elves thanks to his wit and speed or how he kills dozens of giant spiders. He felt almost like the James Bond of Middle-earth at some point, not a credible character development looking at how anxious he was just shortly before all his heroic deeds. The aforementioned spider scene is definitely nothing for people with arachnophobia or maybe especially for these if shock therapy may be the right thing. Even I was quite intimidated during that part and the part with the giant spider is also one from the Lord of the Rings films I remember the most.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think they could have easily cut 45 minutes from the second film of the Hobbit trilogy and it would not have hurt the overall picture at all, probably even helped it without some of the less interesting parts. The scenes with Smaug really saved the film from being a complete disaster. Besides that I also liked Stephen Fry in his small part, but I totally love the man and think he's a complete genius, so this may just be personal perception. Here and there, the movie had interesting references back (or forward, I shall say) to Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's not enough to grant a really high rating. I truly hope, the final chapter around Christmas 2014 will be better again."

It was only the Exit door that gave me relief from this mess of a film.<br/><br/>My wife was visiting family abroad, and I had to work the remainder of the week. As such, I thought I'd take advantage of a smaller Xmas Eve crowd than that found on a usual night for the latest ""blockbuster."" It was a decent plan, but ultimately, a big waste of money and time. In the end, I found that the warmth and companionship of a loyal German Shepherd mix and a small cat trumped spending another second in this pap of a film.<br/><br/>Although having read the books at some point in the past, I am not a purist with regard to interpretation onto the big screen. The films of the LOTR's trilogy was well-done, and the first Hobbit was tolerably good, in spite of some added characters and sequences that detracted form the film.<br/><br/>This, however, was beyond the line in terms of what I could endure. To condense this without similar pap I'll just bullet the following:<br/><br/>1) The story was lost. I just wanted it to end at whatever point was chosen by the director, but it never did - and this was at the 2 hr mark at which I just couldn't take it anymore. <br/><br/>2) There were multiple fabricated story lines that weren't part of the book, and which did not add to a better film story, either. Rarely, I would detect a thread of truth to the original story - and actually, those were good. That said, it was only a small percentage of the film that contained these - certainly less than 20-25% of it. And, the parts that did support the core story were rushed. Character development was nonexistent. I did not give a flying care for any of the characters by the time I finally extracted myself from the torture of sitting through this. <br/><br/>3) The first installment was truer to the story than this by far. Perhaps two movies would have sufficed? One well done film would have been preferable.<br/><br/>I suppose the writers and director intended to use this to build more foundational depth to the LOTR, but ""The Hobbit"" was completely lost, and the ""depth"" turned out to be a load of Cheese Whiz on a saltine cracker. Against the occasional Tolkein dialogs, the screenwriters' work appeared as 8-year-olds writing for 8-year-olds. Truly horrid.<br/><br/>At least it is over.

","I am at a loss for words. I love everything Middle Earth, have read most everything Tolkien ever put into print. I absolutely adored the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that Jackson brought us a decade ago. There were some changes made to those movies which upset this purist, but I fully understand that the big screen requires conversions and tweaks here and there. There were some unnecessary additions but all in-all kept true to the story.<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed by ""An Unexpected Journey"" last year, but at the very least that move seemed to *resemble* the book. I was willing to overlook Jackson's liberal adaptation as a one-time fluke. I mean, this movie was a Peter Jackson film...certainly the changes were done out of necessity? Right? In retrospect I think Jackson anticipated this blind loyalty to turn a profit when he chose to re-write these stories.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" can only be considered the Tolkien tale in the most general of sense. The names of characters and places are the same, there was a forest (briefly) and some spiders, a mountain and a dragon, but the similarities to the tale we know and love end there. I feel lied to. The movie was entitled ""The Hobbit"", which is false advertising and if we were talking about any other product or service would carry legal implications for deceptive marketing.<br/><br/>This all being said, maybe I'm just mad because I'm a Tolkien purist, but maybe not. The movie wasn't even good as a movie by another name. The story was jumpy and disjointed, downright boring in places (30 minutes of Smaug flapping around inside the mountain, some scheme involving ineffective but hastily made bombs, and molten gold? What?) and CG effect quality that might have (barely) passed muster on a mid-day Sci Fi Channel feature.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 because I feel that the bulk of the acting was well done. Special kudos to Freeman, Nesbitt, and McKellan, but for some reason Legolas seemed paper-thin.<br/><br/>I saw all of the LotR movies and ""An Unexpected Journey"" at the midnight showing. Because of ""An Unexpected Journey"" I saw ""The Desolation of Smaug"" on opening weekend. Because of ""The Desolation of Smaug"" I might watch ""There and Back Again"" when I comes out on cable.<br/><br/>So I find myself right where I was ten years ago when the screen went dark on ""Return of the King""...hoping that someday in the future someone will step up and make a movie version of ""The Hobbit""."

","I am a big Fan of Tolkien's work. While Peter Jackson's ""adaptations"" have all disappointed me, I still owned them all. I am willing to allow for necessary changes to translate a story onto the big screen, when done tastefully. However, as Peter Jackson's success feeds his ego, we see less and less of anything tasteful in his work.<br/><br/>For fans of The Professor and his work, the sad state of this movie can be summed up easily: were you to remove Tolkien's character and place names from this movie, they could have bygone purchasing the movie rights and still avoided copyright infringement lawsuits. <br/><br/>While there are a few scenes very roughly based upon the book (i.e. there are barrels, and there is a dragon), none of these scenes plays out in such a way that I personally would have recognized as being based on The Hobbit. The Sword of Shannara actually bears a greater resemblance to Tolkien's work than this movie which abuses the name and idea of middle earth.<br/><br/>For other sentient beings, you need know only that this movie has stunning visuals, a little eye-candy for the ladies, and little else going for it. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson either has no attention-span of his own, or he expects none from his viewers. If I ever actually watch this movie again, I will literally use a stop watch to see if I can ever reach one minute without some ridiculous, artificial, played-up conflict, superficially added to the plot for no reason beyond immediate suspense for its own sake. In other words, cheap manipulation of the audience. All else, including internal consistency, is sacrificed to this false god.<br/><br/>While the movie's predecessor bent the laws of physics, The Desolation of Smaug ignores or destroys them. Parts of the movie bear so little scrutiny that they transport you out of the scene (if you were actually engaged in it before) and into an epic face-palm. <br/><br/>The action is over-the-top, as is PJ's usual. The real problem with Jackson's action scenes is that nobody can really worry about the safety of the characters; every one of them is portrayed as a Last Action Hero that Schwarzenegger himself would be proud of. <br/><br/>I knew that I would be disappointed going into this movie. My expectations were very low. As low as my expectations were, I still left so angry that I couldn't sleep.<br/><br/>All I can say now to Peter Jackson now is: NO! No, no, no! Keep your hands off both Tolkien and movies."

","After seeing the first part of THE HOBBIT I thought about catching the rest of the trilogy on DVD but having sometime off work and some money to spend I thought I'd treat myself to a visit to the cinema as a very special treat . I paid my money if only to escape the drudgery of a tough working week followed by a couple of lonely nights in my flat but didn't expect much from Peter Jackson whose creative stock seems to have utterly collapsed since RETURN OF THE KING <br/><br/>To be fair Jackson has made a darker and much better paced film to the first instalment that often manages to disguise how over extended the narrative is . Instead of the painfully repetitive story structure of being captured , escaping , being captured , escaping for the entire movie we actually often have engaging storytelling . I've never read the source novel and Tolkien junkies might hate any embellishment brought to the silver screen but the quest aspects are well done for the most part . The production have now concentrated on making THE HOBBIT a proper prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS as the Necromancer's power starts expanding planning extermination for Middle Earth . This subplot is developed via dual plotting where Gandalf leaves Bilbo's entourage and finds himself in danger . Bilbo and his comrades find they have problems of their own with constant danger all around them <br/><br/>The problem these dangers are often undermined by the production team who concentrate on spectacle rather than developing drama . A good example is where Bilbo and the dwarfs are cocooned by giant spiders which is a terrifying fate but is totally undermined by the arachnids being killed far too easily . This happens several times throughout the set pieces in the film where the good guys constantly defeat the bad guys so easily the audience quickly lose any sense of danger and adventure being involved . There's also a bit too much of the laws of physics being constantly broken . For example a fireball in a confined space would burn up all the surrounding oxygen and anyone nearby would suffocate but this fact is ignored and other implausible things involving science don't make the slightest sense . I know this features in many fantasy films , not least the original LOTR trilogy but it's been done to death and is very distracting . Compare the spectacular set pieces seen here to the battle scene seen in the departure of Boromir in FELLOWSHIP and you'll notice how overblown everything is in comparison here .<br/><br/>In summary this is fairly good film that is better than part one of THE HOBBIT . I say "" fairly good "" but when you compare it to LORD OF THE RINGS in general and FELLOWSHIP in particular ii is something of a backward step from the production team who brought us the original trilogy . That said I will probably pay money at the cinema to see the finale though more in hope rather than expectation"

","It starts with an opening scene that is so awkward it is almost comical - but not in the ironic, fun way. In the ""did I get in to the wrong movie?"" way. It was like watching Scary Movie when you thought you were sitting down to watch Scream.<br/><br/>It didn't stop there, though. Despite being incredibly long, the movie has almost no character development, and aside from Bilbo, none of the characters are at all likable. I went with friends that were big fans (and I was also a big fan) - and we all equally disliked just about every single one of the dwarfs. So much more could have been done with them, but instead they acted as props for the entire movie... moving props, yes, but still props.<br/><br/>Now to the absolutely, positively, worst element of the movie. HFR 3D. OMG, I really hope this goes extinct, and fast. I love 3D, and it is the only reason I go to movies in the theater anymore - but this HFR stuff makes it obvious that you are looking at a bunch of guys in makeup on a badly assembled set. I felt like I was watching a high-school play the entire time. I understand that HFR improves the way that sports look - but movies are vastly different. Movies need the soft edges and warmth that *film* provides. Movies need to let me escape into their world and enjoy the story. There wasn't a single moment during this movie that I felt like I was part of the story. Please, please let this medium die. I thought it was just me, but at the end of the movie my friends turned to me and asked ""Why did the movie look so bad?"" I explained about HFR to them and they said ""Well, guess we aren't going to waste money going to the movies anymore.""<br/><br/>And that's exactly what you would be doing if you saw this movie in the theaters."

","The first three Lord of the Rings movies were excellent. Gorgeous scenery, solid acting, wonderful soundtrack, and a decent script true to the books.

This was a mistake, and many parts of the movie suffered from these artistic liberties brought it. There was potential though, so I hoped the next film would do more. Unfortunately, it didn't do anything good.<br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug continues what An Unexpected Journey began, sinking a fantastic series of movies even deeper into pathetic mire of misery that will make most Tolkien fans wince. This film is just terrible and 80% or more of it can be skipped over with no real loss. <br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is out the window. Some scenes are BREATHTAKINGLY awful. I can't even begin to describe how utterly ridiculous and campy they are. Particularly the barrel-riding sequence. Desolation of Smaug devolves into something so unbearable, calling it ""typical Hollywood"" would be a compliment. It's trite. Banal. Hackneyed. Clichéd. Vapid.<br/><br/>I would rather watch The Room (2003) or Rubber (2010) every day for the rest of my life than sit through the entirety of this film again. I only give it a 4/10 because some of the scenery is decent, the actors did alright, and there's Lee Pace + Benedict Cumberbatch. <br/><br/>Script: 1/10.

","I read many criticisms of this. Apparently, there is a fundamentalist Tolkien fan club that rivals the Austen group in assailing anyone that deviates from the written word; by this I mean the last rewrite of Tolkien's<br/><br/>I never could finish any of the books. What enthusiasts claim as masterful world-making, I saw as a description of different types of beings with ordinary politics behind unexplained excuses for repetitive quests. So take this comment as one from someone looking for a good film experience rather than for allegiance to the books.<br/><br/>I think Peter Jackson is important in the world of film. Yes, not a showman or an exploiter. Not even particularly a storyteller but a film visionary.<br/><br/>Look at this and think about how the space is rendered. The dimensionality of it is striking, in places unique and generally it advances the state of epic cinematography.<br/><br/>When you make a work of art, you at least have to have a central organizing mind to make the world and its presentation coherent. It is not sufficient to borrow the mind of the writer, who is basically a statistician of emotion. Instead, Jackson has given us his own spatial organization, around which this is built. In fact, where Lucas built his own special effects company to render objects, Jackson has created his own, WETA, to render space.<br/><br/>We've known the influence of his introduction of dimension in the earlier films. By this I mean both the way depth is used in staging a scene and how the camera moves within that space. You can see a difference in the early films compared to what came before, and the very quick use of similar techniques in other big budget films. It is extraordinary. We are working on a project to annotate and track just such cinematic influence. Some of these non-Jackson films even used his WETA shop.<br/><br/>Here I think they advanced the art in three ways.<br/><br/>— Needless to say, we have sets with more vertical dimension and complexity than ever. The final set is amazing, with apparently infinite levels above ground, while simultaneous action is going on in apparently infinite levels underground. The camera seems effortless, but pay a little attention and see that new craft is used in the way the camera is placed and moves to allow us to comprehend where are, where we are going and what is flowing through.<br/><br/>— Creating a 3 dimensional movie is still bad business. The biggest challenge is that the stereoscopic projection handles movement with depth well only if it is horizontal. Vertical movement just seems jaggy, especially in comparison to the horizontal movement and most especially so when the movement is along the z-axis. The solution to this is to shoot the whole project at double speed. We don't need the extra frames for the horizontal stuff around which cinema evolved. But we do for all the new dimensions WETA is mastering.<br/><br/>— Adding in vertical action scenes is likely harder than you would think. We have two here that qualify, meaning that they are not just action within a dimensional set, but that the causal dynamics of the action are interwoven with the dynamics of the space. So the battle with the dragon doesn't qualify. The fight with the spiders does, but I believe that uses the paradigm we saw in ""King Kong."" I cannot check it but I think one of the falls through the trees was blocked quoting a fall by the ape. The new paradigm is the barrel fight; you know they have mastered this when they can insert humor that works.<br/><br/>I am okay with the inserted love story because it is so pure, archetypal in most ways. The only real problem I have with this visual thrill ride is the way the gold coins were handled. The basic idea is great: merge a complex threatening environment with the complex kinematics of a serpentine being. This is done by merging the flows of the coins with the flows of the dragon. Only WETA would have such an ambitious goal. You can see how they changed story elements around to have Smaug be gold coated toward the end of the sequence and have gold flow from scales. They obviously did not have time to have the gold slake off as flat elements. But long before that they compromised.<br/><br/>The way the scales on the dragon move through the sequence is precise, just as plates would. But the way the coins move as objects is not. Coins are disks and packings of coins will have internal alignments making feet shift randomly. The coins when they flow down slopes will combine tumbling with sliding as both sliding and lower locations are lower energies.<br/><br/>The point is that we can see that WETA wanted to do something advanced and clever here. But the costs would have been high and the funders didn't see the value. Shucks. Instead we get the coins and random objects rendered using ordinary particle physics — as if they were sand. This is the second major failure in this vein, since the original visionary of ""Brave"" was fired over the rendering of snow as hair.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"RaspberryWaffles","4","67","127","13 December 2013"," Not ""The Hobbit""
","Did I read the right book? After seeing this last night I'm not quite sure Peter Jackson did. I get it. One small book, into three films, you have to elaborate. I was a stout defender of the three film decision and I stand corrected by all those who called it folly. PJ & CO. have not given us what they did a decade ago with Tolkiens The Lord Of The Rings. His reach exceeded his grasp. Let me be honest, the film itself is wonderful. Its fantastic and powerful and dynamic and bursting with action. Yet....somehow it is not anything at all like The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Take the beginning, after the prologue, Beorn looks ridiculous. He looks more like a centaur from the Harry Potter movies than he does like his description in the book. Meager time is given to him and his scene is droll and dreary. They could have started the movie off fun and lighthearted again like in AUJ with a great feast scene with Beorn's trained animal companions! Then we hasten (and by hasten I mean FLY YOU FOOLS) into Mirkwood, which is again HASTENED. No Elvish lights and dinners, no desperate and famished company, no magic river...<br/><br/>Then, we come upon the spiders. This, in the book, is a gigantic moment for Bilbo. His courage and bravery to (in the book) insult, distract and ""sting"" the spiders to save the Dwarfs is another of his turning points in the book. The scene you read is breathtaking and on the edge of your seat intense. What you see is similar...but the arrival of Legolas (somehow looking 20 years older) and his girlfriend Tauriel send the entire vision of Tolkien into disarray.<br/><br/>I will allow you, if you have not seen this, to explore the mind of Jackson yourself. I will say again that this is a great movie. If Jackson had called this movie ""The Dwarfs and The Hobbit"" or ""How The East Was Won"", changed some names and removed all copyright infringements this movie would be one of the best ever made. BUT! You have to take source material into account. If this was an essay on The Hobbit I would have given Peter Jackson an F. A 4 will just have to do though."
"luke-a-mcgowan","2","3","3","12 February 2016"," Heinous in all areas
","Many call this the best Hobbit. I don't see why - it is one of the downright worst films I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Middle Earth is completely saturated in CGI which nearly always kills the sense of wonder that Andrew Lesnie's cinematography could create with New Zealand's natural setting. Motion capture is necessary in for creatures like Smaug and Gollum, but the decision to use it for Orcs is downright terrible because as a result none of the creatures look real. It looks like big noodles of CGI flailing around and interacting. Worse, none of the film's action has any tension because everyone slays their opponent outside of perhaps one sword clash. If you watch the best fight scenes in LOTR, they usually involve challenge, like Aragorn racing to Boromir's aid only to be slowed by random Uruk-hai warriors. Here, every character - dwarf or elf or even Bilbo - kills any person in their path. The only actual action sequences involve Legolas (who we know survives and therefore provides no tension).<br/><br/>I'll mention some positive elements because they do exist. Martin Freeman (Bilbo), Lee Pace (Thranduil) and Luke Evans (Bard) all provide excellent performances. Freeman is clearly trying the hardest of everyone and has some wonderful moments especially whilst interacting with Smaug. The traumatised look on his face when climbing out of Bard's toilet makes the whole scene. Pace could easily be the thousand-year old King Thranduil (despite being two years younger than his on-screen son), and delivers the film's lines with almost Shakespearen grace. Evans is giving a passionate performance, and its a shame he's never allowed to interact with anyone else with talent. The visual creation of Smaug was everything I could ever hope, voiced flawlessly by Benedict Cumberbatch, and there are still some wonderful moments of cinematography.<br/><br/>But that's where it ends. <br/><br/>Ryan Gage's Alfrid is a cancer on the Middle Earth franchise. He contributes nothing but unnecessary conflict to pad the movie into a trilogy. Orlando Bloom is cashing in his whole performance and providing absolutely nothing to the story but inane action sequences. Even the great Ian McKellen is overacting (he does this thing with his mouth after he speaks) and that's truly sad. Ironically, Sir Anthony Sher probably gives the best performance of all the dwarfs and his scenes exist only in the Extended Edition.<br/><br/>The screenplay is disgusting, full of quarter-baked story lines (ahem, Tauriel-Kili), undeveloped characters (Legolas), and truly heinous dialogue (""I told him to go ishkh khakfe andu null!"", ""I could have anything down my trousers""). Characters make stupid declarations about danger that we know won't come true but are included to pad the run time. Azog continues to be an underdeveloped villain - especially with the introduction of Bolg - and his purpose is only to harass Gandalf (again, a character we know will live through the film). <br/><br/>The film's big set pieces are both enormously undercut by different elements. The barrel ride is ruined by the Legolas jumping on Orc heads and also by the forced romance - Tauriel is so undeveloped with Kili that its almost distracting how much she appears to care. The ""morgul shaft"" is a gimmick included for no other reason than to further a barely functioning love story - the orc's taunting of Tauriel makes no sense without the context that he isn't aware of. The big fight scene with Smaug is undercut by logical implausibilities (riding on molten gold) and the fact that the film ends so abruptly and unnecessarily. Couldn't they have just taken the death of Smaug from the start of the third Hobbit and ended the film on that?<br/><br/>I could go on for hours about how terrible this film is, but I'll just finish with two things that bother me. First, Azog just walks in and talks to Sauron. Orcs don't walk in and talk to Sauron. Gothmog talked to the Witch-King and he was the general in charge of 200,000 orcs sacking Minas Tirith. Azog is just some big orc. It is like a big storm trooper talking to the Emperor. <br/><br/>Secondly, there's too much CGI gold. If the dwarfs literally liberated that gold and brought it back into the economy it would have no value whatsoever. If you physically make Minas Tirith and everything in it out of gold, then there's no point in buying anything! I feel that the CGI department should have just calmed right down. Some have accused me of nitpicking, but honestly either this is a pressing issue or the movie is so boring that it gave me nothing else to think about."
"lucasversantvoort","5","3","3","6 May 2015"," The Desolation of the franchise
","After being somewhat let down by the first Hobbit film, I was still somewhat interested in seeing Smaug in the second. It's not every day you see a wonderfully arrogant British dragon talking down to others. As expected, Smaug is the highlight, while the rest of the film is hampered by the same issues that held the first outing back.<br/><br/>We pick up where we left off, with Gandalf, Bilbo and the dwarfs on the road to Erebor in order to reclaim it from Smaug. On the way, they split up, with Gandalf heading to Dol Guldur and the dwarfs entering Mirkwood, a forest filled with huge spiders. They narrowly escape, but are captured by elves, including a familiar face (Legolas) and a new one (Tauriel). They are brought before Legolas's father, the king Thranduil. Naturally, with tensions between dwarfs and elves always being high, this 'meeting' goes less than well. Thorin remembers very well how the elves refused to help when they were driven out of Erebor by Smaug. Meanwhile, the dwarf Kili and the elf Tauriel develop something of a romance, further complicating matters. Bilbo, using the ring, helps the dwarfs escape using empty wine barrels and floating down the river. Legolas and Tauriel give chase, but are forced to aid the dwarfs when orcs show up. After a somewhat boring sequence involving Lake-Town, Bilbo and the rest (excluding a now wounded Kili) resume their march toward Erebor wondering, like me, if they'll find something worth paying an admission ticket for.<br/><br/>And they do find it, more or less, in the form of Smaug, a deliciously cocky dragon voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. It's the kind of villain where you relish every line he utters. It's all very quotable. Unfortunately, even if you haven't read the book (like me), you immediately know that Smaug's pride and arrogance will prove to be his downfall. The only thing left to do then is cherish the scenes where he mocks the protagonists, etc. A scene I really like is when Thorin and the rest lay a trap for Smaug. Thorin lures him by (what else?) insulting him and claims how they'll have their revenge. I won't tell you what the trap entails, but needless to say, it doesn't work and Smaug consequently mocks the notion that they could have their revenge: ""Revenge? Revenge!? I will show you revenge!"" It's hard to put into words, but it's one of Smaug's more badass moments.<br/><br/>So Smaug is fun to watch, but the rest of the film is either boring, suffers from uninteresting storytelling and dialogue or features poor CGI. A lot of the action scenes, like the river chase, just don't look good. It really feels like 90% of the budget went into Smaug. This effect is only increased by the over-the-top choreography. Whenever Legolas is fighting, he jumps, he slides, he flips and he just looks blurry. The same goes for the attempts to inject the action with humor, like when Bombur (the fat one) pirouettes in one of the barrels with his axes sticking out, thus killing any approaching orcs. Though funny, it also reduces the tension drastically. The romance between Kili and Tauriel was also uninvolving. Rather than feeling for them, it felt like the requisite romance, like Aragorn and Arwen in the original trilogy. But maybe it'll pay off in the third film. Another wasted opportunity is Beorn, the 'skin-changer' who shelters Gandalf and the rest at the beginning of the film. He has his monologue about how orcs killed his kind and how he's the last one, but I'm just rolling my eyes thinking 'who cares?' Reading the book would've probably helped when relating to him, but that's just an excuse. The film itself has to be capable of at least making you sympathize with him. As it is, Beorn just feels like a throwaway character. Lake-Town is also uninteresting. Not only does Stephen Fry in the role of the mayor feel incredibly out of place, it's all just really unengaging, a problem exacerbated by little things that don't make sense. So, you're trying to sneak out of Lake-Town with a whole bunch of stolen swords and you're letting Kili, who's injured by an arrow to the leg, carry the swords? Well, gee, I hope he doesn't trip or anyth—oh wait, he just fell down and the racket caused by the swords has woken up all of Lake-Town. Well done, guyswell done.<br/><br/>Problems, problems It's interesting looking back on these two films and seeing how much they differ from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Of course, the scale is smaller overall, but they just 'feel' different, in the same way that the Star Wars prequel trilogy feels different and that's not a good thing. You know it's bad when you're looking at the trailer for The Battle of the Five Armies and all you're really thinking is 'let's just get it over with'."
"filmfanperspective","5","3","3","5 May 2015"," How To Lame Your Dragon (**1/2)
","How can a film like this be boring? I love the previous four films (yes, four, since the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is so clearly connected to this), so what possibly could go wrong? Is it conceivable that I try harder to be 'critical' now that I'm writing about these things I love? Sure. Is it also conceivable that the bubble finally burst, and Peter Jackson delivered a bloated, plodding, nearly joyless Middle Earth film that actually feels three hours long before we even meet the marvelous titular character? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Up to this point, these 'creatively adapted' four films have given us visual splendors as well as soulful performances. Jackson and crew have no equals as it pertains to technical brilliance, and they have such an outward passion for the material that it has shown on- screen. His indie sensibilities paired with his keen eye for 'dirty worlds' have been a natural fit for J.R.R.Tolkein's material, and I do not believe there is another filmmaker working today who could have come close to what he's accomplished.<br/><br/>So, what is ""The Desolation of Smaug"" missing? To begin with, it lacks the sincerity and heart of the previous films. Perhaps it's the lack of whimsical, wispy musical overtures like the 'Shire' theme. Perhaps it's the lack of hobbits in general. Perhaps it's the newfound toy Bilbo has that draws his darker side out. Perhaps it's a creative choice to show all, or most of the main characters allowing their negative traits to shine through, leading them on dangerous paths. By themselves, all of these reasons would be solid markers to prove the lack of heart in the film, but together it snowballs into an unenjoyable conglomeration of CGI set pieces and choreographed battles.<br/><br/>Even the lightest part of the film involving the elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) had no resonance once I learned that she was a completely fabricated character. I made a point not to read The Hobbit, as I figured that three films totaling 8 hours would probably provide all the narrative I needed. Finding out after the film that Tauriel was invented for this film was disheartening- after all, if Tolkein's work alone, and Jackson's prowess aren't enough, why would we be interested? I think the answer lies in a cynical place- Tauriel exists to soften the edges, to attract more females to a film with a predominantly male cast, and mostly, to bring in more money.<br/><br/>Thus far, Jackson has been able to deftly navigate the muddied waters of studio interests, rights issues, fanboys, and casual viewers. Choosing to include a character not previously established, combined with the need to stretch this material into three films, disappoints me. I guarantee it has been difficult for Jackson to satisfy everyone, but I cannot deny the negativity that has now gathered around what had been a relatively pure experience for me. Call me naive, but that's where I stand.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that works extremely well, it's certainly the realization of the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) on-screen. If Smaug were in the rest of the film, I'd have to reconsider my overall opinion. Sadly, he's only part of roughly 45 minutes, and it's clearly the high-water mark for the film. Smaug's slithering, booming voice strikes an excellent balance as he exchanges witty repartee with Bilbo, and his movements are so cool yet menacing that I can't help but think of him as one of the better 'villains' of recent age. It should come as no surprise that he's the best dragon we've ever seen in movies, with respect to Draco of ""Dragonheart"", and the Hungarian Horntail of ""Harry Potter"" fame.<br/><br/>I imagine that the last entry for Middle Earth, next year's ""There and Back Again"" will be a better film than this. One can only hope that Jackson has remembered what made these films the experiences they are as he finishes the editing process- they are deeply rooted, beautiful to look at, and strong with emotion and heart. The first two things are abundant in ""The Desolation of Smaug"", but the heart is sorely lacking, turning this into an exercise in action choreography and CGI set pieces, nearly redeemed by a scaly talking monster."

","It's one of those much discussed topics amongst the lovers of saga cinema, does The Hobbit live up to the splendor and magic of Frodo and his 10 odd cinema hours of Lord of the Rings adventures....After seeing this installment, I have to say with hand on heart, no. Using the formula of, New Zealand backdrop, Elves, Humans, Goblins and Auks, with a couple of LOTR characters thrown into the mix, but yet lacking a positive direction. It seemed to me that there were a whole pile of different scenarios and they were just thrown together to make this presentation. I spotted a couple toward the end, first was that people in Lake Town got the impression that the smaug was coming to destroy the town and kill them all, one of the main characters still had a black arrow that could be used as the only weapon to kill the beast, and then we see the Smaug arguing with Bilbo at the end and says he is going to destroy the town, then we don't see any of this, it should've happened. thus the ending of the film for me was a let down. One thing that is this movies saving grace is the visual splendor, the CGI pro quality that just shines all the way, loved that! Another thing I was not to impressed with was some of the battle scenes, particularly the one with the dwarfs and elves going down the river with the barrels, was just to fast and too much going on, and many action scenes were just that bit too fantastical. Many other critics of this movie have said that it is only about 30% faithful to the original book, but then what film is these days?

I wonder if it was more to pay a 'homage' to a country that boasts the largest cinema screen in the world rather than for the scenery- Scotland & England are interesting from landscape point of view and would have been more appropriate since the Tolkien books were written in England, not New Zealand. I read three JR Tolkien books when I was young and much of whats in this film I didn't recognize-maybe I forgot it-maybe it wasn't even there. The film was forgettable in the true sense of the word- as in the scene with the dragon is so bad you will do pretty much anything to forget it-go on a week long drunk-watch 25 007 movies in a row-that type of thing. The only positive reviews I have seen for what amounts to an abundance of less than amazing films these days seem to come from New Zealand-home of the worlds biggest cinema screen-and the place where director Peter Jackson decided to shoot much of the footage for these so called screen adaptations of a decidedly wordy story for kids & adolescents written in the 1930's-that foreshadowed WW2-but that little tidbit can't be mentioned by Peter Jackson.

","I was hoping to be surprised with #2 after the oddities that strayed from the charming, effective story by the great linguist and teacher, Tolkein. Instead, previously admired movie director, Peter Jackson, and his creative assembly, have gone where no group has gone before. Part 2 of this needless trilogy is a joyless slog through made up characters which serve a non-story purpose and contain so much lengthy violence including stabbings and decapitations that it really buries the idea of the original story of Tolkein's The Hobbit.<br/><br/>The encounter with the spiders was just wrong. The clever language of spiders, and indeed most animals is suppressed, but the the language of Smaug is not. The encounter with the Wood Elves was odd in that they weren't approached by famished dwarfs desperately looking for food. The escape in the barrels was over a Class 5 rapids that could not possibly be used for commerce. Melted gold? So quickly ... so much ... and since we know dwarfs and hobbits are temperature sensitive, well ... what's the point? To make Smaug mad enough to attack the village? The village didn't throw the mysterious solid-then-molten gold on him, but that's where his anger is focused.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not fun. The characters have no really happy moments. Gandalf makes strange decisions, none of them with a wink or twinkle of his eye, Radegast makes another appearance, and all of it is so serious and depressing that you may not want to finish the movie. I did, but just barely.<br/><br/>There is no need to put more ""Tauriel"" and Orlando Bloom's Legolas in the story. Although I love Bloom's Legolas, that was a different story. It takes away from the already limited time of the main character, uh Bilbo. The great man/bear Bjorn was well done and as scary as he needed to be. For my money, the extra orcs and wargs and the oddly provocative Pale Orc who appears more than Bilbo are a complete waste and change the narrative so that it becomes confused and completely inaccessible for children. By the way, the target audience for The Hobbit is children. Peter and Phillipa decided it was more important to make a trilogy with lots of action, violence, and ideas they gleaned from other sources, including their own imaginations, than to translate the best Hobbit ever made for the screen. Too bad.<br/><br/>I really don't know what to expect for Part 3. Perhaps 15 armies and nuclear annihilation?"
"odekingrat","3","3","3","14 May 2014"," In a word: Disappointing
","I just finished watching the Desolation of Smaug and I'm sad to say I am quite disappointed and shocked that Peter Jackson has totally taken a great story and mixed it up so much that the original story is totally lost. Starting with the intro of Beorn was really messed up from how Gandalf introduced the dwarfs little by little with riddles to Beorn who does finally accept them into his home and gives them the help they need to continue their journey. You only see him once as the great bear he can turn into and it's done quite wrongly. Mirkwood was run through so quickly I didn't even think they actually went through there and the fight with the spiders was totally done completely wrong. Bilbo was invisible and harassing the spiders to no end while he's rescuing the dwarfs but we don't see that and how he humiliates the spiders and enrages them so and then them wandering from the path or Bombur falling into the enchanted stream, their capture by the elves and imprisoned and Bilbo the whole time invisible getting them out. True it's funny when he dumps them into the river and finds himself still inside the elves cellar and the way he look's around is a bit funny till he walks to the end and dumps himself in. The dwarfs are supposed to be sealed inside the barrels and the orcs and elves fighting along with the dwarfs was totally out of place and needless. <br/><br/>The addition of Legolas and Turiel was very unnecessary and took away from the story totally. I could go on and on about how this movie has totally wronged the whole story from the book and Tolkien is probably rolling over and over in his grave and screaming from Heaven, "" WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY STORY?"" It is kinda of a fun movie to watch but I still say, it is very disappointing if you are a devoted Tolkein fan of his books. I will buy the last edition when it comes out to see how they do the Battle of the Five Armies and what Bilbo does with the Arkenstone(if he even has it as it was never shown in this movie if he had it or not). Time will tell and I will have all the movies as well as the books in my library collection to pass on to my grandchildren and further on, I hope. <br/><br/>Enjoy the movie for what this version shows but just know that Peter Jacksons interpretation is so way off to be very disappointing. <br/><br/>Sadly I only give this version of the trilogy just 3 *** and that is being generous."

","I was very disappointed with this movie. As usual the production is very good but, my God, did they have to mess with the story so much. Face it, the original story is as good as it gets to start with and just making the movie true to it would result in a great movie. But,nooooo, the fools who wrote and directed this movie had to think THEY could write a better story than what Tolken had written and, for me, ruined it. I was livid when the escape from the Mirkwood Elves lair was messed with and again when they changed the meeting with Smaug.

","I didn't expect this movie to be so weak, it just doesn't live up to the standard of quality set by Lord of the ring trilogy, and i cannot believe same people were making it. I was thinking ""what are they doing, why"" the actions of the characters just didn't make sense, i couldn't get their motives and feelings, its like they just read their text blocks. Combat parts of the movie make me smile. There is no impact, no physics, so to say, in their strikes. it is just my impressions, i don't claim objectivity. it felt like big weapon swings of those orcs went into nothingness, when low weight character blocks something it should at least push them back. <br/><br/>and this dragons scene just made me facepalm. they talk to him, then run, then talk again and it drags on. He destroyed that city when it had army and defenses and now couldn't handle a group of scared dwarfs))). Instead of just picking up the gem and running away from there, they were running around the whole place (possibly to show huge work vfx artists have done creating it) pushing and pulling some levers, and rotating wheels. then they somehow melted giant statue of a dwarf??? onto the dragon, dragon's feelings were hurt and he flew away saying something about revenge. If he wanted revenge why not kill those dwarfs right there, why did he fly away, he wasn't hurt or anything. OK maybe creators had their logic behind it, i just didn't get it. this smuggler guy takes out a hidden spear and runs outside, then gives it to his son and tells him to hide it??? but it was already hidden in his house))) just an example, this movie is full of such moments."

","The road to the Lonely Mountain continues for our company of 15 (13 dwarfs + Gandalf + our titular Hobbit), taking them through an evil forest, a less-than-friendly encounter with the woodland elves, a mad barrel chase, and finally a confrontation with the great dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>Two films in and it's getting harder not to keep kicking the very dead horse that is the ""2 vs 3 films"" debate. And yet Jackson, that lovable, fan-boy geek of a filmmaker, has finally overstretched himself to the point where seams not only show, but are sometimes downright embarrassing. Turning a 1000 page book and its dense appendices into 10 hours of film was a wise decision. Stretching a novel under 200 pages to nearly the same length might well turn out to be a folly.<br/><br/>The Jacksonian touch is still present and strong, don't get me wrong: the main cast more than pull their weight with obvious mention to Martin Freeman's Bilbo - arguably a much better character than Frodo or Sam in the Ring epic - Ian McKellen's Gandalf and the now ubiquitous Benedict Cumberbatch as a very threatening Smaug. Certain set-pieces also up the ante on anything produced to date in the realm of adventure cinema: the nasty spider ambush, a demented barrel-chase that matches the best of Tex Avery, and the reveal of Smaug. A lot of the humorous touches are also not only welcome, but pulled off to perfection, even if they draw attention to the film's great weakness: its tone.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a brisk, fun, children's story. It is an adventure, Indiana Jones to Lord of the Rings' War and Peace if you will. Bar one nearly poetic encounter by Gandalf in Dol Guldur, every attempt by Jackson to bring these Hobbit installments closer to Lord of the Rings makes them lesser, longer and messier films. <br/><br/>Did we need a romantic triangle? Not really, especially one this devoid of consequence. Did anyone really want to see Legolas again? Or Frodo and old Bilbo in part 1 for that matter? No. A certain villain's appearance might be beautifully executed but for all the confusion it creates it might have been better to skip to the meat of this particular story. We only get to Smaug or any of his desolation the title refers to until 2/3 into this movie!<br/><br/>We all look back on the majesty and spectacle of the Lord of the Rings with genuine affection, but in the case of the Hobbit, less really would have been more, along with a more sustained focus on the elements that really work. And while we can look forward to more genius Jackson touches in part 3, given the sense of doom built up here and the number of subplots to bring to a close, intimacy probably isn't going to be that film's defining feature.<br/><br/>More's the pity."
"pat_22","6","3","3","29 December 2013"," Best CGI in film, yet poor dialogue and script.
","""You have nice manners for a thief and a liar!""<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's latest journey to Middle Earth was to explore Smaug and introduce the audience to the battle of the five armies that will ensue in the final film. We find Thorin Oakenshield being thrusted into leading his merry gang of dwarf's to the Lonely Mountain as Gandalf intends to inspect the happenings of Dol Gulder. This film more notably than other Jackson/Tolkien films is incredibly bloated and overindulgent, filled with multiple sub plots that create a relatively exhausting feeling. The new script for the penultimate movie was comprised with various new characters not mentioned in the original novel; this in my opinion created an unnecessary diversion to the traditional tale and therefore disrupted the enjoyment and naturalistic fluency of the story.<br/><br/>'The Desolation of Smaug' once again possesses amazing scenery of New Zealand intertwined with the story accompanied with an immersive soundtrack composed by Howard Shore, the direction of these films never seizes to amaze as the primary story line is perfectly encapsulated and terrific casting options provide a sentimental and emotional substance to this fantasy epic. The film has a thoroughly tedious opening act but as the film establishes the antagonists and setting, it propels into an intensified ambiance unparalleled by many other films. The riddle in the dark sequence with Gollum and Bilbo was commendably the most memorable scene in the entire unexpected journey film, yet unfortunately Martin Freeman was arguably underused in this film. Bilbo shared another memorably extended scene with his encounter with Smaug which was a beautiful use of CGI and fantastically voiced over by Benedict Cumberbatch, the scarily deep and loud tone sends shivers down your spine whilst Bilbo's witty flattery to survive against this beast is a terrifically entertaining combination.<br/><br/>The film tends to become host to some moronic and inane action sequences and experiences the occasional tasteless dialogue especially with the Elves and sub par delivery of key lines,it was rather disappointing from my perspective how the the characters had to continually rely on Legolas and Tauriel saving just in time and how these particular elves repetitively showed their skills monotonously. However the intended creative expansion on Bard the Bowman was impressive and Gollum not featuring in this movie was a somewhat substantial restraint given that Peter Jackson likes to connect and link all of his characters from his Middle Earth films. To witness the phenomenal spectacle Smaug makes up for the seemingly very long wait, despite his arguably disproportionate size in different shots it still compensates for the redundant sub- plots; for instance the love triangle between Kili, Tauriel and Legolas. I firmly believe that this tale would have been better as two, three hour movies rather than three, two and half movies. Problematic narrative flaws and raw characters wither the deep and passionate story of the dwarf's quest to Erebor."
"skrat8900","3","56","105","12 December 2013"," Worse Than the First
","I went into The Desolation of Smaug with low expectations and managed to be disappointed. Like many, I love The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but the prequel trilogy has yet to impress.<br/><br/>That's not entirely true. Peter Jackson's cameo made me laugh out loud. I also loved the visuals. My only complaint with An Unexpected Journey's visuals was that the orcs looked totally different than they did in the LotR movies. Thankfully, the orcs (with the exception of that pale fellow and his chum) are back to their old menacing look and feel.<br/><br/>But TDoS does not impress in writing, acting, music, action sequences, or anything else.<br/><br/>Writing: If I had taken a drink every time there was a dramatic pause followed by some God-awful, stupid line, I might have given this review a higher score on account of being too inebriated to catch all the awful writing and nonsensical plot filler that littered the last half of the movie.<br/><br/>Acting: With how long this movie is, and with how much filler they squeezed in, it's amazing to me that it never seemed like anyone had time to properly deliver a line of dialogue. Everything felt rushed. Questions bled into answers as if the characters knew what would be said before it was said. The emotions of the characters seemed either non- existent or so over the top that the viewer could not possibly relate.<br/><br/>Music: I didn't notice it until the very end when I thought, ""There's music playing, isn't there?"" Any LotR fan knows this is a bad thing.<br/><br/>Action Sequences: These were my least favorite parts of the movie, and they took up about half of the time. I love a good action sequence when it's done right. However, these are not. Half of the action was silly and cheesy, and the other half was boring (not quite half, actually, because I properly liked one bit of action: when that dwarf did a barrel roll, if you know what I mean). It was always predictable. ""Predictable? That's the nature of a prequel!"" I hear you scream. Well then tell the writers to get the action over with fast so we can focus on, say, caring about the characters.<br/><br/>Anything Else: Smaug was stupid; he looked cliché-dragon, sounded cliché-deep-voice, and acted like an enemy in a bad action movie (coincidence???). The movie strayed far from the book. I mean, I'm not the sort to bad-mouth a movie because it's different from the book, but I am one to bad-mouth a movie that ruins everything it touches in the book. Which in this case is everything."

"HenbaineAccount2","1","12","18","3 January 2014"," The Slight Irritation Of Smaug
","As a LOTR fan,familiar with The Hobbit in literary form since I was a child, When I first saw Fellowship Of The Ring as a teen I was so excited thinking,I really hope someone makes this as a full movie prequel one day..So imagine if you will, my excitement when it was revealed they would in fact be making The Hobbit series. Ater the first, slight let down but still quite true to form.. I clicked on the trailer for this one with huge anticipation- and sadly, this is where it all fell flat.<br/><br/>I just want to point out before going further, that I am the first to defend book to movie format from critics who carp on that there are too many differences blah blah and call for artistic license if something is stated to be ""based on"" the book and have always made exceptions for this one as well. However,if this film had veered off from day one,it would be less disappointing and I would accept this rule more. That said, the trilogy is very true to Tolkein's form for the best part and that feeling of relief that Jackson and Co had not gone uber-Hollywood back then has sadly died in a pile of ash suited to Smaug himself. Jackson, who gets all mad at people for for using a the Hobbit name/references in an unrelated manner seems to have almost done the very same ironically - he uses the name ""The Hobbit"" and some characters/places,yet this seems to be where the similarity ends. <br/><br/>So, back to this trailer then, well my first thoughts were: 1.why,is Ed Sheeran singing the music? I love the guy's music but really? is this a Disney movie now? what happened to the beauty and seriousness of Enya and the likes? The style kind of fits the film but it's too pop like. 2.Do we really need a female elf? (unknown male in the book..) Her existence is all too transparent:eye-candy for the boys,some fluffy girl power with pointy ears and a pretty face for the girls. As if that's not bad enough, there is this sickly and horrifically Twilight-esque love triangle between her, Legolas (who also technically does not exist currently..)and a (albeit the only looker) Dwarf? 3. The pronunciation of ""Smaug""(the terrible-come-stock dragon style villain for this movie's name sake) got me stumped as they insist it's ""smowg"" but even hal the film crew call him ""smorg""(I always believed it to be pronounced as Smorg (soft augh sound)-though I could well be wrong) 4.Even in the trailers, the spark seems duller and the dialogue more user friendly- by which I mean a kid could have written the script it seems.So this from the off had me concerned to say the least.<br/><br/>So why?- I believe the answer would be, the female teen and young adult male fan-base. sod the main audience who have followed the franchise for decades, they no longer count it seems, it's all about grabbing the kids for a GTA style graphically violent, poorly scripted, rushed FX overkill of a movie.It's nice they have included the youngsters more and all, but why at the risk of the context? This film franchise has still attracted kids in it's true form ( I was a teen first viewing it with many others around us in the cinema) so why alter it's style so much now? I guess due to the way things are generally marketed these days. <br/><br/>Mr Jackson, a 200 million dollar budget- what prey tell, convinced you that you had to CGI a HORSE? Not to mention everything else around? Rushing over parts of the book that are more than relevant and would have been enough to fill the full movie had it been a reasonable hour and a half long say.I am not happy about this but of course, the reason is clear once again- it's to get to the Jackson style ""romance"" and action sequences that are somewhat bordering on loosing all credibility now. And, just how much of an ego maniac ARE you to have to play a cameo at the start? personally I'd be ashamed to even lend my name to this travesty- let alone my physical presence for all to see. I am so saddened that this beautiful trilogy has finally succumbed to the Hollywood style so near to reaching it's closure. As someone who could not wait to see this film originally, I feel I'd have been better spending my time sticking pins in my eyes for almost 3 hours.<br/><br/>So to sum up, some good parts- yes there were but they were so brief I could barely remember them. Some effects were true to the original but mostly not. It was nice to see the cast but even Gandalf- and I NEVER believed I'd say this- seemed to bumble his way through the storyline like he was on drugs or drunk though I very much doubt this to be due to Sir Ian. And Smaug-He is internally full of fire, how would molten gold HE melted,kill him??No,unsurprisingly it won't- but, Dwarfs are so smart, yes? Terrible ending, of course classic ""let's pay to watch the next one cliffhanger"" ""what have we done"" is painfully ironic and would have been the best time for Jackson's cameo-as himself"" Cue black screen and Ed Sheeran warbling "" ""I see Fire."" Well,I was seeing red, but it wasn't fire.So, to you Mr Jackson I will say this (not that you will ever see it but it still feels nice to vent and all..)You could not have done this book more injustice if you had opened the spine in the middle, crapped all over it, ripped some pages off to wipe your backside then set the remains on fire. The End. ( And no,I won't be seeing the third unless he wakes from his literary coma and does much better to bring this round..)"

This movie would have been better if a deal of comedy and cool use of computer skills were involved in this terrible film.<br/><br/>Finally, if you want a better deal of a bad movie there should have been way more normal use of comedy and drama instead of the terrible use of comedy and drama.<br/><br/>My final say would be try adding a sense of humour and more drama so you can be more sophisticated and add more intellectual use in using graphics."
"saveourlives","5","5","6","26 August 2014"," The worst film of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth franchise
","For some unknown reason, I denied to watch the Lord of the Rings films for years, even though I was at the right age when they were released (which was, adolescence). I decided to watch them only last year, over 10 years later, and fell in love with how a blockbuster fantasy film series can tell so much about the real world in such a great gift wrap (that is, the visuals).<br/><br/>So I sat to watch the two Hobbit films this year - more accurately, yesterday, back to back. The first Hobbit film was okay, but something felt wrong. This second film came to make clear to me which parts are wrong.<br/><br/>First of all, the themes of pride and the fight for it are so obviously presented - nothing like the LOTR films, where its themes were well hidden and you actually had to think a bit in order to find the underlying messages. This alone makes those two films shallow, let alone the simultaneously endless and meaningless Orc-fighting scenes which are there only to showcase the CGI technology.<br/><br/>And this brings us to the second point, which is... the CGI. The original LOTR films had an organic feel, a big part of which being that all main beast characters were real people in greatly-done makeup and the backdrops actually were photographed real-life miniatures (this in particular is what I mostly loved about the visuals of those films). All these have been replaced by CGI - and not even the most ""filmic"" one. I have to exclude the Smaug dragon (which is exceptionally animated and rendered), but everything else feels too video-game-like. To make things worse, I noticed some terrible mistakes in lighting the actors for green screen.<br/><br/>Third, the camera work. Peter Jackson had a discreet yet distinctive style of capturing the images of the LOTR films. The first Hobbit film was close to that, but this second film is photographed in the terrible Avatar-like way (which is, always move the camera around so that the 3D feel comes out bolder).<br/><br/>These are only some of the cons I got from the film. Nevertheless, as someone already said on the discussion, the film is too expensive to be terrible. It's a film you can watch as a LOTR fan or just for time killing, but it has nothing of the magic the previous films possess."
"fung0","3","5","6","29 April 2014"," Glossy but vacuous
","Lots of people seemed to feel the first Hobbit film was too slow, while the second nicely picked up the pace. Personally, I see the reverse.<br/><br/>The first film was slow, but to some purpose. The lengthy intro in Hobbitton gives us some worthwhile characterization. As the expedition moves through the wild, the action builds to a suitable climax. It's all a bit overblown and over-hyped, but it works.<br/><br/>In the second film, it's one endless action sequence after another. Barrel-riding on the river (in open, easily-swamped barrels) turns into a ludicrous extravaganza of 3D heroics by two characters who aren't even in the book - and who therefore can do nothing to advance the storyline of the movie. But the final battle with Smaug is even worse - an endless barrage of increasingly implausible CG-rendered escapades, which again have nothing whatsoever to contribute to the story - given that in the book, the dwarfs never actually meet Smaug at all.<br/><br/>What's particularly galling is that Jackson actually OMITS some of the best parts of the book. The arrival at Beorn's house, in the previous film, skips the clever introduction of the dwarfs, two at a time - a classic fairy-tale passage. The trek through the woods, which in the book extends to weeks of gloom, terror and privation, is reduced to a ridiculous, brilliantly-lit slug-fest with special-effects spiders.<br/><br/>The endless interludes with Gandalf, Radagast and Sauron are well filmed, but obviously needless. It's like an extended product-placement: a trailer for the Lord of the Rings trilogy edited right into an unrelated story.<br/><br/>I did like Stephen Fry's performance as the Master of Laketown, and I liked the image of Smaug. Aside from that, there's very little excuse for this film. It not only fails to capture the spirit - or even the major events - of the book, it's dead boring as a piece of cinema.<br/><br/>I can understand Peter Jackson reaching for a big box of Tolkien Helper in order to extend these movies to such extreme length. But it might have been better if he'd waited till he ran out of actual Tolkien.<br/><br/>(BTW: my apologies for the misspelling of ""dwarves"" - IMDb keeps changing it.)"

","Boyens - She wrote a movie that isn't even close to the plot of the book, and the changes were not for the better. Part of it is not her fault: she was probably told about 80% of the way through that they would change it from two movies to three. You could tell the scenes in the Mountain were blatantly added as time filler. It was seriously almost 30 minutes of Smaug chasing the Dwarfs around, and don't get me started with that illogical exploding gold statue they made. Christ, that was cringeworthy. And the Kili-Tauriel-Legolas love triangle was vomit inducing.<br/><br/>Jackson - I think he is getting too cute with his action sequences. Every kill now is some elaborate CGI-fest. When done in moderation (like the beheading of Lurtz in FOTR), it's cool. Now every orc is killed with some crazy throat-chop beheading. As a result, every ""good"" character now seems like an invincible killing machine, even the dwarfs who in the first movie were noted as being ""merchants, minors, toymakers...not exactly the stuff of legend"". The way Jackson portrays them, Legolas, Thorin, and the other 12 dwarfs could destroy all the armies of Mordor by themselves. One of these ""toymakers who isn't the stuff of legend"" gets turned into a barrel-tank at one point and goes two handed with some axes and slaughters about a dozen orcs in two seconds on a river bank...And then his fat ass manages to jump 10 feet across a raging river, timing his jump so that he could land perfectly inside a barrel that was about a half-inch wider than he was.<br/><br/>I can forgive a lot of things but I was legitimately disappointed in this movie and thought the first Hobbit was much better."

","You should never go to the cinema because you feel duty bound to see something rather than because you are really excited but that's how I felt about this one. I knew I was going to see a middle section of a story and following from the first Part of The Hobbit I knew it would be visually interesting but probably arse-achingly long.<br/><br/>I was right about the length but the visual appeal is waning. I really liked LOTR and the visuals were stunning but we are used to that style now so the other elements of the film have to be much stronger. With this one they really stretched the story. I didn't appreciate the changes that meant that there were orcs everywhere along the journey. This simply lead to overlong, over-choreographed fight scenes where I felt I was watching a computer game.<br/><br/>The huge scenes in the mountain with dragon fire and falling buildings became tedious. Dwarfs were being thrown all over the place and not one was even slightly injured. Not even dwarfs would believe that covering a fire breathing dragon in molten gold would be of any use. The whole piece about molding a giant dwarvish statue was just silly.<br/><br/>Yes I will slavishly be back for part 3 because these movies need to be seen on the big screen but again it will be a sense of duty (with a huge dollop of hopefulness) not pure desire that drives me to buy a ticket."

","For the People who have read my First hobbit review you may remember that I wasn't really positive about it and I called it a boring video game movie experience because of the CGI usage. So was this movie better?? Personally I think it is almost the same as it is very mediocre and if I have to be honest it may even be a little bit worse.<br/><br/>The reason why I didn't like this movie is because it felt like it was a very thin story held together with a lot of filler materials. Because of this the movie's pacing suffered and the rewards didn't pay off. Even though the first movie had boring action it at least had some scenes to develop the story. In this movie most dialogue's veld like exposition followed by action scenes plus fan service. I always wondered how Peter Jackson intended to split one book into 3 movies. Well, by extending the basic story line and adding fillers.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the movie I would like to say that the movie tried to follow a three act structure (beginning middle and end) but it really failed at the third act. The movie was more like a beginning and a very long middle.<br/><br/>Some titbits Character development was decent but it wasn't really noteworthy.<br/><br/>Music was okay but it failed at capturing the moment when I compare it to the lord trilogy or even hobbit one. And that is because of the movies pacing.<br/><br/>Cinematography was much better than the first movie with more scenery/nature shots but there was still a lot of green screen.<br/><br/>In the end the movie continued the story and it is already laying down the foundations for the next trilogy. I'll give this movie a 6."
"dehunter456","5","5","6","27 December 2013"," The Hobbit: The Desolation of a Good Film Series
","Go to the bottom to see my overall thoughts if you want a short review of the movie.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug looked like it would kick ass from the trailers. There was an awesome dragon, Orcs going nuts on dwarfs, and some over the top stunts. The movie was very different.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>-Film maintains a constant tone: As much as I liked the first film, it had a very major problem. The film kept changing tones. At one point, we have dwarfs singing about what Bilbo hates and the next scene, we have the dwarfs explaining about the fall of their race. The Desolation of Smaug fixes this with a constant serious tone. <br/><br/>-Great Visuals: Middle Earth once again looks fantastic with some gorgeous CGI and great shots of New Zealand. <br/><br/>-We can take the Dwarfs more seriously: The dwarfs now have more dignity and don't have as much silly moments. That isn't to say that there are still some silly moments, but they aren't just Gimli clones now.<br/><br/>-Smaug is AWESOME!: Though Smaug sorta looks like a generic dragon, dragons are freaking cool. Smaug is Godzilla sized which makes him even cooler. The CGI on him looks pretty good, though nothing special. Overall, I liked Smaug.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>-Movie is just one long actions scene: This is my main problem with the movie. It's just one long action scene. The stunts are pretty much the same, except that they are in different places. While the first movie had scenes of people talking drawn out way too long, this movie has action scenes drawn out way too long. They get pretty old quickly.<br/><br/>-Not a lot of Bilbo: What I liked about the movie was being able to revisit Middle Earth again and Bilbo Baggins. In this movie, he isn't in that many scenes. The scenes he's in are usually forgettable. Instead, we focus on the dwarfs who are all interchangeable except for Thorin. By the time the movie was finished, I hardly remembered seeing Bilbo in this.<br/><br/>-Pacing is weird: I read the books and they've paced this one really weirdly. One major event from the book takes place for only a few scenes while a minor scene from the book is stretched out for 30 minutes. It's really weird.<br/><br/>-WAYYYY TOO LONG: This is a problem with both the hobbits. They are stretched out way too long. In the first Hobbit, it felt like we moved somewhere as Thorin finally accepted Bilbo on the quest and we learned a lot about what was going on which made up for the long time, but this movie is pretty much only action scenes. I didn't really learn anything about these people, but why have character development when we can have people jumping into crap like the 5 other scenes before it.<br/><br/>Overall Consensus: The Desolation of Smaug had some cool stuff in it with great effects and visuals and was not a bad film. For me, this was definitely very underwhelming with one tired action scene placed after the other. Character development is little as well as the fact that the film is way too long. If you haven't read the books, you might enjoy it, but as a fan of the book, I was disappointed."
"seal_aao","1","63","120","11 December 2013"," A great book manhandled by Peter Jackson.
","Peter Jackson really outdid himself, he managed to create Hollywood-  action-garbage out of a great book.  J.R.R. Tolkien would be furious and sad to see his works raped in this  kind of manner.   I am also sad to see such a great work of literature being turned into  something so deformed. And for what? Some changes are understandable  and I can understand how plot lines might need some work for the big  screen but this..! The story is completely rewritten, it is really weak  and relies only to the numerous actions scenes and great visuals.  This is not The Hobbit, this is just Peter Jackson raping a great book."
"azeemak","3","8","11","13 February 2014"," Oi! Jackson! No!
","I say this as a Tolkien fan who read The Hobbit several times as a boy and recently read it to my daughter, with much enjoyment, and has read The Lord Of The Rings several times, twice as an adult. I adore the LOTR films, where Peter Jackson and his writing collaborators (Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens) worked wonders to get a coherent screenplay out of that massive, unwieldy tome. He jettisoned whole chunks of plot and characters - Tom Bombadil, the barrow wight, orcish politics - and few reasonable Tolkeinophiles could complain, as these omissions were clearly intended to streamline the story. Personally, my main regret is the absence of The Scouring Of The Shire, the riveting coda to the adventure of The Ring, in which the hobbits return to the Shire and put right the wrongs that have been perpetrated in their absence.<br/><br/>More controversially, Jackson made some radical changes to the story: Elves At Helm's Deep! Arwen's part beefed up! Tolkein would undoubtedly have deplored such meddlings with his text, and his son and literary executor Christopher, when breaking a lifetime's silence to give an interview in 2012 made his feelings clear. And yet, the appearance of a battalion of Elves to strengthen the beleaguered garrison at Helm's Deep somehow feels right, and is not at all implausible in the context of previous alliances between Elves and Men. And while one motive for beefing up the part of Arwen was undoubtedly to give the film more female interest, the love between Arwen and Aragorn is not an idle fancy of the writers, being detailed in the Appendices.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the fact remains that there is a huge wealth of material in the Lord Of The Rings, and the big questions for the writers concerned what to leave out. But then there were well over a thousand pages (in small typeface!) to draw on. It was always doubtful, on the other hand, whether wringing three films out of the Hobbit, a far slighter book, would work. After Part 1, I thought he might just pull it off. Although ludicrously overlong, it was a welcome chance for fans to re-immerse ourselves in that beautifully realised world. Some sections, particularly Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, are perfectly realised. Part 2 shows conclusively that Jackson hasn't pulled it off. With The Desolation Of Smaug, the project appears to be holed below the waterline. This is where the inadequacies are made manifest. So thin is the source material stretched here (barely five chapters!) that he's just Made Up A Whole Load Of Nonsense to buff out the time. Parts of it (such as the rolling barrels) look like video game footage, which for all the CGI jiggery pokery of LOTR was never a problem with those films. Those CGI achievements, which were so thrilling, yet spawned so many doleful imitations, have become the master rather than the servant.<br/><br/>Then there's the matter of the new characters. Tauriel's introduction was doubtless motivated partly by the same concerns behind the decision to make Arwen more prominent, principally a desire to increase the minimal female presence in the story. The trouble is that everything she does is newly introduced material that was not in the Hobbit, and as such its only real raison d'etre is to pad out the films, justifying the ludicrous decision to make three films out of this book - which both Jackson and original director Guillermo del Toro acknowledged is ""lightweight"" compared to LOTR. Indeed, the decision to expand from two films to three was only made in July 2013, as detailed in the films' Wikipedia entry. It is therefore certain that some of the material in both of the first two films would have been outtakes from a two-film project. There are other problems with the sequences in the Elven domain in Mirkwood: nearly all of the dialogue is laughably portentous, almost parodic of ""Tolkein-speak""; Thranduil is played as a camp pantomime villain; and Tauriel's ""love triangle"" with Legolas and Kili is wholly implausible.<br/><br/>Throughout, the depiction of the Dwarfs is problematic. Their leader, Thorin, is handsome, noble and vainglorious, and not out of keeping with Tolkein's creation (although Richard Armitage's performance contains rather too much ham for my liking). The others seem to belong to a different film altogether: barely differentiated, mostly farcical, and some with hideous prosthetics. Then there is Radagast the Brown, a character who is mentioned once in The Hobbit and is only briefly in LOTR; while I have no beef in principle with making certain characters more prominent, what Jackson & Co have done to poor, blameless Radagast is turn him into the Trilogy's Jar Jar Binks, an absurd, crusty comic grotesque. In fact, sadly, the Hobbit films are shaping up to have more than just that in common with the Star Wars prequels. I am a little worried about the last film, based as it is on barely 60 pages of the book. In fact, I might hold out for the ""compact version"" of the films, perhaps one film of three hours or so containing the real meat of the original story. I won't be holding my breath"
"sumanchakraborty-kol","6","8","11","2 February 2014"," Incoherent and unemotional with fragments of greatness
","One big factor of Tolkien's universe is emotional aspect and metaphorical meaning of the conflicts going on to the real world. This movie tried too many things but failed to be coherent enough to leave a great aftertaste. There are moments of greatness through dialog, action, cgi and some fragments of great characters. But unfortunately the emotions of a Hobbit or the leadership of Thorin don't get much screen time among the action of Elves. Many good moments, characters are initially built and then the movie leaves them and jumbles between 2-3 parallel story arcs. We don't see enough of Bilbo here and the emotional bond between Bilbo and the dwarfs is almost gone. We had many emotional moments related to loss of homeland and fearless leadership of Thorin in the first installment of the trilogy, but the second installment fails to deliver in that aspect, instead there are some good moments depicting the resurrection of the dark powers. This instead of complementing the Hobbit storyline competed against each other and finally left almost nothing for Freeman. Freeman's natural and eloquent depiction of Bilbo is a treat to watch shorty in the final act. And the Smaug is really menacing with his tyrannical but witty personality. On a technical front, this movie being so reliant upon cgi should have invested more in high quality cgi, the cgi looks artificial in some scenes during the light and shade in some scenes related to motion. The brand name of Tolkien's universe is enough to drag us to the theater and the Producer/Director should have paid more respect with a better thought out and a more authentic storyline."

","Firstly, I haven't seen the Lord of the Rings films but I grew up with The Hobbit as a book, read it and loved it and then I watched the cartoon which I'm sorry to say for all their effort in use of green screen and digital animation excels this film.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, talented actors as they are couldn't save this film. That is the problem when you take a 300 page novel and stretch it out into 3 three hour movies. You have pacing problems and simple boredom. I suppose Peter Jackson tried to fill it up by extending the action sequences with the spiders and the Woodland Elves and the escape thereof, etc, etc. but they become quite dull. Having them spend 10-15 extra minutes fighting spiders or figuring out how to use the barrels to escape the elves whom are racists just because.<br/><br/>Legolas shouldn't exist until later but they wanted a female and what is a film without a love triangle which didn't exist in the book. It got ridiculous the many numbers of what should be fatal accidents they had which turned out to be no big deal. And then 15 minutes was spent trying to determine where the keyhole was in the lonely mountain.<br/><br/>Onto Smaug. Well, the dwarf kindly advised Bilbo to try not to wake him up. He should of just said ""wake him up"" for all the good that did for Bilbo went about in his cave like a blundering fool. He even called out hello several times in Smaug's cave which had an echo. Then he tossed a bunch of coins and gold cups around. It's a wonder Smaug didn't wake of five minutes before. The best part of the movie was hearing Benedict Cumberbatch voice Smaug because his voice dominated that section of the film. But for the first half an hour, and yes, the dragon interchange was an hour or so, was just conversation between Bilbo and Smaug about this and that. The ring, Thorin's ego, Smaug's ego, showing off for Bilbo, etc. The inevitable hide and seek occurred. Eventually, it was tedious.<br/><br/>Really, as I said, the best part of this film was Benedict Cumberbatch giving voice to the dragon so if you want to see that, get the movie, skip to that part and watch it for the rest is just a waste of time and well the three of us walked out with killer headaches and some nausea.

Things improved a bit when the elves were involved but I was just hanging out for this to end for the last 30 minutes. My son didn't like it either and he's a fan. I got the feeling that the director felt he had to somehow make it a long film and totally lost me in the process. There seems to be two story lines, one with the dwarfs in and one with Ian McEllan.

","After reading some of the previous reviews, I wonder what it takes to engage the modern viewer. It seems we have become so jaded that we see the necessity of giving a one star review to something as phenomenal as this film is. It is filled with action, sets of remarkable creativity, amazing characters, in a complex plot that made me long for the conclusion. I know it doesn't follow the book religiously. Get over that. Even a fifteen hour miniseries based on a novel fails miserably. Of course, every English teacher on the planet knows that we are working in two entirely different mediums. Books and movies are different! What Peter Jackson has done is taken the primary plot and allowed his script writers to take what is given and supplement it with their own creativity. The first film, though imperfect, does set the stage for this superior second effort. What we get is nonstop action, moving the characters toward the object of their quest. Tolkien's rules are followed if not the letter of the plot. The first film was criticized for being too talky. Now this one is being criticized for not being talky enough. For me, the scene where the gang must escape an elven prison and face the orcs is one of the most delightful fifteen minutes I've ever spent in a movie theater. I don't expect an action film based on a book with voluminous characters to have character development like ""Driving Miss Daisy."" See the film for what it is and count yourselves lucky to have the luxury of being able to see the amazing accomplishments of the Peter Jackson's of the world."

","I would never normally watch a film of this genre, let alone review it, but I had a soft spot for the LOTR films (and the book of the Hobbit... never liked the LOTR books), and enjoyed the first Hobbit film. Well! This film is a perfect manifestation of why American (and I mean that in terms of the capitalism-inspired film factory rather than the nationality) cinema is risible and pathetic. Here's a list of why: 1) Awful CGI throughout. Not a single shot doesn't look like some sort of teenage boy's x-box wet dream. 2) Terrible, boring dialogue. I neither understood, nor cared about, what the hell anyone was talking about or the apparent ""plot"". 3) The film consists of: dwarfs run to a huge set piece and are besieged by CGI baddies, none of which are remotely original; dwarfs run to another massive set piece (all of which look like some sort of fantasy mini-golf world or look like they've been stolen from earlier films such as Pan's Labyrinth). 4) Pisspoor acting all round. Even Sir Ian is over-acting, probably trying to lend some sort of gravitas to this cash cow. 5) Crap music: couldn't be arsed to come up with anything new? 6) Whatever this new HFR thing is meant to be, it looks AWFUL. The heightened colours only serve to make everything look like plastic. This is expounded by the constant use throughout the film of the swirly filter akin to something from Photoshop. Zzzzzzz.<br/><br/>I actually gave up concentrating when someone said ""Yeah, I told him to go..(something in Elvish... ""get a real job"" perhaps?).

"borland-2","5","13","20","23 December 2013"," The single most boring movie that PJ has ever made.
","The first half of the movie has no plot. There are no character developments, apart from the attempted drama in Mirkwood where Bilbo first uses the ring other than to escape. And the elves have no personality. Actually, I'm sure they do, but it's not portrayed as well as in LotR or the first movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is two films, not three. I could have seen the first film ending on the way to Lake Town. And the second (and final) film starting in Lake Town. The whole Mirkwood thing doesn't say much at all for the story apart from creating more (irrelevant) tension between the elves and the dwarfs. Thranduil should have been a greater part of the story on a personality level, instead we get more Legolas stunts. And the Beorn thing is a waste of time. PJ should have taken his own advice from the Tom Bombadil ""issue"" in LotR, and just cut him out. He has nothing useful to say either way apart from that he hates orcs more than dwarfs. Yay for that or something...<br/><br/>The introduction of Legolas is actually extremely cheesy; it takes the Legolas moments at the battle of helms deep and the mumakils and shits all over it. It's like a preteen girl trying out makeup for the first time, and not knowing when to stop, when it's borderline absurd. Not to mention that this time it's TWO elves being circus artists at the same time. Yes, elves are agile, fast and efficient, but they are NOT there to be a tribute to the comedy of Jackie Chan or the artistry of cirque de soleil. Even the fight in Lake Town is pitiful. And how is it that Legolas almost dies to an orc standing right behind him (and twice is being saved by one of the dwarfs and Tauriel respectively) but somehow anticipates every move from 3 other orcs at the same time?<br/><br/>Enough about the elves. Dwarfs next. There are what, 13 of them? At most two develop through the film. Kili plays a major role with the Tauriel love story thing, but his dialog is very - in lack of a more suitable word - amateurish. It could have been Aragorn/Arwen all over again. Instead it's more like Clerks II. And it's the only part of the story in this film that would have lifted the movie to its own feet. Instead it's more like a footnote.<br/><br/>The other dwarf that changes through the film is Thorin. As in he becomes more like his grandfather. Perhaps he does realize at the end that this is not the way to go, but that's pretty much it. No deeper thoughts, no contemplation or any influence from other characters. Just a sudden change of behaviour.<br/><br/>And another thing this film is very poorly equipped with: Acting. Especially in Lake Town. It was bad. The first film was fantastic with all the dwarfs, the goblins, and even Martin Freeman being very into Bilbo. It doesn't even show in part 2. He's never the focus of the story (movie-wise), nor is any other character apart from Smaug, who - let's face it - is a villain whose feelings we could not give a flipping toss about. What would have been more important to show even more (or at all, really) is Thorin's struggle to not be his grandfather. Make it stand out from the rest of the story, which at the end of it felt like nothing more than filler between parts 1 and 3.<br/><br/>What else is there to say... oh yeah... The intro sequence is never followed up throughout the film. As in, it says nothing useful, and all it does is give PJ his annual cameo. It doesn't even reach the LotR intros to the ankles in terms of relevance.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry as the Lake Town master (not a bad casting decision, but I suspect mainly for the PR) is reminiscent of the Goblin King, but he is not projected as that powerful and consequently the tension of being in Lake Town is very weak, even after Bard switches to become the ""enemy"". He still helps them, perhaps with a desire to avenge his forefather's reputation. But the movie is so shallow it never explores these things. It just says what happened before and the acting fails to portray the characters' deeper intentions, if there even are any.<br/><br/>NOW WHAT IS GOOD WITH THIS MOVIE?<br/><br/>Well, quite a few things, but things that should be secondary to what is already mentioned, in order to make it worth sitting through two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Smaug is fantastic. CGI, voice, story, everything about him. Nuff said. But he does not carry the movie. His part in it starts well into the second half, and that is not enough to make him carry it.<br/><br/>The sets are (as usual in middle earth) amazing. Especially Lake Town this time. Knowing the behind the scenes from LotR, I'm sure they just built a very small section and shot from different angles to create an illusion of size. Still impressive.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION?<br/><br/>This trilogy should have been two films, not three. The second film is an artistic liberty that should not have been granted. It does not qualify as a worthy 2.5 hr film. The only things tipping it into 5 stars is Smaug + the visual look of the film. I can imagine the 3d aspect possibly carrying the first half on just that experience, because there are a few action packed scenes. But in 2d the story just doesn't entertain enough for it to work."

","The six stars that I give this film are all attributable to strength of whatever original material that survives. Peter Jackson and his co- writers have slid down the slippery slope of the Mountain of Adaptation and landed somewhere in the Slough of Fan Fiction. If it were good fiction, I wouldn't have so much of an issue. But it's not. And it's there at the cost of original material left undeveloped.<br/><br/>I would be surprised, for instance, to learn that the company spent more than 10 minutes screen time in Beorn's house. Jackson doesn't dare leave it out, but he has no idea what to do with it. Likewise with the spider sequence--much of Bilbo's cleverness and resolve in rescuing the dwarfs from the arachnids is eliminated and he's reduced to the plucky hobbit-cum-action hero who for some unspecified reason is the only member of the company able to wield his weapon effectively in the webs.<br/><br/>Even more disturbing, Bilbo's singular encounter with Smaug, a high point of the book, is cheapened by a full frontal assault by ten of the dwarfs (three of them have been left behind tending the sick Kili whose pretty little elf-nurse is rushing to his bedside after slicing through a commando squadron of orc SEALS). The sequence culminates in Thorin Oakenshield racing in a wheelbarrow along a river of molten gold to stop the dragon before he takes his revenge on the dwarfs by ravaging the irrelevant and dwarf-less Lake Town.<br/><br/>Why Smaug can't simply kill all ten of the dwarfs when he's destroyed an entire kingdom full of seasoned warriors only 60 years previously is left to the decimated imagination of an audience overfed on CGI.<br/><br/>Of course, Tolkien gives a very good reason for Bilbo's escape: Smaug doesn't know what he is and gets distracted by Bilbo's flattery while Bilbo, partially shielded by his invisibility ring, grabs some treasure and runs for his life. But in mega-production newspeak, that sort of thing isn't cinematic.<br/><br/>I beg to differ. It's mythic, and that makes it cinematic. In Tolkien, the scene is pure Beowulf. A thief steals a few items from the dragon's treasure hoard, and the dragon wakes and wreaks havoc on every living creature in the surrounding countryside. It's practically archetypal. But Jackson and his ilk are superior to archetypes.<br/><br/>Jackson's contempt for his source material is only slightly greater than his contempt for his actors. He has an enviable cast, who are all reduced to doing little more than realize the visual concepts of John Howe and Alan Lee. This, I suppose, at least ensures that the movie has a great look--and, like the first one and the LOTR trilogy, it does. But there's little else. When Martin Freeman is actually asked to act, as he is in the sequences where Bilbo meets Gollum and Smaug, he's quite good, as is Andy Serkis. But there's precious little acting that goes on otherwise. Richard Armitage as Thorin glowers and sneers his way through his scenes, mostly because he's been misdirected (or possibly, more charitably considered, uncorrected) by Jackson. Orlando Bloom shows up as Legolas (no worries, as elves age backwards--or was that Merlin?) and seems even more intent on his image as the cool bad-ass elf hottie than he was in the trilogy (although one wonders how much more he has to work to get laid these days). Even Ian McKellan spends most of the time trying to look either wise and grandfatherly or like a cranky old man, only occasionally sharing a Shakespearean bellow as he rebukes evil in, presumably, elvish or Betazoid or Norwegian or something.<br/><br/>As long as they have the look, Jackson doesn't seem to care about what they say or emote. Instead, he gleefully uses the camera to simulate a computer game--and boy howdy, just wait until it comes out. Now, I don't want to seem like a crank. As a game, this one will probably be pretty fun. But crikey, stop pretending it's a movie. Because it ain't. And it ain't the Hobbit anymore, either.<br/><br/>Except, like I said, for the parts that remain. The desolation. One can hope that the future will hold a technology that allows users of digital movies to easily cut the film apart and put it back together, perhaps in some semblance of what a REAL version of the Hobbit might actually look like.<br/><br/>But until then, we have this. The film reeks of Jackson, Jackson, and more Jackson. Evidently, he wasn't humbled at all by his epic failure to remake King Kong, an endeavor for which he still stands in the shadow of the great Merian C. Cooper like an anemic little boy wearing his soldier-daddy's clothes.<br/><br/>Living with that sort of failure must breed bitterness. Too bad he's chosen to take it out on Tolkien, another giant whom he admires but is too arrogant to embrace. Instead, he's taken a great children's classic and marked it like a junkyard dog.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that I'll probably go see the third, and buy them all as well. Namarie."

","I'm a huge fan of the first three movies and actually wished they were longer but turning ""The Hobbit"" into three movies, researching other Tolkien works for filler, placing LotR characters in a story when they were never there before and just making up new characters so Jackson could stretch one story into three, for me it ruined the purity of a wonderful story.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson got to show off his special effect skills in super extension but it left me feeling like this was nothing more that a betrayal of J.

"henryp1997","10","16","26","2 January 2014"," *Awesome film and there are some idea's I would like to address in this review*
","*THIS IS TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE WAY THE HOBBIT WAS MADE TO STOP THIS GREAT FILM'S NEGATIVE OUTLOOK BY MANY*<br/><br/>I loved LOTR and equally I love the Hobbit films thus far. I am writing this to help people see the idea and thinking behind the Hobbit films, so people can have more of an appreciation than a negative view. Firstly the thing behind the LOTR was their was three books, three long detailed books, so almost everything required for script writing was already there and could be interpreted into script and into of course, 3 films. On the other hand the Hobbit was written as a children's book, so, if you have read the book you realise things go by at a very fast pace (like really fast). So when Jackson was writing the film he didn't have much to work with, and yes, there are a lot of events in this short book that people are forgetting about, lots of events but only summarised by Tolkien, too summarised for a comprehensive film. People say he needed one film, but when you think about how fast, the film would go by, you would hardly see anything, and you could miss out on some key scenes and characters. So Jackson had to expand the sequences by using information he brought in from Tolkien's other related texts. My next big issue is pacing... seriously, what a stupid argument, where movie ""critics"" have to find something to be critical about. For instance in the first film in the Shire, where people said it took to long, for god's sake, the movie is called 'THE HOBBIT', and Hobbit's live in The Shire, I enjoyed this scene immensely as it provides more than adequate characterisation, which for a quality film is important, it provided us with Bilbo's character flaws and habits, the dwarfs mannerisms, beliefs, ambitions, quirkiness, and importantly, individual character points and differentiation. Also showing us Gandalf and Thorins power of presence and importance. The movie breezes along at a steady pace for a first film of a trilogy, which is expected. Also people say that the LOTR is more important, or interesting, thing about it... one is to save the whole world, the other to kill a dragon and take back a kingdom, so please stop comparing the two films, they have their similarities but also have profound differences, pros and cons. People have been saying he (Peter Jackson and his associates) verged too far from the books but what he did was really quite clever, he allowed us to see more of Middle Earth than ever before, and in an entertaining, clever way. Thank you Sir.<br/><br/>So please before you go and say something negative about these great films (which I highly recommend above all other films at this point), just think about what has gone into these films and why and also show a certain appreciation for these magnificent films.<br/><br/>And once I again I would like to re-iterate that you go see The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug, filled with awesome characters, mind blowing scenery, fantastic acting and direction for Peter Jackson. This film,is great fun for all ages and I urge you to see it. <br/><br/>Thankyou"

","This movie is exactly how Tolkien's Hobbit should not be. After first part I asked myself if screenwriters ever read book, now I ask myself did they ever read any book. This dialogs in movie mostly fit some early developed Japanese rpg games with bad simplified English translations, story fit them good too(that much good fits, that you do not even need to read it, just press button on gamepad to skip dialogs and continue to fight bad guys). After this movie I expect to see Conan the Barbarian played by Adam Sandler in 3rd part of movie, Justin Bieber as Batman, and why not put justice league in 3rd movie? Iron man will fit Tolkien's middle earth world, same way as all you put so far fit. Really is this parody? Or your screenwriter really think that they can compete with Tolkien? Even G.R.R. Martin can't compete with him, nor any writer in last 80 years in this genre ever made success that much that can stand near Tolkien, but barely literate screenwriters you engaged think they can? Really I played games with better dialogs, and better story, even if this is game(because it looks mostly like video game), it would be bad one. I really like not just Tolkien's book also G.R.R Martin's and a lot of other, even Terry Prattchet's world seems more realistic than this movie. Jumping on heads of dwarfs in barrels, Really???? Poison Arrow? Dragon can only be killed with specific arrow and special balista? Bard as secondary main character, and it should be completely opposite, accident bowman guard that kills dragon, Legolas I Tauriel or whatever her name is why are they here? Tell us this is Parody or please have respect to Tolkien and change the name of your movies. Tolkien became unit of measurement for good fantasy it should not be changed it should be a constant I'll give you example: Game of thrones is 0.8 Tolkiens, Wheel of time is 0.4 Tolkiens, your LOTR is 0.8 Tolkiens, and your Hobbit is 0.001 Tolkien."

","Having literally been counting the months down to this release, I finally watched the film at the IMAX in 3D. An avowed JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson fan, this was always going to be a difficult one to deliver, having set the bar so high in the previous films. I so wanted to enjoy this but it was just not to be, even when viewed through such ""positively biased"" eyes as mine. OK, the original Hobbit had a few mistakes in my opinion; the ""mockney"" accents and dialogue of the Stone Trolls seemed to be aimed at the under 10's and the misjudged song of the Goblin King aside, there was still enough quality material to keep you hooked, captivated and entranced by the sheer beauty of the language, the cinematography and the plot. This, however, was a different animal. Whilst, still on occasion, certain sets and visuals were almost breathtakingly stunning, including the detail in the rain soaked opening scene at Bree, the bulk of the movie felt like a cross between a made for TV sci-fi and a super lifelike video game. New characters introduced failed to have much depth, and the inclusion of Stephen Fry, playing Stephen Fry was a huge mistake on the same scale as Eli Roth playing the Bear Jew in Inglorious. Parts of the action seemed to have elements of incredible reality quickly intermingled with clear CGI falseness, which just made it difficult to watch. Most of the fantasy scenes in previous offerings were successful largely because they were believable - these just felt false through and through. I could go on....The accents of certain characters, the choice of casting in parts, the decision to have the dragon talk at such length and in such a style (think Ka the snake in Jungle Book) was all just wrong, wrong, wrong. I will be there in 12 months to watch the final conclusion and hope it proves a fitting end to the Trilogy. LOTR and the Hobbit IS undoubtedly a fantasy tale; but that does not mean that it needs to be reduced to a version of a Harry Potter film to make it work."

","I read this book as a ten year old and it really affected me in the most positive way a book can. But I'm not a purist and I understand scriptwriters need to alter and change things a little to make it work on the screen. Ill admit I'm not a fan of Jackson, I've never truly enjoyed any of his movies, there always was an over reliance on special effects, whether it be old fashioned or cg effects, they always took center stage to the detriment of storytelling. I had issues with his LOTRs movies but most people enjoyed them for what they were and that was fine with me, I just wont be watching them again, once was enough.<br/><br/>The Hobbit on the other hand is so bad that I feel like smacking Jackson round the earhole for his butchery of a wonderful and inspiring book. He messed it up catastrophically , its all there in the book just follow it and do the best you can, alas peter saw dollar signs and awards and his name in lights once again, and for that he deserves a left boot into the chops. I wont talk it through scene by scene many others have and have done better than I can, probably because I had a brain seizure with all the flashing images and had to be resuscitated, ill just mention mirkwood, in the book there was a overwhelming sense of the vastness of the forest, one got the feeling it would take weeks to walk to the other side, that it was truly ancient and alive and that they were being watched constantly by malevolent things in the shadows, things more evil than Jackson's underwear hamper, the dwarfs are completely without hope and its a grim and dark chapter in the book , Jackson spends 10 minutes in mirkwood and made it look a cheap set with bits of awful cg with trees that look like painted Styrofoam and spiders that were about as scary as a daddy long legs"
"scarletharlot66-946-138032","4","9","13","12 March 2014"," Overlong, childish and full of plot holes
","I adore Tolkien, and adored the LOTR movies. I didn't have a problem with the departures from the original - different genre, different person at the helm. I don't have a great problem with Jackson departing from the plot of The Hobbit as such, except that the original in no way justifies three movies.<br/><br/>No, the problem for me is that the content that has been added is just so dire. There's a weight of unmemorable characters and the interaction feels stilted and wooden. There's even an added romance that's gratuitous and flimsy. The plot makes limited sense, and I spent most of the movie saying ""Why are they doing that? But surely they knew that already...? Oh, that's just silly.""<br/><br/>To add to that, the CGI is pretty unimpressive. At its best - Smaug - it looks like a video game. As its worst, it's ridiculously over- choreographed fight scenes that had me yawning at their predictability - surfing on shields and bouncing on enemies' heads is now compulsory only because we can. This makes for good guys who are able to gallop around dispatching baddie after baddie while never getting a scratch - with one exception, itself neatly sidestepped. This makes for almost zero suspense.<br/><br/>I was never entirely sure who was supposed to enjoy this movie. The scenes in Dol Guldur add some of the darkness of LOTR, and the spiders of Mirkwood are much more threatening, although Bilbo cuts through them like butter. On the other hand there's romance, there's slapstick, there are pointless shield-surfing fights every few minutes, and needless distracting cameos from LOTR franchise characters.<br/><br/>For me, the movie's biggest crime is in its departure, not from the plot of the original, but from its spirit. The Hobbit is a fairy tale, the story of an untraveled young man given a job that takes him on an adventure beyond the confines of a comfortable life, to which he ultimately returns grown and changed. The Hobbit movies seek to make the story over into an epic, a prequel to LOTR, but lose focus horribly whenever they lose sight of Bilbo's journey."

"jontalong98","2","9","13","17 January 2014"," The people deserve another Hobbit movie from another director.
","After watching The Hobbit DOS for the second time, i have come to realize this is nothing like the book, and i hate Peter Jackson for making this his own story and not honoring Tolkien's work. With Lord Of The Rings, Peter Jackson took the work of JRR Tolkien and made something magical with it. With The Hobbit, it's like Peter Jackson took the book and shoved down the toilet.<br/><br/>The movie is a joke. The first thing i want to mention is the Beorn scene. Beorn is showed in this movie 5 minutes, the dwarfs sieges his house and locks him out side. In the book they enter as guests and Gandalf introduces them two by two so that Beorn would not freak out over the amount of dwarfs. I loved that scene, it shows Gandalf's wit and the dwarfs shyness. Not like in the movie when they by force take his house and lock him out. <br/><br/>The other thing i hated in the movie is Legolas and Tauriel. They steal time and attention from the movie and i think it was a non wise move from Peter's part to include them. For me, it's like they are this movies main characters, not Bilbo. This just shows of Peter Jackson failure<br/><br/>The third thing is, all the physics breaking fighting scenes that's just wastes time. They are not realistic nor entertaining. Just a pain to go through. A good scene when this is shown is the barrel down the river scene. That scene took 20 minutes, and what did really happened? A lot of orcs died by Legolas and Tauriel, who both was in god mode. Then Kili gets shot. That could have been cut down and the time could been used to something much better.<br/><br/>The fourth thing is the amount of time Bilbo was shown, there was barely none. He did not really speak to me during this movie, apart from his conversation with smaug which i think, is one of the few good scenes in this movie.<br/><br/>The last thing i would like to hate on. Is the dwarfs vs Smaug scene. This everlasting, boring scene makes Smaug looks stupid and that is a something he truly is not. The scene is really just a out stretched ''NANANAN YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, NANANAA'' game.<br/><br/>I did not like this movie and i think that the world needs to see another director do another movie about Bilbo Baggins adventure, one that's fair and wonderful, just like the book"

","This film was slightly better than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey which was just a mess. The battle scenes may appeal to teenage gamers but I found them boring after about 5 minutes. Apparently a lot of the gamers felt the same as me as there was a glow coming from the rows in front from many mobile screens as the owners texts messages and read emails. The film had no beginning and no ending, it reminded me of the Saturday matinees I used to attend as a boy where the Lone Ranger was left hanging over a cliff and you had to come back next Saturday to see if he was rescued. I for one will not be coming back to see the next part of the franchise. Jackson has taken many liberties with Tolkien's simple children's book and there are too many to name, but the hint of romance between elf and the dwarf was not even in the book and was ridiculous to the plot. The film was dark with very few laughs in it. A lot of the scenes gave the impression of having seen them in other movies such as the spiders or Evangeline Lilly with her bow and arrow reminded me of The Hunger Games. I will give this awful movie 1 because it had some magnificent New Zealand views in it."

","The first installment of the Hobbit at least was kind of okay as an action movie, even if it mangled the book. This time, the person next to me nudged me and asked whether I wanted to leave about one and half hours into the film. I was tempted. Very tempted but stuck it out. However, by the time it was finished, it was a relief it was over.<br/><br/>I am not going to repeat all the same points from my review of the first Hobbit film, but instead will think of a 'what if?' scenario.<br/><br/>What if Jackson had made a single film, about two and a half hours long (or three?) and had stayed true to both the spirit of the book and the story? You see, the book has sold year in and year out for decades. This is because it is a VERY GOOD STORY. Just think about what could have been made.....it was possible that he could have made a classic film that would stand the test of time of decades of being watched and loved, and would have sealed his reputation as one of the greats.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong - I love dumbass action films. My enduring recent favourite film is Battleship. I like action, I like fantasy, I like fun films. However, instead of any of these, we are fed a bloated, overblown version of the story. As an analogy, Jackson had a recipe to make a gourmet rib eye steak sandwich and instead chose to mince the steak to make a Burger King Whopper.....<br/><br/>....and whilst a beautiful rendition of a steak sandwich may be remembered, who remembers a Burger King dinner....it kinda satisfies for a short while, but in the end it is just junk."

","After reading all the positive reviews before I watched the movie, I was fairly optimistic The Hobbit trilogy took all those much needed adjustments in direction and fixed the problems of the first movie. Unfortunately I've let my hopes fly too high yet again.<br/><br/>Without going in any details about the story, the movie felt like an unsatisfying mess. The biggest problem for me is its identity crisis. In general I consider myself a very open-minded movie goer as long as the movies are fully aware with their purpose, direction and the reason why the audience are going to enjoy it. Even bad movies per se can be good in the sense that they may not pretend to be anything other than bad. So the audience takes the movie on its face value and enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>With the hobbit I just can't understand what the makers tried to achieve - it's a bit of a child book story but with some gore and violence and dark epic tones. As a story driven movie where character development is in the background, the pacing is slow and without a clear direction. I can't believe the same team made the classic that is The Two Towers as well as the rest LoTR movies. The movie I felt is very comparable to other PJ's works like King Kong, which again wasn't character driven and the pace was too bad and ruined the movie. <br/><br/>The second movie was the defining one for this trilogy.

However, I was not prepared for what I was faced with.<br/><br/>The inclusion of an extra character left me scratching my head for quite some time. Tauriel is apparently a Mirkwood elf. She is also apparently a love interest for both Kili and Legolas. I can't understand why Jackson chose to weaken the robust storyline with the inclusion of a love triangle, especially when there is an enmity between Elves and Dwarfs. This vastly underplays the insular nature of the Sindarin Elves and breaks the concepts Tolkein set in place.<br/><br/>The inclusion of ""hints"" towards the future of TLotR were quite distracting and showed that Jackson didn't care if he was playing fast and loose with the time lines. In the books, Sauron wasn't even a whiff of smoke in Gandalf's mind until after he had knowledge of the ring.<br/><br/>But most of all, I REALLY had an issue with the dragon being dipped in gold. Isn't it enough that his belly is encrusted in coins? Tolkein provided awesome descriptives of what happened. Why change it to such an extent? <br/><br/>This isn't the movie I wanted to watch.

His LOTR was by no means exactly the book, but it worked as a cinematic experience of Tolkien's masterpiece. Beautiful, moving, funny, thrilling, profound and elegiac.<br/><br/>With this film, he's done the EXACT opposite. He's taken an enchanting, funny, thrilling story and inexplicably either cut all the fun moments out of it or overloaded them until they become dull and obvious. When not doing that he's busy glopping it up and weighing it down with elements from LOTR or the appendices or just crap pulled out of thin air as far as I can tell. It's hard to fathom that it was directed by the same person. Sloppy storytelling, dull, repetitive, messy to look at for the most part and, unbelievably, boring. Most disappointing, is that the film is practically un-Tolkien. I wasn't a big fan of the first film, but aside from the huge misstep of putting Orcs into it, I liked it for the most part. Desolation of Smaug, however, is irredeemable.<br/><br/>I guess one of the most fantastic coming-of-""middle-age"" stories in English literature wasn't enough for Jackson and his crew. They didn't care to make The Hobbit.

","Though I'm willing to give the movies a bit of lee-way in terms of adaptation. No movie based on a book is going to be 100% faithful to it's source material, at least not word-for-word. I quite enjoyed the previous ""Rings"" movies. They were expertly directed by Jackson. He was able to retain the spirit of the piece - and much of it's narrative. Sure, it had it's problems; a little too much CGI in places, some wooden scenes, but overall it was Tolkien's work. With Jackson's second foray into the world of ""Middle-Earth"", many of the problems with translating books to screen have reared their ugly heads. ""The Hobbit"" has been ripe for the big screen treatment for years Sadly, much of what made the ""LOTR"" trilogy charming has been lost in ""The Hobbit"". My first issue lies with Jackson's choice to make a relatively short novel (If a novel it is) into a 3 part, sprawling epic. This worked with ""The Lord of the Rings"" because it was, ultimately, a trilogy. ""LOTR"" is dense with character, story, themes, and back story. ""The Hobbit"" is a much less fleshed out work and is substantially less complicated than it ""sequel"". The books share characters and settings - as Tolkien created a World with a rich history, language, peoples et al. ""The Hobbit"" is more of a traditional fairy-story whereas ""LOTR"" is an epic. There is a LOT of filler in these movies and it feels like filler. What was already a rather threadbare narrative is now stretched to the point of tearing. Characters are ""expanded"" or cameo, dialog and scenes are conjured from inference or behave in a manner not consistent with their character. If Jackson had tightened up the story, dropped some of the ""wink and nudge"" moments, and focused on delivering a solidly told, compelling work more faithful to the spirit of the piece perhaps I would have less of a problem with it.<br/><br/>My biggest issue lies with the ridiculous action scenes. Sure,""LOTR"" audiences responded to the ""cool"" action scenes, but they always felt, at least to me, to be the weakest parts of the movies. Now, i'm not talking about the battle scenes themselves but to the obviously CGI- rendered scenes. Used sparingly they can be a nice treat during the action; a memorable moment or bit of fun. However, making almost EVERY scene into an impossible display of acrobatics, dumb luck, and silly cliché only serves to make the rest of the film feel silly as well. ""LOTR"" didn't focus on the cheap thrills to propel the story, and tried to bring some genuine emotion to scenes. ""The Hobbit"" tries to juice every bit of cheesy sentiment, action, and spectacle. It's almost insulting, as a fan to be shown this sort of cornball, exaggerated drivel. There are ""dick"", snot, and drug jokes, overly long and heavy-handed moments of ominousness, scenes of brooding, etc. Nothing feels genuine. I was highly disappointed in these first two ""Hobbit"" films. I expected a continuation of Jackson's excellent ""LOTR"" trilogy work. Instead we were treated to an extended exercise is ""focus grouped"" nonsense. Jackson seems to have left behind ALL of what worked in the ""LOTR"" trilogy and decided to give the audience what they've come to expect from today's big budget films: Too much CGI, too little story, thin characters, and plenty of lowest common denominator-style ""thrills"". I found myself thinking, ""Are you kidding me?"" and ""Wow. That is incredibly dumb"".<br/><br/>Jackson is trying very hard to make a 6 part film series based on Tolkien's work. Sadly, instead of 6 good movies, he has delivered 3 solid films, and 2 mediocre films. I have NO hope for ""The Hobbit part 3"". He is padding these films with so much ""LOTR"" lore and story threads that it is having an adverse effect on what ""The Hobbit"" is. Yes, the stories are related, but can exist without being duct-taped together - and that's as skillfully integrated as they feel.<br/><br/>Jackson should have learned a lesson from the last prequel trilogy and side-stepped the pitfalls therein. But it feels as if Jackson decided to follow Lucas' footsteps. ""The Hobbit"" trilogy has failed to capture the feeling or look of ""LOTR"". It's both surprising and disappointing that Jackson could go from winning the best picture Oscar for LOTR 3 to making such a disappointing, unworthy follow-up. what's worse is Jackson had everything laid out for him. Yes, there was adaptation to be done, but it was already there for him. All he had to do was follow the path he had tread previously. Sure, technology is better now, and new techniques are available, but they should only serve to make these movies better - they seem to have hurt them. I'm not sure how Jackson could have made a WORSE film, but he did. The practical effects should have been a priority over the overdone CGI - both in characters and in scenery. It takes a fantasy film and makes it even more unreal. The CGI - like in many films as of late - destroys it's own ""willing suspension of disbelief"" by making what we are seeing so utterly unrealistic, it causes the viewer to mentally check-out. Like I said, a bit of this stuff - used sparingly - works and can be memorable. Trying to create an entire film this way just makes it unwatchable."
"rossatronnn","3","11","17","28 December 2013"," Jackson aspires to mediocrity with The Hobbit
","As expected, the second instalment in The Hobbit series disappoints. It almost feels like a rookie filmmaker was at the helm of this production, desperately attempting to emulate the magic of Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. Instead, it really is Jackson orchestrating this mess. He directed, produced and wrote this film, which is quite unsettling considering its inferiority when compared with his usual terrific work. <br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is executed like a film from the Narnia series. Its narrative is uneven, a portion of its characters are superfluous and it fails in adsorbing the audience; interesting things happen that we should care about, but we don't. That's due to the first film's weak introduction to the story and the characters, who, due to their awful development are impossible to relate too. When Biblo finds himself in danger we should be riveted, held in suspense as he weaves his way out of the situation, rather than distanced and apathetic, which is ultimately how we feel. In my opinion, this apathy stems from the bad writing and equally dull portrayal of Biblo by Martin Freeman.<br/><br/>Jackson tries to force unwanted characters in the face of the audience by putting these characters in scenes that he believes will elicit an emotional response from the audience (when you watch the film these scenes will be apparent). Even so, these scenes are so poorly constructed it is impossible to care. It feels so amateurish, as if Jackson has no control or passion for the story. It's told in such a rushed way that it allows no time to show its heart. Afterwards when you recount the experience, you realise it was an empty film, only a child or the average brainless viewer could truly love it. <br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is almost lifted by a few brilliant sequences. Smaug himself proves to be the best aspect of the film. No matter how excellent, though, he is not great enough to rectify the remainder of the film. Unfortunately, that scene beneath the mountain is overshadowed by the other faults, including the careless pacing and fake looking, overly vibrant sets that look nothing like the Middle Earth that LOTR had made us accustomed to.<br/><br/>For the average viewer, The Desolation of Smaug will be a fairly enjoyable film, albeit easily forgettable. For a film enthusiast, it will disappoint. Though, if you know anything about films, you probably should expect it to. That's not to say it does have not some admirable moments. Jackson just should have done better, he has the talent, and this had so much potential. I'm not sure how he got it so wrong."
"stimpy_tr","5","11","17","22 December 2013"," Hobbit or Smurf?
","I think this is the worst movie of LOTR+Hobbit series. I found it very annoying and boring. The talents and the luck of hobbits are greatly exaggerated as if in a smurf or Tom&Jerry cartoon. Well, at the beginning of the movie, there was no flashback of the previous episode so I began to think that this was an independent adventure. As one year passed over the previous Hobbit movie and unless you are a keen JRR fan, there is no way to remember where the last episode ended. There are many ridiculous things in the plot. Why did Gandalf disappear when he was needed most at the entrance of that scary forest? Why did he met with the other nutty sorcerer inside the cave of a mountain? And why did Gandalf told him not to follow him after a short while? How did all those hobbits survived the giant spiders without a scratch? It was an insult to Frodo's legendary fight against the spider in LOTR. What was the fight against that dragon? Come ooooon!!! It was 100 times larger than Balrog and those super witty hobbits succeed to dip it inside a huge 5000 Celsius gold bath again without getting a scratch. And this was an insult to Gandalf's legendary fight against Balrog. During all this time, the scenes were interrupted, the fight against the dragon was interrupted at least 10 times because of the stupid chase in the lake city. I don't even want to mention the fight between the orcs and hobbits along the river and the one between the elf and big orc chief in the lake city in which the orc chief should have cracked all his bones. They all deteriorated the charm of the LOTR trilogy. The director should very well read these comments and pull himself together. He may be a great director but he should remember that he is not making independent movies. He is making episodes that are connected to each other and he should not be fooled by the number of spectators."
"thomaslee9474","1","34","64","15 December 2013"," Don't waste you time, there is really nothing to see.
","Usually for the hobbit/LOTR films I would say that it was predictable/clichéd and had a childish story with undeveloped yet, lovable characters but had really nice visuals/cgi which successfully conveyed how epic and grand the story was, which made it entertaining overall. <br/><br/>In this ""film"" however, absolutely nothing happens story wise. It was a painful 3 hour trailer for the 3rd film, which is set to be just a war between Orcs, elves blah blah over a stone. <br/><br/>The little substance that was in this film can be summarized in the following paragraph. <br/><br/>Gandalf leads them to a forest. He then decides to go meet the necromancer for some reason. The dwarfs need to reach the lonely mountain by following one path, but manage to stray from it. An army of spiders attack them but they are saved by the elves (Legolas and Tauriel). They are all captured except Bilbo cause hes wearing the ring. He frees them. they make it to the lonely mountain by passing through ""lake-town"", which they were smuggled into because dwarfs aren't normally allowed. Through that process the audience is told that there is only 1 type of arrow that can pierce the scales of the dragon Smaug. The dwarfs then proceed to kill the dragon by covering it in melted gold. They obviously fail, the dragon gets mad and fly's to lake-town to kill everyone. thats how it ends.<br/><br/>Whats wrong with the hobbit series so far: 1) ridiculous, almost comical action scenes. These random bunch of dwarfs have inhumane fitness and physical co-ordination. <br/><br/>2)Pathetic attempt of romance between a hot elf (Tauriel) and dwarf.<br/><br/>3) In the LOTR series Gandalf was a fatherly figure that proved hope and courage to the hobbits and soldiers against an impossible adversary. This role is completely necessary in this series because the dwarfs and Bilbo constantly achieve physically impossible feats as if it were nothing. On top of that, his character actually has little relevance to the overall story and he's only related to the stopping of the necromancer. <br/><br/>4) For a dragon that can speak impeccably with good diction, he is retarded. Could have ended the dwarfs and Bilbo in 1 second. All the protagonists are one dimensional/stupid/predictable. <br/><br/>5) This film could have been under 1.5 hours. <br/><br/>6) A lot of random, unnecessary scenes like the beginning of this one. Had no relation to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>7) it is such a cliché, the idea of good overcoming an almost impossible adversary is just so overused in this series in general, which makes it so predictable and boring.<br/><br/>This film is just eye candy, and even then there weren't enough Legolas/Tauriel scenes. Tauriel is really hot thou, so they have that going for them. Overall, it is really is a waste of your life. The book isn't even that great either so don't bother. <br/><br/>LOTR is much better."

","What makes The story of the Hobbit is it's beauty in simplicity. The story is pretty simple, but it has deep characters with great story telling, and interesting foes along the way. I was my favorite book growing up. Desolation of Smaug convolutions all that and ruins (arguably) some of the best parts of the book. 1) The added Orc guy chasing them... is stupid. It's not in the book and is TOTALLY unnecessary.<br/><br/>2)One of the funnest parts of The Hobbit is seeing the wisdom and trickery of Gandalf. The way he tricks Beorn to extend hospitality to his party is so awesome... but not in the movie. They do it totally wrong and stupid. It cheapens the character of Beorn. <br/><br/>3) The dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug was another GREAT part of the book that this movie totally takes a huge stinky Carl's Jr dump on (like after a Western Bacon cheeseburger and fries type dump). Bilbo NEVER went fully into the room with the dragon. He hid in a chamber and had excellent banter with Smaug. Smaug tried to lure him out and tried to roast him with fire... but Bilbo in the passage escaped. The movie goes over the top with Biblo out running a freaking dragon!! It's not believable and cheesy and stupid.<br/><br/>So in closing... Dear Peter Jackson... your an idiot. If you want to make a movie about a book... write your own freaking book and then ruin that.

But I do care if the movie carries no resemblance to the book except for the names of the main characters. The first movie was, apart from the few action scenes, relatively true to the book. And I enjoyed it. But this one.... PJ has ruined the best four scenes from the book that I was really excited to see. First, Gandalf introducing dwarfs to Beorn, then, Bilbo taunting the spiders, third, dwarfs escaping from the elven cave (or better, the whole few weeks of their imprisonment), and finally (my favourite), witty conversations between Bilbo and Smaug. What disappointed me the most, was that endless chase in the Lonely mountain. I really don't see the point of inventing that scene. If any of the characters got killed there, I would just go: ""Eeh, so what!"" These and the whole bunch of stupid plot changes and pointless battle and action scenes ruined the movie for me. And I'm certainly not going to watch the third movie, as I'm sure there will be even more stupid action, probably a whole three hours of fighting. I actually went on and read the whole book in English as, until then, I have only done it in my native language to see if I had read badly translated Slovenian translation.

","Apologies for the facetious summary but this movie unfortunately does deserve it. Note that I will let you know when the spoilers begin. Of course, I really can't spoil anything for you. The movie will spoil your day, all on its own.<br/><br/>A low score warrants context. My daughter, 13, and I, 42, loved the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and forgave The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey as an acceptable though uninspired start to the trilogy in progress. Prior to watching this, I'd read numerous reviews claiming that the second Hobbit installment was much, much better than the first, and that Smaug was the best on-screen dragon of all time. Finally, I love the books, but this poor review is not a result of Jackson's ""faithless"" adaptation.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings has great character development, palpable relationships, and surfaces inner struggles very effectively. The Hobbit limps along, relying mainly on the characters we got to know in LotR (the few that are in the movie), and preventing any real interaction with the ""new characters"" through a never-ending montage of frenzied activity. Jackson gave himself 3 movies to help us connect with The Hobbit, and I sadly feel confident that installment 3 will come and go and I'll feel totally disconnected to the characters in this trilogy, and even worse, it may damage my feelings for the LotR Trilogy.<br/><br/>A LIST OF SPOILERS: 1. Smaug is introduced brilliantly. What follows however, is utter disappointment. Bilbo, lacking any discretion as he eyes the Arkenstone. Is this realistic behavior? A bunch of fat dwarfs tricking Smaug in his own lair. Really? This is where the book got it right. It was just Bilbo and Smaug, and Smaug could not see Bilbo, who was wearing the ring. And even invisible, Bilbo was petrified. Such is the fear that Smaug should invoke; fear that Jackson fails to stir. 2. Legolas and other characters have gone from near-impossible feats in the LotR to non-stop suspensions of reality. Is this the Matrix, where the laws of physics can be ignored? This may sound hypercritical, but constantly defying the laws of physics reduces the movie to a video game with human characters, rather than a film that is cleverly using CGI. The lack of reality is ongoing and overbearing. 3. So, the party gets to the Lonely Mountain, and presumably the entrance, in which a keyhole will be revealed at last light. Well, the sun sets, and there's no keyhole, and the dwarfs, after mere seconds, give up and begin to descend the mountain. Really? Just like that? Aren't they accustomed to obscure riddles/instructions by now? My message to Jackson is this: whether being faithful to the book or not, be faithful to the characters' motives and context, and you'd actually make the audience care.<br/><br/>I'll stop momentarily, because I want to actually enjoy my day, and reliving this very mediocre movie is not going to help. I hope that Jackson's obsession with CGI and other technological cinematic advances diminishes, so he can once again make movies with real characters, and memorable dialogue.<br/><br/>The LotR Trilogy is on a shelf in our home, and I can safely say The Hobbit Trilogy will never find its way on that shelf, or any other."

The plot they do add is full of holes and inconsistencies. It is sad that they didn't trust the book on its own merit enough to give it any respect, filling it with endless fight scenes and way too much comedic relief.<br/><br/>Secondly, Peter Jackson ""Jacksoned up"" this movie even more than his previous works.

It was boring, overlong and had just too much filler. Tauriel is unnecessary. Read the books - no Elven women fight. This is far too much of a stretch. Then to have a love triangle between two elves and a dwarf? Unacceptable. No elf or dwarf have EVER been lovers or in love. If Tolkien didn't write it, Jackson shouldn't have included it. Adding stuff from the appendixes was a great idea, but the whole scene was done poorly. And Beorn, a major character, used in a cameo? I was disappointed beyond words in this movie. Overblown and under thought, with a horrible ending (likely because of all the unnecessary filler), this wasn't anything like the great two part film the Hobbit should have been. And, among Jackson's many crimes against The Hobbit, he totally ruined the barrel escape. Oh and Azog is dead by the time of the Hobbit. DEAD. His son, Bolg leads the Orcs of the misty mountains.

Yes, the portrayal of Smaug is magnificent (and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome). However, there are so many issues with this film.... Lets start with the introduction of a character that is never in the movie...WTF? Then, build a love triangle on top of it that is also not part of the story line. As much as I like looking at Evangeline Lilly, her character ""Tauriel"" is an insertion into the movie that allows Peter Jackson to extend the story line and justification for stretching this 1 book into 3 movies. Tolkien is sacred in my house, as his stories have now enthralled 3 generations of children in my family. Passed down from my father to me, and me to my son. It was the first full novel of any literary significance that I ever read. As it was for my son. The story is marvelous, rich, and deep. The characters are well developed and immortal. So, I guess what I am saying is, when a director and studio feel the need to insert characters and story lines into something that is so treasured and revered, it cheapens the entirety of the film to a degree. This isn't the first time that Jackson has taken creative leniency in the films...But this is the first time that ""creative leniency"" cannot be applied as a term. This is borderline blasphemous. After the introduction of Tauriel, I had a hard time lending credence to the 20 minutes or so of ""crafted"" story line developed around her introduction. It was obvious filler, and the rest of the movie crawled along until I found myself souring on the whole experience. Perhaps I am over thinking the whole thing, but this movie just seemed ""off"" for me. It seemed contrived and generic, and it felt like it was being fed to me. My worst fear is that the continuation of this unauthentic side story will permeate into the last film, and ruin what should be an epic conclusion to the book."
"Anarion14","1","19","34","23 December 2013"," ""One ill turn deserves another. It is over! Embrace the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction!""
","Firstly, I loved Tolkien's books (especially the Hobbit) and was absolutely enchanted with Peter Jacksons film versions of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In fact, those are some of my favorite memories of my adolescence. My Dad coming home with our first DVD player and picking a movie to buy with it (and of course he chose ""The Fellowship of the Ring""). I was twelve years old. After seeing the FOTR, I went and read the Hobbit and all of The Lord of the Rings books before the Two Towers film had come out. It was a magical experience. It was all so real to me; even at twelve years old, I somehow had this wonderful hope and belief that Tolkien's world was real, and that he hadn't simply made it all up; that maybe it was just a world that had come long before our time. I even spent my free time making bows in the forests surrounding my home, trying to pause the movie to observe the designs on Legolas' bow, and borrowing ""The Bowyer's Bible"" from an old friend who was also a bow and LOTR enthusiast. Those who knew me in those days remember my bows could shoot over the tallest pine trees in Sam Houston National Forest, which were quite tall.<br/><br/>Anyways the reality is that when the Lord of the Rings films were first being made, Peter Jackson was almost a nobody, and Tolkien was definitely a somebody (relatively speaking). Tolkien was a master story teller, a pioneer in literature, and in many ways a founding author of the fantasy genre. That said, during the making of the Lord of the Rings, Jackson was much more humble and allowed the passionate Tolkien artists and craftsmen to pour their work out (To include staying true to much of Tolkien's source material, and when deviation was necessary, staying true to the spirit of the work). From my observations, I have concluded that the Lord of the Rings film was a masterpiece 10% because of Peter Jackson's directing and adapting and 90% because of the artists, craftsmen, and actors who loved Tolkien's work and poured themselves into recreating it, and of course making minor deviations as necessary for the sake of turning the story from one medium to another (book to film), while staying true to the spirit of the books. During the making of the film, I think that Peter Jackson mostly gave people thumbs up as they poured out their amazing work, but in the end, he got the majority of credit for the masterpiece, physically carrying many of the Oscars and the publicity with it. That's not to say he doesn't deserve his due credit for the logistics, preparation, directing and adaptation of the project (hence the 10%).<br/><br/>So then life went on. Pretty much everyone believed Jackson was a truly great artist and story teller. Jackson had done what was thought for a long time to be impossible. He had brought the Lord of the Rings books to film, and it was done in a masterful way.<br/><br/>And then we saw King Kong, and then we saw District 9 (Both over-rated and highly forgettable films in my humble opinion)and now we're seeing the Hobbit series I'm Afraid the Hobbit is something like %60 Peter Jackson, and only %40 the master artists, craftsmen, and actors that made the original Lord of the Rings films so great. Many of these wonderful people are still present, but they've been pushed into the background to make way for the overconfident director of the Lord of the Rings, who mistakenly decided he was the most qualified to make the most important artistic contributions to the film.<br/><br/>Now we have a film made primarily by Peter Jackson and it is like almost all of his other films (save LOTR): silly, unbelievable, and at best cinema fodder for less appreciative movie goers. I will not tell you what the Hobbit films are (All the other reviews can do that for you), but I will tell you what The Hobbit films are not. They are not the masterpieces made primarily by the Tolkien enthusiasts and great artists that we saw a decade ago. This is Peter Jackson's film, and everyone else, including Tolkien, has been pushed to the sideline.<br/><br/>Four stars instead of one, because the contributions from the great artists and enthusiasts are still quite noticeable."
"isisinhouston","5","26","49","14 December 2013"," Where's the Tolkien
","We all know that Jackson takes broad liberties with what Tolkien gave us and it is no where more obvious than in DOS. Since you have to expect that, it wasn't a deal breaker but if you are a Tolkien purist, hopefully you have realized that the theater and Mr. Jackson's renditions aren't for you.<br/><br/>There is no reason at all for the creation of Turiel other than to make the movie longer. She doesn't exist in middle earth, only in Jackson's screenplay. She really adds nothing to the story and from what Orlando's father in the movie says about her relationship with Legolas, she won't be around long. I really didn't expect her to make it through the film but it looks like we will have to put up with her in the last installment. She's more ""lost"" here than she was on the island. Sorry Evangeline, it's not that you were bad, your character just wasn't any good and completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Jackson continued to alter Tolkien's world with every step he took in this film. 95% is Jackson. 5% is Tolkien. Very sad.<br/><br/>That being said, it was a good film. I did enjoy it, mostly. Jackson loves battle scenes. I do not. I thought it was better than the first one and I hope they will finally dump Azog completely since he was dead long before the Hobbit started. Another unforgivable alteration by Jackson. I will be glad to see the final installment next year and then rejoice in the fact that the stories have finally been done and not have to worry about them being brutalized any further. So glad that Jackson does not own the rights to the Silmarillion so he can't screw it up."
"atlaswoof","3","17","30","16 December 2013"," 3D and a trilogy is not doing The Hobbit any favors
","I was very surprised to learn that The Hobbit would be a trilogy. This second installment makes it clear that Jackson did not have enough content from the book for great screen writing across 3 films, so expect a lot of cheesy, brain-dead fluff throughout this movie. I was pretty disappointed.<br/><br/>Parts of the movie are downright boring because they don't add anything to the story. The scene where the master of the lake town is getting out of bed scratching his butt and emptying his chamber pot? Totally unnecessary! Likewise, most of the dialogue from the people of lake town was not necessary. I didn't appreciate the liberties taken with the writing.<br/><br/>The cinematography from LotR was beautiful, stunning... and with the 3D for the Hobbit, the cinematography just doesn't live up. The 3D is best during action scenes and I would agree enhances the action some, but during all other parts of the movie with rolling, scenic hills or intimate dialogue between characters, the 3D filming brings the film down. I am not sure if this is because they need to use different angles, lenses and setups to make the 3D work, but something is way off. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a bad history channel movie.<br/><br/>Sometimes it looks extremely real, but at the same time, extremely fake. Most of the time it just looks fake. I could not get over the feeling that I was watching actors in a studio or on set with fake lighting. The 3D kind of ruined the film's ability to pull in a viewer into a fantasy world the way the LotR movies did.<br/><br/>I will not watch this movie again and I think Jackson missed the opportunity to make a great movie with The Hobbit. I would never have compared the original LotR movies to something you would see on a made-for-TV-movie."
"brickyardjimmy","5","17","30","14 December 2013"," The Desolation of Peter Jackson
","So here's the main points.<br/><br/>1. The actor who plays Thorin did a video commercial for the DVD of the movie that you just paid to see in the theater suggesting that you should pay more now so that you could get some wondervision DVD at some later date when it becomes available. It looked eerily similar to those videos of terrorist hostages talking about how America blows. Nice job Hollywood.<br/><br/>2. Like the first installment of this three movie one book epic there are action scenes of infinite length that, basically, are set up so that the dudes that make the Lego video game of the Hobbit don't have to think too much.<br/><br/>3. Speaking of action scenes, in the ""barrel ride"" scene something really weird happened in my theater. I think the projectionist kept mixing in video of his family's white water rafting trip from last summer. Either that, or they just forgot to bring a film camera the day they shot the close ups of frothy water. Maybe Peter Jackson made a selfie movie on his cellphone of him splashing around in his bathtub and stuck it in thinking no one would notice.<br/><br/>4. The studio or whatever must have finally gotten the note that they forgot to put any black people in Middle Earth because they put one whole black person in this one. Sure it was just one extra in a Lake Town scene, but at least they kept cutting back to reaction shots of her face for awkwardly long and obvious takes. Now no one can say that Middle Earth isn't racially diverse.<br/><br/>5. They could have given an actual speaking role to a black person. Like Bart. I don't think Tolkien ever said one way or another if Bart was white or not. Instead, they appeared to give Bart's role to Jean Claude van Damme made to look youthful through the magic of CG. <br/><br/>Incidentally, Jean Claude van Damme once told me that he could kick me in the eyeball without getting up from his seat across the dinner table after I told him that I really liked his performance in Monaco Forever. Nice to see you again Jean Claude!<br/><br/>It's not the worst movie ever made intended to help stretch a single, fairly lightweight fantasy book into three seven hour movies but it's not the best either."
"antagonist117","4","8","12","28 February 2014"," With slightly more plot this is a small improvement over the first, but it still has little of the fine character work that made LOTR great
","The second Hobbit movie is an improvement over the first simply because it stops for plot. There are two very long, insensibly edited, stupefyingly predictable action sequences, one toward the beginning and one at the end, but in between them there are a couple of hours of dialogue. That dialogue is mostly a string of clichés, and it has only a tangential relationship to anything J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, but at least the characters are talking instead of flinging themselves around in a glaringly artificial whirl of debris and Orc body parts. So that's the good news, if you can call it that. The bad news is that despite the opportunity to correct it, one of the main problems of the first movie is still unresolved: the Hobbit himself, Bilbo Baggins, a literary hero beloved the world over, is effectively absent from the movie that is ostensibly about him and his adventure. Tell me, what does Bilbo think about Lake Town politics, about which so many instantly-forgettable words are bandied? Who knows? We don't see or hear from him during our entire time there. Nor do we hear what he thinks about the intriguing history between the Elves of the woodland realm and Thorin's ancestors, because we are too busy watching the beardless Dwarf Kili (or, who knows, maybe it's Fili! They're all interchangeable and most don't talk!) flirt with a character that Peter Jackson invented! Bilbo, and this is a statistical fact (don't research it, just take my word for it), has less screen time than any title character since Godot. The movie is better when Bilbo is in it, which he is at the very beginning and again towards the end just before a Scooby Doo chase scene starts between Smaug and the Dwarvеs. But as appealing as the intrepid Hobbit is in his fleeting cameos, before you can say ""second breakfast"" Jackson's rickety roller coaster is off again and Bilbo's out of sight. Maybe in the three-hour final movie Jackson will somehow find time to squeeze Bilbo in, either during the action of the Battle of Five Armies or, if the film can accommodate such luxuries in such a short runtime, during moments of dialogue. For a refresher on how to achieve this sort of thing, Jackson should refer to his own beautiful and character-rich adaptations of the Lord of the Rings."
"melee-3","1","8","12","22 December 2013"," absolute BS as either The Hobbit or just an action movie

Anyone giving this a positive review is not only lying to you, but is helping the film company steal your money.<br/><br/>This is soooo bad, that I'd advise you to not even watch it when it is rentable.<br/><br/>Because that moron Jackson created that chase scene in the first installment, he had to continue it in this one.<br/><br/>Orcs fighting the elves in Mirkwood, orcs fighting in laketown, a few of the dwarfs staying in laketown while the rest go to the Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>Other BS like Legolas being in this film......Gandalf (alone) vs Sauron, The action scenes... totally bs ..... from the fighting scenes to the dragon ..... astonishingly stupidly done.<br/><br/>Forget the fact that there should be no fight scenes between Thorin's group and Smaug........ this dragon that was able to totally devastate 2 towns/communities (Dale and the Lonely Mountain ) .... is now unable to kill a dwarf or halfling when right in front of it....<br/><br/>Because he screwed around with "",,,,five fir trees"" in the first movie, AND had that ongoing, nonsensical chase continuing..., Jackson has to come up with some moronic method to get Beorn into the movie .... and moronic it is....<br/><br/>If you like the book, don't waste your time.... and if you like action movies..... why not find something like ""The Seven Samurai"" or an Errol Flynn classic like Prince and the Pauper...?"
"djdeath-450-294917","3","8","12","31 December 2013"," Jackson's done it again.
","And not in a positive way.<br/><br/>This movie is another good example for Peter Jackon's flawed style of film making.<br/><br/>When I was 17, the Fellowship was released and I was blown away. Not by the storytelling or the portrayal of the characters. No, it was the amazingly detailed illustration of Tolkien's world that got me hooked. I loved the books and already felt that some things in the way the characters were presented were off, but I didn't care because of the spectacle. I watched it three times in cinema alone and was totally hyped when the trailer for the Two Towers was released.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema with great expectations and I disliked the movie almost completely. Too many Hollywood clichés and more noise than substance or heart made this one already a big let down, as well as Jackson's disability to be subtle and remain meaningful. Add to that many scenes that are involuntarily funny, and you arrive at almost B movie quality plot devices.<br/><br/>The Return of the King continued in the same way, while leaving out some great scenes from the book and having quite a few questionable (and laughable) stylistic decisions (Lighthouse Sauron, the ghost army for example). Add to that the very anti-climatic solutions to the great battles and some really atrocious changes to the books characters (again) and I was left with an empty feeling to what I first thought could be an enjoyable movie going experience.<br/><br/>So, when it was said that some other director than Jackson would be responsible for the adaptation of The Hobbit, I must have been one of the few, who was a actually glad about this bit of news.<br/><br/>And then Jackson got in again and in addition to his already annoying direction goes all Lucas with The Hobbit.<br/><br/>And this time I just hate it. My main problems among many are:<br/><br/>1. Catering to lowest denominator: Cram in more action, more romance and childish humour and people will love it. 2. CGI Overuse: Much like Lucas' Star Wars prequels, this prequel trilogy is marked by an overuse of CGI. And it completely takes me out of the movie. While the first trilogy (especially FotR) made a sensible use of its SFX budget, Jackson now has apparently way to much money to spend on CGI sequences. Maybe I've become too sensitive in that respect, but I get sick when I see CG orcs doing conversation. Especially Azog looks so out of place, I can't imagine any reason why they decided against using masks and costumes. Especially when it worked so well in LotR. 3. Trying to be like LotR: The Hobbit is a completely different tale than The Lord of the Rings, but Jackson tries to make it as epic and meaningful and it just doesn't work for me. It also distracts heavily from the original story and its main character. More so than in AuJ, Bilbo as character and main protagonist is completely underused and subdued. Now, you would expect that time saved here is used to make the other characters more interesting and memorable. And indeed, with the amount of time Jackson reserved for the adaption, there should have been plenty of time, to give the dwarfs some character and actually improve on the book, where the dwarfs remain quite bland. Unfortunately, it's not better than in the novel. 4. Way too much over the top action: Combined with the CGI, this absolutely shattered my suspension of disbelief. There's no feel of tension or danger. Combine that with the problem that I don't care for the characters and all I get is big yawn from the prolonged fight scenes. 5. Copying from the Lord of the Rings: This trilogy doesn't bring in any new ideas. Kingsfoil, the way the Ring slips on Bilbo's finger, a Worm Tongue look a like... it's just so obvious.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me is that Jackson has to show us how evil the ring is with Bilbo as an example. Now, some people actually think that the scene in question is one of the best from the movie, but it just doesn't make sense in the long run. If the ring gets a hold on Bilbo this early, shouldn't Bilbo have changed drastically by the time his 111th birthday arrives? And it's not because Gandalf reminds him that killing is bad, that he doesn't take Gollum's life. It's because of his peaceful Hobbit nature (Murder is basically unheard of in the shire). All this makes Bilbo/Frodo so resilient against the influence of the ring. Now it just doesn't fit in the context anymore.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, there is so much that is off, but the typical moviegoer with his craving for action and show wont notice anyway.<br/><br/>The truth is, that these movies have become boring and stale. Sometimes less is more. A good story, told with heart and soul is much more compelling than this CGI extravaganza, hailed by the people who are satisfied with seeing Middle Earth on the big screen again. But sorry Peter, that alone wont make a good movie. At least not in my book."
"bouldergecko","4","8","12","28 December 2013"," CGFX/plot diarrhea will leave you empty at the end
","Easily a contender for one of the worst blockbusters of the decade, The Desolation of Smaug crushes everything good about the beloved story The Hobbit and bakes in every stale trope of modern action movies. The bitterest part is how obviously this script was drawn out to fill up three films, when it could have been a more intimate work, just as the novel had been. <br/><br/>Too many other elements have been forced into the story, attempting to create conflict where none need exist. The worst of this is the love triangle between Legolas, Kili and a character, Tauriel, who was invented precisely for this purpose, making the movie read more like a soap-opera than an epic fantasy. The barrel ride, for example, was made into some complicated Rube Goldberg plot device to arrive at a romantic climax later in Laketown. For purists, the characterizations are all off, with Bard as a fisherman scorned by the townsfolk, an all-too-prominent Radagast sketched as an addled hobo, and the Laketown mayor far too paranoid about some imaginary revolution on the edge of erupting. The dragon, who was to have been the pièce de résistance, gets mired in an action sequence that takes all the gas out of the character, and the tête à tête between Bilbo and Smaug is devoid of the mischievous streak in our hobbit hero that made the book version so entertaining.<br/><br/>The movie had a weird light to it, and left me wondering if I was watching some PBS video drama from the 70s or 80s. Most of the movie lacked the natural light that made the Lord of the Rings so breathtaking in its sweep. In that series, the beauty of New Zealand really shone through, but this series has an artificial quality to it, reminiscent of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action sequences were cartoonish and over-the-top, suspending the laws of physics in a brazen manner, creating an almost campy tone. Directorially, the actors seemed to be struggling with dialogue that felt out of place in the story (though that could just be my bias for the original).<br/><br/>This movie seemed to have all the elements of a success: a well-established franchise, the founding director, an ensemble of great actors and stunning VFX technology, but the script was far too crowded and the action too muddy to entertain. I want to say the producers filled the movie to overflowing as an apology for poor script choice, but then I remind myself that the overflowing was the problem in the first place."
"ajping","3","8","12","27 December 2013"," A good story ruined by failed attempts to create suspense when there isn't any
","Ugh. This movie is painful to watch from beginning to end. First there is the atrocious editing. The beginning of the movie is simply difficult to follow. Then there is the fact that the plot unravels fairly quickly. Orcs are relentlessly pursuing the party for what reason exactly? Oh right, it's to give Orlando Bloom and elf-girl a reason to be in the movie. Gandalf's cut-away scenes make no sense. The scenes in the forest are just plain ridiculous. The final scene with Smaug is similarly ludicrous, poorly written, and overly dependent on CGI. Smaug the terrible comes across as pretty inept at killing for a creature that purportedly wiped out an entire army of hard ass, armored dwarfs and a city of humans.<br/><br/>There are a few places where the movie rolls well. The fighting on the barrels is very well done and the scenes with Bard and the town kingpin mesh well.<br/><br/>But ultimately the movie is ruined by too many big names demanding close-ups and screen time. It would have been better to sharply cut back on both Gandalf's and Legolas' appearances or at least connect them back to the central plot more cleverly."

","When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey premiered on silver screen as the first in a trilogy of films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, the response it received was mostly positive to mixed. The majority of criticism was targeted at the needless expansion of a single film story into three features but, in my opinion, it did commence this latest Middle-Earth adventure on the right note and, despite its sluggish pace, ended up providing a largely satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the second chapter of The Hobbit film series & picks the story right from where it was left off in An Unexpected Journey. Continuing the adventures of Bilbo Baggins who's accompanying thirteen dwarfs on their quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor, the film covers the journey ahead for these fellows which is full of dangers and even if they manage to get away with it & reach the Lonely Mountain safely, they have a stupendous dragon to deal with.<br/><br/>One thing I have always admired about this Middle-Earth franchise is the filmmaker's strong intent to keep the story very much within the realms of Tolkien's spirit. But this latest chapter marks a significant departure from such faithfulness & ends up being an immensely frustrating experience. There are a few things The Desolation of Smaug gets right but there are also way too many things that are wrong with it. Let's start with the things it gets right first.<br/><br/>Since the previous chapter was criticized for its sluggish pace, the filmmakers have vastly improved the pacing in this middle chapter with addition of many more action sequences to keep the entertainment going throughout its runtime. Production design continues to amaze. Cinematography encapsulates the picture with a darker layer which suits its tone. Visual effects has its share of highs n lows & Howard Shore's score is good but it also stumbles a little for the very first time.<br/><br/>Now coming to what's wrong with it... First, it slaughters the book in a manner that's plainly insulting to Tolkien. Second, the absurdly introduced love triangle, overindulgence of Elves & eye-rollingly cheesy dialogues are poor filler substitutes. Third, this film had a great opportunity to further develop its characters but thanks to its rushed pace & more emphasis on over-the-top action over a riveting narration, we still have difficulty in recalling the correct names of all the Dwarfs.<br/><br/>And that's not all. Martin Freeman is brilliant as Bilbo Baggins but his character is demoted into a secondary role for the centre stage is taken by Richard Armitage's Thorin. The remaining Dwarfs get only as much screen time as they did in the last chapter. Elves have never been as annoying as they are in this film for Legolas wasn't even needed in this adventure & Tauriel, who doesn't even exist in the novel but was created to bring a feminine energy to the series, is given a stupid love story to work with instead.<br/><br/>At last, I would like to talk about Smaug. Exquisitely designed, remarkably portrayed & meticulously detailed, this splendid beast of CGI is a jaw-dropping wonder to look at & the painstaking work that went into bringing this magnificent dragon to life truly deserves a bow. But thanks to its inefficient handling by the filmmakers, the cunning, proud & intelligent dragon of the novel is turned into a foolish creature here which is a shame because Smaug could've been as memorable to this trilogy as Gollum was to The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an emotionally unappealing but visually spectacular sequel which features a much more exciting, fiercely paced & action-packed entertainment that'll satisfy most filmgoers but for the devoted fans of Middle-Earth, it's a heartbreaking disappointment that adds even more insult to injury by abruptly ending at one of the most frustrating cliffhangers in cinema history, thus leaving the experience very much incomplete in the end."
"SleepKills","5","8","12","23 December 2013"," Reasons I didn't like The Desolation of Smaug
","As The Two Towers is my favorite film of the previous trilogy and I was told The Desolation of Smaug was darker than the first Hobbit film, I was looking forward to this one. But my god, was it disappointing. Why? Well, here's why:<br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf and Bilbo have to be the most important ánd most interesting characters of this trilogy. But where are they in this film? Gandalf leaves the group pretty early in the film and we hardly see him again. And also Bilbo isn't really used to his maximum capability, it almost looks like Peter Jackson forgot the film has Bilbo.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>So, who gets all the screen time, then? Well, there is this dwarf that gets his leg hurt and an elf who randomly falls in love with him and wants to heal him. And then there is Legolas, who also loves this elf or something? This love triangle is apparently so interesting that during the big scene with Bilbo and Smaug, they keep cutting back to the dwarf and his leg that hurts. Yeah, I really didn't wanna miss that.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And this film is filled with a lot of boring and pretty much useless characters and appearances. Boring characters such as that leader of the elves. And useless appearances like Cate Blanchett showing up for 2 seconds. Or that Radagast dude, who only appears so he can lift his hat and show there is a birds nest underneath. Exciting AND useful.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Anyway, you can really tell that Hobbit 2 is mostly filler- material. I guess you can just walk in the film during the third act and you wouldn't have missed any essential part of the story. I'm even assuming you can just skip the entire film and go right to There And Back Again and you wouldn't be all that confused with what you've missed. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Also, I find it frustrating that Jackson didn't even take the time to give this movie a proper ending. Fellowship, Two Towers and even Hobbit 1 had cliffhangers too, but at least they felt like they had an ending. Here the film just stops in the middle of a scene, like it's a cliffhanger for an episode of a TV-show. Only difference is; this is a three hour movie! A little more effort wouldn't be too much to ask, right? I mean, the man who had 20 endings for Return of the King didn't have one left for this film and so he just simply cuts to black?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The one thing I would look forward to with this film, was the dark tone. I thought the first Hobbit was a little too childish, with all these trolls and goblins with funny voices. But Peter Jackson apparently liked this, so he even gave the giant spiders a voice. Yeah, that just what Shelob, one of the scariest and most awesome creatures from the original trilogy, needed; a funny voice. Only cool thing I can say about that is, is that one of the voices was done by Peter Verne- Jones (Lord Crumb in Bad Taste). But still, why would you give those spiders a voice?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I guess the voice of Smaug seemed a little more appropriate. Benedict Cumberbatch does a pretty decent job on the voice of the dragon, really dark and mysterious. Only problem is.. the dragon just won't shut up. I guess this scene had to be stretched to reach the 3 hour mark, but my God, couldn't the dragon just shut up for one minute? He really got a lot less mysterious and threatening when he just kept talking and talking. Too bad.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>So, is that all the problems I had with The Hobbit 2? Not really, there were still two things that really annoyed me. First of all, there were these horrible scenes in this little town, with Stephen Fry as the mayor/leader/master- guy. It looked like an unfunny episode of Blackadder, did they really except us to take this stuff serious? Stephen Fry was totally inappropriate and out of place, his Wormtongue- ripoff- sidekick was really annoying (the guy obviously isn't a Brad Dourif) and that Bard and his family were far from interesting characters. And still, we stay in that town for a very, very long time. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Last thing I really hated was the 3D- HFR. I saw the film in HFR and I can't remember ever seeing something so incredible ugly. I really can't believe someone actually chooses his film to look like that. And they say that's the future for cinema? God, I hope not!</li></ul><br/><br/>Last but not least, is there anything positive to say about The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug? Yes, there is. Like with the previous film (and also the first trilogy), the effects look great and the action sequences are well put together. And Martin Freeman is a great leading man, much better than Elijah Wood for the Lord of the Rings films. But still, Freeman doesn't get to do a lot, because of all the other uninteresting characters showing their faces. <br/><br/>Best scene of the movie? That is, without a doubt, Gandalf showing up at Dol Guldur and seeing the return of Sauron (with that Mordor- theme playing). That gave me some chills, as a true Lord of the Rings fan. But it was only for a short while, because right after Gandalf vs Sauron, we had to return to dwarfs with leg pains, elves in love and Stephen Fry."
"jkok-4","5","8","12","23 December 2013"," Why could they not just make two movies as originally intended?
","The problem with the LotR trilogy was the sheer size of the opus. There was so much material that a lot would have to be left out in order to streamline the movie and make it work. Usually it tends to work and it did in that context. Here, however, the book is considerably shorter and one would think it would be easier to adapt to a movie. <br/><br/>The original plan was to make two movies, correspondingly to the structure of the book. Now with the second movie the bad story telling decisions made early at the scripting phase are beginning to snowball out of control. There's just so much bloat and unnecessary alterations without which a much more compact and to-the-point end result could have been achieved. Not much is left to expect from the third movie anymore. Maybe somebody could do a fan edit after the third movie is released.<br/><br/>The brilliance of Tolkien's work is in the fact that he wrote what he wanted the way he wanted to. The error here is trying to force the story to a mold it originally refused to fit into. It makes not sense. The original story captivated millions of people. Why could a true to the original adaptation not do it?"

Rhadaghast the Brown just having a cameo and doing sod all.<br/><br/>Bilbo being congratulated on his keen eyesight because he's spotted a giant carving of a Dwarf in the side of the mountain, how amazing must his eyes be??! The dwarfs spending months journeying to the mountain, only to give up after 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The sub-plot between the dwarfs, the Bard and the Master in that town. None of it worked apart from the comedy value of the dwarfs being covered in fish and then sneaking into the house via the toilet.<br/><br/>I found it ludicrous that they made such a fuss about 'getting across the lake' and into the town, why didn't they just walk down the pier like the Orcs did? The whole over the top running 'battle' between the dwarfs and Smaug inside the mountain. I mean what was all that about? It was such an elaborate digital laden farce which ended in the most ludicrous of ways.<br/><br/>The ending. I mean it's been thrown in our faces that Smaug has a scale missing, only a black arrow can pierce it and the Bard has one arrow left. What could possibly happen when Smaug attacks the town? Maybe I'm wrong but it's hardly a cliffhanger isn't it? I think for me overall the reason I didn't like it as much was the first one focused on Bilbo and told the tale from his perspective for the most part. This one Bilbo's not really central and it's all over the place. That combined with so much CGI, some stunning, some obvious, made me feel detached during the last hour or so."

","By far the worst , until now of the series. Bad script, bad acting, bad cgi,.... 13 dwarfs and a hobbit are on a journey, enter the elven forest and not for long they are discovered by the elves....but an whole army of cgi orcs are not, they can advance,surprising elf sentries!!!!! Bilbo is back as the fifth(fourteenth) wheel. As ever disliked by Thorin. Where is the friendship gone that was there at the end of the first Hobbit journey. The orc mercenary Bolg walks around as if he just crapped his pants.(Way to cgi)It's all just to visible. Makes the film look cheap. Like the barrel ride downstream. Legolas was older here then in the LOTR films .Serious!!! The dragon was to easily fooled by fellowship of the midgets(It is after all a children's book)Is this the reason why we get a dumb dragon? Morgul tips(blade for Frodo, arrow for Kili) have jet to become as lethal as in the first LOTR film. I was amazed by the sheer number of orcs killed by elves,dwarfs and a hobbit.I was afraid there weren't going to be enough left for the announced war. Was it all bad. No, the ring making you Dr Dolitlle was fun. The bear creature was fun in an awkward way. The becoming of the lidless eye was kind of great. The dragon was fantastic even portrayed stupid. The dialog between Smaug and Bilbo was great. Ian the Grey was good as ever and managed to carry the overlong scene at Dol Guldur. The be-headings were a funny addition, however useless they seemed."
"patmahoney","4","9","14","10 January 2014"," Poor adaptation of book
","Having seen both of the Hobbit films, I must say I have found them a big disappointment. I have read the Hobbit many times – as a teacher it was often my class novel to 10/11 year old children, who grew to love Bilbo as much as I did. I looked forward to the films and while all the costumes, special effects, battle scenes, etc are excellent, for me it is not the same as Tolkein's novel. There is a lot of emphasis on battle scenes with the Orcs and Goblins, who must be said as fearsome as they look, are pretty rubbish with swords and bows and arrows! The charm of the book for me is the central character, Bilbo Baggins, who finds himself taken out of his natural environment in Bag End, on an adventure he does not want to be on, and wishes many times to be back in his own little hobbit hole. From my viewpoint this charm is missing in the film. The story too I feel has been spoilt by dragging it out for 3 parts – I had difficulty keeping my eyes open for the beginning of the first film, where 'The Unexpected Party' dragged on far too long that it actually became boring. I can appreciate that the film is an adaptation of Tolkein's work, but for me the book remains supreme!"
"marten-112-513286","5","9","14","1 January 2014"," Yes the rumors are true - This isn't very good.
","When Guillermo del Toro was out of The Hobbit and Peter Jackson was back in, I was a bit disappointed to say the least. Guillermo is a fantastic visual artist if nothing else and would probably have given us something beautiful and unexpected. Well at least PJ has done this before - I thought - and if he can avoid repeating the things I felt least satisfying from The lord of the rings movies (cringeworthy action sequences aimed for 15 years old boys to put in the trailer and painfully dragged out camera roller coasters in caves or landscapes where nothing of interest to the story happens) this would be an OK representation of The Hobbit.<br/><br/>Unfortunately since there really isn't story enough in The Hobbit for three whole movies of this magnitude, PJ had to fill them with a lot of fluff (yes you guessed it - cringeworthy action sequences aimed for 15 years old boys to put in the trailer and painfully dragged out camera roller coasters in caves or landscapes where nothing of interest to the story happens). And instead of actually elaborating on the scenes that occur in the book he prefers to cut most of these as short as possible to fit totally irrelevant junk in there. Also there is a significant mood change from the book in order to make The Hobbit more into a Lord of the rings duplicate.<br/><br/>The second installment in The Hobbit trilogy gives you pretty much the same of what was started in the first movie, only more so. There is less of events from the actual book and more of irrelevant side stories this time around. Total lack of character development during the film and the main character Bilbo is basically just a parenthesis throughout. It feels very much like a regular studio production to make money instead of any attempt to make a work of art.<br/><br/>This isn't really worth going to the cinemas for and it has left me totally indifferent for the final movie.<br/><br/>:) Best part of the movie: Well made props and some beautiful sets.<br/><br/>:( Worst part of the movie: It has few relations to the actual book. Big waste of opportunity."

A little serious at times, so Martin Freeman does well to add some light relief.<br/><br/>But the reason why this cannot score over 5/10 is the utter pointlessness of the film. The Hobbit is a lovely children's book, one of my favorites and should have only been one film, maximum two. I'm afraid it is a money-making, selling-out exercise of which you are being laughed at. I was infuriated when I saw Smaug fly off to Lake Town and the film just ended- bloody finish it!!!! If Peter Jackson knew what that it was to be carved into three films would he have agreed? Not impressed."
"Leofwine_draca","4","4","5","9 April 2016"," What on earth was Peter Jackson playing at?
","I thought the first Hobbit film, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, was just about passable, although spoilt by the inclusion of random CGI action scenes and a general lowbrow comedy feel. Unbelievably, this sequel, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, is even worse. Peter Jackson's once undeniable talents as a director seem to be rapidly departing him, as he's churned out a random CGI kid's adventure film which has virtually no resemblance to the middle section of the Tolkien novel.<br/><br/>The problem with this overlong and incredibly dull movie is the amount of extraneous material. Whoever thought it was good idea to bring back Legolas (complete with CGI eyes this time around) was an idiot. His ridiculous fight scenes are an embarrassment. I could just about cope with Arwen's presence in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but Evangeline Lilly's presence here is unforgivable.<br/><br/>The CGI is constant and unending. Most of the backdrops are done with CGI, and even the orcs are now CGI too. They look poor, very poor. We even get CGI moths and butterflies and CGI bumblebees. Jackson has no idea that less is more when it comes to computer effects and instead keeps plonking them in constantly, resulting in a film which looks fake from beginning to end. Performances across the board are poor - the actors are merely required to interact with CGI scenery after all, and a sense of weariness and exasperation has set in - and the long-winded bit where Bilbo finally makes it to Smaug's lair is sleep-inducing, it's so dragged out. However, the stupid barrels-down-the-rapids sequence has to be the nadir of the whole thing..."
"richlewin","6","4","5","4 November 2014"," Jackson's weakest
","BEWARE! Spoilers Contained.<br/><br/>This a brief summary of my thoughts. For me the H:DOS is one of Jackson's weaker films. The film delivers as a great action, fantasy but does not contain the depth and stamina of the LOTR trilogy or the first Hobbit film, which in my opinion was just as good as LOTR. The action and CGI are far too cartooned for my liking and the plot is evidently bulked up for the sake of making the 2 film plan work as a trilogy. The story elements that are added such as the Elf, Dwarf love triangle is ridiculous and goes against the hatred between the elves and dwarfs established in H:AUJ. In my opinion the film lacks character development and drama and the inclusion of Legolas as a character adds no weight to the story and seems pointless just for the sake of linking it with LOTR. Bilbo is the one character who does go through an arc as he slowly becomes obsessed with the ring and aware of Thorin's motives Some scenes iconic to the book I feel were rushed or poorly constructed such as the barrel sequence and Beorn's house. What I would have liked from this chapter is more of Radagast's character investigating the Necromancer and being the one who is captured as opposed to Gandulf. I also felt the ending should have been the demise of Smaug rather than being saved for the final chapter. In doing so would it have been reminiscent of LOTR. In two towers the lesser evil is defeated leaving the ROTK for them to fight the main villain. Although I look forward to the Five Armies I can't help feel it will be overfilled with action."

","Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is continuing his trek to Lonely Mountain, accompanying Bilbo are the 13 elves, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) the wizard, and Thorin (Richard Armitage) the King of the dwarfs. Once they find the mountain, they have to use the Key of Thorin to open a door carved into the Lonely Mountain. He must also find the Arkenstone, the royal gem of Erebor, and take on Smaug, the dragon. And he must do all this before sunset on Durin's Day. Before he gets to Lonely Mountain, there are many obstacles in Bilbo's way. He seeks refuge with Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) and then has to fight giant spiders in Mirkwood Forest. They escape the spiders only to be arrested by the Elvin King, Thanduil. (Lee Price) Bilbo and company escapes the Elvin prison in barrels only to run into a band of Orcs. The attack is repelled by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gandalf has split from the group with Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) to find the Necromacer, also known as Sauron. Before getting to Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarfs must go through the burgh of Laketown with the help of Bard, (Luke Evans) to get weapons. Thorin also tries to negotiate the return of Laketown to the dwarfs, Thorin promises to share the gold from Lonely Mountain with the people of Laketown. They accept Thorin's proposal. By the time Bilbo and the dwarfs gets to Lonely Mountain, the sun is setting, and they cannot find the keyhole. Bilbo has the ring which gives him invisibility, but will he get a chance to use it against Smaug? Does Gandalf find Sauron?<br/><br/>The last 40 minutes if the Desolation of Smaug is well worth watching. The chemistry between Freeman and Cumberbatch crackles with tension. Getting to that last 40 minutes, however is a long, hard slog. Peter Jackson has again taken a simple story, and made it a bloated, unrecognizable mess. He could have scaled back on Legolas and Tauriel, he could have scaled back on Laketown and skipped the love triangle between Legolas, Tauriel and Kili altogether, but all the minutia was there. I haven't read the Hobbit or any other Tolkien, but all the minutia made for dull watching. The problem is, every sci-fi movie since Star Wars has to be an epic trilogy, the Lord of the Rings was an epic trilogy, so the movie makers, for purely pecuniary reasons, made the Hobbit a trilogy, and it's the audience who suffers. The Hobbit movies also suffer by comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy which was a rich tapestry of story and characters, which built to an incredible climax, the Hobbit will never match the magic of the Lord of the Rings movies.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, especially by Cumberbatch, Freeman, and Ian McKellen. The movie is best when the three are on screen. When the movie shifts away from the three characters they play, the movie suffers. Evangeline Lilly and Orlando Bloom do their best, but their storyline just didn't interest me. Richard Armitage is pretty forgettable as Thorin.<br/><br/>The pacing is very slow at points, and I noticed that the landscapes, which were pretty spectacular in the first Hobbit movie, were somewhat ordinary, the CGI budget seemed mostly to be poured into the talking spiders, and Smaug, and I must say, Smaug is a special effects marvel, but still not spectacular enough to maintain a 2 hour and 20 minute movie.<br/><br/>For more fire-breathing reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","I honestly can't see why everyone loves this film so much. It is nothing like the book, and though people are saying don't go into it expecting to see Tolkien's Hobbit, I at least expected to see something similar since this is credited as an adaptation of the original novel. What I got was a horrible bloated version of the Hobbit that barely resembles Tolkien's work. What's worse is the terribly cheesy love story edited in for a longer run time and more content and the often clichéd script. CGI is too frequently used (even the horses are computer generated). The giant super-soldier orcs are horribly obviously fake. What made the orcs from LOTR so awesome is that they were actual actors armed with a legion of prostetics. Here we get dwarfs mowing down monster orcs effortlessly, all while fleeing from elves in barrels flying down a river. Character's motives are unclear and instead of getting you involved with the characters, we get dwarfs whose names (unless you are dedicated to the book) you don't even remember chopping off Orc heads every thirty minutes like they are performing tricks. Plus the soundtrack is just boring. Anyways, it's a horribly made movie, made horribly just so they could squeeze three movies out of a 250 page book."

This movie was in one word disappointing, and this is not due to the fact that they have totally disregarded the actual book and invented entire piles of new (and often lame stuff). The hobbit is a children's story not meant to be epic or a 3 movie thing. A simple, relatively small movie would suffice. I would really like to see 3 epic movies from Peter Jackson on the SIlmarillion. The audience of the Hobbit seems to e targeted at 15 year old. It simply does not do justice to either the book or the Lord of the RIngs movies."

Initially it was said that Guillermo del Toro would direct this movie. But finally it came to Peter Jackson. A decent story, yet deviated too much from the novel and since its neither the first nor the final part of the trilogy, there ain't expectation of an ending to the story. There are too much action scenes and times I felt like the team aimed to show off their CGI stuffs and for the Video game consoles.<br/><br/>My review for this movie is that it is adventurous with awesome camera work with CGI but too much deviated from the novel.

The usual Peter Jackson three/four adventures in a movie, which I noticed ever since LotR and Percy Jackson, is present in both The Hobbit and Desolation.<br/><br/>I have to admit the action sequences in Desolation is quite impressive and is upbeat which gives the movie a joyous moment, and I have to admit also that Legolas is the star no matter what; outshining every character present in the movie which, Legolas, was not really present in the source material in The Hobbit book. Good thing for Peter Jackson to put the coolness back, but I'm pretty sure, fans of the Tolkien epic is not happy.<br/><br/>The depth of the story is somewhat garbled and confusing, but I know it will be summed up in the third film. And I don't like how hanging Desolation was. Unlike the LotR series, it has satisfactory hanging by the end of the first and second book; but in Desolation, it was crunch anguish I felt, and when the screen faded, I then asked my partner if how did he feel; he said it was 'okay' and I know it's not the best. And Desolation has reached one step to the climax but then cuts, so it made me feel angry.<br/><br/>And one more thing, I don't quite understand why it's titled 'Desolation of Smaug' when I know Desolation means something empty or destruction. Enlighten me, people.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is directed by Peter Jackson."

That and the fact that there's hardly any toilet humor, except in the most literal sense, are the only reasons I rated it as high as 5. Beyond that, it suffers J.K. Rowling syndrome,i.e., the love of one's own voice and the inability to edit. Or is the motivation monetary? The action sequences are too numerous and too long. Indeed, everything is too long.<br/><br/>The charm of the book is nowhere to be found. Well, I did notice Martin Freeman trying to inject some at a couple of points, but his efforts are are lost in a sea of effects and needless action. Also, there can't be any climax because everything is so amped up from the start. When not amped up, it's needlessly dreary. Is Kiwi weather relentlessly gray or something?<br/><br/>Finally, I'm getting sick of movie-makers changing books and adding characters to suit their own vision, or please some imagined demographic. People love a good story. I do. But this one's so bogged down by effluvium that I can't imagine sitting through the opening credits again, let alone the entire flick. <br/><br/>The entire trilogy boiled down into one two-hour (maximum) movie.

Now having just written a review of the awful UNDER THE DOME, I should point out that I am very critical of a story being dragged out just to fill a time line. However when it is done well the effort is justified. So when the first one came out and it was a wee bit of a disappointment, I was hoping it would get better in the second one and then be truly magnificent by the end of the third. The middle one is always the most difficult and so this proved. It was almost as if there was a change of directors or writers from the first as the movie was totally different from the first in tone. The first was in keeping with the book, light hearted and a pure fantasy. Now in the second part it was a more serious film with none of the songs and humour of the first. If this was the direction the director and writers wanted to go in the first place then why have all that in the first movie and none in the second? I am not a fan of the songs but I do like the humour and there is very little in this second part. If you listen to the directors commentary on the extended edition of AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY he and the writer clear up some of the ""faults"" with the first movie but it will take a lot of explanation as to why they discarded some of the stuff they did in the first movie for a more ""serious"" look and feel to the second part. I am hopeful the third and final part will wrap it all up but at the moment all I took from this second part is that they finally go to where they were heading but then again that is how the first part ended.

"Keatonics","3","4","5","29 December 2013"," Mr Jackson, sir: you left me wanting...not in a good way. ***SPOILER ALERT***
","Dear Peter Jackson;<br/><br/>Call me old fashioned.<br/><br/>When I watch a movie (read a book, listen to a song, etc.) I have an expectation that there will actually be an ending. You did that with the LOTR trilogy, and with the first Hobbit movie. But this one...it didn't end. It just stopped.<br/><br/>I actually stood up in the theater when the screen went black and let out a scream: ""Noooooooooo.""<br/><br/>OK, granted. It is hard to turn a single novel into a movie trilogy. That was the advantage you had with LOTR. Each book had it's own conclusion written by a master story teller. Three independent stories. So, given that, maybe you shouldn't have tried to turn one rather average length novel into three more-than-full-length feature films. You were bound to have problems stretching it that far.<br/><br/>But to end it where it did. Really, Peter? This isn't TV. This isn't a season ending cliff hanger. It is a feature film. It needs an ending in order to satisfy your audience. <br/><br/>One problem with Hollywood-from its beginning-is the inability to end a story. Screen writers have always had this trouble. Novelists always seem to end their stories well, why can't screen writers?<br/><br/>There would have several logical places to end it. The most logical would have been when we first saw Smaug. Smaug opens his eyes, we see the look on Bilbo's face followed by a teaser. Another logical place to end would be after the killing of Smaug, which we know is coming (and who is going to kill him). There would have been cheering and a happy ending, and perhaps a teaser about what was coming next. Even during the battle when it is unclear whether Smaug or the people will win. <br/><br/>But that didn't happen.<br/><br/>But it just stopped.<br/><br/>Stopped.<br/><br/>No ending.<br/><br/>I'll give you credit where it is due. The production design was beautiful, the green screen was as expertly accomplished as we have come to expect from you. The characters were very well developed-particularly Thorin and Balin and Kili. They came a long was since the first film and all the characters had a greater depth, perhaps more than Mr. Tolkien had conceived. Character prosthetics were absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>The effects were a bit over the top but you did have a lot of time to fill, so I will give you a pass on that. We kind of expect that now. But my feeling here is that just because you can, does not mean you should.<br/><br/>As for the story-with a strong story from a master story teller you had more meat on the bones than most film makers. Who could lose?<br/><br/>In fact, Peter, you had me absolutely hooked. I was right there (suspending disbelief when I needed to), feeling the tension build, feeling sympathy for the good guys and hatred for the bad guys. Tension during the epic battles-Orcs vs. the world, Gandalf vs. Sauron. Tension when Bilbo is discovered by Smaug. Very well executed. <br/><br/>But you absolutely lost me when Smaug delivered the last line and the screen went black.<br/><br/>Naughty, naughty Peter Jackson. That is no way to treat an audience. You did not give us the respect that we are due. It was just crassness, plain and simple, obvious that you were milking the story for the money. You forgot our needs. Naughty, naughty.<br/><br/>My prediction: you will end up losing between one third and one half your audience for the final film...all because you stopped the story abruptly, instead of giving the story a resolution-an ending, and the respect for the audience that we deserve."
"miriamseshadri","5","4","5","27 December 2013"," Quite disappointed
","Of all the Peter Jackson films, this was the one that strayed furthest from the book and in doing so, lost practically all the charm and magic of the bits I was looking forward to. Perhaps a quarter of the movie was loosely (very loosely) based on the book, the rest was unnecessarily formulaic pap (especially with the music that played each time The Ring was shown). The interaction with Beorn was reduced to about three minutes, the order of how they got lost in the woods and trapped by the spiders was changed around completely so that more fighting scenes could be put in, the dwarfs were not packed into the barrels but instead the tops were left off so that they could have yet another highly unlikely fighting scene (in real life they would have been flooded with the first waterfall) which, of course, was not in the book. The secret door was no longer a secret with a great big staircase in the form of a stone statue leading up to it, the door did not open with a piercing last sunbeam but with the light of the moon like the door of Moria. The dwarfs were not wimps hanging out by the door but engaged in full battle with Smaug in direct contradiction to anything that happened in the book. Orcs were given too much prominence. And totally unnecessary and boring love plots were introduced.<br/><br/>All that said, it wasn't a terrible film but in changing it so much to apparently make it more exciting, they lost most of the charm of the book. I don't think Peter Jackson's heart was in this one. I should have waited for the DVD and that says it all really."

As a lifelong fan of these books I have been awaiting every adaptation with huge anticipation. And with The lord of the rings you did such a perfect artwork, that the whole world was (and still is) at your feet. It is a true reconstruction of the whole tale. And even with the first Hobbit film you did a good, inspiring fantasy epic. But everything that you did right with the trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, you did wrong with the second one. I cannot imagine how I would've felt if there wasn't the scene between Smaug and Bilbo. The whole movie would have been pointless if it was bas as well. At least that scene was deserving. Of course that doesn't change the fact that you made up 2/3 of the story and characters from The Desolation of Smaug. Scenes, characters, relations - all out of space and sense. And why? Because the big bosses from the studios implied that they want more movies and money. Because cinema is a tool which can be perverted. But you can't do that to Sir Tolkien's imagination! His works are beyond time, beyond people or wealth. So that is why I would like to ask of you, Mr. Peter Jackson - please do the third one right (you have the materials). If not to us, the fans, you owe it to Tolkien's legacy."

The movie was a little dull in places--forced foreshadowing in the dialogue took away some of the mystery. Overall: if you loved the book you probably should wait for the DVD. If you never read the book, this is a fun adventure story that should have been given a different name."
"Robinio3000","4","14","25","19 December 2013"," A lot of action with very little sense
","I am a keen fan of Tolkien's books and when I was told this film was better than the previous one, I was excited for it. However both me and my girlfriend were extremely disappointed. What started out looking like quite a good film turned into one that had me looking at my watch and shaking my head wondering where on earth things were going.<br/><br/>The story starts how it ended - with our heroes being chased by a make believe Orc pack led by a guy who isn't even alive in the books. Okay, it makes things a bit more interesting I suppose. It turns the book from a quest into a chase. <br/><br/>The scene in the woods was very good, and true to the book for a change. The exit in the barrels was entertaining, despite the regenerating Orc pack and barrels (that Bombur manages to roll into despite previously crushing his own barrel). Although the side quest with the elves doesn't exist in the book, I can see why Jackson did it. Although the silly love triangle with the female elf and Kili makes little sense. <br/><br/>The film started to go wrong after Bilbo entered the mountain. The scene with Smaug was entertaining but it just went completely off the rails, it was almost laughable at times. Even for someone who hadn't read the books you could clearly point out everything that didn't even make sense. Why was Bilbo allowed to freely stand in front of the dragon without his ring on? Why did the dwarfs then enter the mountain, only to run down the stairs instead of back the way they came? Why could Smaug not smell the dwarfs despite crawling directly over the top of them? Smug then stands by dwarfs at several points without thinking to crush them which he could have so easily done. In fact how all the dwarfs made it out alive is nothing short of bizarre. Then Thorin rides an iron shield down a molten lake of gold (which is highly logical) and a solid gold statue turns to liquid for no apparent reason. Then finally, hurrah, the dragon does what he should have done half an hour ago, he goes to destroy the lake town. Phew. We got there eventually, despite the most uncomfortable 30 minutes of film I've ever sat through. <br/><br/>Seriously I do laugh at some of the reviews saying it is the film of the year. Even without reading the books you can see how utterly ridiculous some parts of the film are. It just didn't make sense most of the time. A real disappointment."

","I really enjoyed the first Hobbit film, and I was not disappointed by the second. This Hobbit film is darker than the first one, with the darker story, visit fights and even the desolate grayscale color scheme. The story drags on a little in the beginning, and I wondered where the magnificent scenes are. When the gang finally arrive at the mountain, I was completely blown away by the amazing visuals of the Dragon and its flames. The ending finale is a series of wows, as the flames, and the color change of the Dragon is very impressive. The ending elicited another wow from me, as it is so abrupt. I really thought and wish there was more after the ending. Do I really have to wait a year or two to find out what happens after?"

","The fellowship continue to flee from Orcs, but have to venture alone into Mirkwood(aka, the LSD forest - great sequence, if one of the only two that the increased pace renders rushed through). Gandalf(McKellan, wise and somewhat on his own) has to investigate the land's growing evil. When the dwarfs are discovered by the area's Elven, some secretly disregard the king Thranduil's(Pace, carrying his force with tremendous dignity) orders to stay behind and not run risks. Captain of the guard Tauriel(Lilly, gorgeous and taking matters into her own hands), perhaps because of her growing feelings for Fili(O'Gorman, sympathetic, and still attracted to these tall, gracious beings). Speaking of romance, Legolas(Bloom, still spot-on as the determined prince) goes with her as he is in love with her - however, not to his knowledge, his father refuses him marrying outside of hierarchy.<br/><br/>As this completes the transition into re-imagining(after the first was an adaptation with some added elements), it not only sets up the Lord of the Rings trilogy(serving as a prequel - and though this was not necessary, it is, in my opinion, quite welcome) much better than the original children's faerie tale did(or was ever intended to; for my money, this is much more enjoyable than its source, not feeling like it was made up as he went along, letting its theme of greed and selfishness being something that has to be overcome show more clearly through), it changes for the better pretty much the only things that the first one got wrong(not that I, personally, minded them). As such, the plot not only takes off immediately, it keeps moving throughout. The action never takes over. There are genuine consequences(power is corrupting... this is seen in our protagonists!), and rather than a series of unrelated events, this presents a definite chronology of events, with characters sticking around and being developed.<br/><br/>The most compelling of these, without a doubt, is Bard(Evans, a courageous, loving father), who takes on many roles, living up to all of them. There is a change of the weighing of humor and darkness, now in favor of the latter. We now begin to feel that this is a dangerous endeavor, one that may claim the lives of some of them. While FX tend to be CGI over practical, this never gets lost in them. Reaction shots, use of perspective and other approaches are employed to ensure that. The High Frame Rate will take your eyes(and rest them before and after, this does strain them some - it's worth it) 15 minutes to adjust to - and then you'll literally believe you can reach out and touch what you witness. And even if you won't go with that, make sure to watch this in 3D. Few things poke out at you(meaning they never lose the effect), and it further improves the amazing atmosphere, where every location feels distinct, with temperature and scents seemingly affecting you in the cinema. The scope is shown well, you appreciate size differences.<br/><br/>For those who wished they'd seen more of Smaug(Cumberbatch, making lines work when no one else could) in last year's film, this is for you. He doesn't show up for a while - trust me, you won't mind. We get such a satisfying taste of him, his massive physique, his danger, his manipulative nature. The cliffhanger ending does leave us hanging - excessively so. Dialog and acting are enthralling. Charm and mystery work well to draw us in, keeping each other in check so as to not let either overwhelm us. Bring your kids. Take your parents. There's something for everyone. This makes use of quick, loaded introductions - to people, places, beings, etc. Thus, a ton of detail and change can be implemented, making even the 160-ish minute running time packed with events. No, this is not An Unexpected Journey. That one set the scene. This? The real show. There are winks to those who've seen the previous trilogy already, and they are less on the nose. No one shows up to do nothing in this, we don't visit anywhere that nothing occurs in.<br/><br/>There is a lot of mild to moderate violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy, drama and grandeur. 9/10"
"shaw-austin96","4","11","19","21 December 2013"," Truly Unpleasant
","Overall, I liked An Unexpected Journey much less than the original Lord of the Rings movies, which were, to be fair, fantastic. This second installment began promisingly, but it declined quickly, and had the same serious issues that the first did. <br/><br/>There are pluses to this film, and I want to acknowledge them. Mirkwood was well done, and although I initially criticized the use of CGI for a forest, it in fact helped create the atmosphere of the forest. The midbending element of the forest's magic was a very interesting addition, and the spiders were great. The character Bard was a very good addition as well, and provided a much better protagonist than the greedy and arrogant Thorin. Laketown was well done and just as I imagined it. Erebor and Smaug were both well portrayed. <br/><br/>However, The Desolation of Smaug had difficulty, like the first, establishing what sort of mood and tone to set. It jumps from dark shots of the carcasses of slain dwarfs in Erebor to scenes of Disney-like battle choreography. The fight scenes in this film tend to be much goofier but also significantly more graphic and violent. In Mirkwood, there is a ""funny"" scene where the dwarfs gather around a spider and pull its legs off. Another time, an orc is catapulted up to a balcony, which provides a humorous setup, but Legolas follows up with a disgusting beheading that left an uncomfortable silence in the theater. Peter Jackson can't seem to reconcile the silliness of the children's book and the darkness he established in Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson also utilizes the same sort of situations that appear in Lord of the Rings and bring into question his versatility and originality as a writer. There are far too many times when one of the characters (whose voices are without exception deep and somber) will look into the distance and say something like ""darkness is growing"" or ""there is yet hope."" These meaningless clichés are thrown around so frequently that there is little time left for meaningful dialogue. The script hits rock bottom when someone says to Thorin, ""the dragon will kill you,"" and Thorin replies, ever so articulately and cleverly, ""not if I kill it first."" Jackson's main antagonist through most of the film is, yet again, Sauron, and new characters always warn the company about the growing threat of the Necromancer. It begins to sound tiresomely like the Lord of the Rings all over again. There are numerous other instances of repeated conflicts and character archetypes like the ""it is not our fight"" argument between races, the conniving, deceitful king's adviser, the character who nearly dies in combat but watches, in slow motion and in silence, someone come to their aid, the shot of a character climbing over yet another enormous ancient statue engraved into a mountain (the Secret Doorway my ass), etc.<br/><br/>A serious issue is the character Kili and his love situation with Tauriel. Kili becomes important in this film, and in fact becomes the object of affection of the new strong female character Tauriel. I do not object to the introduction of Tauriel - the story is undoubtedly dominated by men, but Tauriel's love for Kili is laughable. There is no believability or emotion there, and when Kili is poisoned by a Morgul blade (sound familiar? Apparently they are not so rare), no one cares. And no one in the audience cares to see the action of the climax interrupted by scenes of her healing him.<br/><br/>There are multiple other instances of nonsense and stupidity in the editing and writing of this film, but they are too numerous to list here. Instead I will detail to you the Desolation of Peter Jackson upon Smaug.<br/><br/>The movie begins to careen off of the tracks about five minutes after Bilbo enters the Lonely Mountain, and it crashes and burns in the final minutes. Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch both performed very well together, as Biblo desperately tries to flatter the probing and arrogant Smaug into letting him live. But then Peter Jackson took some creative liberties with the story that ultimately made no sense and destroyed the film. The dwarfs enter too, and they lead Smaug on a merry goose-chase, and the dragon is apparently incapable of keeping track of more than one group of dwarfs. It is embarrassing and stomach- churning to watch Smaug bumble after the scurrying dwarfs. When they finally lead Smaug down to the forges (where they obviously have the best chance of escape), they trick him into lighting them, and they pour molten gold into carven rivulets. The dragon is still struggling to detain his pesky intruders, when he finally corners Bilbo and several of the dwarfs at the end of a hall. But they're standing on some large stone structure, which they tear apart to reveal an enormous cast gold statue of a dwarf. Smaug gazes at it greedily, but then the eye of the dwarf pops out and the statue melts and Smaug nearly drowns in the boiling metal. This bizarre and completely senseless ending put the nail in the coffin of this hopeless movie. And it was the last thing that happened before the abrupt ending, which cuts the movie with a ""what have we done?"" by poor little Bilbo. Right, you are, Bilbo."
"andresmgv","1","26","53","28 December 2013"," Not only a bad version of the Hobbit, but also a bad movie
","Let's try to summarize things (bad and good) in a clean way -Decent special effects, even if it's overloaded with CGI. -Decent acting by the main characters. However, most of them don't get too much development. Actually, I didn't care to much about them because they were all the time running around escaping from something. Some other reviewer mentioned that he didn't even remember who was the dwarf that got stranded in the lake town or why he should care about him. That's exactly the same feeling I got. -This is important: although I haven't read the book, I've been told by someone who did read and does love the book, that the story simply contains too much unnecessary filler that IS NOT on the book (like the love story between Tauriel and Kili, both of which I think are characters invented by Peter Jackson's team). -Adding this love story makes the movie probably more targeted to teenagers in need of romanticism, but it's totally unfaithful to the book.<br/><br/>The general feeling is that they tried to fill three movies three hours long by adding a lot of fan(director) fiction, that doesn't have anything to do with the book and in the meantime they forgot to tell a lot of things that really were in the book. <br/><br/>OK, so, it's a bad rendition of the book, but the main problem is that it's also an awfully boring movie. One hour into the film I was already looking at the time impatiently, and I fell asleep for half an hour after that, only to wake up and discover that nothing of importance had happened.<br/><br/>Final note: don't let yourself be fooled by the (in my opinion) numerous fake reviews that inflate the score of this movie. It's a tendency I've seen in the last year, that a lot of people is probably being paid to post ridiculously good reviews just to make others watch the movie while it's still on theaters."
"mjgcae","4","10","17","21 December 2013"," It IS possible to love your material too much ...

Instead, we tries to tell THIS story on an epic scale, and The Hobbit got lost somewhere in the process.<br/><br/>The other problem with over-extending the story on such a bloated scale is more basic. It is now a play in three acts ... three mammoth acts of 2-3 hours each, with intermissions of a year or more between each act. <br/><br/>Act One was all exposition. It isn't really until this movie (Act Two) that you begin to provide the true basis of drama: conflict and suspense. And the results are better than in the first movie ... but ultimately disappointing. 160 minutes spent at a breakneck pace to create complications and difficulties for every character and subplot ... NONE of which are brought to dramatic resolution. It is all tease, no pay off. All cliff hanger. For that, we will have to wait ANOTHER year for part three."

The acting is OK, the Tolkien parts of the script is awesome, and the added stuff is really cheesy. Animations are pretty good. Smaug could look more scary and less Jar-Jar. Some of the dwarfs should tone it down a bit. Some of them should look like dwarfs.<br/><br/>But for me, who read Tolkiens works as a child, and who loved them dearly, it was just frustrating to watch this. They didn't stop at adding stuff, they even changed events from the book.

"mwp-036","3","5","7","10 January 2014"," Very disappointing, especially for fans of the original
","For people who have not read the book: 6 stars (OK, not great) For those who have read the book: 1 star (awful)<br/><br/>This movie was, to put it bluntly, meh. <br/><br/>First of all, I'm a die-hard Tolkien fan. I've read the Lord of the Rings series several times, and the Hobbit several more. I've read the Silmarillion, and even some of Tolkien's non-canonical works that were published posthumously by his son. To me, the Lord of the Rings movie series were almost perfect. Although they deviated from the plot in (mostly) minor ways, they portrayed the spirit of the books exceedingly well, and had amazing special effects and great actors/actresses. <br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was very good as well. It annoyed me a bit that they added the white orc and some other (seemingly) minor details, but it's Hollywood and they have the right to take certain liberties. <br/><br/>However, the Desolation of Smaug was ridiculous. It's pretty good as a movie, and I'm sure people who haven't read the books will enjoy it. However, if you know anything at all about the original story, you'll know that this is not it. The vast majority of the movie had absolutely nothing to do with the book. At the very beginning, the company arrives at Beorn's house. Beorn was one of my favorite characters in the book, but I couldn't help hating him in the movie. Later, the company escapes from the elves in barrels. There was no fight in the book, but the movie takes a solid ten minutes or more as we watch Bombur bounce along the shore, killing orcs every time he lands, while Legolas, a female elf (I forget her name) and the rest of the dwarfs fight against orcs sent to kill the dwarfs. Arriving in Lake Town, the dwarfs are once again attacked by orcs who invade the city while Kili almost dies from a poisoned arrow wound. Eventually Thorin and company leave for the mountain, leaving four of the dwarfs behind in Lake Town. After Bilbo sneaks into the mountain, the dwarfs actually fight Smaug.<br/><br/>None of these things happened in the book, though they are a large majority of the movie. Many of the fights seem completely over the top and unrealistic, even for a fantasy movie. There is a strange romance going on with Kili and the elf lady, which seems to be just thrown in, in hopes of attracting more of the sentimental audience. The fight with Smaug never happened, and even the scene with the spiders was completely different from the book. They also left out several important parts from the book, and very little of the original plot remains. <br/><br/>All in all, it seemed like the movie was just haphazardly thrown together with no thought for the story or for any sort of continuity. It's as if the producers just thought ""yes, we're making a movie about the Hobbit, but Tolkien didn't know what he was doing, we can write something SOOO much BETTER!!!"" and then failed miserably. It would have been a ten-star movie if they had simply stuck to the plot of the book. It also appears as if they really just wanted to show off their fantastic special effects in whatever way possible, so they added a ton of random unnecessary fights, including a massive battle between Smaug and the dwarfs. Or rather, between Smaug and 9 of the dwarfs, since they left four behind. This is completely out of character, and it makes Thorin out to be a much more selfish and uncaring person than he is. The only redeeming factor in this movie is Bilbo. Martin Freeman does an excellent job portraying this little Hobbit who is slowly finding his courage. <br/><br/>The only explanation I can think of is that the directors and producers wanted to make this movie a prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is not a prequel, it is an almost completely unrelated story. But I'm sure they thought they could make more money from a prequel for fans who haven't read the books and wouldn't know any better. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: read the book. This movie is OK if you don't compare it to the book, but it's not great. And when compared to Tolkien's work, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug looks like a mockery. I hope they do better on the next one, but I am quickly losing my faith in this trilogy. As an avid Tolkien fan, I was severely disappointed."
"Leardriver512","5","5","7","29 December 2013"," Disappointing..
","Although an OK movie as movies go, it was a let down to those expecting any relevance to the original story. I was impressed by the first of the Hobbit trilogy because the amount of creative license was acceptable. It stayed within the original plot and story. The Desolation of Smaug took that license way too far. It shifted the original plot of the book so far askew that I am not sure I will even go see the last of the trilogy. I see no way to turn the 3rd episode back to even remotely regain the magic of the original story. This was just another movie, lots of CGI and action. Thank goodness it is full of decent actors because otherwise it would be just another cheap imitation. I was really let down Peter Jackson sold out on this. Up until this movie, the series was a wonderful rendition of a great book. This was just another movie, the magic is gone.<br/><br/>P.S. Maybe Elves age backwards because Legolas sure looked a lot older in this than he did in the Lord of the Rings. A small detail but, well, doesn't make it any easier to accept the other disappointments."

But if you want to see Tolkien's book brought to screen, even the 1977 animation movie is better choice than Peter Jackson's effort.<br/><br/>Essentially, this movie can be described as Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) that meets Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy (2004) in a world imagined by J.R.R.

","THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG 12/25/13<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, the wonderful maestro of the magical world of Middle Earth has now directed THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the second in a trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's great novel The Hobbit, prequel to The Lord of The Rings, and it is another big budget film, and more importantly to the studios and its investors, a huge successful moneymaker. Looking at the closing credits took at least 15 minutes – filled with name upon name of all those involved in the making of this spectacular ""much of the same"" and for me alas a yawning bore of a cinema experience.<br/><br/>My problem with the film is that it felt like last year's model, the territory including the mood and ""light"" is visually too familiar. The landscape and special effects are panoramic, both natural and artificial – products of the digital age we live in - filled with fierce, snarling animals, teeth bared accompanying equally vicious and savage creatures called Orcs, along with gigantic spiders weaving viscous entangling webs, and a rapacious fire-breathing flying dragon, Smaug – of the title - who resides in The Lonely Mountain protecting his copious bounty of purloined coins and jewels.<br/><br/>Despite the inclusion of many of the same actors such as Gandalf the Wizard (a bit more bedraggled Ian McKellan) who can still conjure up enchanted divinations, and the beautiful Orlanda Bloom, heroic as ever as an Elvin Prince, I felt confused by the addition of characters that were never in the original book. I can accept a director creating composites in their screenplays that diverge from the book, but this time it was at the expense of the wonderful Bilbo Baggins (delightfully played by an often bewildered Martin Freeman,) the brave Hobbit who reluctantly again leads a band of 13 dwarfs on their urgent quest to reclaim their homeland, the dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the overlord of Middle Earth, Smaug, the green- eyed, molten bellied monstrosity, at any moment primed to expectorate flames annihilating all those who step into his realm. Unfortunately, Bilbo's humanity disappears in the CGI effects, and for much of this barely under three-hour movie, he is an ancillary personage in the plot. One inclusion I did respond to was that of a female Elfin warrior Tauriel (lovely Evangeline Lilly,) who is excellent at her craft and refreshingly human, inserted into this practically all-male cast to attract female audiences, creating a whisper of a possible ""interspecies"" romance.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part of THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG addresses the age-old question of isolationism vs. interventionism in the face of dictatorial chieftains preparing to expand their territory. Absolute power vs. the exploited; tribal factions, self-interest, and ethnic purity with its accompanying disdain for the ""other,"" are still recognizable in our contemporary universe. The grab for world superiority aligned with the corrupting dominance of lucre is never-ending, and the fictional Middle Earth is no exception."
"harryb1705","6","5","7","14 December 2013"," The most disappointing movie in history (for the reader of the book)
","Now let me start of by saying that the movie itself is not terrible! I actually kind of enjoyed the movie, but there were some severely dis- heartening parts to it for someone who has read the book multiple times since a very young age.<br/><br/>PROLOGUE- Let me begin with how the movie starts. We're thrust into a flashback to the night Gandalf and Thorin met, which was actually a very good scene, but what is it doing at the beginning of the second film? It definitely felt like something that should have been at the beginning of the the first instalment.<br/><br/>BEORN- Then we pick up right where we left off! the gang are escaping Azog and his pack who is still hunting them, as well as this mysterious bear figure...Us book readers will know this is Beorn. In the book the scenes with beorn are actually quite long, the hobbits stay and chat to him for quite a long time and they also have a feast that is organized by animals under his control. YET, none of this was used in the film! his scene was very short lived and rushed and to top it off, he looked bad as well! more like something that belonged in the Narnia universe than middle earth.<br/><br/>MIRKWOOD- After Beorn's house we're treated to a quick (less than 2 minutes) small shot sequence of them travelling on horse back, and then they're almost immediately at mirkwood! at this point I wasn't letting the rush bother me too much because I thought mirkwood would be a long winded part of the movie! I was so wrong, it started off well, with the gang following the path and having to stop and move leaves to fin it again BUT,once the y lose the track of good, we're treated to another short shot sequence of them acting all hight and tripping out (Yes they did completely miss out the magical river). Then we reach the point with the spiders! which is probably my favourite part of the whole book, its a huge part in the book! that emphasizes that Bilbo is starting to change, in the film it does this but nowhere near as well, not too much to say about this scene, it was enjoyable in both book and film, but lacked detail in the film! it was also nice to see bilbo naming his sword.<br/><br/>ELF KINGDOM/BARRELS- I have no negative comments to say about the wood elf kingdom, and the barrel escape! both scenes were excellent and matched my imaging of them from reading the book many years ago.<br/><br/>LAKE TOWN- I enjoyed the laketown scenes in the beginning! it looked just as I had imagined. the characters were all as expected too, one thing I didn't like was when we constantly returned there to check on Kili who had been wounded and did not go with the rest of the gang, along with Fili and bofur.<br/><br/>EREBOR- Here's where I was willing to forget everything else and enjoy the hell out of the movie! the entire part of the movie that takes part in erebor is amazing! smaug and bilbo's dialogue is great and felt so much like the book! the dwarfs plotting against smaug and trying their best to outwit and kill him, ALL AMAZING!.<br/><br/>ENDING- The amazing erebor scene was soon destroyed, when the ending so abruptly and poorly placed came into existence. Smaug takes off from the mountain and heads to lay waste to laketown (another amazing part of the book)""I am fire, I am death"" by smaug was the perfect build up to the destruction, yet we were fed a line from bilbo ""what have we done"" and then credits.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'm very aware that PJ cannot put all of the book into the movies! but he misses out some really good detail in some of the best parts! so to finish things off, a very good film with a rushed beginning a nice amazingly enjoyable bulky middle and a indescribably disappointing ending."

It stays pretty true to the book, and the areas where it doesn't, seem justified. Most notably, it varies from the book in the perception of time passing. In the book, everything takes forever. The whole journey takes years, and they stop for long periods of time at every location. In the movie, everything is fast paced and exciting and there is no lull. It feels like it all happens fairly quickly, in a period of a few months of something.<br/><br/>I am also a big fan of Jackson's LOTR films, but I can honestly say, that I like the Hobbit films as much or more than LOTR. Elijah Wood in particular, but also Pip and Merry, always bothered me a bit. I think he is a great actor, but there is something about him that feels awkward to me. The actors in The Hobbit are all really great and well cast and I love watching them.<br/><br/>The movies are long, with lots packed in, great production design, and lots to look at. This gives it great re-watch-ability, and, like LOTR, I can watch these movies over and over again without getting bored. In fact, I can't think of many other films that I can watch as many times as Peter Jackson films. LOTR, The Hobbit, and King Kong are all great movies to throw on at any time. I tend to put these movies on when I'm doing something else and tune in and out.<br/><br/>I'm really excited for the fifth installment to come out, because I think they will all flow together very seamlessly as a whole.<br/><br/>I feel that these movies will truly stand the test of time, and those who criticize them now will eventually come around and realize how great they are."

","This is the first review I have written for IMDb, I couldn't sit silently after last night's film experience...<br/><br/>I was appalled at the liberties taken by the screenwriters. I understand why: it was a great financial idea to add back story and characters that would stretch this endeavor into an audience inclusive three part cash cow.<br/><br/>What I couldn't understand is why I couldn't identify more than 10 minutes out of 160 that actually matched Tolkein's story. <br/><br/>Beorn, The Spiders, The Elves of Mirkwood, Laketown, The Lonely Mountain - not a single scene filmed as written. I have seen truer adaptations of The Hobbit performed by children at local community centers. <br/><br/>The special effects are spectacular - but I can say that about dozens of movies that didn't have to rape a well loved piece of literature to make it to the screen.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't walk out of this film is that I went with my wife and friends."

Part II is everything Part 1 was not -- a non-stop adventure that compares with the best rides at Disneyworld, especially in 3D. The barrel scene is unforgettable. Smaug clearly has Shakespearean training -- a very educated dragon, he -- and Cumberbatch does a better job here than in Star Trek; Ian McKellen was born to play Gandolf, there is no makeup on earth than can substitute for a face with life experience. This was an almost perfect film, save for the last 60 seconds, when they essentially advertise the next instalment. In 3D raindrops are as big as bees and bees as big as raindrops.

A lot of the scenes in the movie have only bare bones resemblance with the book. This, however, isn't a surprise, as the first movie altered the narrative from the book quite a bit. So you either roll with it and are okay with the changes, or you cringe your teeth. I rolled with em', as the movie itself is good.<br/><br/>Just like the first movie, I saw this one in HFR as well. I must say, that during the first film of the series I had some issues with the quality, but now it looks like most of the small issues have been cleaned aside.<br/><br/>Like the Two Towers, Desolation of Smaug has no real ending. Afer all is said and done, the movie comes into sudden stop, where, I assume, the third, and the last, movie will continue straight on.<br/><br/>DoS is very entertaining, well crafted movie.

The irrelevant extensive additions to the original story add nothing at all, including the ridiculous over-long computer game-esque fight and chase sequences. I admired Jackson for Brain Dead but what he did to the trilogy was smear audience capture clichés all over it after removing far more relevant elements of the story. He has done that here in spades in order to spin it out and keep costs down. Why bother with a plot when you can have another fight sequence or another chase. I'm really, really, really glad I did not pay to watch this and felt very let down by its greedy stupidity after it was lifted from a pretty good yarn by Tolkien. Never mind the complete alteration of a great plot to provide a three letter word guide for the dumdums who managed to sit through the trilogy listening to the ghastly fake Celtic music.

What could only be called the super powers displayed by the elves as they slaughter orges left and right actually pulled me out of the movie. It really gave off a video game vibe to me. Also, the chapter feel has grown tired because yet again they don't end the film but rather set up the finale.

I'd love to see some deeper information about each and every one of the dwarfs as someone who didn't read the books have zero clues about who they are besides the little info given occasionally throughout the movie + the scene at Bilbo's home in the first flick. <br/><br/>Tons of ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-styled goofs, few noteworthy scenes, flashing camera angles and an out of the air-love story between the filler character Tauriel and one of the dwarfs.<br/><br/>I have no clue as how to this movie managed to achieve this kind of IMDb score."

","To be honest I did not expect much from this movie. It was clear to me from the beginning that The Hobbit"" is too short a book to be made into three separate movies. And it shows. Not much happens in Desolation of Smaug"". Our heroes meet some elves, among them our hero from LOTR, Legolas who is at this time of his life very different character but that's OK. Then our hero fight some orks, some spiders and finally reach the Lake City which I must say is nicely thought out, we didn't have this kind of architecture or culture in LOTR. There we have the exact scene from The Fellowship"" when a female elf saves our dwarfish hero from certain death from a poisonous Morgul-arrow. Then they go to the Lonely Mountain where they fight Smaug, but are unable to defeat him. He escapes and flies to the Lake City in order to destroy it. That's about it. Hopefully the third installment of the series will be better then this, but who knows? The movie is not a complete waste of time but unfortunately all that happens, all the sound and fury in the end doesn't signifies anything."

","I enjoyed the first film, though it may have been long, I was still left fulfilled when I left the cinema. So of course I was excited for the sequel and boy was I disappointed.<br/><br/>It all just felt rushed. The characters didn't seem to have much about them and the story itself was filled with (seemingly) pointless subplots. I have never read The Hobbit myself so I wouldn't know if all of this was necessary, but to me it seemed irrelevant.<br/><br/>The one positive thing I will say about The Desolation of Smaug is that the special effects were spot on and the dragon looked immense as well as the action being pretty decent itself."

","I was disappointed. <br/><br/>The story picks up with... wait, how did the last one end? It was so long ago. And then they go to Lonely Mountain. Something about the dwarfs, apparently. There's some trouble on the way, but Bilbo bails them out. More trouble, more Bilbo saving the day. More trouble... you get the idea. Predictable should have this movie next to the entry in the dictionary.<br/><br/>Special effects were sometimes really good (the light vs. dark battle), and sometimes head-shakingly poor. The barrel ride down the river was cartoonish and completely unbelievable - apparently barrels can go completely underwater and come up without any water in them. I was literally shaking my head watching that scene, it was so bad.<br/><br/>I lost count of how many Orcs an Elf can kill in one second without getting a scratch, or slowing down the Orcs. I also got tired of the 'slay the orcs' choreography. It was a grind - like playing a poorly designed flash game.<br/><br/>And then there's the story. I like a movie that has a story line, preferably involving characters that we get to know a bit along the way. This was more like a string of special effects shot, with a plot line - no plot, just a line. I like Tolkein because of the story. He was a story teller. This movie did not tell a story. Things happened in a sequence, but nothing really developed along the way.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie as much as the first. I tried to like it. But my advice for this one: wait until it comes out in the 3-part DVD set."

"Likes_Ninjas90","5","6","9","23 December 2013"," Hopefully There and Back Again is a tighter film, with stronger character development and fewer magic doors
","We're two down and one film to go in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. The Desolation of Smaug wasn't screened to media outlets in the much criticised High Frame Rate format that tainted An Unexpected Journey. This mode will be available to the public but seeing the film in the standard 3D aesthetic is a treat. The 3D visuals are clear and unintrusive and there is occasionally a selective 3D long shot that provides depth to some of the narrow spaces of Middle-earth, such as the entrance of a spooky forest. Some of the early monsters that Bilbo Baggins (reprised by Martin Freeman) confronts are also scarier and feel more dangerous due to the tight close-ups, like a giant spider that gnashes its fangs in the forefront of the frame. In the final quarter, the dragon Smaug emerges as an astonishing visual achievement, with believable heft and weight provided by Benedict Cumberbatch's booming baritone voice and piercing eyes, as much as the superbly detailed computer animations. <br/><br/>Yet a scene where Bilbo sees a glorious sunset, before he is pulled back into the entangled branches of the forest, epitomises the way the beauties of this world are lost inside a numbingly bloated combat movie. For as much as Smaug is a technical improvement over its predecessor, the screenplay is still disappointingly shallow and the pacing is glacial. Unlike The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where a poignant friendship forged the heart of the story, Peter Jackson's Hobbit films have no thematic goals or subtext that can transcend good and evil. His chief concerns are the countless ways that he can decapitate Orc monsters and finding new reasons to enslave and then free Bilbo, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) and the other dwarfs. Each of the narrative's episodes are written around elaborate, overstretched action set pieces, such as barrel riding down a river, where plausible physics are gleefully disregarded, ultimately minimising the damage and dramatic tension faced by Bilbo and his fellowship.<br/><br/>Although less linear than the previous film and opening multiple subplots, the script is extremely light on characterisation. The opening scenes look promising because the once reserved Bilbo is now becoming possessed by the powers of the One Ring. It makes him hungrier and greedier but the internal conflict goes unexplored. Bilbo and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) are the series' two best characters but they're also marginalised by side stars that are difficult to care about. Jackson and his three co-writers (including Guillermo del Toro) needlessly continue to import characters from The Lord of the Rings, even though they aren't in Tolkien's original story, and invent new ones too. Elven archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom) makes an unwelcome return in an unnecessary, boring love triangle involving himself, a newly written ninja-like archer named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Kili (Aidan Turner), a wounded dwarf. This thread makes the narrative painfully slow and flabby, while the film's quietest moments are burdened by such gloomy clunkers as ""with every victory this evil will grow"" and ""the enemy is preparing for war"". <br/><br/>The scene I liked best in the film is Bilbo's confrontation with Smaug inside the Lonely Mountain. This is a powerful sequence and beautifully framed. It opens with a wide shot of the dragon's lair littered with gold and then the camera tightens onto the sleeping dragon's twitching eye. The scene works because rather than throwing us into mindless combat, it forces us to imagine the very worst for Bilbo so that's it's suspenseful and psychologically inevitable. Yet typical of the film, it becomes too much of a good thing. It is also interrupted by Peter Jackson's insistence on expanding the universe by rudely cutting back to the side stories. Despite an admittedly sharp cliff-hanger ending, it is the tardiness of the story and the deliberate, unresolved turgidness of this series in general which lingers more than any desire for another three hour film about the dwarfs reclaiming their real-estate. Hopefully There and Back Again is a tighter film, with stronger character development and fewer magic doors."
"freemantle_uk","8","6","9","14 December 2013"," The return of the darkness
","The first entry of The Hobbit trilogy was met with a mixed reaction by some, being too light, too comic and too long. The second film, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the shortest movie in the series, strives for a much darker tone and begins to weave many of the trilogies plot lines together.<br/><br/>Thorin (Richard Armitage), Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the company of Dwarfs continuing their quest to The Lonely Mountain, in order to defeat the dragon Smaug (Bendict Cumberbatch) and reclaim the throne of Erebor. On their perilous journey through Mirkwood, the company end up clashing with the Elves, led by King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) of Lake-town. These two characters are but a few that hinder their journey before the final day of Autumn. A creature known as The Necromancer (also Cumberbatch) is summoning Orcs to the ruins of Dol Guldur, forcing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to also face the new threat.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a movie that contains sub-plots galore. Outside the main plot, involving the Dwarfs, Gandalf cleanses Dol Guldur, Thranduil attempts to shelter his people in his borders, the political rivalries between Bard and The Master of Lake-town (Stephen Fry), Bilbo suffering from the effects of The Ring, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), the Captain of the Thranduil, guards wanting the elves to face the Orc threat and a love triangle between Taureil, Thranduil's son Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Kili the dwarf (Aiden Turner). That a is a lot to handle even for a film that is 161 minutes long and for someone of Peter Jackson's previous experience in Middle Earth, some of the subplots get sidelined. The subplot involving Bilbo's corruption and hearing voices in his head is a presence at the beginning movie, but is ignored later on.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is short novel and straight adaptation would have been a 2 hour, 30 minute movie. To add to the movie the screenplay supplement with the use of appendixes in The Lord of the Rings, some elements of the Unfinished Tales collection of short stories and the filmmakers own creative license. Tauriel is an original character created solely for the movie and Legolas had no role in the timeline. The events in Lake-town were also greatly altered from the original novel.<br/><br/>Unlike previous entries in the Lord of the Rings series The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the first time we look at the North of Middle-Earth. The tensions and policies are explored and showing that the Elf kingdom is insular and does not want to get involved with the wider world and the people of Lake-town are divided. Anti-dwarf prejudice is touched on, as dwarfs are seem as greedy, selfish and short-sighted and only one level above Orcs.<br/><br/>One of the big themes is greed and lust; both for wealth and power. There is physical manifestation with Bilbo starting to see himself and savagely killing a spider, the Master of Lake Town seeking wealth and power, leading to the mismanagement of the town, Smaug not wanting to give up any his ill gotten gains. Thorin also suffers from greed, which affect his judgement, his relationships with his comrades and is forewarned that he could end up like his grandfather.<br/><br/>There is plenty of energy in the movie's action sequences, the highlight being the river chase as the Orcs, Dwarfs and Elves are in a battle, filled with decapitations and arrows to Orcs' heads. Both Legolas and Tauriel are given plenty of chances to show their action credentials, though since this is a prequel we know that Legolas is immune from any perky incidents like an axe to the head. The final battle with Smaug is also ramped up from the book, giving Bilbo and the Dwarfs a larger role.<br/><br/>The first act and the third act are great with its pacing, action and character development. Its the middle of the movie that The Desolation of Smaug slows down, a little too much. This is the case of the events in Lake-town as the Dwarfs try to prepare for the final leg of their journey. It is at this point when Bilbo does not have much of a presence in his own movie.<br/><br/>The Dwarfs are give more chance to shine this time role. In the first Hobbit movie, Ken Stott and James Nesbit were the Dwarfs with the most screen time: in the sequel Graham McTavish as Dwalin was more noticeable with his aggression, Kili is given a background and even the silent Bombur (Stephen Hunter) is shown to be very strong despite his weight problem.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug will give fans their Middle-Earth and is successful at solving some of the issues of the first Hobbit movie. The tone is darker and the action is much less cartoony. The Hobbit is proof of being the pinnacle of the fantasy genre and this second film still proves that.<br/><br/>Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com"

They depicted The Hobbit as a prequel of Lord of the Rings with the same atmosphere, fights and frightens though The Hobbit is a book for children. As they did before in The Lord of the Rings they cut too much to introduce concepts, stories and people never occurred in the books. The films should report ""loosely based on the books by J.R.R.

It's a very tough act to follow and regrettably they are not living up to the Rings movies.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is good in the role of Bilbo, but the plot is a bit all over the place. There are battles every few minutes, but the character development which was so well done in the Rings is largely overlooked in the Hobbit. Consequently the battle scenes which are well done contain very little in the way of emotional involvement. You really don't care that much who wins and loses. It feels like Peter Jackson as got too concerned with the look of the film and forgot a little about the plot!"
"odin5491","4","7","11","12 January 2014"," Fire and Bombast, Cartoonery and Schmaltz
","The first face one sees in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is neither Bilbo's nor Thorin's nor Gandalf's, but director Peter Jackson's, munching a carrot and peeking from the dark streets of Bree directly into the camera. The sight of him jolted me right out of Middle Earth. It was as if the film had started with Jackson cavorting centre screen in jester's guise, bellowing, ""Gotcha, sucker!"".<br/><br/>And the more I think about this film, the more I feel I've been had. Jackson's Middle Earth cycle has plummeted from the epic high fantasy of The Two Towers to, in Desolation, cartoonery and schmaltz. The action scenes are neither spectacular nor exciting; most are simply silly, flouting the laws of physics and full of the tedious gyrations of Jackson's Indestructible Ninja Elves. (How many consecutive kill shots can you count?) The few attempts at interpersonal communication attempted by the screenplay are drowned by the soundtrack; the musical themes that were apt in Fellowship now seem so overwrought and familiar that they have become parodies of themselves.<br/><br/>Not that the screenplay needed much help to, well, suck. I do not care whether Jackson alters or pads Tolkein's source material. But I do care (at least £25 worth, which is what I paid to see this movie in Odeon's over-hyped ""iSense"" high-frame rate 3D), that Jackson's liberties are so frequently implausible. I just do not buy, for example, that the wary elves of Mirkwood allowed platoons of orcs (judging by the number of them dispatched by the aforementioned Ninja Elves during the fatuous barrel-riding sequence) to pass within spitting distance of their front door, then cross the forest undetected to launch a surprise attack on the elves' river gate.<br/><br/>And a ""morgul shaft""? Really, Peter? Used by an orc? It's bad enough that you're repeating yourself with the whole back-lit she-elf morgul-healer thing. But at least come up with a reason for it that makes sense, instead of simply parroting Tolkeinisms from Fellowship that, apparently, you never really understood. Orcs are the donkey's asses of the evil army. I presume you know this, Peter, as the orcs in Desolation (with, perhaps, two exceptions) exist only to commit gleeful and pointless suicide upon the weapon of any available adversary. Orcs do not casually spray about any sort of rare and powerful magic arrow, let alone anything ""morgul"". The Witch King, so degraded, must be mad as hell.<br/><br/>There are some good things. The moment when Smaug's hoard slides away from beneath Bilbo's feet to reveal the dragon's eye is the best in the movie, and Smaug is easily the best movie dragon to date. But flaws infect even these good things. Smaug's hoard is suspiciously homogeneous, as if it were not accumulated but instead manifested whole from piles of digitally cloned gold coins. (Ahem.) And Smaug proves to be totally combat ineffective: The dragon goes nuclear on Thorin and company, yet fails to so much as singe a single dwarven beard.<br/><br/>Perhaps Smaug's martial impotence reflects the film as a whole. For all its frenzy, bombast and fire, one can only roll one's eyes, and hope they do better next time."

","A hardcore Tolkien fan (as in read all of the HoME!) for some twenty years, I have an uneasy relationships with Peter Jackson's films based on Tolkien's works. While I did not like the Lord of the Rings movies for straying from the books while still pretending to be faithful to them, I loved the first Hobbit film for being a fun adventure movie that did not even pretend to follow its literary source. It was not perfect, but it grabbed and held attention enough for me to overlook its flaws.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug felt... like a high schooler's standard pattern essay transferred to the big screen. I had two problems with it. The first one is that action sequences were too long and repetitive, to the point of being boring (and I generally like pure action movies!). I would cut each major action sequence in half... The second one is how predictable it is. Here is an exposition tying this moment to what's coming next, there is a direct quote from the LotR movies, here is some other way to tie it to LotR... I don't like being force-fed information in such an obvious fashion, though some people apparently found all the tie-ins to LotR endearing...<br/><br/>An interesting thing was, right after I walked out of the theater, I though it was a pretty good and entertaining movie, then I started to mostly focus on the flaws. A week later I saw it again for the ""final"" opinion - and again, sitting in the theater during the movie I thought that perhaps I was unfair to the movie and it is actually pretty good... but then the next day I could not remember any positives, only the flaws.<br/><br/>To me it felt... insubstantial. A cinematic pulp fiction of sorts...<br/><br/>I think if I were a 10-12 year old boy who has not read Tolkien but watched LotR movies, I would have absolutely loved it. But I am none of those things, which is why I give it 4/10.

","jackson has turned the entire hobbit story into a chase scene. the hobbit story had many entertaining scenes that involve word play and other devices. for example, in the story, when bilbo is noticed by smaug, he creates riddles to put him off from the truth. in the movie, they make Smaug omniscient, and the whole scene is reduced to yet another chase scene. <br/><br/>Also, it was a bad idea to add the extraneous material about the coming invasion of mordor. After LOTR, it made sense for Tolkien to add this material in references later. but inserted inside the hobbit story, it just slows down, and muddles the story. I think jackson has shown he is a hack, and many of his decisions were made to maximize profits. I won't be seeing the last of this ""trilogy""."

But i still have no idea who any of them are, or what they bring to the table. <br/><br/>Not a single character is interesting. I don't care about anyone and one moment the dwarfs are useless, then in the next they are a one man army in a Naked gun film.

","Finally part two of "" The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. I have waited one year for this --- and all I get is this crap?<br/><br/>To put it mildly. I am really disappointed. IT's almost like a heartbreak.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is about when the Hobbit and the 12 dwarfs Oin , Gloin , Ori , Dori , Nori , Fili , Kili , Bifur , Bofur , Bombur , Dvalin , Balin and Thorin Oakenshield has been put down on the Carrock fleeing towards the house of Beorn. And it is a blow in the face. Beorn is almost non-existing. This vital piece of information cut away with a machete? <br/><br/>Sure, I understand that one can not follow a book to the letter , when to retell it in a movie , even a third movie where every part is about two and a half hours . But when you cut the important parts from the story while writing new plots into the film it detaches completely from the book.<br/><br/>When saying that Jackson has written new plot , I do not mean the presentation of the female forest-elf Tauriel . I have nothing against that . Nor Gandalfs trip to Dol Guldur - and the meeting with a familiar evil - which we in the "" Lord of the Rings "" gets to know as Sauron.<br/><br/>The unnecessary editing of orcs into Esgaroth and the wood-elf-realm, is merely stupid. There is no excuse for it. <br/><br/>Certainly there are great special effects with the dragon Smaug - but unnecessary . Smaug never chases the dwarfs inside the mountain , and there is never any question about rebooting forges in the mountains. And what happens to the significant debate between Smaug and Bilbo?<br/><br/>This is an appropriate place to end this chapter on, which Jackson also understood . But why on earth he let one of the dwarfs ( Fili ... or was it Kili ) be hurt by a Morgul arrow , which requires that he must have king's foil - athelas to become healthy again just makes a silly point - this is part of the story that belongs in the "" Lord of the Rings "" when Frodo is wounded by a Morgul blade from one of the "" nine "" ringwraiths . The whole thing is just sad . [ He did the same in King Kong by mixing bullshit monsters into the action and have not learned from the mistakes he made then​​] .<br/><br/>The only thing I can hope for is that any extended version of the film re-edit can undo damage by removing nonsense - and get the real story in place. Sorry , Peter Jackson, I can not and will give you more than a five ( 5) for this chapter."
"clivemcgee-74112","4","2","2","22 January 2019"," Review and critical overview
","'The Desolation of Smaug', in which the Head of the 'Thorin Mining Corporation' and a bunch of disgruntled ex employees and a hobbit continue their attempt to get back the company that was taken from them in a ruthless takeover by the 'Smaug Group'. If they succeed in this enterprise, Smaug is sitting on so much gold that if released into the Global 'Middle Earth' Economy, would result in an economic meltdown of such proportions that it would most likely bring all powerful 'Sauron Enterprises' and it's associated conglomerates to it's knees. The fallout of all which, might mean that even the faraway shires could find itself inundated with unemployed Orcs looking for work, with all the associated unpleasantness associated with that. I mean Orcs don't seem very happy at the best of times.<br/><br/>I can see the practical and financial logic why they've bulked out the slim volume that is 'The Hobbit', I just oh so wished they hadn't. They could have made this a tight, fun, ordinary length film, but they didn't. And because of that although the Hobbit is a prequel, it feels cinematically like a sequel to me, like it should be called 'LOTR Reloaded' or 'LOTR Sauron Strikes back'. The trouble is, is that this film is a corporate entity, it is financed by them, it's execution is corporate in nature and it's themes, although admittedly critical, are corporate as well, which my initial jokey 1st paragraph reflected.<br/><br/>Since writing this 'review. I watched the the last one... oh dear. A shabby world war was about to occur between the feuding middle-earthers, when in stormed the Orcs to turn this rather squalid tale into something like a 'just war'. Oh those Orcs ! Those middle earth Dalek equivalents were one of the main beefs I had with this film. Orcs and their sidekicks are one dimensional things - They have - No back story - No family - No ecology - And are relentlessly ugly and evil (The connotations of that combination always jar with me). I could take the one dose of them in the original LOTR story, but here they are tediously overused to create a very clumsy moral dynamic in order to keep the whole unnecessary trilogy going.<br/><br/>And one final point this film is called 'The Hobbit' and I thought Martin Freeman's performance was rather good and could have been the heart of a good film, But most of the time he was sidelined to the role of bemused spectator in this LOTR rehash of a story that he was supposed be the centre character of. However, he could not be the kind of hero that you have to have in these kinds of CGI heavy fantasy films and because of that in this telling of the story, he really was a bit of a fraud and didn't deserve the love and respect he had from the fellow dwarves.<br/><br/>So I give 'The Desolation of Smaug' 40%, it's alright, and the highlight for me was the dragon and his conversation with Bilbo. It was a bit better than the first one...... or was it that maybe I was just battered into submission."

"movienut-21729","4","2","2","10 December 2016"," When everything is epic, nothing is epic.
","The fundamental task of storytelling is to take the audience on an emotional journey that works its way up to a final, epic climax. The Desolation of Smaug fails to accomplish this very basic task by bombarding viewers with a constant sequence of epic struggles from the outset, leaving itself no room to increase the level of emotion and intensity into a final climax. After watching nearly three hours of epic battles between numerous combinations of orcs, dwarfs, hobbits, elves, spiders, humans, werewolves, wizards, and dragons I found the final ""climax"" to be dull and tiresome, having nothing more to offer. When everything is epic, nothing is epic. I spent the final half hour growling ""End Already!!!"" constantly because the movie had gone flat, boring, and quite frankly irritating.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that so much effort went into making a movie that fails simply because the creators lost their understanding of basic storytelling in their obsession with epicness."
"DanielRobertRoss","6","2","2","24 May 2016"," More of the same and Smaug is not worth the wait
","I didn't see this in cinemas. I was so disappointed in the overlong nonsense of An Unexpected Journey, I refused to watch the second and third movies. Reluctantly I eventually watched Desolation of Smaug on DVD, and well, I don't know. It's technically better than the first film, but still has all the same flaws; the unnecessary characters, the bloated length, the side quests that go nowhere and the jarring tonal shifts. <br/><br/>Things start off promisingly enough, but soon devolve into an awkward mix of slapstick and pratfalls. And it seems that all the FX work on Smaug consumed the production, and the rest of the CGI was rushed in a week. I hate that Azog is a CGI character, he has no depth whatsoever. And the barrel ride with the dwarfs has some of the worst blue screen work I've seen in recent years. <br/><br/>Once the film gets to lake Town, I gave up, the film just stops dead in it's tracks. The pointless politics, the endless discussions, and the ridiculous master of the town. I love Stephen Fry, the man is a genius. But from his first scene, I couldn't stop giggling. He's less Master of Lake Town and more Monty Python. <br/><br/>After an eternity of needless exposition and characters that go nowhere, our forgettable (Thorin and Balin excluded) dwarfs finally encounter the title character. Just like the riddles in the dark scene with Bilbo and Gollum in the first film, Smaug is worth the wait. He's everything I wanted and more. It's just unfortunate that Jackson just can't figure out what the tone of the film is. The scene with the dwarfs fighting Smaug goes on way too long, shifting from genuinely exciting to comical, to ridiculous (And back again).<br/><br/>So do I recommend it? Not really, if you're a Tolkein purist, you'll probably hate it (I am one of them), if you're a casual film fan, you'll be bored by the excessive running time and bloated second act. And if you're a kid who read the book and you want to see a film version, the film is too violent and intense. For a film based on a children's book, it's all over the place. Rent the DVD, chapter skip to where you first see Smaug, then watch it to the end. Everything else is rubbish."
"user-196-766417","5","2","2","7 August 2015"," Extended edition was fairly good for the first 40 minutes.
","After the disappointment of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", I hadh fairly low standards for the second film. It started off incredibly well, but then spiralled into a mess of deus-ex-machinas, disrespectful book deviations, and unnecessary heterosexual romance.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/><br/>The cinematography and visual design. From the caverns of Erebor to the Halls of the Woodland King, the film's artistic direction is so amazingly detailed. Again, the filmmakers use the beautiful scenery of New Zealand to create the world of Middle-Earth. It's honestly breathtaking.<br/><br/>Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and Thorin's (Richard Armitage) character development stories are coming along great. Bilbo is becoming braver and more proactive; Thorin is starting to respect him. Both actors, in my opinion, are perfect for their roles - Freeman is natural in his lightness and often comedic relief, while Armitage carries a gravity well-suited to Thorin's pride and severity. Ian Mckellen has always been brilliant as Gandalf, and always will be.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how amazing the Mirkwood scenes are. The visuals of the forest, the dim lighting, the slow cameras and the illusionary special effects create the forest's heavy and stifling atmosphere perfectly. The feeling of wrongness was so strong and so well- crafted. <br/><br/>But then it all went downhill.<br/><br/>The cons:<br/><br/>I can pinpoint the exact second when everything started going wrong: when Legolas and the other Elves slide down the branches to kill the giant spiders. <br/><br/>The very inclusion of the Elves, in my opinion, was a mistake. It heavily detracts from Bilbo and the dwarfs' story. The whole Elf- Dwarf superiority complex is incredibly irritating - the film always portrays Elves as the pinnacle of civilisation while the Dwarfs are crude, greedy and unskilled in combat. It's not a good idea to antagonise thirteen of your main characters. And Legolas' appearance seems to be just for the sake of pulling in viewers.<br/><br/>Tauriel and Kíli. Oh boy, where do I begin? Firstly, it undermines Legolas and Gimli's friendship in ""The Lord of the Rings"". Secondly, they lack chemistry and their romance is so forced and cringeworthy. Thirdly, how Tauriel goes from, ""Do not think I will give you a weapon, Dwarf"" to going all moon-eyed over Kíli in the time frame of a few hours. I could go on.<br/><br/>Tauriel herself is written fairly badly. I liked the idea of a badass elf lady, but everything she does is for Kili's sake. Jackson and co. have obviously neglected to research (or more likely, deliberately ignored) Elven history with her red hair and attraction to Kili. Tolkien worked so hard to create a wonderful fantasy world, and it's been destroyed in the matter of a few minutes by Jackson and co.<br/><br/>The Company splits up. That's right. Fíli, Kíli, Bofur and Oin remain in Lake-Town, while the rest of the Dwarfs march on Erebor. Why? It doesn't add anything to the plot, except to develop Kíli and Tauriel's grating, unrealistic romance by romanticising Kíli's injury.<br/><br/>There were so many unnecessary plot lines. The scenes with the orcs' point of view don't add anything. There's too much focus on The Master and Alfrid. There shouldn't be this much emphasis on secondary characters when not all thirteen Dwarfs have their own personalities yet.<br/><br/>The alright:<br/><br/>The Dwarfs taking on Smaug. It makes their vendetta a little more personal, I guess. They did fairly interesting things to try to kill him, and we get a good look at the insides of Erebor. Gandalf and the Dol Guldur subplot were alright. It was nice to see him doing more magic, as we didn't get that much in ""The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>Overall, the film was quite poor. It started off wonderfully and then just began deviating too much from the book to be a good adaptation. Even though the tone was much more consistent than the first movie, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" treats Tolkien's world and works in an unapologetically dismissive and disrespectful manner.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is much worse. If you found this film unengaging, you will certainly find the last instalment unbearable."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","2","2","24 December 2014"," What a chore.
","In my opinion, The Two Towers was the best film of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It hit a very sweet spot and said some very interesting things about storytelling in the nature of setup and payoff. The Hobbit's The Desolation of Smaug isn't in the same league as The Lord of the Rings, needless to say, and it doesn't even live up to the mild entertainment of An Unexpected Journey. It has no payoffs to offer. This is an utter chore to get through. I don't care enough to go into detail, I'm not invested in any facet of this instalment of Middle Earth. I get that Jackson kind of wants this whimsical shimmering aesthetic but holy moly it couldn't be messier. It's cool to watch the elves wreck things up, but it's littered with so much video game physics that the immersion is gone, if it was ever there in the first place. While some moments are alright, Martin Freeman makes the best of it when he has any focus, it just feels like a soulless money grab.<br/><br/>5/10"
"alaskacouponmom","2","2","2","26 June 2014"," All flash and no substance.
","I love the hobbit and was looking forward to seeing this movie. I was so disappointed. I kept watching my watch hoping it was over. If I had not gone with a group, I would have walked out. It was all action and no substance. I did not care about the characters at all and this is coming from someone who has read the book several times. It was all action all the time to the detriment of it even having a point. I guess if that is all you want you will like it, but if you like a good story to go with all the action be prepared to be disappointed. It does not stay true to the wonderful book either. There was lots of pointless things added just so there could be more action and killing and...........This was a big waste of time!"

","The first film; well I quite liked it as it captured the feel and themes of the book really well, albeit so drawn out you would think that the series would go for 5 films.<br/><br/>Now, the second in the series. Things change a lot and the pace hits absolute top gear, flying from one encounter to the next.<br/><br/>Overall the film did not work for me. I know some will lap up the action, but it is unnecessarily drawn out, action scenes are even added where there should not be and did not happen in the book; but all this comes at the expense of the character development and building of the grandeur, length and epicness of the adventure. With three films to work with, there is an opportunity to spend some time doing this, however, with the distracting side plots and drawn out action scenes, there is no time.<br/><br/>What made the LOTR series great was the ability to capture the themes and story of the books. For the hobbit, I'm starting to feel its not the hobbit any more, just a movie with characters of the same name.<br/><br/>Fight scene with smaug at the end never happened in the book and ended up just stupid. Rivers of gold and a liquified gold titan whipped up in a few minutes....really?"
"Keith-weaver1","6","2","2","15 May 2014"," disappointing
","This movie is OK if you like 2 hr 40 min of sturm and drang. Scenery and special effects are good, and the movie is visually appealing. Much of the action was clearly driven by the 3-D format. However, any resemblance to the book is superficial at best. In essence, the title has been grafted onto a mostly different story. Anyone expecting a faithful recounting will be sorely disappointed. Based on the examples so far, it must be almost impossible to write a screenplay accurately derived from Tolkien's stories, or one that captures their grace and lyrical charm. Though this series of movies has been a modest commercial success, I suspect Tolkien would be aghast at Peter Jackson's work."
"christiank7","2","2","2","25 April 2014"," Only dolars in the mountain for jackson
","I did not give it awful because the dragon was really quite good. The problem with this series is that Jackson has fallen into the trap of making money before passion for his art. That is OK in itself as most film makers do exactly the same and always have and always will but why does he do it? Good question. I mean he has enough cash does he not? He has enough fame does he not? So why? Well, because ultimately he was never really been a hero of film making at all. Disguised in his hobbit cloak he tricked almost everybody into believing the garbage he was saying but now we all know where his true allegiance lies. In the gold at the bottom of the mountain. The ring has him firmly in its grasp and such a shame too. Will not be supporting any further of his ventures and I will never forgive him for selling out to the true Tolkien spirit. Should have made one good film and end it there but NO. Sequels mean cash and so it is as it has always been. The mind of man summed up in a travesty of deceit."
"sjc-tech","4","2","2","2 April 2014"," A disappointing second installment.
","This film continues the story of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" and, in my opinion, is the worse of the two. The length of the film as a whole, at 2 hours and 41 minutes, isn't the problem. The problem is that the ending drags on for 40 minutes and is ultimately bare and dismal.<br/><br/>The score, though average for the beginning of the film, is ineffective for the later part. For a film like this you need an eruptive and explosive score, and in this we are lacking.<br/><br/>The acting here is much better and more believable than it's predecessor, though Richard Armitige's (Thorin Oakenshield) performance could still be improved.<br/><br/>Unlike in ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" the size proportions of the Hobbits, Dwarfs etc. are a constant, which improves the believability overall. Similarly, the graphics are slightly improved here which, again, improves the credibility.<br/><br/>The battle scenes - especially the scene at the river - are beautifully orchestrated and easy to follow. That quality is of the greatest importance in an action film; and this film has more than it's fair share of action.<br/><br/>The gore is kept to a minimum, but there are far more beheadings than one would think necessary. It does, however, give more substance to the battle scenes, rather than hiving just boring sword swings and arrow fire.<br/><br/>The dialogue could be improved in explaining the situation at hand. Like the antecedent, there are gaps of important information that I very much hope will be explained and tied up in full in the next film."
"RolltheClip","7","2","2","20 March 2014"," Although better, still room for improvement
","The internal debate. When disappointed by the initial instalment of a trilogy, do you bite the bullet and give the second part a chance or steer clear to avoid further upset? I believe that in most cases, if you truly strive to enjoy a series then the former seems the obvious choice. Going in with poor expectations occasionally causes the viewer to dissect the following film. On another occasion, the bar is set so low that you are unable to be anything other than pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>When The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was released, I left my local multiplex completely underwhelmed. With almost a decade between The Return of the King and the initial prequel, I contemplated whether my tastes had simply changed in the passing time. Prior to Middle Earths resurgence on the big screen, HBO made a sizeable impact on the small screen with Game Of Thrones which offered a darker, more adult alternative to the fantasy epic genre. Where Jackson's envisioning of Tolkien's Middle Earth were condensed into three hour films, the television adaption of George R.R Martin's book saga was debuted weekly, allowing a higher threshold of character development without glancing over certain plot points.<br/><br/>Regardless of these factors, surely the familiarity of such beautiful compositions as 'Concerning Hobbits' should have rekindled my past love for the franchise in those opening moments? It did, however the remainder of the film felt much different. Whilst the soundtrack felt familiar, including the new addition of the song of the 'Misty Mountains', the overall tone never seemed to reach a consistent note. Personally, it felt more akin to The Chronicles of Narnia adaptions than the previous Lord of the Rings trilogy with it's needless use of child orientated humour. Additionally, the creatures seemed to be heavily influenced by the input of Guillermo Del Toro with the Orcs taking a slightly contrasting appearance. Their presence moved further away from the more menacing, prosthetics based entities I had come to both respect and fear in my youth to a more CGI centric being.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is a much leaner, more refined continuation of the Hobbit storyline. Having already established all of the characters, the momentum is able to build at a faster pace without repeated introductions, moving swiftly between each set piece,from a conflict with a cluster of giant spiders to the groundbreaking encounter with the dragon, Smaug which showcases some of the finest CGI I have seen. On the contrary I felt that, excluding these two action sequences, the remainder of the effects were rather flawed as though they had spent all of their efforts on those key scenes. The rest of the film is weighed down by a comparatively horrendous usage of green-screens which will accelerate the ageing of the instalment in years to come.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a balance between action and the progression of the cast seems out of reach. Perhaps prolonging the length of one book into a trilogy is the root of this problem with a limited amount of plot to cover. Some conflicts seem to border on filler and I felt there was a lack of conversation on some part amidst the hordes of Orcs although it did distinguish more defined combat styles. The Mongol-esque dismemberment of a spider by the Dwarfs and the graceful, honed battle skills of the Elves as they seemingly dance between their foes. The camaraderie feels less apparent than in the first trilogy and the lack of any fatalities to the company removes you from the same sense of danger that previous instalments emitted with Legolas or Tauriel rescuing our protagonists from any impending tragedies.<br/><br/>Overall it was an enjoyable film, I just deem it lacks some of what I once felt was a more substantial part of the franchise and the essence of The Lord of the Rings; such as the emphasis on friendship and the adventurers persevering through hardships. On the other hand it did capture the undertone of how overpowering desires and obsessions can really contribute to someone's downfall. Despite some of the negativity within this review this sequel was a vast improvement full of excitement and ambition ensuring that it leaves viewers craving the conclusion to the Unexpected Journey."

I noticed these things starting with 'The Return of the King':<br/><br/>1. Why is every battle scene a handful or few versus and endless number of enemies? I feel like I'm watching a video game and not a movie. Can't it be just a little more realistic? Maybe a few versus a few more?<br/><br/>2.

"mrfrodogetdown","8","28","61","10 December 2013"," A little disappointing, but still good
","Let me start this review with a cliché: I am a HUGE fan of The Lord of the Rings movies. I saw the first film when it was released in 2001 (I was 11 back then). They are my favorite movies and have made me what I am today - a student studying film.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was the movie I waited for years and years. I always knew it couldn't be as great as LOTR films were, but I hoped it to be decent. And it was. I thought it was maybe a little too long and had some unnecessary moments. In my opinion, the LOTR movies are better than the books, so I am not a Tolkien purist. Thus I didn't mind all the ""made up new scenes"" PJ added to the movie - actually I loved most of them.<br/><br/>Now after waiting for a year, the second part of the trilogy is here. I saw it in HFR 3D in a midnight screening here in Finland. The Desolation of Smaug starts *** SPOILER SPOILER *** with a prologue from the Village of Bree, where Gandalf meets with Thorin, wanting him to claim Erebor back. I think this was a very nice beginning for the film, and you can actually see a familiar face from the Fellowship of the Ring eating carrot again.<br/><br/>After this, the actual story continues where it ended in the first film. The company is followed by bloodthirsty Azog and his wargs, and the dwarfs seek refuge from Beorn's house. Beorn is an interesting character in the book, but unfortunately there's only little of him in the film. That's a pity as the actor seemed good.<br/><br/>The Mirkwood was something awful in my opinion. The CGI looked so god damn fake (especially on the trees) I wanted to cry. I don't think it was the 48fps making it look so bad - The Unexpected Journey looks at some points bad from Blu-ray. You have to but wonder - what on earth have they done right with the LOTR films over 10 years ago to make them look so brilliant and real? Is it really that nowadays CGI just looks crappier? I don't know, but the CGI on the Mirkwood looked bad - and this bothered me time to time with different scenes throughout the whole film (especially in Gandalf vs. Sauron). Have they not have had enough time to finish all the shots? Anyways. Let me not bother you with boring whining about CGI. Legolas is back, and that's a good thing. I think his character is nicely introduced in this film. His father seems to be like an douchebag, and Legolas is clearly fond of Tauriel - a new character played by Evangeline Lilly. Tauriel is, without a doubt, a pointless character. Yes, she is Legolas' love interest, but she crushes on Fili (or was it Kili? I always mix those two!), and that is something so dull! Tauriel's scenes are dumb and they make the movie look bad. Especially the overlong chat in the dungeons and the King's Foil scene... WTF?! The battle scenes look great, and I loved the barrel scene. The choreography was outstanding, and extremely fun. I think that's a good thing considering The Hobbit is a movie based on a children's book. You could see Peter Jackson's old splatter film maker imago popping up time to time, but those scenes were made with good taste.<br/><br/>The Laketown was very nicely done with all the detailing, and Luke Evans did a great job being Bard. Erebor looked as great as it did on the prologue of the first film, but now we got to see the dragon and his mountains of gold (about the CGI; this scene looked most of the time great, but the melted gold was awful!). Benedict Cumberbatch made a terrific performance as the voice of Smaug. The theater trembled when he spoke and that gave me some serious goosebumps! I liked the Smaug scene, even though it was way too long with a ""little"" battle. And now comes even bigger spoiler, about the ending - so don't read forward if you don't want to know how it ends! I was so sure before seeing the film that the movie was going to end in the death of Smaug. But it didn't. The ending came rapidly and a bit unexpectedly, at least to me. The movie ended in the scene where Smaug is seen flying towards the Laketown. After thinking this for a while, it is a good ending. It has cliffhanger, and the Smaug is in the last film too by ending second film like this. The third film would not have made much sense if it would have only the the Battle of Five Armies.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good film that could have been better. Some scenes are just so pointless you have to but wonder them. This is, by far, the funniest Tolkien film made to date. You have to laugh at least to the Gimli joke. Peter's directing is great, but the film could have been better, if some scenes would have been saved for the extended edition. Actor's are all top notch, as you'd expect. Only big complain I have is CGI. It really does look bad at some points. HFR films looks awesome, as does 3D. This is a nice film that you have to see in theaters!"

Tolkien's fantasy tales, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was a substantial letdown from ""The Lord of the Rings"" films, and the thought of enduring another immensely long trilogy too much to bear. But even they'll agree with the biggest fans of ""An Unexpected Journey"" that part two, ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" shows substantial improvement over the first film.<br/><br/>Foremost, the film benefits from needing little to no exposition. The suspense and action ratchets up quickly as Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs, on their quest to reclaim their homeland from the dragon Smaug, are still being pursued by a band of ruthless orcs led by Azog the Defiler at the behest of the frightening, amorphous Necromancer. They must journey through the cursed forest of Mirkwood, home of the wood-elves, up the river to Lake-town and across the lake to the Lonely Mountain where Smaug awaits.<br/><br/>The action sequences alone prove ""Desolation"" a better film than ""Journey."" Nothing was really wrong with the first film, but the danger, excitement and creativity of ""Desolation"" simply trumps its predecessor. The return of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) along with his companion Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, who looks born to play an elf) brings with it the return of incredibly fluid, exciting and yes, perhaps even unrealistic fight choreography. Remember when Legolas took down an entire elephaunt in ""Return of the King"" in a brilliant sequence? The barrel escape on the river shows it up big time. Simply put, orcs are treated as deli meat in this movie.<br/><br/>Aracnaphobes be warned: director Peter Jackson is relentless in the spider scenes in Mirkwood toward the beginning of the film and as for any dragon-phobes — yeah, you might want to walk out of the theater after the first two hours, because at that point begins the Smaug show. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers delicious vocals (as expected) playing the fearsome dragon, and the sheer scale of the climactic sequence inside the cavernous halls of the dwarf kingdom of Erebor doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>As was a noticeable challenge in ""An Unexpected Journey,"" the ""Desolation"" script contains even more filler and plot lines not in the book crafted from appendices than the first film. Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro generally make good use of this creative freedom by keeping the pace of the film up some parts of the movie, though excellently written and executed, go on a bit too long and provide little value outside of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Two-thirds of the way through this adventure, it has become clear that the themes of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy don't run nearly as deep as with ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and neither does the emotion. A subplot tries to create a love story between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel as a change-of-pace from the danger and fear (the film's primary and dominant emotion), but it just doesn't hit. Kili has nowhere near the same level of audience admiration as Legolas, whose legacy from ""Rings"" carries instantly over to this film and who seems an obvious match for Tauriel. Outward ploys to generate some emotion such as this, however, wouldn't be necessary if the same motifs that made ""Rings"" more than blockbuster (friendship, the struggle of being outside of one's comfort zone, the fear of failure) were a part of ""The Hobbit."" Freeman and Richard Armitage (Thorin) are true talents, but they can only go so far with this material. What ""Desolation"" makes up for in entertainment value from ""Journey,"" it loses in heart.<br/><br/>Other casting decisions earn excellent marks among the film's new characters including Lilly and Cumberbatch. Lee Pace nails the elf aura as good as Cate Blanchett playing the elf-king Thranduil and Luke Evans makes a fine, likable hero out of Bard the Bowman, the man who harbors the company in Lake-town. Although his character is a waste, the delightful Stephen Fry is another good call as the master of Lake-town. And let us not forget old friends: Ian McKellan gets a good number of badass moments during Gandalf's side-journey.<br/><br/>Anyone unsure which format to view the film in should consider that the last sequence with Smaug and a few others occur in somewhat dark locales. This is a significantly less than desirable situation for traditional 3D, because 3D already makes the frame seem darker. Those looking to upgrade from 2D should make the jump to HFR 3D, which despite its many critics, definitely has less motion blur and doesn't have the same issues with darkness.<br/><br/>Jackson, of course, continues to marvel with his vision for Middle Earth. The design of the locales and the sets (the wood-elves' kingdom, Lake-town, Erebor) show a great deal of technical sophistication and more importantly, imagination. The places truly come to life in all these films, and with a sense of eye-opening grandeur. Sometimes it even borders on too big and magnificent.<br/><br/>""The Desolation of Smaug"" definitely sets the stage for what will surely be another memorable conclusion in both excitement and scale. The film ends on much more of an unexpected cliffhanger than the first film and the first ""Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Two Towers"" definitely unwound in the end, as ominous as it still was, but ""Desolation"" will leave viewers with a sense that what they just saw will be like foreplay when they witness the conclusion.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I really didn't care for the first installment of the Hobbit so I was hoping that the second would be better....well it wasn't. From the beginning seen (the one that I had to explain to my grandson, seeing as the two characters had already met) to the end so called cliffhanger this was a really poor attempt to make a dramatic movie. I have been saying from the beginning that Jackson bit off more than he could chew trying to stretch this simple book into more than one movie. This middle movie is a perfect example of this stories short coming as a series. It was boring, then there was a battle, then more boredom. The dialog was a rehash and the music. I just couldn't get past the really awful music. Must is supposed to enhance a movie not work against it. I am really not looking forward to the next one. Maybe I'll wait till its on DVD or cable if this keeps up. Going home to watch the good movies."
"vincentasmuth-869-109803","4","19","39","13 December 2013"," -READ THIS BEFORE WATCHING- An honest review
","Well, what can I say about the hobbit 2 desolation of smaug. It was in parts the best and in parts the worst movie I have seen this year. Peter Jackson got totally carried away with rewriting the hobbit source material but mostly not in a good way. I actually liked that they fleshed out the hobbit that much and made the story bigger and in a way funnier. The first hobbit was really really good at rewriting the source material and making it fresh. As much as I love the hobbit book, I also loved Peter Jacksons first movie. So what went wrong? I am not going to spoil you so I can't get into much detail but I try to explain. 1. This movie has really really really bad pacing. The beginning is really strangely rushed but I could have accepted that. A fast past action flick. The last scene however lasted over 1 hour and was painfully long and made you wonder why the beginning was so rushed.<br/><br/>2. REALLY bad ending Only a bad TV series would get away with that. Tune in next time kids, when the story gets interesting.<br/><br/>3. Awful fight scenes I am actually a fan of Peter Jacksons slapstick fight scenes in the Lotr and Hobbit 1 but many of these fights were just annoying cuts and close ups and the last fight lasted far too long had BAD CGI and was just boring to watch. The ending of the last fight scene however made me laugh sooo hard. It was ridiculous, rotten to the core, illogical and just breathtakingly stupid. It was without a doubt the most nonsensical fight scene I have ever saw. WHY oh why Peter Jackson. This is not loneytunes.<br/><br/>4. Everything falls apart in the last 1 hour or so Maybe I haven't stressed enough HOW bad the last hour was. The whole audience who where laughing and enjoying this flick (Like me) became silent, people first stood up to go to the bathroom and people started talking and complaining. As stated above even the looks of the film fell apart. Despite being one of the best looking 3D movies in the end the CGI was completely GARBAGE. It looked like Star wars episode 1 maybe even worse. It really was an unpleasant experience. Every 1 minute there was a AND NOW SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN- Close up on someone face + Epic music moment BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. People where doing impossible things (REALLY impossible, even for fantasy standards- Legolas from Return to the kings would have laughed at this and said impossible) and at same point it really resembled more a video game than an actual movie. 1 hour wasted maybe just to get a higher ticket price and even worse cutting the beginning of the film which would have been much better.<br/><br/>So what was the good part? 1. It looked mostly great! You felt like you where there. It was just breathtaking in the first hours.<br/><br/>2.The middle of the film was AWESOME. It had great pacing, great original writing and just great scenes and dialogues. I loved it. Peter Jackson did not rely too much on his Lotr formula but on the first hobbit formula of action, comedy and adventure combined and it was great. The best thing I have seen in a long time. Really pleasant. He even made fun of his over the top action scenes in a particularly silly fight scenes where suddenly everything escalated to comedically first class material. I laughed so hard. It was great.<br/><br/>Is this movie worth watching? If you love this franchise you are gonna see it anyway, aren't you? But don't get your hopes to high. It is the worst middle earth flick Jackson has made and all because of the STUPID, boring and ugly last hour. It really gave people a bad feeling walking out of this movie and that is not a good sign. If you are a casual viewer maybe you skip to hobbit 3...<br/><br/>A little comment of the positive score this movie has (At least the at the moment I write this review). I watched it in a movie theater with maybe just 80 other guys. It is a really pretty theater and when you go out everyone waits in the same lobby so I was listening to people talk, talked to my friends and even asked other people. THEY ALL thought the last hour was either horrible or not entertaining and nobody though this movie was superior to the first hobbit. I just wonder what all these other reviewers have watched?"
"wehillusa","1","10","18","21 December 2013"," Another boring LOR flick
","I can't believe I spent $18.00 (ticket, coke, popcorn) to see this crap. Way too much dialog and way too little action. And as with all of the LOR (Lord of the Rings) type movies your left hanging at the end. Well unless I have a choice of a lobotomy or seeing the next chapter, I thinks a lobotomy will be my choice. And the warning on this movie should be ""ONLY WATCH IF YOUR EXTREMELY BORED""!!! Maybe a discount on the tickets of snacks would entice people to see it but I wouldn't recommend it. So between the movie previews about the new godzilla movie and the over salted and over buttered popcorn my experience was almost a complete waste of my afternoon."
"mjeatspies","2","13","25","17 December 2013"," Just watch the trailer
","After watching the trailer I was excited for this film to be released as I wanted to see what would happen to the dragon. Would it be destroyed or would it survive? Well turns out, they just stretched the movie to nearly 3 hours then ended it in a similar way the trailer ended except adding the line which I will not spoil, all you need to know is that it's not a line you would likely want to hear and then the film cliff-hangs the audience obligating us to watch the next film. Don't invest your money here if you wish to view any more ""content"" than what was showcased in the trailer. I was personally frustrated and disappointed that the movie did not have a proper conclusion. For those of you who work minimum wage and are watching a film solely for entertainment, you will not receive and fulfillment here. The film industry is dying and so are all the capitalistic industries. Save your time for something else more important. My entire family attended the film and we were all disappointed."
"cgavriliu","5","13","25","14 December 2013"," No hero time, no emotions, no focus
","I don't know how it's possible for this movie to have 8.7... It doesn't have a hero, doesn't develop characters and it's not even spectacular on the special effects side.<br/><br/>The hobbit character didn't have enough screen time to developed but they decided to give away half an hour to a fake, underdeveloped ""love story"" that stole a lot of focus.<br/><br/>I was with 5 people to see it tonight, all of them got bored at some point. Everything was on full speed as the director wanted to insert as many actions, plots and characters possible. Meanwhile the main characters didn't get enough time to shine.<br/><br/>Another annoying thing was the fact that everything was predictable and you could clearly see the next step. No suspense, no surprise, no real twist. <br/><br/>And what about the dragon that likes long chats... What??? Maybe the director wanted to pay a tribute to Tarantino with a half an hour talk. The only difference is that this talk bored everyone to death. He's a dragon, not a bragging pussy.<br/><br/>Don't think that is the worst movie of the year, but considering the budget, the story and resources available it could have done so much better..."
"mortoniain","2","20","42","14 December 2013"," The Hobbit - The dream in tatters...
","I am a lifelong LOTR fan and have waited ten long years for The Hobbit...I couldn't be more distraught. PJ has missed every opportunity to complete the circle here. LOTR had atmosphere, dynamics, tension, hair-raising on the back of the neck moments (Bernard Hill's Shakespearian battle monologue in TTT was particularly well crafted)...but THIS! Where were any moments even like those?<br/><br/>It was the Middle earth equivalent of Die Hard, action substituted for dialogue, no character building, no beautiful moments just action, action, action all the way....a video game generation abomination. PJ has bowed to Hollywood and abandoned all the care and love he showed for Tolkein in LOTR.<br/><br/>The book had fantastic atmospheric chapters that have been lightly skipped over in favour of effects and an unwarranted love interest.<br/><br/>Either do it right Jackson or don't do it at all....you were my hero once. :-("
"marksuttonie","3","14","28","17 December 2013"," Stretched like butter over too much bread
","Oh My! I had wondered how they were going to get three movies out of this simple children's book. With or without references to the Appendices to Lord of The Rings or the Silmarillion.<br/><br/>Well now I know, keep the title, give a nod now and then to some of the scenes which reflect the book and then add on totally unconnected story lines that are almost a separate film and chuck in a strange and unfathomable love interest and a character from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Also make sure there is an initially interesting, but ultimately boring series of action sequences every 15 minutes or so and voila: A dog's Dinner of a film.<br/><br/>I felt this was a Hollywood sellout: No attempt at deeper characterisation of the existing characters or characters like Beorn who were prominent in the book, though I was dubious indeed about Bard the Bowman and unhappy with the introduction of an automatic black arrow chucker.<br/><br/>I mentally replaced Smaug on the loot with Warner brother's execs and the the trilogy made much more sense.<br/><br/>Smaug and Dominic Cumberbatch's voice acting were superb. But even here we were treated to another pointless exercise in time filling with action. The liquid gold was totally unrealistic and the whole chase sequence reduced Smaug to an archetypal Hollywood villain, not the true menace he was meant to be. Their take on smaug the golden finished me off, no wonder the cinema on the first day emptied, you could feel people sliding away from any engagement.<br/><br/>I rather imagine that Bilbo is echoing the writers when he says at the end:<br/><br/>""what have we done?"""
"jabbatron","10","8","14","8 January 2014"," A worthy piece of cinema.
","There are many ""second instalment"" films that outshine their predecessor. From The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather – Part II to The Dark Knight, some films are just an appetiser for the main meal.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug follows on from his disappointing 2012 feature film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey with ten times the action and excitement to make this second title in the Hobbit series a feast for moviegoers.<br/><br/>Kicking off with a flashback to a year before Bilbo Baggins came into the orbit of the vanquished Dwarfs of Erebor, Gandalf the Grey urges Thorin Oakenshield to seek out the Arkenstone to reclaim the throne of the Kingdom Under the Mountain, before slipping neatly into the time frame shortly after the first film ended.<br/><br/>If the first film was lacking in happenings and characters, this one more than makes up for it. Skin Changer Beorn keeps the attacking Orcs at bay before taking human shape and explaining he'll help the dwarfs despite detesting their kind, because the only thing he hates more than little folk are Orcs.<br/><br/>And it's no wonder. These foul creatures will star in many a nightmare for younger viewers.<br/><br/>Here's a film to avoid if you dislike gigantic spiders. Also dizzying heights, fire breathing dragons, decapitation, sword-fights, Elves, Wizards, poison, puzzles and spooky forests.<br/><br/>The way that Peter Jackson is able to weave his magic with real live action seamlessly integrated with CGI is phenomenal.<br/><br/>A film to cherish in 3D, and pore over again on DVD & Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>jabbatron.com"
"Johan-smedjebacka","6","11","21","16 December 2013"," Disappointment for book readers
","It's not a bad movie, actually a very good action movie. But the thing is that it claims that it is based on J.R.R Tolkien's book. The places and Characters from book are there, but not much else reminds of the book.<br/><br/>The movie start with orcs leaded by Azog hunting Bilbo&Co,so they seek safe spot from Beorn's house, and this is the first disappointment, Beorn is only shown minutes! It would have been such a opportunity for longer scenes. Then comes the scenes in dark magic forest, which is actually good with all terrible spiders and dark magic, but then arrives elves and the movie turns worse again. What is Legolas doing here? And some elf women who is probably from Jackson's fantasy. And while dwarfs are captured she starts to have some ridiculous love fair with one of them.<br/><br/>Bilbo manages to help Thorin&co out their prison, and then starts the most ridiculous scene in the whole movie dwarfs and Bilbo riding barrels in the river, it would have been OK like that. But Jackson added some orcs and elf battles along the river, and the movie turns for a while to an comedy, orcs are 10 times more, but only manages to hurt one dwarf.<br/><br/>Scenes in Laketown is good with the sympathetic Barn and his family who tries to stop Thorin from entering the mountain, but fails to stop them.<br/><br/>The final scenes in the mountains with smaug could have been good, but are now made so long, and little boring.<br/><br/>My opinion is that The Hobbit should have been 1 or at most 2 movies, not destroyed with GGI and other effects, more faithful to the books. But money talks. If you loved Tolkien's book this will be a disappointment to you."
"titus_larcius","5","17","36","14 December 2013"," Jackson must answer for his crime!
","The ONLY reason I give this movie a 5 is because of the pure and utter AWESOMENESS of Smaug. That, and Gandalf facing off against the orcs and Necromancer in Dol Guldur. Pretty much the rest of the film was rubbish. EPIC FAIL! I figured that Jackson would have matured as a director over the years, but he seems to have gone the other direction. Who is this movie for? I get that it's supposed to have a lighter tone than LOTR, but that's not what he succeeded in creating at all. This movie is an action farce. Jackson has the mind and sense of humour of a six-year-old. The movie is unbelievably INSULTING to audiences, and especially to both Tolkien fans and Jackson fans alike! The scenes that are bad are SO bad that they destroy the fabric of the entire movie. They are stupid, unnecessary, over-the-top, superfluous, and distracting. They remove one from the plot, and they destroy one's suspension of disbelief. I feel hurt. I feel an apology from Jackson is in order. I want him to release not an extended addition, but rather an abridged addition. It's the only one I would buy!"
"telechubby1","10","7","12","3 January 2014"," If you thought one orc was bad, wait until there are two orcs. *Some Spoilers*
","The Hobbit 2: Desolation of Smuag is an action movie which takes place one year after The Hobbit 1: Unexpected Journey. This popcorn flick has everything: Drama, Action, Magic, Mayhem, Spooks, Romance, and did I mention action? How can one man sum up such a historical film in such a short time? Well, I guess I'll be the first to try.<br/><br/>First let's get this straight; this isn't just some normal one hour movie you see all the time. This is 3 hours of epic story-telling and the most amazing graphics anyone can witness. All of this should be known to you if you had the pleasure of viewing The Hobbit 1, and if you haven't then get off your butt and go rent it from Blockbuster ASAP! The Story: *Warning some minor spoilers* Our hero Biblo and the other hobbits set forth for another adventure just one year after The Hobbit 1 debut. This time they encounter an old ""friend"" the white orc and his goons, who chase them into a cabin in the woods. After a quick breakfast with their new friend the werewolf they set out once again into the spider woods. The hobbits are quickly snatched up by a gang of talking spiders *amazing graphics on these, you'll love it* but the elfs save them and we are introduced to two big players in The Hobbit 2 scheme of things: Legolas and Galadriel *the later of which falls in love with Fili*. Expect a lot of tension between the characters as they struggle for the lady's hand. The hobbits escape the evil elf king the most unique style of escape yet *I'll cover this scene later*. Meanwhile the big white orc has found a new friend who is bigger, stronger, and faster than himself. This new orc brings the much needed punch to the film to get things really rolling.<br/><br/>The barrel scene: This scene needed its own section since it was so much fun and exciting to watch. Biblo and crew hatch a plan to escape in a water ride from the Elf Castle, but they hit a few snags along the way. Jaw-dropping camera angles and graphics so real you can't tell if you are in a movie or actually in The Hobbit world. I am still blown away by the stunt work it took to do this fast paced battle, the Legolas actor pulled some mind blowing acrobatics while jumping from rock to rock and head to head. My absolute favorite part was when the fat guy bust his legs out of his barrel and used it as armor to take down some orcs in style.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie takes a darker and deeper look into things. A new character The Bard shows up to help our heroes out. This character was odd because if you play video games you would easily see the reference to the mythical class called Bards in this man's name, but he is designed to be the complete opposite. Instead of wielding a guitar and singing he uses swords and smuggles people right under the cop's noses. At long last the movie reaches it's climax at the treasure mountain that Bilbo and friends have been searching for, but deep inside the treasure is something so clever and weird it will throw you off if you aren't paying attention. Bilbo decides to go in alone *most likely to take the gold for himself now that I think of it* and after discovering the near endless supply of coin he finds the greatest writing I've seen in a film in a long time. Face to face with a giant creature which I believe symbolizes or is even in fact a version of Biblo from the future. Smilbo is a great red beast of a man with webbed skin for wings and the hottest breathe in town. Bilbo has a ""heated"" battle with himself finally seeing what he has or will become if he lets all this go to his head. In the end Bilbo calls apon his loyal friends and they trick Smibol into getting covered with molten gold and lava. The biggest surprise of all is that the movie doesn't end the way you think it would, it actually has the biggest cliff hanger I've seen in a movie since Star Wars.<br/><br/>The Good, The Bad, and The Amazing: The Good: Excellent writing and well written characters. Best Action scenes since The Matrix. Best Drama since Saving Private Ryan. Best graphics you can see. Best hour per dollar ratio ever. The Best Jumps, the man sitting behind me kicked my seat when that bee flew at Bilbo in the cabin.<br/><br/>The Bad: No movie is perfect, but this one almost is. My complaints are few, but here they are: Too many characters – this could have been solved by killing off or removing some of the Hobbits. Not enough Bilbo screen time – my favorite character and I just loved every scene with him.<br/><br/>The Amazing: Everything, simple as that. You must watch this film. Nobody does it better. Top of the line camera, graphics, actors, stunts, action, and pure adventure.<br/><br/>My Rating: 99% out of 100% My closing comment: Even if you hate movies and fun you will fall in love with this film. You are hurting yourself by not seeing it, so get out there now and Hobbit with us all!"
"lee_ross_1996","10","7","12","2 January 2014"," Fiery second part to The Hobbit.
","Out of the frying pan into the fire. The Desolation of Smaug is visually fantastic. You get another great insight into Tolkien's world in is the second giving of The Hobbit. Peter Jackson directs and makes the world look amazing in 3D – don't forget to look out for Jackson's cameo at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Although Legolas (Orlando Bloom) isn't in the book it doesn't change the original works for the worst, but for the better. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf plays the role at his best in this slice of Middle Earth. Even though the film gets darker as the dwarfs and burglar (Bilbo, Martin Freeman) delve into Erebor The Lonely Mountain, and Middle Earth begins to get darker The Desolation of Smaug still manages to keep a comedic tone just like An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>A must see, and a great cliff-hanger, for those who have and haven't read the book. There and Back Again cannot come quick enough, I can't wait for to see how Jackson depicts Middle Earth on the big screen for the 6th time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jjdmcook","3","10","19","15 December 2013"," Way too long
","The second movie of the trilogy is always questionable. Peter Jackson took a boring section and made it even worse. There was no reason to add extra non-related material just to make the movies longer and more horrible to sit through. Granted the CGI was excellent but it was just too too too long. For as much money as he has, you would think he could hire a decent editor. Legolas and the dwarf do not need a love triangle. It never really did explain why they had Gandolf going to the necromancer and being in a cage. Kingsfoil is not mentioned for four more books. He's taking a classic story and ruining it. Well it's necessary to watch this just to get from the first to the third movie I was quite disappointed in the way he handled this movie."
"DragoonKain","9","10","19","13 December 2013"," Peter, Fran and Philippa's formula for adapting Tolkien's books
","I saw the Hobbit DoS last night. Incredible movie! Very fast paced and action heavy, as I've come to expect.<br/><br/>If I have one gripe it'd be that the action in the two latest hobbit films are too over the top crazy and unrealistic. The action in LOTR was grittier and felt more real, even though it was still fantasy. You actually felt like the characters could die or get seriously wounded in the fights. But in The Hobbit, everyone's just either super lucky or just god mode powerful. Someone mentioned it's like playing a video game on easy mode. LOTR is hard mode. I agree with that assessment. Still, the films are great fun and I found them very entertaining.<br/><br/>Peter, Fran and Philippa tend to follow a predictable formula when adapting Tolkien's books: <br/><br/>1. Cut out as much exposition as possible, and for the exposition that is necessary, tell it through flashbacks if time allows for it. Some Examples: -the intros to the movies are always flashbacks, and there are several flashbacks within the story. -the council of elrond is greatly shortened -lines of dialogue are always a lot more brief in the films than they are in the books: ""I am no man"" vs. ""But no mortal man am I, for you look upon a woman ..."" <br/><br/>2. If there are quiet moments in the book, cut it out, or greatly shorten it. Some Examples: -a lot of the down time at lake town, the elven king's halls, and Rivendell is shortened to the point where they seem more like very brief stays, rather than the weeks that were spent there in the books. -Nearly 20 years pass between Frodo receiving the ring from Bilbo, and him finally setting out on his journey in the books. In the film, it seems like it's the next day. -The scenes with Radagast, Gandalf and the white council investigating the necromancer of Dol Guldur, and the corruption of mirkwood occurs over the course of thousands of years in the books. In the film, it all seems to happen within the same week. -The time spent worrying about how much food they have, or how tired and hungry they are on the journey. Worrying about where they're going to sleep, and other serious problems that one would run into while going on a long journey. Bad guys trying to kill you aren't the only thing the dwarfs and bilbo had to worry about on their quest. -Journeys last months in the books, in the movies it feels like only a couple of weeks. -Moments of rest and peace, minor conversations, and minor character moments. <br/><br/>3. Cut out anything that may seem a bit too goofy. Keep children storybook humor and whimsy to a minimum. Some Examples: -Tom Bombadil -The wacky way Gandalf introduces the dwarfs to Beorn -The anthropomorphic dogs and many of the talking animals (and wallets) -Many of the songs are cut. <br/><br/>4. Greatly expand on any and all action that's presented in the book, even if it's just one sentence. Some Examples: -The sentence, ""They ran down the stairs and across the bridge."" is adapted to a major 15 minute action scene in FOTR when they're running from the Balrog -The expansion of Azog's role in the story (keeping him alive after Moria), as well as expanding Bolg's role. The orcs attack them much more often in the films than they do in the books. -They added a lot more action to the barrel riding scene than was in the books. -The confrontation of Thorin and the dwarfs against Smaug on the Lonely Mountain was a very brief passage in the book. In the film, it's nearly 45 minutes. <br/><br/>5. Expand the roles of the female characters. -Arwen's role is much bigger in LOTR and she even replaces Glorfindel in her introduction. -Galadriel gets more screen time than she gets in the books, though her role in the story is true to the way Tolkien wrote it. -The Elf King's chief prison guard in The Hobbit was a nameless elf with a very small role, but in the film she's a female Sylvan Elf named Tauriel who has a much bigger role and even a romance subplot. <br/><br/>The Extended cuts are paced more slowly, and are closer in feel to the books. A lot of the exposition and quiet character moments are put back in, as well as some of goofy humor and whimsical moments that may have been cut. The extended editions are how the films should truly be seen, IMO."
"fghezae","1","18","39","13 December 2013"," It wasn't as good as expected
","I waited for this movie and i watched it, it was a great 3D experience i think. But the movie was almost empty compared to the breathtaking book of Bilbo. Of course I don't expect that the movie would tell every thing which is on the book, that costs indeed but this doesn't mean to dismiss too many breathtaking situations and parts of Tolkiens book. What i am trying to say is that many that had supposed to be in the movie , were not there. To begin with the the voyage of the company of Thorin in the dark forest Where they became attacked by giant spiders and take as prisoners by the wood elves. This plot of the movie is described as it takes Bilbo and the dwarfs only one day, thats why I couldn't feel the e.g. the darkness of that old dark fores as it is in the book. further more the part of Beorn is to short in the movie, and Beorn gets learn his new guests so quick but in that great book ít is Gandalf who cleverly introduces the dwarfs and of course Bilbo to the furious Beorn. Again and again high quality, beautiful work and a great experience of 3D. But Unfortunately it is not the hobbits tale i i expect to be."

The final product is so much more than the beloved children's book could ever be, and by the end the entire saga will seamlessly connect with LOTR.<br/><br/>This installment builds on the first by fleshing out many of the dwarfs that were background addition in the first and the end result is a company the you care about and know.<br/><br/>Oh, and I never laughed so hard in my freaking life.

That's why I love the Desolation of Smaug. It's bright, fizzy, optimistic, passionate and very charming. It's also bolder and a little menacing with excellent pacing and the best CGI to date.

","Right off the bat, I am no LOTR aficionado (LOTR would be 'Lord of The Rings' for all of us uninformed novices). I mean I did read the Tolkien books but felt they were only OK. Honestly, this whole yarn is no more than a dated, quasi-exciting fairytale. That being said, I really enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. It was an enjoyable, fun romp introducing Bilbo to his gang of voyagers and to the viewer. Fast paced and good tempo carried the day. Let's face it, this was the beginning. From that point on I knew this was going to be the exciting chronicles of Bilbo and his horde and their encounters with all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures. The first movie was solid (at least I thought it was) and it was primarily about Baggins. I was so stoked for the second (and last) movie to come out. I did not see where a third movie would be warranted or possible. Boy was I ever wrong? One more movie is all that was needed to wrap things up. Really, just one. Sean Connery said it best in 'Hunt for Red October', ""one ping and one ping only."" Alas, after suffering through this time-drag on my life, I decided I will not bother with the third (or fourth, or fifth, or sixth) Hobbit movie(s). There is really nothing left to see. Read the book again – maybe - OK? But this movie, wow, what a horribly disjointed bucket of twaddle. The story line vanished and was replaced by a knotted spindle of fishing line. And it seemed Bilbo (remember – the main character - you know - the guy this whole story was supposed to be about) was relegated to the position of afterthought, while a bunch of scene-steeling elves flew around and ruined the show. The writers might as well have written the little fella out of the story altogether. I mean, could this silly fiasco had been any longer or more more drawn out than what I endured? Could it - really? Oops, yes, another stupid question by me. Of course it could. The answer to this sad dilemma is a resounding yes. Hollywood never passes up an opportunity to fleece moviegoers of hard-earned cash at the drop of a hat. Maybe I am a bit rough (or maybe not?) Chasing that stupid dragon all around was another exhausting 'bit.' And after all of that running and slashing – that stupid fire breathing clown escapes. Well - I am done. I am done with LOTR, I am done with Hobbits and I am done with endless sequels. If a movie needs a sequel, it is a show and should be put it on TV."

"Lalchemiste","6","6","10","2 January 2014"," The Desolation of Fantasy
","This movie is about what I expected it to be. Aside from the plot and scene padding with questionably added characters, the use of High Frame Rate/3D technology gave the movie an eerie realism and starkness that took a while to digest. It had the look and feel of a reality TV show, which was fine, except when the CGI figures appeared. They weren't as real and it muddled the whole experience and ruined the fantasy illusion for me. This is the first movie I've seen that is truly immersive and I'm not sure I like being right in the middle of the action. That said, I tried to view it on its terms instead of holding on to my expectations.<br/><br/>I read the book many years ago and don't have a problem with the whole ""Jumping off point"" approach, but what is lost here is something every good director and author knows. Good storytelling is lean, efficient, and concise, not ponderous, overly detailed, and (dare I say it?) bloated. There simply isn't enough engagement or grandeur here to justify a telling lasting nine hours. LOTR was different. Three books/three movies was appropriate because they were dense stories. This story isn't and I found myself asking, ""what did that scene have to do with anything? It wasn't in the book and it wasn't really necessary."" On the whole, ""the Desolation of Smaug"" suffers from the cinematic equivalent of TMI. With so many added players, individual character development was sorely lacking. ""What was his/her name again?"" is not a question one should ask. <br/><br/>Since I don't believe in plot-spoilers, I can only say that the film also exhibits the risky pitfall of having multiple villains who don't seem to be aware of each other. I'm reminded of the Chinese aphorism about the fallacy of chasing two rabbits.<br/><br/>If you've invested your movie-going interest in the first Hobbit movie and you're a Tolkein fan, I'd say go ahead and see this film. It isn't going to offend you but it may tax your backside. You're supposed to like sitting there for three hours, right? If you're into cutting-edge filmmaking and love gratuitous CGI and jaw-dropping visuals at the expense of expert pacing, knock yourself out. <br/><br/>To plagiarize a 19th century Richard Wagner opera reviewer, ""At 7pm I began to watch 'The Desolation of Smaug.' At 10pm, I looked at my watch. It said 7:15."

","Peter Jackson should remember that he is not J.R.R.

Why bring in the surfing Legolas with a love interest?, Why have such a long and drawn out conversation with something that looks more like a giant bat than a dragon?, Why the digression with Gandalf and Radagast and Sauron. The list goes on.... <br/><br/>The only conclusion I can make as obvious as it is, is that Hollywood success from LOTR has gone to Jacksons head and he is now in the business of misleading and deceiving fans of Tolkein.<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a small book it could have easily been done in one or at most two films, dragging it out to a third movie and adding a whole lot of unnecessary rubbish to a perfectly good story shows how little the producers respect the author and the story. <br/><br/>The special effects etc... as as good as ever.

","The Desolation of Smaug occasionally entertains, often meanders. It has a pointless prologue (a flashback with people discussing stuff we already know), an equally pointless epilogue (a superfluous set-piece which is only there because the project was stretched over three movies) and a lot of filler between them. There are some neat moments but they are buried under an obscene amount of bloat.<br/><br/>McKellen as Gandalf is always good, although he has to deliver way too many cryptic asides. Freeman is perfect as Bilbo. Armitage invests Thorin with charisma and a darker streak. Pace's aloof King Thranduil provides an elf who is way more interesting than pretty stuntman Legolas (who is back, needlessly). Bard's role has been rightfully expanded. Smaug the dragon is great, his confrontation with Bilbo the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>As for non-canon character Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, she of the pensive stares in Lost)... the extent they go to make her likable - including heroic horns blaring in the soundtrack every time she jumps on screen slaying enemies - is rather embarrassing. And this is from someone who liked the expansion of Arwen's role in the previous trilogy.<br/><br/>Jackson's visually busy set pieces are tiresome, with weightless characters bouncing around and zero sense of threat. It's all very ""pew pew, here come the good guys"", like some hyperactive child playing with his action figures, if the child was a multimillionaire owning WETA.<br/><br/>What's worse, these sequences often don't advance the plot in any way: take the final fight against Smaug, which accomplishes exactly nothing. The dragon could have left before the scene started, or maybe halfway through it, and it would have made no difference. The last act, cutting back and forth between three parallel story lines, feels clunky and unfocused. Also, new villain Bolg, aka Azog 2.1, is criminally generic.<br/><br/>Howard Shore, who composed three amazing soundtracks for the Lord of the Rings, is also once again below expectations: continuity is one thing (by the way, where is the Misty Mountains theme which dominated the first movie?), but the amount of recycled material from the previous trilogy is distracting and the new themes nowhere as memorable.<br/><br/>It seems Jackson is finally doing what Christopher Tolkien (J.R.R.'s son) had
unfairly accused him of doing all along with The Lord of the Rings: turning his father's work into shallow action nonsense. I shudder to imagine Tolkien Jr. 's reaction to these new films: since he hated the trilogy which was actually good, this one must feel like Jackson is intentionally trolling him.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Although some fans of the Tolkien books have had mixed feelings regarding additional scenes and characters, I personally found this to be a non-issue. That disclaimer aside, this movie is the best I have seen in a year, and worth the year-long wait. IMAX 3D (if you don't mind forking over the extra cash, but it is surely worth it) brings the visual depth and storied richness of Middle Earth truly alive, and immersive like a tidal wave. The acting is cathartic, and Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch of Star Trek: Into Darkness fame) is beyond brilliant. All throughout the experience, I felt like I was on vacation; I didn't want the ride to end! You know a film is compellingly good when the film moments keep replaying in your mind for hours or even days after the end credits roll. If you are a fan of Tolkien, you will be entertained at the very least. If you are a fan of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings iteration, then you will get twenty times your fix. But if you are a fan of really good film - thoughtful dialogue, beautiful storytelling, spot-on cinematography, charismatic characters, amazingly brilliant action and choreography - this Christmas has just come early for each and every one of you.

","i never thought i would have to write a review like this, being a massive fan of the LOTR trilogy and having liked the first Hobbit installment so much. This movie is just the Hobbit in name only, far too many liberties were taken with the original source material, and even though this happened in the LOTR trilogy, at least those plot changes were plausible or, dare i say it, an improvement. <br/><br/>Here they were obviously just to provide filler for a middle movie that is not required. Some of the plot changes were so diabolical that Tolkien must be spinning in his grave. <br/><br/>I realise i must come across as a Tolkien purist but anyone who loved the last trilogy as much as i did, and really enjoyed the first Hobbit can't be labelled as such. This movie was unnecessary, it doesn't advance the story much and could easily have been incorporated into the first and 3rd movies. It was as if the producers and director of later Pirates movies had taken over the franchise. <br/><br/>I veered between boredom and anger while watching this, as well as feeling conned that it was just a way to make extra money from one of the most loyal and greatest movie fan-bases around. it also felt like a vehicle for the wooden Orlando Bloom. Evangiline Lilly did well with a character that was unnecessary.<br/><br/>i will watch the last installment of this franchise out of a sense of loyalty and hope that it will be much better.

","After being carted away by ""The Eagles are Coming!"", our troop is still playing Hide and Seek with Azog's Orc-Pack.<br/><br/>But we have to have a Flashback First. Once again we see Peter Jackson walking around Bree with a Carrot in his mouth. In ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" we met his daughter as one of the cute little Hobbit kids. This time, she is a ""Butterbur"" (The Ostlers of ""The Prancing Pony""), carting tankards of Ale to Thorin and Gandalf, one year earlier. Just look for the girl that looks like Peter Jackson. Here is talked about Thrain's Disappearance, Thorin's father- Who wielded the last of the Seven Dwarf Rings. As Gandalf tells Thorin, they would need a Burglar...<br/><br/>Fade to Bilbo spying on Azog's pack, and he sees a huge Bear. Gandalf tells him this Bear might be an Ally, he will either help them - Or kill them.<br/><br/>So they take refuge in a House, Gandalf not telling them it's The Bear's house, until The Bear is chasing them into it. The Bear is ""Beorn"" (Mikael Persbrandt), and it just so happens that he hates Orcs and Goblins more than Dwarfs - So they have a temporary Ally.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of the things I was waiting to see, Mirkwood, The Spiders, and the Wood-Elves Kingdom. Lee Pace is Thranduil, Legolas' Father. It just makes Sense that Legolas is there, and if he were true to character, he would have helped the band of Dwarfs just like he helped Aragorn and Gimli. Peter Jackson creates a She-Elf out of thin- air, ""Tauriel"" (Evangeline Lilly) who is very Elf. I don't have any trouble with this either, she neither adds nor takes away anything, and gives us something very pretty to look at. But she only has eyes for Fili, much to Legolas' Chagrin.<br/><br/>Since The Hobbit was written as if Bilbo wrote it, these little facts and characters didn't need to be written in, so it's up to us to fill in the blanks, with Jackson's help. And Tauriel is very much an Elf, displaying many of the powers that Arwen had.<br/><br/>While the Dwarfs plus Bilbo get ""wrapped up"" in Mirkwood, Gandalf has to go to the High Fells of Rhudaur. This is part of the back-story of the Witch King of Angmar, the leader of the Ring-Wraiths.<br/><br/>These two stories get told side-by-side for the rest of this film and beginning of the last, much the same way Lord of the Rings told up to five stories at once, we have the Orcs - Azog and Bolg, who is introduced here, summoning Azog to Dul Goldur. We have the Wood-Elves Kingdom, we have Laketown, and the bargeman Bard's (Luke Evans) relationship with the Master of Laketown, and his history, Evans also plays Bard's ancestor Girion, the archer who shot the Black Arrows at Smaug at Dale and missed, but in fact causing a chink in Smaug's armor, to be abused by Bard 60 years later. Laketown creates the opportunity for many characters and interactions to take shape.<br/><br/>But mainly, the Dwarfs get to Erebor on Durin's Day, even though their party has been split up, Kili and some others left at Laketown, where Bolg attacks, giving Orlando Bloom the opportunity to be Action Hero again. It seems that Legolas has the Skill to kill Bolg (Lawrence Makaore, who was the Witch King in Return of the King), just not the luck to do it this time.<br/><br/>We finally get to see the Whole Smaug this time, not just his nostril or eye. This is one of the best Dragons of Film, CGI or Not, almost as good as the Dragon from the early 80's film ""Dragonslayer"".<br/><br/>Some of the interaction between Smaug and the Dwarfs is expanded a bit, but in the end, Smaug smells Laketown on Bilbo and flies off for retribution. But not before he gets to take a kind of Swim and gets a shiny new coat...<br/><br/>If ""An Unexpected Journey"" hinted at many of the things to come, ""Desolation of Smaug"" gets into the details much more, further connecting this trilogy to the ""second"" one. In a way, I wish this trilogy had been made first, or that less time had been between the two. That way the reaction to this one would have been less jaded.<br/><br/>When it comes to film, what do people want? Three more Expendables films? More Schwarzenegger films? I think this era's moviegoers, well they may be fine - But it is all of these Internet Eberts who create 50 IMDb accounts, just to try to scrag the ratings of one film, that ruin the enjoyment of the people who went to see it. And if you check the join date of every bad review or 1-star rating, you'll see it was ""One Day Ago"" - And I'll bet they pirated a copy of it just to watch it - If they watched it at all, which I doubt."
"sbwoodside","6","5","8","4 January 2014"," Michael Bay's The Hobbit
","Like a Michael Bay movie, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug delivers one-liners, flat characters, and constant running battles. It's a far cry from the epic splendour of the Lord of the Rings movies or the original source material.<br/><br/>Central characters are reduced to thin caricatures of themselves. Thorin comes across as petty rather than regal, weakly acted by Richard Armitage. His mood swings seem more like the tantrums of a teenager than the tortured efforts of a man who's lost his home to reclaim what is rightfully his. The glory and tragedy are lost.<br/><br/>There are some truly illogical bits that killed the suspension of disbelief. Even a hero as powerful as Bard could not move a ten-ton barge by swishing the rudder back and forth. Legolas suffers from a classic unlimited-ammo scenario. I counted 72 dead orcs without reloading his bow — he's known by his fellow Mirkwood elves as ""Rambo"" perhaps.<br/><br/>Gandalf's side adventures show more potential. I don't mind, in principle, expanding the story with material from the Lord of the Rings. But Gandalf's encounter with Sauron, while visually astounding, doesn't ring true. I don't recall Gandalf being captured in Dol Guldur. That's a big blow to the reputation of Gandalf, in a series that is otherwise trying to remain true to Tolkien's core story.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug isn't so much epic as action movie. It's a series of lengthy running battles punctuated by occasional one-liners. Plot and character are sacrificed for more arrows, more leaps, more dizzying 3D zooms through beautifully realized battlefields.<br/><br/>This is not The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien, this is The Hobbit by Michael Bay."
"LarkeFarquhar","3","5","8","2 January 2014"," Swords and Sauce-ry: Not the Sharpest Knives in the Drawer
","The visuals and technical imagery are brilliant, the action/chasing well-paced, the dragon quite stunning, but on every other aspect of storytelling -- plot, narrative, dialogue, character-development – this movie is so poor.<br/><br/>I don't understand why a reasonably well-told and rather charming story (albeit, literature-wise, a bit slight) should be denuded of all its wit, charm and intelligence, and actual tension, and be converted to this corpse-strewn romp through Middle Earth, in such a dumb, stolid, uninspired and fundamentally sloppy fashion.<br/><br/>There are four aspects which had me shaking my head in despair.<br/><br/>One -- the bits that were in the book. These are glossed over, mostly to get to bits that weren't in the book. The encounter with Beorn is turned into a scene of somewhat arbitrary rationale (first he is chasing the dwarfs, who hide from him inside his own house; then he is protecting them because they are slightly higher up the hate-scale than their pursuers); the eerie, mysterious Mirkwood turns into a follow-the-yellow-brick-road stroll, except the dwarfs are too incompetent even for that (see Three), and the supposedly tense stand-off between Dildo and Smaug is resolved in moments -- cue Thorin's dramatic entrance armed only with the sword he came in (yeah mate, the dragon that has slaughtered armies in their thousands is bound to shiver with fright when you show up with your massive tool).<br/><br/>This means we get more action, fighting then chasing, or chasing then fighting, or just fighting, where ""fight"" in this context means wholsesale slaughter of sword-fodder orcs. The good guys are, naturally, barely scathed; except for a slight leg-wound contrived for a might-as-well-have-had-subtitles sub-plot development (see Two) and Legolam getting a slight nose bleed, mostly because he forgets his qualities as an archer and fights the Big Baddie with a knife, rather than just shooting him. (Must have been out of range, or shame stayed his hand. It's a shame I've run out arrows, thought Legolam, and a shame the director hasn't chosen to share that with the movie-goers. Or think it through.)<br/><br/>Two -- the bits that weren't in the book. Strong female characters weren't, admittedly, a mainstay of the original story; those 1930s Cambridge Dons weren't renowned for their awareness of body parts below the neck, and only dimly aware of ""chaps in skirts"". So, to get over the homo-erotic twelve dwarfs being all boys together, we throw in a hot chick she-elf and give her a hugely improbable instant crush on a dwarf -- the only non-caricatured, completely in proportion, darkly good looking one of course. At least it raised the admittedly dim prospect of some seriously dirty dwarf-on-elf action (if only for a potentially redeeming scene with Kili pitilessly humping Tauriel from behind and shouting ""Like the pointy ears, elf -- gives me something to ... hang on to!"").<br/><br/>Three -- the dwarfs are useless. Utterly, utterly useless. A more useless combination of 12 characters could only be generated by taking Ian Duncan Smith, Jeremy Cutter-Hunt and Michael Gove, and then cloning Gove 9 nine times. So far they have managed to get themselves trapped by 3 cave trolls, a bunch of goblins, some spiders, the wood elves and finally the loser humans so smart they live next to a dragon and immediately believe in the trickle-down economics rousingly proposed by Thorin. (Then again so many people have been swallowing that neo-liberal guff for the last 30 years this is wretchedly plausible...)<br/><br/>However useless the dwarfs are (bearing in mind they've shared the minor details of their quest with everyone in Laketown, and still set off in search of a secret tunnel in order to take that dragon by surprise), those trying to catch them are even worse. So Azog the (supposedly) scary Orc repeatedly fails to catch the dwarfs where everyone or everything else succeeds. It is little wonder his armies get turned into chutney in LotR since he demonstrates an ineptitude on a scale so vast it that makes Douglas Haig look like a strategic mastermind. In fact he is only out-classed in stupidity by two characters, the first being Smaug himself, who is so stunningly useless he is outwitted by the dwarfs (for whom we have already established a stratospheric standard for incompetence) using a tactic that would embarrass a kindergarten. The second character being...<br/><br/>Four -- Goodgulf, or Gandulf to use his stage name, is overwhelmingly useless. Not ""Gandulf the Grey"", more ""Gandulf, the Fairly Shaite Wizard"". If he is not abandoning the dwarfs to their collective fates, he is playing chicken. In the first movie, confronted by Azog, instead of invoking some mighty incantation, he runs up a tree and sets fire to fir cones (D&D's Magic Missile is actually Fiery Fir-cone, who knew?) with the added distinction that evidently self-preservation is not his strongest instinct as he sets alight the very object providing his protection. ""I'm Gandulf, Gandulf the Grey. As in: Gandulf, the Rather Short on Grey Cells."" Fortunately the bird-brained is saved by some birds for him to survive into this movie, where his contribution to the quest is to hide from the orcs, flee from the bearman, abandon the dwarfs at Mirkwood, and get himself captured in Dol Guldur; only the movie ends before any ornithological deus ex machina can save him. So next movie then...<br/><br/>Incompetence on a Middle Earth scale. Unfortunately this extends to the story telling. I'm all for suspending belief and it being a fantasy and all that, but at least make the internal characterisation, motivation, plot etc consistent. It is so sloppy: my suspension of belief stops at the point where it is impossible to find some halfway decent scriptwriters who can tell a story properly and get all the action, romance, excuse for 3D visuals, etc the director wants into it, yet retain some flavour of the original story and a bit of internal logic."

The lighthearted atmosphere from the book, that shone so brightly over the 1st part of the his version of the Hobbit, is no longer here, the strange story lines that were added to tie every thing together so no loose end is left and everyone watching the film knows that Peter Jackson did tell us all there was to know. An exact opposite of Tolkien's original who kept always saying (or implying) that middle earth has much more to it than he could ever cover with his stories. It's a difference in egos that doesn't always work for Jackson. Even though he did create a magnificent fantasy epic. Much darker than the first part, much more action packed very high quality of acting performances by all involved. The sins against the original book aren't as grave as those he committed with his LoTR trilogy, mainly because the Hobbit as I already said is a simpler story that doesn't allow for miss representations of the author's intentions. Jackson simply had to invent all these from scratch.<br/><br/>I'm all for re-imagining a story, but if you do so at least be honest and tell us that's what you did, like Tim Burton did when he made his version of Alice. Jackson never said any such thing, if he did it was kept a secret from most of the viewers, which is plain shame as far as I'm concern. I know everyone is going to hate this review to pieces, so many ""Jacksoners"" are following every bit of film he creates trampling in their wake over all those who dare oppose him. But I personally think that had he kept himself closer to the original, he would've ended with a better movie. It was so with the first part, but I feel like his ego couldn't share the credit with the original author anymore, so that's what we got. It's fun to watch - it's just a different story we're watching than the one we were promised."
"daniel-misciagna88","10","8","15","22 March 2014"," The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
","I loved this film! It out did 'An Unexpected Journey' by a long shot. That film is good too. However 'Desolation of Smaug' delivers far more action, thrills, and its darker making it the better movie. Its a fantastic joy ride through Middle-earth. The special fx and art design are beyond superb. True eye candy! Loved the beautifully composed, and many times dark, music (score). All the cast members did a great job at performing their roles. The story is somewhat faithful to the book, however out of all director Peter Jackson's films based on Tolkien's world, this one deviates the most. It didn't bother me though. I understand its a movie, not a book. Certain liberties had to be taken (changes and additions) in order for this film to work. And it works remarkably well! I am a huge fan of Tolkien and was more than happy to experience more of Middle-earth in Jackson's pleasant view. It was lovely to see events from 'The Lord of the Rings' appendices. The director, cast, and crew do an outstanding job at succeeding expectations for die hard fans of the Tolkien universe. Just expect more than what is read in the only 300 page book many of us know. The barrel chase scene was exciting beyond my expectations. Smaug was absolutely impressive and terrifying. Also the events involving the Necromancer adds more depth and thrill to this film. Overall, best movie I've seen all year! And after the cliffhanger ending, I wait with great anticipation for 'The Hobbit: There and Back Again' due out late next year."
"bela-petr","6","8","15","16 December 2013"," Peter Jackson﻿ kills the story with an endless series of battles
","""Stories are the most important thing in the world. Without stories, we wouldn't be human beings at all.""<br/><br/>The Hobbit is not a battle. It's a story. A brilliant, beautiful story. The Desolation of Smaug is, in contrast, an action movie which bears little resemblance to the joy of the book. The mesmerizing chapter in the House of Beorn? Forget it, Mr Jackson doesn't want to waste time with such crap. Bilbo's stealth endeavors and hopeless situation in the Elvenking's halls that you live through with the characters for weeks? No way, we need to rush to yet another battle scene. <br/><br/>On and on, the viewer is being robbed of any chance to emotionally connect with the story. I'm very sorry for everyone who hasn't read the book because you must be totally confused what (and why) the hell is going on. In the end, you can stay assured about only one thing: that there's another battle just around the corner (and that some elves are gonna come out of nowhere to slay the orcs).<br/><br/>For me, it's the most useless movie of the five LOTR/Hobbit installments. Let's hope the battling nature of the last one will make up for this misstep at least a double times."
"room102","5","3","4","10 October 2015"," For fans only
","I was never a fan of the series and I'm not going to be now.<br/><br/>This is a 30 min story, squeezed into a 2.5-hours movie. As always with Peter Jackson, Technical side is excellent but the movie has no soul and it stretches endlessly with slow speeches and scenes that are cartoonish and endless (dinosaur chase, anyone?). Why is the barrel riding sequence better than the jungle scene in ""Indiana Jones 4""?<br/><br/>Actually, I'm amazed that I saw the whole thing - obviously I fast forward a lot - since with the previous movie(s) I gave up after 20-30 min.<br/><br/>I wasn't impressed by the barrel scene, which I heard great reviews about. The dragon ""scene"" was OK, but about 10 times the length it should have been.<br/><br/>The effects of putting ""regular size"" people together with dwarfs are amazing and completely seamless."
"Quinoa1984","7","3","4","3 January 2015"," Smaug rules, and the rest of the movie... is okay (thought I'd say 'drools' didn't ya)
","Bilbo is supposedly the lynch-pin of this whole story - hell, it's called 'The Hobbit' after all, and it's about (as the song in the 1977 animated film starts, 'The greeeeatest adventurrrre') - but damn if you'd know it watching the majority of this entry. I say the 'majority' as he does show up in large part at the end, when it comes time to enter the castle in the mountains and the face-off against the dragon, Smaug, who has hoarded over the dwarfs' gold. But with the exception of a few scenes scattered about, it felt like there was a lack of Bilbo, which is a shame since Martin Freeman is so moving and funny and on-point in this role of the quirky 'straight-man' to these much quirkier, rambunctious dwarfs led by who is arguably the real protagonist - or co-protagonist - Thorin Oakensheild.<br/><br/>Let's talk about that for a moment. For what he's asked to do, Richard Armitage isn't exactly bad in the role, not by a long-shot. He is there and present in this character if the hardcase leader of the dwarfs who has a rightful problem with his father, the former king of the dwarfs, being killed. He wants revenge and justice and so on, but the character just feels so flatly written and plain, somehow there was just a little more dimension with the Lord of the Rings trilogy's mirror character, Aragorn. Thorin comes into a scene and makes his declarations, which is what you do in a fantasy epic like this. But I never really felt for the character so strongly or his quest so much, despite the ending of the first film where there is something of an arc between him trusting Bilbo. Again, not a bad character, but something that I wish was a little more strongly written or played dimension-wise.<br/><br/>Like the other two films in this unnecessary trilogy, there's padding. This is like looking at a nervous football player, loaded up so that he doesn't get pummeled. It's mainly in the inclusion of the elves, and an elf/dwarf romance that comes when the dwarfs are captured momentarily and the really handsome one and Evangeline Lilly's elf fall for one another. Oh, and Legolas returns and there's sort of a hint of a love triangle, because these epics need them nowadays. Not bad actors, once again, and Lilly has more than proved herself on Lost to be capable with a bad-ass action heroine as her character is here. But where's the purpose with the main story? There's no connective tissue with this, and just enough (though added not from the Hobbit but from appendices that Tolkien wrote - just that word 'appendices' like an organ you don't need) with Gandalf on his separate quest which will figure in to this whole SIX film epic at hand.<br/><br/>There's enough well-filmed action and peril to keep things moving along not briskly, but in a manner that I at least didn't fall asleep... well, I did get annoyed by a barrel chase for technical reasons (sure, throw in a low-quality go-pro camera in the river chase while you're mostly using the highest-quality RED cameras, sure, why the hell not?) But, at least, the sequence with Smaug is perfect. It's a marvelous CGI creation that ironically brings back together from Sherlock Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who voices and also does the motion-capture work for the dragon of the title. This is a sequence fraught with tension, clever dialog (much of it with Bilbo's riddles, and this is very similar to the animated film by the way), and intense action and suspense. It's what one wants to see from one of these movies, with a dollop of humor as well.<br/><br/>If only the rest of the film had that. Desolation of Smaug is a good movie, on the whole, but it's so uneven that it may frustrate those who aren't already super-psyched to return to Middle Earth anyway."
"eliasmanos","4","3","4","16 August 2014"," Industrialised and very 10's like
","I would rather skip the part with the major conflict most people have about chopping the book into pieces in favour of the film, and go straight to the feeling I got while watching it. What both my wife and I felt in almost every scene, was ""what the hell?"" and almost anger. First of all, this is not a fantasy adventure any more, but an action movie. Legolas goes all pew pew, martial dancing, etc. etc. The film has literally action scenes. Almost no photography, no scenery, no music, and most importantly; no logic in the progression of the plot. <br/><br/>Most scenes were extended to the limits of a nervous breakdown (e.g the barrel-river scene) and the characters/plot would got stuck for nothing, or because someone did something foolish. I mean, the whole film goes with countless ""Pippins throwing stones into wells"" only to have something to go on. In addition almost no major turn has any logic or reason. For example, the eagles that saved the fellowship, dropped the dwarfs just before their target on a dangerous place, when they could just as easily leave them a bit further, and to make things even worse, Gandalf abandons the fellowship before a death forrest only to go to Radagast (who does not even appear on the novel) to tell him to find Galandriel and then confront alone the strongest Ainur in existence in his own territory. <br/><br/>Only reason to rate this 5/10 is the novel, the (very good) SFX and a couple good photography scenes."
"tejasvi_hegde","5","3","4","17 July 2014"," Good for Trailer, but where is the real movie ?
","I had always been admirer of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and watched and enjoyed all three of them many times.<br/><br/>But The Hobbit series had been disappointing. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was not up to the mark set by ""The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>I was expecting ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" to be better.<br/><br/>But this movie failed to impress again.<br/><br/>Soul of any movie is story line, but it is missing.<br/><br/>It looks like the movie is created by by combining leftover shots of The Lord Of The Rings.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes are stereotype, does not keep the audience interested.<br/><br/>I know it takes a lot of effort and dedication to create these kind of movies, but for me as a viewer, it did not impress me as expected."
"westek12","2","3","4","11 July 2014"," Peter Jackson Killed JRR Tolkien
","I find it very hard to detect any trace of the rare magic that is JRR Tolkien in any of Jackson's works (with the ironic exception of Radagast's cameo appearance in An Unexpected Journey, which was never in The Hobbit). It's as if Jackson intended to write Tolkien out of the story. How could someone who has read and admired the writings of JRR Tolkien find license to alter the characters and story line in such a heavy-handed, broad and simple-minded way? It's like he can't get out of the way of the story. The very fact that Jackson's mediocre and wholesale rewrite of The Hobbit made it past the ""drawing board"" and all the way to the silver screen speaks to a lack of intelligence on his part and a lack of courage to those in a position to counter him.<br/><br/>Maybe someday, someone will come along and produce/direct a verbatim film wherein the essence of Tolkien is not lost in the process. Unfortunately it may take a while for the film industry to realize that The Hobbit (as well as The Lord of the Rings) were never truly adapted to film.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that Peter Jackson can someday create a story (of his own) that can rise to the level of JRR Tolkien. Hopefully then he will cease to butcher the works of the great masters and discover that well-financed tenacity has nothing what-so-ever to do with talent.<br/><br/>However, I am thankful that Jackson is not an astronaut, for if he were he would have surely found a way to defecate on the morning star."

","I'd say almost the whole movie was a disappointment except for the portrayal of Smaug and his enigmatic conversation with Bilbo but it bitterly becomes silly and disappointing after that again, because Smaug looks like a moron chasing the Dwarfs that long and he is not able to kill them because the dwarfs are obviously very 'quick' and 'smart' - I mean if they are that swift to dodge dragon fire, why the hell they need a burglar then? - obviously, in this installment there is no regard concerning the book, all the charming and fascinating details that made the plot unique have been removed and replaced by stupid and needless combat scenes that feel completely out of place. it doesn't feel natural at all, I mean The Hobbit deserved a much more elegant production and it could've been much more gracefully done than this stereotypical Hollywood battle movie!"
"ian-sharratt72","7","3","4","3 January 2014"," Is Peter Jackson losing touch with Tolkien
","The Hobbit is (dare I say it) precious to me. My father read it to me as a five year old each night before bed. I did the same with my oldest son when he turned five. <br/><br/>Overall, I've been happy with the Peter Jackson adaptations. There's plenty of 'true' Tolkien included and I've been able to tolerate the changes. DoS is no different but geez Jackson is pushing the limits.<br/><br/>The most frustrating thing about the hobbit movies is how inept the bad guys are at killing people. What's the point of establishing big, blood thirsty, killing machines when a soft serve with a sling shot is taking them down? <br/><br/>This takes away all feeling of menace within the movie and makes the periods of exposition almost unbelievable. How can we invest in the thought that a goblin army invaded and overthrew Moria when thirteen dwarfs survive an attack by thousands of goblins without a scratch? One of them was brandishing a soup ladle as a weapon! The kitchen staff should have been enough to defend Moria.<br/><br/>At one point in DoS the dwarfs had been bitten by giant spiders, imprisoned by elves and were armour-less, weapon-less and stuck in barrels floating down a river. <br/><br/>Then Legolas and Tauriel go tip-toeing and pirouetting across the boulders slaughtering orc after orc. Why was the last alliance of elves and men such a ferocious battle?<br/><br/>I didn't mind the introduction of Tauriel. Imagine if she had been introduced as the surviving member of an Elvish hunting party that got decimated by orcs. It would establish her credentials and have the orcs gain some much needed credibility. <br/><br/>Among others LotR had Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Theoden, Theodered, Denethor die or suspected dead. Faramir and Eowyn were grievously injured, all added weight to the story that these battles had consequences. The Hobbit movies are the poorer for lacking this edge.<br/><br/>I know I'll get howled down for this but I wouldn't have minded if Jackson had knocked off a couple of dwarfs along the way. Preferably Ori and Dori (how desperate was Thorin to have brought along those two cupcakes?) It would have rocked everyone back in their seats, given the bad guys some impetus and had us all wondering what was coming next. Would we have missed two dwarfs?<br/><br/>Back to Tauriel. I didn't mind that there was an introduced character, I didn't mind that she was a she and I could even live with the bizarre love triangle. <br/><br/>Are elves so superficial that Kili's eyebrow waggle, smutty double entendre and relative height were enough to get her immortal heart racing?<br/><br/>It was just clumsy that she was into Kili based only on his look and long before he revealed his poetic, romantic side and she'd sucked the poison out of his...(see Jackson you're not the only one).<br/><br/>Has Elrond been waiting 800 years for Celeborn to get out of the way so he can have a crack at Galadriel?<br/><br/>Why was Legolas such an angry young Elf? There's parts of LotR where he is quite grim but in DoS he's like a troubled teen. It would have been nice to have visited Legolas at home but his introduction as a major character was completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The handling of his hots for Tauriel was, like a lot of things, raced through.<br/><br/>Thranduil: Legolas likes you. Tauriel (breathless): Does he? But you would never allow a guy like him and a gal like me...? Thranduil: No. I wouldn't.<br/><br/>Done. Move on.<br/><br/>Thranduil was great. He really tapped into that Elvish other worldly quality but in a distant, angry sort of a way. <br/><br/>I've heard people unhappy with the brevity of Beorn's appearance in DoS. Beorn is a classic character but I can understand his limited involvement...all they did in the book was eat honey cakes and drink milk. I'm looking forward to seeing Beorn kicking ass in the Battle of Five Armies. <br/><br/>Likewise the journey through Mirkwood. Jackson established the confusion and drowsiness of the forest without having the dwarfs chasing fairy lights all night. The spider battle was brief and intense but like a lot of things in these adaptations we've seen it before in LotR. <br/><br/>We see in Bard yet another ""can he escape the shadow of his ancestors"" storyline however I think the third hobbit movie will be better for his characters development given the major role he is to play. <br/><br/>The Dol Guldur back story is well handled and provides a link to make this series a true prequel to the LotR movies. The shot of Gandalf charging across the bridge with staff in one hand and Glamdring in the other is truly iconic.<br/><br/>Smaug. Smaug's introduction was brilliant. The treasure horde was of a scale that couldn't be imagined and the slow reveal of the dragon was amazing. Smaug's voice and movements were perfect. The riddling with Bilbo was intense and very evocative of the book. But...we have yet another epic villain who couldn't hit the side of a barn!<br/><br/>The Erebor sequences of Smaug playing hide and seek with the Dwarfs were obviously intended to provide an action packed climax to part two but all they achieved was stripping yet another key villain of his power and menace.<br/><br/>The gold statue of Thror is one of the most ridiculous movie scenes of all time. After going to all the trouble of setting it up, Smaug simply shakes like a dog after a bath and everything is fine. <br/><br/>As always the landscapes and sets of Middle Earth are breath taking. The performances are very good. <br/><br/>The problem for mine is that Jackson seems less sure of where and how he needs to vary from the original text than previously."
"kmcloone96","7","3","4","3 January 2014"," Not a bad movie by any means, just not as good as it could have been
","Before going in to The Desolation of Smaug, I had been given the impression it was quite simply one of the best films this year. Apparently improving over the original in every single way and being just as entertaining as Peter Jackson's previous trilogy, it seemed almost a little too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was. <br/><br/>The film begins almost exactly where An Unexpected Journey left off, with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the group of 13 accompanying dwarfs heading towards the Lonely Mountain to reclaim it from the terrifying dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The ring Bilbo finds in the first movie however, is having a clear impact on his mental well- being, which is comparable to that of Frodo's in The Two Towers. The group soon make their way through the insidious Mirkwood Forest, unaccompanied by the great Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), and eventually seek brief refuge in Lake-Town before heading to the mountain itself to confront Smaug. <br/><br/>Strangely, the first third of the movie is noticeably slow, which is odd because it would be expected all of the build-up would take place in the first movie. Yes, there are some action sequences early on, but they weren't as engaging as they probably should have been. That's not to say they were boring, but when compared to the expansive fights in The Lord of the Rings, they weren't really anything special. Also, certain scenes seemed to lack very much musical score, which may have been an issue with the cinema I went to but it detracted hugely from the on-screen events. Returning characters such as Bilbo and Gandalf were just as enjoyable to watch as in the first movie, it's just a shame that they weren't in The Desolation of Smaug quite as much as I would have liked. <br/><br/>Before it sounds like I hated the movie though, I want to make a point of saying when things went well, they went very, very well. Despite the lacklustre action at parts, there were specific scenes (such as one involving white-water barrel rafting) which were not only exciting, but they redeemed many of the slower moments of the film. Couple this with the inclusion of characters such as Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a genuinely intimidating dragon towards the closing scenes of the movie, and it's easy to see how there were several things which worked in The Desolation of Smaug's favour, it's just a shame that the negatives often overshadowed the positives. <br/><br/>Smaug himself was easily the highlight of the film for me. Although he is shown briefly in the trailers, you haven't seen him properly until you watch the movie for yourself. If Peter Jackson does one thing correctly, it's scale. The combination of the vast environments with clever camera-work and exceptional CGI meant that Smaug appeared incredibly sinister throughout all of the scenes he appeared in, and the choice of Benedict Cumberbatch to voice him could not have been made better. If there was a single reason to see the film that I could think of, it would be for this infamous dragon. <br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug definitely isn't a let-down, it's just not quite as good as I had hoped it would be. The CGI was consistently breath- taking and the majority of the film was entertaining, but that doesn't save some segments from being boring and drawn-out. Also, it ends on a cliff-hanger which has scale rivalling The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Fans of Tolkien and Peter Jackson will definitely love this second Hobbit instalment, but it's difficult to recommend it to an average movie fan."
"FeatherlessBiped","5","3","4","28 December 2013"," Slightly better than the first ... that's not saying much.
","I initially rated the first Hobbit movie 6 out of 10 and this one 7. On further reflection, I was too generous; they're lucky to each get 5.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug still has Peter Jackson's remarkable production values, and it has a bit less goofiness (the goblin king in the first movie was nauseating to watch).<br/><br/>However, this film bears painfully little resemblance to the book. The filmmakers:<br/><br/>*added a slew of characters (Tauriel the elf-woman; Legolas the elf-dude, who appears in The Lord of the Rings but not in The Hobbit; the blackhearted aide to the master of the lake town; etc.)<br/><br/>*inflated other characters' roles (Bard ferries the dwarfs to the lake town and hides them, and he is suspected of seeking to overthrow the Master; the Elvenking is now named Thranduil and gets involved in various matters, such as Legolas's fondness for Tauriel; etc.)<br/><br/>*reduced some of the most charming bits (the conversation as more and more dwarfs arrive at Beorn's house; various songs)<br/><br/>*and added so much running-from-the-orcs and running-from-the-dragon footage that the story becomes more action than thought (it seems like Run Lola Run set in Middle Earth).<br/><br/>I could go on - about the use of athelas, about the elf/dwarf love triangle, about Radagast being portrayed as a buffoon - but my main point is that, while this film is sometimes entertaining, it is unlike The Hobbit, in plot or in spirit. The bare similarities and the fine technical aspects made me give it a grudging 7, but after further consideration I felt 5 was more realistic."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","4","26 December 2013"," Promising
","The general consensus is that ""The desolation of Smaug"" has generally succeeded in avoiding the pitfall of ""An unexpected journey"": an excruciatingly slow pacing. Even when I was not particularly bothered by the somewhat languid pace of ""Journey"", I did find ""Smaug"" more entertaining, at least in the conventional perception of entertainment. With the groundwork nicely laid in the first movie, the sequel moves along in welcomed simplicity, tracing the quest (this, I coined) to recover treasures in The Lonely Mountain. Sprinkled liberally with first-rate CGI action, the adventure unfolds in three parts: (1) the journey continues (highlighted by a spider colony), (2) Mirkwood Forest and (3) The Lonely Mountain (including its satellite Lake-town and the mountain itself). There is also a spin off line when Gandalf detours by himself, meets Radagast (""The Brown"") and together visit Dol Guldur where they make the devastating discovery that Sauron is abroad again.<br/><br/>Just as in the first movie, there are welcome links to LOTR, first through the two hauntingly beautiful Howard Shore creation of the themes for the Hobbits (soothing and heart-warming) and the Ring (mysterious and sinister). By far the most popular addition in this one is Orlando Bloom reprising Legolas – and they even have the name of Gimli thrown in for good measure (mentioned by his father). Of the new characters, Tauriel the lovely Elf (and Legolas's love interest) outshines all others. Portraying her is Evangeline Lilly whom you would not forget if you have seen her in ""Real Steel"" (2011) where she radiates heart-melting warmth whenever she is on the screen. Here, she and Bloom team up in some of the best Elven gymnastics scenes that you have ever witnessed. And then, during a healing scene speaking Elvin words of magic, you could almost believe that you are looking at Liv Tylor as Arwen.<br/><br/>Of the other newcomers, Luke Evan is the most prominent as the boatman who smuggles our protagonists (all 14 of them) to Lake-town, a man name Bard who is actually more than what meets the eye. Another veteran Stephen Fry (brother Mycroft to Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes) plays the politically shred mayor of the town. For another Sherlock association, lead actor Martin Freeman's partner in the B.B.C. TV serious of updated Sherlock Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch provides the voice for the titular creature Smaug.<br/><br/>People who are dismayed at the cliffhanger hook at the end really have no cause to be. It is all but expected. The question is just that whether the conclusion ""There and back again"" in 2014 will satisfy. That, we can only wait to find out."
"eshwarmail","7","3","4","25 December 2013"," Bigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before.
","Definitely more exciting and entertaining than its previous installment that was inevitably burdened with introductions and setting up the base which to my opinion was a little sluggish. With more references to the LOTR storyline, this would appeal better to the fans of the popular trilogy. Shot and released in premium 3D, the number of effects are comparatively very minimal considering we should wear those glasses for its exhaustive runtime. However due to lack of enough interesting characters to root for unlike the LOTR series, the screenplay completely relies on the adventure element which is again a little unsatisfactory having seen similar if not better content already. <br/><br/>In a prologue, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) reveals the reason why Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is part of the 'fellowship' of dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage). To reclaim their Kingdom Erebor, Thorin has to unite the 7 dwarf families which is only possible with the possession of Arkenstone jewel lying beneath the fire breathing dragon Smaug inside the lonely mountain accessible through the hidden door. Bilbo as a burglar is expected to steal that. With a little help from the Elves especially Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) who is smitten by a witty dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the dwarf pack manages to keep the Orcs off their tail, but would they be able to do the same of Smaug comprises the remaining storyline.<br/><br/>LOTR's effectiveness comes from its multi-layered story with characters coming from a wide variety of backgrounds each having their perceptions and approaches to the common objective and the presence of Gollum. With none of those elements present, this edition of the Hobbit still comes out to be entertaining (sans the awe element). Another major drawback was that none of the lead characters actually standout. Having mastered the craft in presenting the beauty and wonders of middle-earth, Peter Jackson's experience, expertise and his aesthetics play a major role in the making of this enormous project. The climax of the movie doesn't go too well with the title of the movie, but leaves you lingering as good as 'The Two Towers'. The special effects, locations, costumes are directly progressed from past experience, but the action set pieces were a far cry from the middle-earth battles we have seen before. The background score doesn't leave a note you would recall. Having discussed quite a few drawbacks, there is still some good we can take from this movie like the following 1. The dwarfs escape from the Elves 2. Introduction of Smaug 3. Prologue featuring the town Bree and the famous tavern 'The Prancing Pony' 4. Legolas and Tauriel's incredible battle skills 5. Witty lines from Bilbo and Kili<br/><br/>Bigger, better and more entertaining than the previous edition, but falls incredibly short from the adventures of middle-earth we have seen before."

I don't have a problem with Jackson straying from the actual Hobbit story line. But there is very little story here.<br/><br/>The dragon, Smaug, is very well done as is his voice.

","Another triumph for Peter Jackson. Like many people I questioned the wisdom of splitting this book into three parts. It smacked of profiteering from the franchise. However, having seen all three parts, I can't see how he could have done anything else. This final part is exciting and moves along at such a pace that I couldn't believe the time had passed so quickly. I won't go into the plot but suffice to say there are shocks along the way so don't expect everything to end happily. The battle scenes are as usual breathtaking - however I will have to watch again to fully understand who is fighting who. Nonetheless it is very exciting. Full marks to Richard Armitage and Martin Freeman for their acting but it is the blend of different characters that really make this film. I'll be the first in line for the box set!"

","WARNING: Some of the info here may be regarded as spoilers. Do not read if you have not seen the film.<br/><br/>The stars are purely for a few fine visuals.<br/><br/>I cannot separate my Hobbit watching from my decades-long Tolkien obsession. Therefore, I cannot review this film except from the perspective of a disappointed Tolkien fan. But so what? That is, in fact, a perfectly valid perspective to take on a film based on a well- known and beloved book and created universe. When a film maker sets out to do a film with such source material, he accepts that certain expectations come with it. Sadly, Peter Jackson, who is a Tolkien fan himself, has jumped the shark in these Hobbit movies. For the record, I love the LotR films by Jackson. They are not perfect, but they are largely faithful in spirit to the source material. Where he deviates, I understand WHY he deviated, even if I don't always agree with the changes. Sometimes, he even improves on Tolkien. I have been surprised at certain details which I thought I remembered from the books, only to find they actually came from the films. But mostly, the LotR films are explainable in terms of Tolkien's world. In addition, the very way the films were made makes that world seem like a real, living place. The characters seem like real people or creatures. In contrast, the Hobbit movies are mostly artificial and contrived. I cannot detail all of the ways that The Desolation of Peter Jackson-- Smaug, I mean--grated on me. That would require more viewings than I am willing to give the film and more time and effort than it is worth. So let me give one example each of where Jackson added something which might have worked, but blew it, and where he simply blew it. 1.)Elf-Dwarf relationships. Sorry, but Elves and Dwarfs simply don't fall in love, ever. It's contrary to both of their natures by everything that we know about the races from Tolkien. Therefore, it is contrary to Nature itself. That means the very idea is just too damn kinky for Tolkien's world. HOW IT COULD HAVE WORKED: Tauriel strikes up a simple friendship with Kili. That's perfectly plausible as we know from Legolas's later friendship with Gimli (and Kili is quite likable, maybe TOO likable for a dwarf). Legolas could have been indignant that Tauriel was friends with a dwarf. That would have been a wonderfully ironic stance for Legolas in light of future events. It would have added depth to Legolas's character across the trilogies, as would have his relationship with Tauriel. But the ""love triangle"" angle is preposterous on its face. 2.) The decision to go full CGI with the baddies. I'm sure that the gray guy chasing the dwarfs around for most of the film will be a fine villain in the video game, but Lurtz from The Fellowship of the Ring was FAR more menacing because he had a real presence in the form of a real flesh and blood actor playing him on screen. Jackson just blew it in the basic decision process here. In a tendency which is visible even in the LotR trilogy, and which has grown in every film since then, he is letting his movie-making toys gradually overwhelm his simple movie- making good sense. This has not been a happy trend for him, in my estimation. RANDOM GRIPES: --Smaug was the most interesting character in the film, as in the book. No problem. But why am I more impressed with the dragon from Dragonslayer of 32 years ago than with the smooth CGI creation here? --I hated the whole Lake Town sequence. It was depressingly ridiculous. --Why don't these dwarfs have BEARDS?? Even young dwarfs have BEARDS-- long, flowing beards-- not just a few random whiskers. --Decide, Peter. Are the dwarfs hardy adventurers or bumbling clowns? They can't be both. It throws the tone off. --It is perfectly clear from Tolkien's writings that Gandalf enters Dol Guldur by stealth. He is flat out forbidden by the Valar to match power with power against the Enemy. We don't need Gandalf to try to be some bad ass hero dude. He needs to be smart, know his limitations, and work with the White Council. Sauron was sort of cool, but the sequence was not. I will dutifully go to see the third film, also, but I won't care to ever see any of these films again, in all probability. Final gripe: spell check keeps changing d*w*a*r*v*e*s to ""dwarfs."" Sigh..."

"s_campanale","5","10","20","16 December 2013"," The Desolation of Tolkien! - The Main Course arrives and it tastes off..
","Almost everything that needs to be said this film has already been said, not just now but last year when the whole 'three epics' plan was unveiled. <br/><br/>Of course it is ridiculous to extend a simple 300 page fairy story (not an insult to call it that, being a staunch Campbellian) to three 3 hour movies and to try and inject it with a lot of fake gravitas and importance not fitting or suitable to the subject. The producers know this, and Peter Jackson knows it too. Jackson strived for years to make the ultimate motion picture experience of Tolkien's classic, and it worked, and at a decades remove it is now rightly a touchstone of popular culture on a par with Star Wars and Star Trek, and will probably remain so forever. He has done what he needed to, there is nowhere left for him to go now, nothing left for him to prove. Gulliermo Del Toro was given Jackson's blessing to make the most incredible movie of 'The Hobbit', but things went south and New Line went to him to make a 'product' and that is what he has made. There is almost no guile in this project, no hiding behind claims of art of reinvention. This is 'Peter Jackson's shameless cash grab' pure and simple. <br/><br/>The way that ridiculous action scenes and contrived 'dramas' of the cheesiest and most shop-worn kind are shoehorned into the narrative is literally laughable. One moment someone will be having a discussion or a little scene from the book, then suddenly doors will slam open and hundreds of Orcs will rush in and a stupid 10 minute fight scene will ensue complete with cod-heroic music to complement the cod-heroics and embarrassing dialogue! The book will flow, then suddenly two characters will start engaging in a long winded, stomach churning romance that would shame even the most shameless teen fiction! It is almost like watching a parody of fantasy action made by Mel Brooks, the Zucker brothers or the South Park team. Jackson must know how ridiculous it all is, and perhaps that is his big in-joke, rather like how the once great Ridley Scott has been increasingly delighting in extracting the urine from audiences and critics with celluloid 'fingers' like 'Robin Hood' 'Prometheus' and 'The Counsellor'. I don't know if the producers know or even care? They are just out to make as much buck as they can, and it's working.<br/><br/>In no way can episode 1, or this instalment be considered an adaptation of 'The Hobbit', hence the ire of fans on this site and beyond. One positive however is once 'The Lord of the Rings prequels' are completed next year, there will be room to make a REAL version of the novel at some point, and that will no doubt be the film fans have always dreamed of and that Tolkien's masterpiece deserves. As for these 'films', the best way to enjoy them is either as straight up fantasy actioners (if you have no sense of irony) or as delirious camp burlesque parodies of all the tropes 'LOTR' embodied. <br/><br/>As to the film itself, the Dwarfs we met in the first film have literally melded into a composite whole, and Bilbo has become a spectator in the story. Apart from his two 'in the book' heroic moments (slaying spiders and taunting a big dragon) he does virtually nothing. Legolas is drawn back, though his inclusion is not so egregious as some others. Along for the ride is Tauriel (the very lovely Evangeline Lilly) who has the same role 'expanded Arwen' did in 'LOTR', ie to add some oestrogen and some romance to a story that had none. She is the standard D&D 'hot sassy bow slinging action Elf in a tight outfit' sex fantasy and does plenty of bow slinging and sexy orc slaying, then gets involved in aforementioned 'absurd romance' with one of the dwarfs (Kili) that leads to equally absurd 'romantic triangle' with Legolas who has the Elvin hots for her. Which will we she choose? 'Team Kili' or 'Team Legolas'? Does anybody care? Does Jackson care if anybody cares? <br/><br/>Ridiculous time killing action scenes include the barrel escape from the Woodland Elves castle, which has been expanded into a 20 minute never ending parade of action so utterly absurd it can only be meant as parody. Equally dumb is the chase involving the titular dragon Smaug. Smaug is voiced and motion captured by Benedict Cumberbatch, and is not bad considering he was what the entire trilogy was being sold on! Well animated and a credible 'intelligent' Dragon with impeccable English manners, he plays out his 'in book' scene with Bilbo nicely, then has to take part in a stupid 25 minute 'chase' around the mines in which (A) it is so easy for him to kill his enemies that he literally doesn't bother (B) an over elaborate scheme to fire up furnaces to melt gold to cast a giant statue that will distract Smaug and then melt instantly, drowning him in a lake of boiling gold. No spoiler to say that after all that he just brushes himself off, gets flustered and flies off to 'show them what he does when he's angry!', or rather he will next Xmas because the film ends there! <br/><br/>Nice additions to cast include Luke Evans as Bard (now popular revolutionary instead of Captain of the guard) and Stephen Fry as the pompous and self-important town headman, (perfect casting?) as well as Lee Pace making for an equally vain and self-interested Elvin King Thranduil, the slimy isolationist to Tauriel's hardy interventionist.<br/><br/>We've had the starter (OK) and the main course (Tolerable) and so now we just have to wait another year for the desert! Can you contain your anticipation?"
"lookinproductions","4","11","23","15 December 2013"," Disappointing
","Me and my friend were dying to see the second movie from this saga, but honestly mostly we were disappointed. I was a cinematography student, so I call it a professional disease to search for errors and mistakes while watching a movie. Most of you might disagree but still I want to share my opinion. There were not that many errors I could put my finger on in the first movie The unexpected journey"" that is why I was so anxious to finally see this one. Firstly I will start with everything that was good : The plot was entertaining, had a good level of suspense, I was waiting to see what will happen next. The dragon itself was done beautifully in most scenes it looked simply amazing, so applause for that amazing job. The Lake-town was amazing, the sunset coloring, the texture of the buildings stunning. Now on to the bad.... There were scenes where it was obvious that it would have been a lot easier to film in reality that to create a 3d manipulation or a computer graphic. Most of the fighting or escaping scenes were done horribly. The part with the barrels tragic, it seemed like I was looking at a video game on the big screen that is all. The melted gold looked like tin foil that was put in the oven. In most of the scenes it was better to show less and concentrate on some parts then to make a bad big picture which was done most of the times. The part were the Ork and Legolas ride on the bridge oh my god... I wanted to stand up and leave it was so badly done, a horse was shorter and was running not like it was supposed (based on the anatomy) the bridge looked like it was drawn with photoshop. And the people who were working on this were seriously thought that nobody will point their fingers on that? Honestly it was terrible. I really hope that they will work a lot harder on the upcoming film otherwise what is the point in doing a film based on such an amazing book if you don't put enough effort it to making it a good one."
"mikerapuano","9","11","23","13 December 2013"," Possibly the best Middle-Earth film to date.
","I feel I need to start by saying I have not read The Hobbit, nor any of the Lord of the Rings books for that matter. I will not be discussing any aspect of the film in relation to the book. I have, however, seen all the Lord of the Rings films, and An Unexpected Journey in their theatrical and extended cuts. That being said, and having thought about this for a while, I can honestly sum up my feelings on The Desolation of Smaug in one sentence.<br/><br/>I believe this is the greatest Middle-Earth film to date.<br/><br/>I enjoy the Lord of the Rings films, my personal favorite being Return of the King. Largely because of the fact that Peter Jackson brilliantly brought the story to life in a way that felt like you were watching an dramatized account of long lost history rather than a fantasy story. However, I do believe that the films are, put simply, too long. The films aren't terribly consistent in terms of pacing, and there are some great moments in between what feels a little dull at times. They go from genuinely engaging to sometimes flat out boring very quickly, and repeat that cycle throughout the films. (And, no I don't mean solely elaborate fight scenes when I say engaging.) This was my major flaw with the trilogy.<br/><br/>In 2012, when An Unexpected Journey was released, I went in with mixed feelings. After seeing it, I found it had the same problems mentioned above, but without much engaging scenes in between what felt like filler. The movie moves at an infuriatingly slow pace, and it could easily be half as long and still feel monotonous. Not to mention the fact that the entire film has an atmosphere of silliness, which makes it impossible, when the characters encounter actual danger, to feel any sense of concern for them. This set my expectations nice and low for The Desolation of Smaug, and I'm overjoyed to be dead wrong.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is brilliant. There is one thing that separated it from all the films preceding it, and that is that the movie was NEVER dull. Having been introduced to all the characters in the first film, we return to the group continuing their quest toward the Lonely Mountain. The movie immediately gets going at a fast, thrilling pace, and just gets more and more engaging. The company comes across many obstacles, while still being pursued by the Orcs, minions of the Necromancer (whose presence much more evident in this installment). But the film reaches its climax the second that Smaug the dragon appears on screen, who, voiced magnificently by Benedict Cumberbatch, is easily the best and most terrifying part of the film. The film ended wonderfully in such a way that screams ""the best has yet to come"". This movie is an all together thrilling experience from start to finish, and for the first time in this series, it earns every second of it's running time. I won't go into detail plot-wise, to avoid spoilers, but I have nothing but praise for this movie and urge you to see this at your nearest IMAX as soon as humanly possible."

","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues to tell JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit in this overly stretched adaptation. What makes this different from the last one is this one finally steps up to focus more on its true epic form and toning down its playful goofiness a little bit. We got a warm welcome before and now the tone has become much bombastic. And just like the last one; even though this is just a piece of a story, it's already a gigantic experience. But even with all of its rich characters, exciting action, and lengthy runtime, the audience would still beg for more. So this sequel is basically a big bite of a special meal that you've been eating since last year.<br/><br/>They sure know how to turn these pieces into actual movies by extending the exposition, fan service, and action to stretch out the runtime. The pacing is now somewhat less slower and the flashbacks are fewer compared to the other. It's all fun to be honest, but knowing the fact that it's a split has always been a distraction, especially when this one has a remarkable focus on the main plot. At least An Unexpected Journey had a theme for the characters to appropriately make it a distinct single story. Here, there is little else to tell and have to really depend on the next part, which is why they had to add Elvish subplots, explore more stuff around the story, and find a way to tease the audience so they won't be left out hanging. It does have a good tease, but it's exasperating when it teases too much, because you'll have to realize that this film is just a huge chunk of the adventure that slightly end up anywhere.<br/><br/>The direction remains the same, there's always a sense of doubt and fortitude on the fate of the main characters, which makes it very compelling. But it was the special effects that once again steals the show. The filmmakers seem to have fun playing with their technical abilities which is why the CGI continues to get excessive, but the Smaug dragon was the impressive standout that looks more threatening and terrifying than the Orcs, while the exteriors keep everything look grand and beautiful. The cast are still terrific and charismatic as ever.<br/><br/>Bilbo's line, ""Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of your enormity"", is too the best way to sum up The Desolation of Smaug. The film is wide large tremendous, if not just a fragment of an adventure. Despite of the excess, its largeness actually made the film work, it was able keep it beyond entertaining. It's still not the best way to tell its story, because this is the point of the series when anyone can admittedly say an economical single film adaptation would be indeed a smarter move. But there's really no denying how fun it all turned out. The next part, There and Back Again, will definitely end up like the first two, and all we have to do is wait (again)."
"badger_chap","9","7","13","17 December 2013"," A rollicking ride through the cinematic universe so greatly devised.
","Much like the second installment of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy 'The Two Towers' , 'The Desolation of Smaug' is quite easily the hardest segment of this colossal fantasy epic to bring forward to the big screen - advancing upon the first film whilst setting up the final chapter. Luckily Peter Jackson knows his vision of middle earth- the realm in which this film takes place - to such a degree that the production of this follow on prequel never does anything less than progress the already impressive first movie whilst wetting the appetite most definitely for 'There and Back Again' - the finale of this filmy journey. Larger, bolder and yet still easily seen as a Middle Earth movie, 'The Desolation of Smaug' does a hell of a lot right, thus cementing itself as one of the grandest sequels to hit cinema screens. Through a rollicking beginning, progressive middle and exciting finale this middle piece easily transports its audience to the centre of the action, therefore making the film feel engrossing throughout and fast paced. Peter Jackson, and his team, have done wonders with the source material - stretching the small classic novel over three movies without making the plot feel prolonged unnecessarily, by incorporating added depth found in the authors other notes.<br/><br/>Following on from the first film, 'The Desolation of Smaug' once again follows the exploits of Bilbo Baggins, and his company of thirteen dwarfs. With the characters having already been established within the filmy universe, the second installment can not only progress via adding depth and tension to the storyline. This means that overall the film brings across a more mature feeling, and thus a heightened engrossment. However, to achieve this the film has to also progress the subject off its plot. With more characters, more action and more set ups, 'The Desolation of Smaug' does enlarge the already big first film in practically every way. This does bring the content of the film to another level of excitement when compared to the first - however some aspects of the storyline does seem to feel rushed still. Characters that appear prominent within the source material are not given enough screen time, with the focus more directed at the climatic showdown with the trilogies chief villains - of which there is two. This means that for all its grandeur, 'The Desolation of Smaug' will not convert Tolkien fanatics into liking the cinematic experience if the previous films were not to their idealistic depictions of the source material. <br/><br/>To conclude, 'The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug' is another triumphant return to a filmy universe in which such acclaim has already been placed, and through this resurgence, interest has bloomed. Peter Jackson once again showcases the fact that come Middle Earth based film productions, he has no equal. A perfect companion to the other already released films, the second part of the second trilogy is a sheer masterclass in what a fantasy epic can become. Once again the film rests on the shoulders of its lead actors, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Ian McKellen and once again they succeed in doing the film justice. Much like Serkis in the previous film, Cumberbatch is a scene stealer that is completely villainous within his roles. Balancing the two villains whilst making each seem different, he once again showcases the immense talent that he holds. A key factor to a key cinematic brilliance, 'The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug' is a fast paced, epically interesting film that will leave you breathless.

"jjjoakimm","5","18","42","11 December 2013"," I want to love it so bad.
","*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, BEWARE*<br/><br/>This movie is, like, i don't even know. I can't decide whether i enjoyed it or not. The amount of special effects is so incredibly high I was having a hard time figuring out whether it's an animated movie or not. Of course they are great, probably the best special effects in a movie since Avatar, but still everything just looks so wrong, way to much. Examples of that could be the Murkwood, where every single tree, bug or shroom would look completely fake. This could work in some movies or genres, like Sci-fi, but here, where the LOTR-trilogy showed such a great example of what you can accomplish with the New Zealand nature, it doesn't work for me. Other examples could be the melting of the golden statue, which just looked weird and completely impossible, or the fight Gandalf had with Sauron where Gandalf would forge new magical barriers over and over again, making the scene look kinda sloppy. The fact that they've also started animating the orchs instead of using actual people with costumes play them takes away much of what's so great with the fighting scenes and dialogs.<br/><br/>Aaand there's more. How could it even be possible to create three 2½ hour long movies based on a book containing roughly 300 pages?! In my opinion it's not possible, and The Hobbit is my proof. This movie contain so many dull lines, so many scenes that would have been fine if they would have been kept fast-paced. Instead we're having parts and dialogs being prolonged to the point of them starting to lose track of subject. Unnecessary scenes the movie would do perfect without, and even unnecessary characters! I mean, who is Tauriel and what role in the movie is she supposed to fulfill? It all starts with the elf's rescuing the dwarfs from the spiders in Murkwood, until they eventually capture them. Now, at this point, we're able to find out that Tauriel is a somewhat highly stationed officer amongst the elf's, with a crush on Legolas. Legolas also seems very fond of Tauriel, which obviously makes you believe that they will become a couple eventually. But then, all of a sudden, she falls in love with Kili after a very emotional conversation between the two about Kili's mother. At this point i was confused as f**k since it didn't really make any sense, their love for each other didn't continue anymore than the scene of her healing his wound later on, but that's it. All she really does is having a switch of love from Legolas to Kili and slaying a few orchs. (Her fighting scenes are pretty awesome though). There doesn't seem to be any real thought behind it. <br/><br/>If you're still reading this review, good, because now I'm done ""hating"". Truth to be told, i enjoyed this movie more than the first one. The action-scenes i felt that Hobbit: An unexpected journey lacked were brought out now, making the movie a whole lot more exciting. The appearance of Smaug and especially the voice-over from Benedict Cumberbatch really lifted the plot and also, Gandalfs side-quest made the tale a lot more interesting, which was needed since it would never have worked if we were to only follow the 13 dwarfs. <br/><br/>But to be honest, i walked in to that theater expecting a disappointment. Being bummed out from the previous movie, which i really did not like, i wasn't expecting much at all. But luckily for me it came out better than expected, and hopefully some of those confusing characters and scenes will be explained in the third and final movie."
"Dark Raven","4","9","18","17 December 2013"," HFR is horrible!!
","Yuck! First of all, the high frame rate (my first time seeing it) is truly horrible. Felt like I was watching a cheap TV period drama from 20 years ago. Is this progression or regression? I felt like I could almost see where the set ended at times. Everyone I saw it with felt the same. They found is distracting and cheap / behind the scenes feeling to it. Jackson, please stop with this. Film is dream, making it more life like loses that veil of illusion. <br/><br/>The over reliance on CGI didn't help matters. Gone are the real locations used in LOTR and instead it's mostly studio sets with greenscreen backing. This is lazy and it looks fake and without grit. The odd shot that was definitely outdoors felt alive and truly epic.<br/><br/>All this would be a little more tolerable if the script was engaging but it's boring. The stakes are not high and I couldn't give a toss whether they get to the mountain or not. Should have been one film not three. Either way I won't be watching part 3 next year."

","Well I just came back from a screening and I still have goosebumps. The movie just blew my expectations! <br/><br/>I followed the development of the movies very closely as I'm a big fan of the book and the LOTR trilogy. In the trailers I saw Legolas in 'what looked like' Laketown, orks attacking elves, gandalf in Dol Guldur... I was wondering, how will this all fit. How will Peter and his crew make this work, since those things don't happen in the book. I must say, they did it perfectly. The story and the twists are so good. They link everything well to each other and all makes sense.<br/><br/>The pacing of the first half of the movie is very fast and the beauty of every single image is astonishing. You should definitely watch it in 3D HFR. The cinematography was perfect! There's just so much happening with the dwarfs and other creatures.<br/><br/>The pacing of the second half of the movie is a bit slower but there are tons of 'WOW' or 'DID THAT JUST HAPPEN' moments. In this half the film deviates a lot from the book, but as a big fan of the book, I didn't mind at all. The changes all make sense and it made the film even better.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is, in my opinion, perfect! I didn't expect it, but without giving it away, I think they made a good decision to end the second film at that certain point. It'll be good for the beginning of the third. It'll surely start with a bang!<br/><br/>There's only one thing I wanted to see more of in this film, and that's Beorn. His appearance was too brief for such a wonderful character.<br/><br/>My god, this film is soooo awesome! Go see it already!!!"
"buny101","6","10","21","13 December 2013"," Desolation of Smug (not a typo)
","Peter Jackson took a trilogy of books, and made it into three movies. He then took a single book, and is trying to stretch it into three more movies. Do the math--if the Lord of the Rings had rec'd the same treatment, there would have been 9 movies in that series. Way too much. Wayyyyy to much. The Hobbit, if anyone needs to be told, is a wonderful book, but it is short on story and long on character development. This movie tries to flip that script and make it a wonderful story about a hobbit, and a dwarf seeking his kingdom, and making it an elf chick flick, and the redemption of a Bard, and let's skip the neat character of Beorn altogether, and add in Orc parties (and forget that the orcs couldn't/wouldn't travel in daylight). Let's change the character study of a odd hero and make it such a stupendous story that the title character, the Hobbit, is lost in the shuffle. Bilbo, for those that don't remember, barely did anything in the book. He forgot his walking stick. He only succeeded in delaying the trolls. He did wake up and holler when the orcs attacked their midnight camp in the mountains, but then he fell off the dwarf during their escape. He did fight in Mirkwood, and was instrumental in their escape, but after that, he is basically just tagging along with the group. And, that's OK! And even though, in the book, he is the linchpin for all the changes, it is more by his inaction than by his actions that he succeeds. Funny thing...that's what made him seem so believable, and accessible, and loved by millions of fans. The Hobbit is not just the most successful fantasy novel because it is the grandfather of all fantasy novels, but because the Hobbit was fleshed out and seemed like an actual creation. He seemed exactly like what we would be like in a fantasy setting. There is a reason that first edition The Hobbit sells for the same thing as first edition works of Twain. This movie has drawn upon the story, but it forgot to tell us his story, and instead is about ten different stories all shooting off in all kinds of arcs. Not a bad movie...but not the hobbit. I blame the director for this. He did the same thing in LOTR...he changed the characters to suit his purpose and forgot that it wasn't his story to tell...he should stick to telling the story and only show us his vision of what it looked like. He is not the creator here...Tolkien was. To think he can improve on such a story is, well, could be defined as smug. And thus, we have the Desolation of Smug."
"emvan","9","10","21","13 December 2013"," Peter Jackson Returns to Form!
","The second installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit adaptation is an immense improvement on the first, which (especially in the Extended Edition) is an excellent film, but falls far short of the historic brilliance of his LOTR. The biggest challenge facing Jackson and his fellow screenwriters in the entire adaptation was turning Bard into a full character worthy of Tolkien, and they have done so spectacularly well. A less obvious challenge was the fleshing out of the Elven King Thranduil (Legolas' father), and that's superb, too. The invented character of Tauriel doesn't have nearly the depth of those two, but she serves her plot purpose very well and is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Unlike the first movie, which simplified and dumbed down the back-story of the Dwarf and Goblin / Orc War for no good reason, the changes to the story here are nearly all well thought-through, and some are so smart that Tolkien himself might have applauded (e.g., what they've done with the moon rune inscription). There's a sequence from the back-story that has been moved into the time frame of this film that's just stunning. The relentless pursuit by Orcs that I thought marred the first film (too much, too soon) here feels organic. The result of all these smart decisions is a film that, much more than Part 1, feels like part of the same Middle Earth epic as the classic LOTR.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the film is a technical marvel (although I don't think the 3D adds much), featuring some of the best action sequences of any of the films, and -- are you surprised? -- Best. Dragon. Ever."

However, even with low expectations, i was disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie is faithful to the book in 2 things: the names (for the most part) and the destination.<br/><br/>Starting with a book comparison: The movie started with a scene at Beorn's place, and all the wittiness and magic of that scene just vanished. It was one of the best scenes in the book. The way they come 2 by 2, Gandalf's story... That would have been great to watch. In the movie, Beorn's eloquence is reduced to zero, and the reason why they stay at his place is because he hates Orcs more... I mean, please! What is this, some kind of a joke? You want some blood, in the book, goblins are supposed to still be chasing them, and Beorn kills some during the night, he makes sure the dwarfs' story is true.<br/><br/>About Mirkwood, that spider scene is way off too... I am glad at least gandalf is not with them. But what about the thirst, the temptation to drift away from the path, Bombur's misadventures, the dangers of the water there, the elven disappearing lights... That forest is not about hallucinations, it is not a drug center.<br/><br/>About the elves there... WHY change that? Why does it seem that everyone knows all details about the dwarfs' quest except for the dwarfs themselves? Since when did Thranduil ever fight a dragon? I am okay with Legolas being there since he is from there. But who is that tauriel? Not only is she not in the book, she is not a Tolkien character. She is not in any book.<br/><br/>A love story between an elf and a dwarf is totally wrong, unnecessary and actually kinda sick.<br/><br/>The characters are all messed up, the action is totally unnecessary and actually cheap in such a story. The escape from the elves should have been epic. To me, it was nothing but a physics law breaking water slide.<br/><br/>The laketown scene was totally off, bard was different, the dragon scene was... I mean, the dragon is never supposed to see Bilbo in the book. They have conversations but Bilbo never showed himself. The dwarfs were not the brightest bulbs, but they were not that stupid. That fight with the dragon was just an insult to Smaug, an epic character in the book. How can a dragon not kill at least one person there? How could he know about the return of the shadow if he was sleeping that whole time? How did he know about the Oakenshield, name supposedly given later at moria? How can the dwarfs survive in a room where the temperature is so high? I mean gold melts there... And iron doesn't? Also can you mold a big golden statue in minutes? I admire their skill for keeping that liquid statue standing for a while... Also, giving Smaug extra gold armor was pretty thoughtful...<br/><br/>There are many other details i will not write about. Just read the book, it is wonderful.<br/><br/>Now about the movie itself: Other than the things mentioned above, considering that it came after Lotr, and is trying to set the ground for the epic trilogy as a prequel, i think this movie is a failed attempt at taking the epicness of Lotr. The story is not exactly made for that. I call this movie autoplagiarism by peter jackson. It is sad that kids will see this movie, then see lotr and will compare Arwen to Tauriel, as they healed in the same way. Arwen descends from the Noldor, she is basically the equivalent of a princess in Imladris (Rivendell), she is one of the highest in honor among elves. Tauriel is basically a wild elf, she is nothing, and i wonder how she got to that captain position. Also, she has the nerve to talk back to the king AND calls herself an elf? The race that basically represents order? I actually hope she dies in the third. Most of the fight scenes are there just to waste time and for extra action. You do not need that, and since you call that movie ""the hobbit"", why not give more attention to Bilbo instead of making Legolas and Tauriel the stars? I mean, just let Legolas fight and people will be happy? No! The movie is actually way less fast-paced than it looks, the fight scenes just go on, that is all. So here is how i would describe it: fight the spiders, escape from the elves, fight the Orcs, fight the dragon. Where are the talk subtleties, the tricks played by Gandalf and Bilbo about everywhere, some things just should not be messed with.<br/><br/>Too much CGI makes the movie actually look bad. Everything looks fake, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Also, considering Tolkien's maps and distances, i would say the dwarfs are teleporting. There is no way they could cover that distance in a few days.<br/><br/>If you forget about Tolkien, the laws of physics, the basic fantasy principles, geography, then this movie may get a 5"
"surferdood","6","6","11","20 December 2013"," A good movie, if you've never read the books.
","The movie varies so much from the books, when watching the film, and trying to picture where you are in the book (which I always find myself doing) you get so lost, until you realize that 90% of the movie is just made up.<br/><br/>Even for people who have only watched LOTR films, you wont be satisfied, as the hobbit has lost all sense of immense epicness which you get in LOTR.<br/><br/>I like the way the added the bit with the Necromancer and explaining how he got to power, and what he was doing during the time of the Hobbit, as this explains allot to the book readers. But the epicness of Gandalf was also lost during his fight scenes with the Orcs, the Orcs looked like cartoon characters from a Disney film, whilst Gandalf seemed to of developed arthritis and fought like a 90 year old with a walking stick, not a the bad ass Gandalf the Grey we know and love.<br/><br/>They skip the bits I was looking forward to so much, like meeting Beorn, and having to come in two at a time, like in the books, but they don't even talk to him properly. This was probably because they where being chased by Orcs throughout the WHOLE film, which is such bull s***t from the books. In the film you just get bored of orc fights, start anticipating them and soon enough dread another dull fight.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has disappointed me as he has included absolute awful humor, in places like Laketown, which is first not in the book, and for a reason, but it is just aimed at such a young audience... I loved Martin Freemans humorous comments, but that's enough, just like the occasional comments from Gimili and Legolass in LOTR, they are funny, in small doses. <br/><br/>That brings me to the elves, they where great (apart from the fighting scenes, which had the same textures as a Nintendo Wii game) but elf's like Legolas' dad (Thranduil) where great, as they represented the true wood elf personality, shown in the books. The female elf Tauriel, after completely plucking her out of thin air (at least Legolass was alive during the Hobbit time), they decide to have her falling in love with a Dwarf... Yes Tolkien fans, she falls in love with a dwarf. At this point, all hope of redemption had well and truly gone.<br/><br/>Smaug was good, but they dragged his scene on for far too long, and mocking him seem thick, with the dwarfs running around him.<br/><br/>Last of all is character bonding, which in LOTR films was great, shown almost as well as the books, but so far in the hobbit films, it may as well be non existent. The only Dwarve I really liked was Balin, and you could see Balin and Bilbo bond, but that was about it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a fight filled (however good they are) film, and you haven't read the book (so you wont find yourself correcting and being confused at the majority of the film) then you will probably enjoy it. I understand that things have to change in films, but I wish Peter just kept to this LOTR film ways, keeping epicnes, a tad of comedy and only removing minimal from the books, and of course not adding loads of crap.<br/><br/>I did enjoy it at parts, but mostly disappointed, even more than I was with the first Hobbit film.<br/><br/>(sorry for lots of typos, couldn't be bothered to go through the whole thing!)"
"stijntje44","10","8","16","12 February 2014"," Great as long as your view isn't too narrow.
","Very very minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>I just don't understand the complaints about the movie, especially not about Bilbo not being the main character.<br/><br/>These books have many many layers, that what makes them so great, and I feel that this complaint is a failure to look at all of them. <br/><br/>The hobbit is a children's book, we can talk about how the story is about Bilbo finding out that there is more about him than he thinks, and I'd agree, that is an important part of the story, it's what gives it depth. Both LotR and the hobbit use a simple premise (throw ring in volcano, slay dragon) that becomes great because the simple premise allows you extra time to build up the elements surrounding the premise, there is more emphasis on the characters and their journey. This layer of the story is more for the adult readers though I think, and works subconsciously on younger readers. <br/><br/>The more straightforward appeal of the Hobbit however are the adventures of Bilbo. The dragon is just an excuse to get Bilbo started on his journey, what matters is all the wonderful places he visits, he goes from one to another and each is nice and short and separate and great as a chapter for a child. <br/><br/>But when you look at it from a more grown up perspective Lotr and The Hobbit aren't really about hobbits, as much as people seem to think they are. They are about the Hobbit getting involved into this greater world, with heroes and wizards and elves and dwarfs, the world is the real main character, Bilbo is just our avatar in experiencing it, an outsider getting thrown into adventure. <br/><br/>Because LotR is a more mature book, it takes its time to develop each and every one of these layers to its full potential, but in the Hobbit they are more subdued. This leads to things like 13 dwarfs without any distinct characters. The only thing that is really an overarching story in the Hobbit is Bilbos growth. You can argue that this should have been the same way in the movies but I disagree. <br/><br/>I hear people constantly say that this or that scene wasn't necessary, and I hear others say that the same scene should be longer (like the spiders). But you can't just get rid of set pieces in the hobbit without losing an important layer of the hobbit, the layer that is about visiting places and having random adventures. <br/><br/>But if they are just random adventures people complain about scenes being useless. If dwarfs have no character then people complain that they are useless. Everyone has their own layer of the stories of middle earth that they love and everyone seems to be complaining that their layer is not the one that all the focus is on during the hobbit, many of the complaints seem to stem from in inability to appreciate those parts of the layering. Some want a simple adventure, some want a huge epic, personally I wanted 3 movies from the start, because I felt that the Hobbit needed it. <br/><br/>Peter decided he needed more characterization, and a more coherent story, not just a mish mash of places. To do this he put more emphasis on the 13 dwarfs, and their habits and stories, furthermore he used the narrative of the ring to tie the tale together with the overarching world. <br/><br/>Gandalfs tale about the necromancer is barely mentioned in the hobbit, because it is from the point of view of Bilbo, that is why everything revolves around him, but Peter decided to show gandalfs tale to us, I appreciate this because it strengthens the idea that this is a world filled with heroes and stories, and not just the tale of Bilbo Baggins, but at the same time I can see the story from Bilbo's side, oblivious to these larger tales. I think it is great to see how Bilbo really only plays a small part in a greater story, and I enjoy it even more knowing that that small part will eventually be the rock that starts an avalanche. The trick is being able to separate the two while viewing it. Bilbo is the hero in his own adventure, his own mind, this is one layer, but middle earth isn't that simple. <br/><br/>The movies spends time on the dwarfs, the necromancer, the greater tale, it weaves everything together, and if you stand back and look at it like this,the movie is great, the only real problems I have with it is that there is to much CGI where there should be practical effects, and they pull you out of the movie, things like the barrel scene were ridiculous, and the same thing goes for the far to lengthy and CGI heavy scene with Smaug and the dwarfs.<br/><br/>I don't feel like Bilbo's tale was lessened just because other tales also got the spotlight. We can clearly see Bilbos growth in not just his actions but his attitudes. The movie starts with them relying on him, he spies on Beorn, he saves them from the spiders, he saves them from mirkwood, he confronts Smaug and gets the arkenstone, he discovers the weak spot (although it should have been due to his cunning). <br/><br/>I can appreciate these things without being annoyed by the fact that the entire world doesn't revolve around him. I don't understand why others can't."
"The-Greatness","7","8","16","13 December 2013"," Just as disappointed, irritated and sad I was over the first. Just as happy, amazed and thrilled I am over this one.
","Iam a big LOTR fan. Its the only 3 movies(out of 1600ish titles) I have given a 10, to all three.<br/><br/>The first hobbit movie was something I wished to see more then anything the second I heard it was going to be made.<br/><br/>But. The first one. I wont go into an endless rant, but just to put things in perspective I was utterly disappointed. I was on the edge of mad. I think I rated it below 5. It was childish, annoying, unfulfilling and just out right terrible. I stand by that. No matter what. I hated it. I was angry for weeks. I re watched it a few months later. Did not help one bit.<br/><br/>BUT! This one. Desolation of smaug. Wow. Just wow. The thrilling and breathtaking adventure, scenes, music and lore was back! It was going for almost 3 hours and when it ended I wanted more. That felling is for me a trademark of a good, no, great! movie.<br/><br/>This had all the elements that I loved from LOTR. You where on the edge of your seat, but not only for the action going on, just because it was that good.<br/><br/>I have read other reviews that complain abit that it tries to tie in allot of the lore leading up to LOTR. That does not annoy me at all, the opposite. It was thrilling and exiting.<br/><br/>This is, without any doubt the best movie of 2013. If you are going to watch anything this year. Its this one."
"ammarjamal","8","8","16","13 December 2013"," Epic
","The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug came to theaters a year after it's predecessor, but after the long wait, it truly delivers.<br/><br/>Directed by the legend, Peter Jackson, The Desolation of Smaug is much better than the previous one, and much more visually stunning. Jackson's directing is better than ever, we see epic fight scenes, amazing camera angles and I loved the detail in his directing. <br/><br/>The writing is amazing, I have read the book and when they announced that the hobbit will be a trilogy, I was worried, but they got it right, although a lot of things were added and some things were changed all was for the better and every element in the writing seemed to make the movie much more epic!<br/><br/>I must say that I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack in this movie, unlike it's predecessor and TLOTR trilogy it does not offer the epic music that I would expect from a Peter Jackson film. Another thing that I was not very happy about was Legolas's make up it just seemed too much, almost like he was animated. <br/><br/>The acting in the hobbit 2 is great I loved Lee Pace as Thranduil, for some reason i compared him with Loki, and he was a lot better! The visual effects were amazing, I loved everything about them.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is no the return of the king, but it is still a great film and I can't wait till ""there and back again""."
"williamhume","6","11","24","13 December 2013"," Light Entertainment, Laid on Thick
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is an okay movie, some nice fantastical elements, quite overlong, but provides great escapism. It is held back from greatness by wrapping its story around arguably the most pointless trilogy ever manufactured by large scale cinema and comfortably dawdling in the shadow of another great franchise it should only occasionally pay homage to.<br/><br/>Before I continue I will say that the only Middle earth lore that I have read is the prologue ""Concerning Hobbits, and other matters"" from ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I am strictly a film fan of the series, and my opinion of watching ""The Journey Begins"" was that it felt like a bit of a drag. Going into this installment knowing that the four screenwriters had written some original material outside of Tolkien's novels to go along with the movie got me a bit excited. I have to say I was a bit let down, it seemed like the filmmakers weren't really challenging themselves here.<br/><br/>Getting my general complaint out of the way quickly is that at this point the series feels formulaic. — ""Where's Bilbo?"" Bilbo shows up, demonstrates courage, saves the day, cue Howard Shore's gently uplifting recycled Oscar winning score. None of the die-hard fans or at least the kind that represents the vocal minority on the internet seem to really be bothered by the way in which this adaptation is being treated into 3 somewhat-mediocre films rather than a singular focused masterpiece, and I don't blame them for wanting to stay in this richly drawn world for as long as possible, but for the filmmakers who are even fans themselves, I would ask for more quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Here is Warner Brothers, sitting on a pile of money.<br/><br/>My older brother pointed out to me once while watching ""King Kong"" that he thought director Peter Jackson seemed to rely a bit too much on CGI. I for one here would initially think that with ""The Hobbit"" aimed towards a less gritty adult style than ""Lord of the Rings"", the CGI would serve the lighter tone of the film better, but in the manner it's done here it comes across as lazy and inconsistent, with occasionally sub-par CGI used on some orcs (or parts of them) and not others it serves as a distraction.<br/><br/>Speaking of distractions every single callback to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" that lasts more than a few seconds ruins the pacing and tone of the movie by getting in the way of the main plot, which I'm aware of but not quite as clear as I should be on. Fan-service doesn't serve a film very well when you refer to a brewing yet rather unrelated conflict that the audience knows was already solved in another film series a decade ago next Tuesday. Funnily enough for some reason, I didn't think the time-keeping in Middle Earth followed the Gregorian calendar.<br/><br/>The screenplay for the film is a slight weak point, as it takes its time understandably it doesn't develop the dwarfs in any interesting or compelling way to justify its running time. There are sparks of interest that lie in each of the supporting characters but it is left at that. For Tolkien fans I suppose that'll do, since I imagine what was or was not presented in books was properly left to the imagination, but here much of what is feels like a waste or a wasted opportunity. I can't quite remember the names of all the dwarfs but considering the amount of screen time they've had so far you'd think they'd talk about something interesting other than the journey. These are the most focused characters I have ever seen on screen, five and a half hours in and they haven't bothered to really let themselves or the audience get to know one another.<br/><br/>Maybe its because they were as taken aback by the sheer spectacle of Middle Earth as I was. The action in the film is more varied and plentiful than it was in the last film but of course much is still saved for the finale, and with a high production value I understand why Peter Jackson doesn't want to leave, the whole thing looks like a soft coloured painting. The scenery is brightly lit and beautiful, such a visually resplendent treat that it makes sense to sit and take it in, not for 2 hours and forty one minutes though. A little precious indulgence now and then isn't too hurtful, but it can lead to audience neglect and unintentionally boring periods of desolation."
"Marshmallow97","6","12","27","11 December 2013"," Thorin reclaims his place in movie history!
","Last night I watched ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" and it was really good. The movie was exiting all the way throughout the 161 min run time. It was way better than ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"", though I did enjoy the first one as well. This movie is really action-packed and keeps you at the edge of your seat. The 3D looks great in this movie and there are a lot of great images. Though the ""Lord of The Rings"" trilogy is way better, so don't go into the cinema with too high expectations.<br/><br/>There are many cool characters. All the dwarfs are back as well, and THERE'S NO SINGING!! :) I wasn't that fond of the dwarfs in the first movie, but now they're starting to grow on me. Now I'm finding myself really caring about each and every one of them. The movie also introduced a new character to the Tolkien-universe. This character isn't written by Tolkien, but by the movie writers. The characters name is Tauriel, and she's a Wood Elf (Legolas is also a Wood Elf). She's played by the actress Evangeline Lilly, which is most known for playing Kate in the hit series ""Lost"" (2004-2010). I thought Tauriel was a great/awesome character. She's one of my favorite characters in the movie, so Peter Jackson made a great decision when he added her. She kicks ass all they way throughout the movie, and she has about the same fighting style as Legolas. It was really cool seeing another ""Lord of the Rings"" character, and I was glad to see Legolas again. Gandalf is cool as always, and is my favorite Middle Eart character. Gandalf has great the greatest quotes and is a very likable character. Martin Freman plays Bilbo perfectly yet again. He's the funniest character in the movie and you've got to love him. We also get introduced to Smaug (the dragon which lives in Erebor) played by Benedict Cumberbatch. His voice and performance really makes Smaug the greatest movie dragon since Falkor the luckdragon.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie and I recommend it to Tolkien fans and fellow fantasy lovers. It isn't perfect, but it's a great effort. The soundtrack is pretty good but quite forgettable compared to the other movies. Every moviegoer should give this ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" a try, and I give it 8,8/10<br/><br/>For more movie reviews visit http://stiannielsfilm.blogspot.no/"
"dhjoker","10","9","19","19 December 2013"," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","This is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. The moment I saw Smaug, it was instantly my favorite out of all The Lord of the Rings/Hobbit movies. But there is so much more than just him that makes this show great. Adventure, Suspense, etc. There are creepy parts, funny parts, intense parts. It's got everything. ""Spoilers below"" OK, so if you're looking for character development, for most of the main characters that happened in the first movie. There is some in this movie, but it flushes out other characters such as Bard who is a great character who seems just like an all around good guy. Smaug is by far the best. He isn't just some dragon, he has emotions and a personality. He's insane with greed, super smart and a truly evil villain. Just as with Gollum, the motion capture puts real emotions into his face that are really believable. I was worried he was going to end up like other movie monsters, such as the Kraken in both Clash of the Titan movies, where there is a huge build up throughout the movie to them, but they are only in the movie for like 2 minutes and they die. Smaug isn't like that. He has like a whole 30 min. of screen time, but I won't spoil how that ends. Benedict Cumberbatch is a perfect Smaug and a great actor. He should get an award for this portrayal. Bilbo, Thorin, Gandalf and many of the dwarfs have their characters develop as well, but it only adds to the first movie. Yes, Peter Jackson adds things that weren't in the book like he did in the other movies. But they make sense and only add to the story. Gandalf leaving them and visiting the Necromancer was in the book, just not detailed like it was here. This is a movie for the whole family, though Smaug and the Spiders are scary. Easily 10 stars. If you didn't like the first, just go into this with an open mind. Enjoy it, don't nitpick it. It's a great film."
"randylkent","6","9","19","14 December 2013"," Peter Jackson fell short of capturing the essence of Tolkien's masterpiece.
","Not much of this film is on par with the book. Being a fan I took the film for what it was, Peter Jackson playing around with his new digital equipment and as a result losing focus of the essence that Tolkien captured in the original novel. Imax 3d is an experience for sure, however due to it's faster frame rate and extreme resolution, some of the acting looks poor and some of the digital scenes look fake. Smaug the dragon is very impressive, those scenes alone are worth seeing the film. Jacskon's best achievement in this film is capturing the magnificent creature and keeping it on par with the book, it far proceeded what I expected the dragon to be, and yes, Jackson adds some scenes that are not on par with the book under the mountain. Smaug should be up for an Oscar with his performance. Despite smaug, the film overall once again, left me unsatisfied and fell short of the classical masterpiece published in 1932. For the average movie goer this film should make your B or A list, but for the avid fan of middle earth it will disappoint."
"phd_travel","3","20","51","12 December 2013"," Frustratingly incomplete but at least there is some action
","This trilogy shouldn't have been a trilogy. There just isn't enough story. After watching the first part which was so dragged out and inconsequential this second part finally had some action and excitement in the river and dragon fight, it ends before the real climax.<br/><br/>Everything was dragged out and unnecessarily so. The river fight was well done but twice as long as it should be. The dragon was too chatty and long winded. Reminded me of the Gollum conversations. Gandalf's fight with the orcs was superfluous. Actually we have seen too many orcs. Enough! <br/><br/>At least compared to part 1 there was some action and a hint of dwarf elf romance. Other good points are the beautiful scenery. The new supporting cast are good. Evangeline Lilly from Lost as an only in the movie character, a female elf fighter is quite good and beautiful. Both she and Orlando Bloom's Legolas have some pretty good fighting sequences. Luke Evans as Bard the Bowman is quite convincing too. It's nice to have something else to look at than middle aged vagrant looking types with British accents running around the forest. <br/><br/>Can't believe we have to wait for another movie to finish things up. Two parts would have been enough."
"dunh0037","6","10","22","13 December 2013"," Slightly less of a mess than the first
","The second installation of The Hobbit continues the journey of Bilbo and the dwarfs, taking us an underwhelmingly short distance from the arrival at Beorn's house (more on this later) to Smaug's departure toward Laketown. I think the redeeming quality of this film was that it wasn't as utterly ridiculous as the first, but it still lacks nearly all the magic of the LoTR trilogy.<br/><br/>One of the most striking realizations on reflecting about the film is that there are no cinematic dynamics. The second film, much like the first, is something like a ~3 hour trailer. Every scene is action-packed, every scene is rushed, even the camera motions are jarring, hurried, and uncomfortable. We get no opportunity to recognize the intense moments because there is no space to breathe. The day after seeing it (was actually able to see it in Oslo, Norway where it debuted 3 days before the U.S. premiere; go figure), I watched Fellowship again. I was struck by the simple scenes, like Gandalf and Saruman walking and discussing the finding of the Ring outside Orthanc. Scenes like this give stark contrast with more intense shots like the battle at Weathertop with Aaragorn and the Ringwraiths. What we get here is 161 minutes of blur that left me asking the question, ""what did I just see and which part was supposed to be the exciting part?"" We are force-fed mindless action and given no time to process and interpret it.<br/><br/>Aside from the general mental discomfort of the viewing experience and the impressively short chapter coverage, there were again several departures from the original storyline which I just wasn't able to let go of:<br/><br/>* The introduction to Beorn. Instead of a sneaky trick from Gandalf which provides character development for Beorn and the dwarfs and context for the surrounding scenes, we have them chased into the house by bear-Beorn with a Jurassic Park raptor-head-in-the-door ending. The perspective on Beorn's human character once we actually meet him took me by surprise, but I thought it was actually reasonably well-done.<br/><br/>* This Azog business. Now there is an orc battle on the rooftops of Laketown, which makes about as much sense as Radagast's bunny-driven jack-assery.<br/><br/>* The Tauriel side-story and Legolas's role. We were PROMISED that there would be no love story involving Tauriel and Legolas. Partial truth. What we got was some weird love triangle with Tauriel, Legolas, and KILI... The freaking adolescent dwarf! Legolas comes in as a major character here, prancing about on top of barrel-riding dwarfs fighting orcs that are somehow now involved in the river escape to Laketown...<br/><br/>* The progression of the Bilbo-Smaug encounter. Smaug actually sees Bilbo without the ring for most of the scene in the film, which he never did in the book. The text's approach lent an element of suspense and mystery that this adaptation forsakes. Bilbo's invisibility helped his courage, and made the whole situation more of a game for Smaug. Consistent with the rest of the movie, we are now simply thrown in headlong.<br/><br/>It's really a disappointment from the anticipation built up for the new trilogy. Much of the speculation was along the lines that Jackson would be untouchable after the success of the first trilogy. However, if he has exerted more directorial control than previously, then he is much less of an artist and much more of a high-budget CGI profit-panderer than any production company could hope to be. It's as if his preparation for the project included cutting out the entry for ""subtlety"" in his dictionary and replacing it with a photo of a clown throwing a pie.<br/><br/>I anticipate Jackson will be getting the phone call one day that I would dread as a director: George Lucas saying, ""Dude, I know what you're going through..."""
"athena-christine-a","6","7","14","19 December 2013"," Great adventure film, bad rendition of Tolkien's work
","In this part of the story Bilbo Baggins really begins his voyage towards the Lonely Mountain, accompanied by 13 ambitious dwarfs. The most dangerous part of the journey: the passage through Mirkwood forest, the biggest, oldest and most fearsome forest of Middle Earth. Gandalf, who leaves his travel companions unexpectedly at the edge of the forest, shouts the historic words 'don't leave the path!' before passing out of hearing, the attack of the hideous giant spiders, the unpleasant stay in the crypts of the Elven King: everyone who loves 'The Hobbit', knows that the highlights from Tolkien's marvelous masterpiece are there, on those pages.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the 'Desolation of Smaug' was a sort of test: would Peter Jackson succeed in translating the magic of those scenes to the big screen? Would he succeed in making the voyage through Mirkwood as memorable as the descent into the mines of Moria in the 'Fellowship of the Ring'? Would he succeed in surpassing the rather disappointing first part of his trilogy? The answer: no. Once again Jackson torpedoed his own film.<br/><br/>He completely misses the essence of the mythology, not a single spark of the fairy-tale-like tone of the book remains. Once again he replaces Tolkien's enchanting magic by the clash of weapons. As soon as our friends enter Mirkwood, Jackson goes into fight mode and he starts throwing his vast array of tricks at the screen: cheap sound effects, hyper-kinetic camera work, and a never-ending bombastic soundtrack- and this while the pressing silence is supposed to be one of the most threatening characteristics of Mirkwood! Jackson's approach of overwhelming and astounding is unfortunately stretched across the whole film. Instead of building some atmosphere, he always, always, chooses in nearly every scene, wherever it takes place, to let it culminate into an attack of orcs, loud sword clashing, a wild chase, or a mindless duel with some roaring troll. As if Jackson is concerned that the cinema public will fall asleep if they're not presented with constant action scenes.<br/><br/>I know, you're not supposed to compare a book with a film, and yes Jackson is allowed to make his own creative choices and giving his own interpretation to Tolkien. But, sorry, his interpretation sucks. The growling orcs, Ian McKellen's ubersolemn monologues, the Elves, forever gazing in the distance with bored faces. All Jackson is doing is giving us Lord of the Rings again, but in pointless 3D. The most ridiculous scene is by far Thorin Oakenshield zigzagging under the dragon's scales in full speed whilst pushing a wheelbarrow.<br/><br/>Is there nothing good to be said? Sure. The meeting between Smaug and Bilbo is rather entertaining, and at a certain moment Gandalf climbs a rather very precarious stairs, and the discovery of the ash-covered corpses of the Erebor dwarfs is a moving moment- but in general the predominant thought in my head was 'I've had enough of this'. Now, you don't have to listen to the die-hard fans who can't step away from the book To paraphrase Tolkien, stay on the path, keep your good humor and hope for the best, and with any luck you will see an epic adventure film."
"stevencvgarcia","6","7","14","18 December 2013"," This movie was called ""The Hobbit"" right? Not ""The Wood Elf""
","I made the sad mistake of seeing the midnight showing for this movie,expecting to see another faithful installment of a Tolkien book. I understand movies take liberties that sometimes have well-received results, but when you take away the main characters for a chunk of the movie, add pointless, cheesy action-comedy, and a BEAR HUMPING A ROCK for a minute, these liberties become insulting. <br/><br/>Before I continue hating on the film, I will admit the movie holds some fantastic scenes. The scenes with the giant spiders were engrossing, well-paced, and completely rewarding, expounding on all the key elements of the book. Mainly, all the scenes that actually had Bilbo in them were spot-on.<br/><br/>Then we get a bear, the animal part of Beorn the ""skin-changer,"" which I honestly could not tell you what it was doing, but all I saw was a silhouette of a bear mounting a boulder and humping it into submission. From there that's when the movie started going down hill for me (I suppose I should have taken that scene as a metaphor for how Jackson is going to treat all of us with this movie). Later we get a dragged out scene of the dwarfs and Bilbo in the barrels, and this is where Legolas pretty much takes up the rest of the movie until Bilbo sees Smaug. It's him stepping on the dwarfs' heads while shooting his apparently infinite supply of arrows and getting perfect shots every time. It gets old very quickly. I actually got up to use the bathroom at the beginning of this scene, thinking I wasn't going to miss anything important and that it would be over by the time I got back. When I did get back, it was still Legolas jumping on dwarf heads, and I asked my friend if I missed anything, and he just pointed to the screen and said, ""Just more of this."" If nothing else it was a nice intermission. It felt like Jackson saw some charts showing the popularity of Legolas and decided to throw away any art of adaptation and focus on crowd pleasing. Not only does Legolas get too much unneeded screen time, Jackson doesn't even expound on his character. It's more of him being even more perfect than he was in The Return of the King, and the one time he starts to lose a fight, he gets a bear-hug from an orc and a little nose-bleed.<br/><br/>Later another great scene comes with Bilbo talking to Smaug. I won't go into detail, but the conversation is well scripted and the actors do a superb job of giving all the tension of the riddle scene with Bilbo and Gollum from the first movie. Sadly, this perfectly good scene goes into another scene where Smaug suddenly becomes incompetent, failing to catch any of the dwarfs or Bilbo in its own home (where it's lived for over a hundred years) and becoming embarrassingly easy to out-smart. <br/><br/>I think if this movie was edited down by about an hour it would have been much better. I like the idea of adding Gandalf's story where the Hobbit only hinted at, but they get bogged down with tedious conversations and poorly done CGI. It was painful to watch how much it ruined what might have been an epic scene between Gandalf and The ""Necromancer.""<br/><br/>Mostly, all the parts Jackson did that followed the book (more or less) were very well done, but all the parts he added were either poorly presented or just tedious and unnecessary."
"adrongardner","6","7","14","16 December 2013"," Fun, as far as watching a train wreck can be
","The last go around in Unexpected Journey, many liberties were taken. Yet, with all the extra characters and walking about in the woods, it somewhat felt passingly like the book. This ""sequel"" of sorts is a big, boated thing that shares only names with the novel namesake and none of the spirit. In common with the first film, Bilbo seems to have an awfully small role. The manufactured elf Tauriel soaks up more lines and screen time than Martin Freeman. It continues... <br/><br/>Where Unexpected Journey was mostly loafing about for three hours, we're nearly pummeled into submission on the way to lonely mountain this year. The music score never lets you absorb a moment quietly. Every single camera or character movement is backed up by incessant audio cues. There are sub-plots of sub-plots. There is a love triangle and double crosses. There are lots of decapitations for a PG-13 movie. There are a lot of forced and unnecessary connections to the Jackson LOTR movies. The editing is often a blurry mess of nonsense, but to be honest I was never all that bored. Without Bennedict Cumberbach, the whole show could have been a lot worse than it is. So it isn't a great film, but it is a decent action movie. Albeit one that could shed an hour or more of fat. Overall, Desolation has even less in common with the book than the first film. But movies are movies and books are books. <br/><br/>So Desolation of Smaug is an absolutely awful adaptation of The Hobbit, but it is also generally an entertaining movie. This may be as good as it gets. When the dragon is gone, I'm assuming in the next movie, we will be barraged by a lot of shots of CGI armies numbering in the thousands throwing spears, arrows and swords. I was bored of that before Peter Jackson did it ten years ago."
"MegaGothmog","8","7","14","13 December 2013"," Amazing movie and loved it. HOWEVER....
","Let me say this straight off; I loved it! it was action packed, the story kept going and it didn't take too long to develop.<br/><br/>However, being a Middle Earth fan I loved the story (Spoilers ahead!) and Peter Jackson altered the story on a lot of points.<br/><br/>1: I liked that they added Tauriel. She is a fierce character and fun to watch, but then the sort of romance between her and Kili is something that I didn't like that much.<br/><br/>2: The orc attacks on the elves and Laketown. It makes everything a bit more interesting and gives some more tension. On the other hand there is no mention of any attack on the elves, nor Laketown.<br/><br/>3: Dwarfs fighting Smaug. It was epic to watch and truly thrilling, but in the books, the dwarfs don't even see Smaug. Now they have this entire fight with him was something that I kind of disliked later on.<br/><br/>4: Beorn. In the books he is described as a big, black-haired man. So i expected a Hagrid-sort-of-guy. It was a surprise to see him like he is now but it is still fun to watch.<br/><br/>The extra story with Gandalf and Radagast was something i did enjoy. It is not mentioned in the books, but it is there. Peter Jackson did look it up in the appendices and it all fits.<br/><br/>Despite that they altered the story (for the better or worse is up to you) on many points, I truly loved the movie and I will surely watch it again. It is a movie that goes fast enough to keep paying attention and you'll keep sitting on the edge of your seat."
"Amthermandes","10","11","25","13 December 2013"," Another breathtaking addition to the Hobbit saga!
","There was quite a build-up for this movie, and also for the dragon Smaug. And Peter Jackson did NOT disappoint. The movie is everything any Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fans could ever want. More adventure, more action, more everything, only with the coolest dragon to ever hit the big screen. Or any screen. The tale of Bilbo Baggins continues as he ventures with his Dwarven companions to reclaim what was once theirs. There is plenty in this movie to satisfy anyone, even those who aren't die-hard Tolkien fans. Director Peter Jackson asked us to put faith in him, especially since he tends to go astray from the events in the book, but I must say that the faith his fans put in him has definitely paid off. The story is intriguing for all, and at the end will have you BURNING for more!!"
"slicedbread117","9","5","9","4 January 2014"," Another enthralling adventure in Tolkien's epic saga.
","Over a decade ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's epic fantasy story, ""The Lord of the Rings"", was brought to life on the big screen in grand fashion. The prequel book, The Hobbit, was later awarded with a movie trilogy of its own. With part 1 of The Hobbit trilogy, ""An Unexpected Journey"", a year in the past, we now look to part 2, ""The Desolation of Smaug"", which is bigger and better than its predecessor in practically every way.<br/><br/>The story once again follows the continuing quest of the Company of Dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey to reclaim their homeland of Erebor from the mighty dragon Smaug. Fans who have read The Hobbit book might not be too surprised at how the movie unfolds, however, its the way that the movie unfolds that is something to marvel at. The Desolation of Smaug swiftly and beautifully delivers high-octane action sequences supplemented by gorgeous CGI and a higher frame rate than its predecessor throughout the entire film, and with rock solid pacing, the action doesn't overwhelm the film while still delivering plenty of exciting action scenes. The dragon Smaug himself is a excellently created mythical beast, who is a joy to watch on screen. The world of Middle-Earth is a vast and adventurous land filled with numerous mystical creatures and races, both beautiful and dangerous and the film does a terrific job in bringing this great world to life. The Desolation of Smaug doesn't hesitate to pull your mind into its fiction, and when you let your imagination dive into the movie, it becomes a world of wonders that delivers spectacle by the ton.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings movies quite possibly wouldn't have been what they were without the direction of visionary Peter Jackson. It was critical that Jackson returned to direct The Hobbit trilogy, and after a solid first movie, Jackson has heightened the level of the playing field to create a second part which leaves you even more excited for the conclusion. It's pleasing to see a filmmaker this in love with storytelling, this committed to creating entire worlds. That's a rare thing indeed, and for it to turn out so well is even more rare. It's a sight to behold, and The Desolation of Smaug benefits enormously from his stellar direction. This film is bigger, darker and deeper than the first, and more emotionally engaging with a great set of characters filling out the stunning world around them. Bravo Mr. Jackson, here's to an even better third act.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the cast from the first film return for part 2, and again do a wonderful job. Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, and Richard Armitage lead the way as Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin respectively, and each of their characters are interesting in their own way. Orlando Bloom carries a heavy load of action as the Elven Prince Legolas, and he is a blast to watch as he mows down enemies. The fierce dragon Smaug, a computer generated masterpiece, is voiced and motion captured by Benedict Cumberbatch, and his performance is stellar. Smaug very well could be the best character in the film, striking a sense of fear and fantasy into the viewer's heart. The Company of Dwarfs are fun to watch and provide some laughs along the way as well. All together, the cast of characters are interesting and well rounded, giving Middle-Earth the occupants it deserves.<br/><br/>The only negatives the movie suffers from is a fair lack of dedication to the source material, something some fans might be even more displeased with, but I found the way the story was told to be a wonderfully penned vision and a success as a whole. One other thing was that our favorite hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, was shorted the screen time he needed to further progress his character. A little more of Bilbo, and Gandalf, would have been nice, but this doesn't hurt the film in any major way.<br/><br/>Now to wrap everything up. If The Desolation of Smaug did one thing, it was being better than its predecessor on nearly every front. The action was thrilling, the CGI and frame rate were top notch, the cast was awesome at portraying our lovable characters, both good and evil, and director Peter Jackson once again proves he's one of the greatest directors in Hollywood with his passion for storytelling and creating yet another grand trilogy set in the beautifully dangerous Middle-Earth. The Desolation of Smaug has raised the bar for the entire Hobbit trilogy, and with part 3, ""The Battle of the Five Armies"", set for a December 2014 release, we're not too far away from the conclusion of another enthralling adventure.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"thimage","3","5","9","30 December 2013"," Nowhere near Lord of the Rings quality
","I just finished to watch the movie Hobbit2: The desolation of Smaug and it was a huge disappointment. After having kept LOTR as my all-time favorite movie for 10 years, I was absolutely certain that Peter Jackson could walk on water. I went to watch the Hobbit1 blindly thinking at the marvels I was about to fill my eyes with, and felt awkward at my dissatisfaction when the movie ended. I thought: ""maybe I don't relate as well as I thought to dwarfs being the stars of the movie"". But I didn't fault Peter Jackson because I was sure that it had to do with me, not with his talent.<br/><br/>Then came the desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>I never could get into the movie, relate to any character or follow the unfolding of the story with anything but befuddlement. The parts are unhinged and don't link well together. Even Gandalf, Gandalf! was wooden and remote. And I must say that I consider Sir Ian McKellen as a top- notch actor.<br/><br/>Other problems lie with the total lack of respect for the original story, the lack of coherence between diverse aspects of the plot and the lack of character depth.<br/><br/>This is something that you can expect from a B movie, but not from the man that managed to put the Lord of the Rings on the screen successfully.<br/><br/>What happened with the attention to detail and the love and dedication to Tolkien's legacy? I don't know.<br/><br/>I'll just pretend that the movie ""the Hobbit"" has never existed to avoid sullying my attachment to the Lord of the rings which is still my all-time favorite movie.<br/><br/>PS (I don't know why the IMDb auto-corrector keeps spelling wrongly the plural of ""dwarf"" but I wish to apologize for the spelling mistake, I just can't edit it)"
"sussman2004","3","5","9","27 December 2013"," Good movie to induce general anesthesia.
","Eegahds!! ZZzzz!! Will this movie ever end? That is the question I kept asking myself. Boring. I enjoyed the last Hobbit movie for the scenery and special effects but this one is a bomb. I definitely won't be seeing anymore of the Rocky the XIV version of the Hobbit. So slow. Very uninspired. I can't believe the current IMDb rating is 8.3 for this movie. I always thought that a score greater than 7.0 and the movie was definitely worth watching. This one was made to milk the sheep who keep coming to see what next is on the menu. There were only two things about this movie that made me glad, one is that I didn't have to pay full price, (it was a matinée) and the second, when it was over."
"chelseaoss","2","5","9","25 December 2013"," Stinks worse than Laketown on a hot day.
","Peter Jackson should be ashamed of himself. And I'm going pretty much going to leave it there, because 1,000 words are not enough to lambaste this horrific, stupid waste of time and money. The Hobbit, as originally written, would have made a thoroughly enjoyable 2.5-hour family movie that could have created a new generation of fans for Professor Tolkien's later works. Supposedly, any ""extra content"" was pulled from the Appendixes in LOTR. Well, that's a complete and utter falsehood. New Line and Jackson have given in to the lure of easy money, and hopefully, just like Smaug, they will find that love of money will lead to their downfall. The only reason I'm even giving it two stars because Smaug was pretty impressive looking, and I love Stephen Fry, even if he's in a piece of offal like this."
"simonjlbutler","6","5","9","19 December 2013"," Better than the first installment but still not The Hobbit that I know
","OK, first off I agree with the sentiment of the posts on here complaining that this is not The Hobbit, at least not as most Tolkien fans know it. However, as a movie I actually thought it was rather enjoyable.<br/><br/>As both a Tolkien fan and a fan of the PJ LOTR movies I found this second movie far more engaging to watch than the first. Sometimes the professional critics do get it right and some of the opprobrium attached to the first movie was, I think, justified. I know many die-hard fans disagree but I, as a 40-something Dad and (like several other 40-something Dad's of my acquaintance) found the first film to be a contrived, unsubtly manipulative, unengaging and plodding video game. I particularly disliked the unnecessary departures from the book, Azog top of the list. On the other hand my two pre-teen boys loved it.<br/><br/>With the experience of the first movie in the back of my mind I went to the second movie with lowered expectations and decided to treat it as a simple movie experience rather than hoping for an accurate interpretation of The Hobbit. And on this level I think it works rather well and is probably why I enjoyed it so much more than the first film. It has much better pacing and takes you along on a roller coaster of a ride. Although I do think the over reliance on CGI detracts from the experience - fake really comes across as fake. As many have already said, the Orcs in LOTR are much more menacing than their CGI counter parts in The Hobbit (don't buy the line that this is because The Hobbit is aimed at a much younger audience, the film's most certainly are not). <br/><br/>Overall, whilst I agree with the purists that this is not The Hobbit in any shape or form, it is still a great matinée action movie to take the kids to.<br/><br/>With my Tolkien hat on, I think both films so far have been an opportunity missed. Whilst I think the LOTR films are pretty definitive and PJ was the right man, in the right place at the right time, I would suggest there might still be room for someone to have another go at remaking The Hobbit from scratch."
"jmacdavidson","6","5","9","19 December 2013"," How can you review 1/3 of a movie?
","I gave this a five just because I won't know what to think until the trilogy is completed. This movie doesn't even try to stand on it's own. The movie ends on a cliffhanger and hardly apologizes for it. Nothing is resolved. To contrast with the 2nd installment in the Lord of The Rings Trilogy, ""The Two Towers"" ends with the victory at Helm's Deep as well as Frodo and Sam escaping Gondor and the Nazgul to continue into the next chapter of their journey. The story's not over, but there is some resolution. That's what I was somewhat expecting out of this movie. What's worse is it's obvious what's going to happen in the next movie because they already set it up in this movie. The more time there is to speculate whether or not our redemption story human (forgot his name) will hit his mark with the black arrow the less suspenseful it will be.<br/><br/>Now that the ending is out of the way, this movie was enjoyable although it suffers from slow pacing. although not as badly as the first one. Some scenes would have been really good if they were just cut shorter. The barrel scene could have been cut in half and be just as funny and action packed. Legolas's role extends far beyond a cameo. There is a unnecessary love triangle between Legolas, an Elf girl, and a dwarf (forgot their names). Gandalf's journeys are pretty interesting for the most part and are what gets me most excited to see the third movie. Again it's hard to say what's good about this movie because if the final part in the trilogy isn't good it will all be for naught."

","An open letter to Peter Jackson(Director of Lord Of The Rings,and The Hobbit series) Dear Mr. Jackson: I am a big fan of your work,especially the LOTR series...I became a fan of JRR Tolkien's literature in 1979(after watching Ralph Bakshi's animated LOTR movie) So, I and all Tolkien fans,in fact waited for 30 years for a live- action rendition of these classic books.And we were not disappointed! Then we waited a bit longer for the first ""The Hobbit"" movie(Which I enjoyed,even though elements of the story were deleted,and other aspects were added)...Then waited another year for the 2nd Hobbit movie...And here is where you lost me,as a fan....I understand your target audience are 15-year old video-gamers,so I can see where you want to put in a lot of action scenes,and show off your studio's CGI skills...But you really went over the top,and distorted the story so much,it is almost unrecognizable as a Tolkien story...The first movie had Humor(so did the Book)... I cannot believe the Tolkien estate agreed to this!!! I will not be purchasing the DVD,when it comes out,I'm sorry...A few plot elements: There was no reason to have Legolas in this movie(except for the star-power factor...)The addition of Tauriel(A completely made-up character,never mentioned in the books) was ridiculous!!Your intention of making this a 3 movie series,instead of 2 movies(GREED!!) by adding elements from LOTR appendices sounded like a good idea,I wish you had added those elements!!!! In a series that will eventually encompass 9 hours,there is a lot of room for character development...Here ,there is none...The title is THE HOBBIT!!! Bilbo is reduced to a supporting cast member!! There are 13 Dwarfs!! None of their personalities stood out(In the 1st movie,they were developing,but I guess that idea was scrapped,also...) I have to say,in this fan's opinion,it is really a major disappointment! There will be a 3rd Hobbit movie coming out in December,and I guess people will watch it,out of curiosity...I may watch it,too...to see if the series can be redeemed,but it will really have to be outstanding,and I know you are capable....This could have been two epic movies,that the fans of Tolkien would have cherished for years to come,but your ego has gotten in the way...What a shame!!"

I loved the book and I also love this movie very much. To all the haters that complain about additional scenes that don't appear in the book and other changes: Stay out of the cinema, all others can be thankful to Mr Jackson that he shows us some more chapters of Middle Earth. Also this one of the nicest 3D experiences I had so far. So now the waiting for the extended bluray version has started as well as for part 3 of the series."

","This part of the Hobbit movies is a lot better than the first one! It's darker, in my opinion more well made and more exciting! I did like the first one, but I disliked that it was so childish. I know Hobbit is more or less a children's book, but anyway I thought it was too childish. This film however is much darker in it's atmosphere, Smaug was very well made and so was all the surroundings. So far so good!<br/><br/>I have read the book, but it didn't disturb me that there where some new added characters. What did disturb me was that BEORN was so little shown in the film. That character should have been a bigger part of this movie! I liked the actor (Mikael Persbrandt) playing BEORN a great deal and really hope that he will be given much more acting time in the next film!! Now they only hasted through that part of the movie like as if the only reason he was part of the film, was that he were mentioned in the book (but wasn't important as a character..?)! That did disappoint me a great deal as one reason for me looking forward to see ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was to see BEORN! As a result it was a big ""fail for me""... I really hope that he will be given a lot more screenplay in the extended Bluray version later!<br/><br/>But anyway, I give this movie 9/10. The first part I only gave 8/10.

"nashad_naash","10","9","20","13 December 2013"," Got the feel of lord of the rings...
","First of all, to all those who compare the hobbit trilogy to the lotr trilogy, i have to say that there is no point in comparing these two installments. I don't have to write about the time period or era in which the two stories have taken place, other reviews have talked about it, but its not just that. I think the fans are forgetting the fact that both (lotr and the hobbit) are two entirely different book. And it would be extremely difficult to portray something as magnificent as the lotr movies. Fans need to understand it and they need to treat both installments as two different installments. Comparison would eclipse the beauty and all the good parts in the hobbit trilogy. (Just my opinion) I have to say that the second installment of the hobbit trilogy is better than the first installment-The unexpected journey. The movie starts with gandalf's meeting with thorin in the prancing pony and convinces him to reclaim the homeland of erabor. Tempo high throughout the movie and PJ tried and sometimes succeeded in bringing the feel of the lotr trilogy. Still the movie could have been better if it was 20-25 minutes shorter. There were some really wonderful dedicated and convincing performances in the movie. Standout according to me was that of Luke Evans's who played the role of Bard. Martin Freeman was as witty and cheeky as he was in the first part. CGI would often distract you from the story but nevertheless, it was really a visual treat.<br/><br/>Is the movie an all time classic...No... But is it an excellent movie.....YES !!!!....DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING and two thumbs up<br/><br/>PS:- Movie actually deserve 7 or 8 stars at the max but im giving it 10 on 10 because im a die hard fan of the franchise. Personally i want to see this and all the movies in this franchise to be in the IMDb top 250...<br/><br/>so 10 on 10...."

The audience laughed when it was over and I'm sure that wasn't meant to be so. Right?<br/><br/>The script is a stretched out mess. It could have been half as long and twice better. The source material simply doesn't provide enough plot for the kind of extravaganza that Peter Jackson and his team are attempting. The film has three plot lines, only one of which was featured in the book. The other two are an invention of Jackson and his writers and you can tell. They simply fail to come to life.

","Welcome to the The Matrix Reloaded against the backdrop of Tolkien's Middle Earth. Or perhaps this movie was written and directed by George Lucas, post the original Star Wars trilogy. Though, to be fair, none of the characters is even close to being as annoyingly stupid as Jar-Jar.<br/><br/>What this movie is, is a generally mindless bunch of action scenes held together tenuously by snippets of The Hobbit. As with The Matrix Reloaded (and Revolutions), the action very quickly becomes dull as the scenes are drawn out to ridiculous lengths and serve no purpose other than to draw out what is actually probably about 40 minutes of story. They serve to demonstrate that Jackson is no John Woo when it comes to action sequences. And, like Lucas with Star Wars, shouldn't have been allowed to touch this story after his success with The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch does do a great job as Smaug's voice, but that's pretty much the only part of the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that Jackson has been allowed to destroy this great story."
"rooee","7","6","12","13 December 2013"," ""I do believe the worst is behind us.""
","The worst of Sir Peter Jackson's Tolkien series - last year's An Unexpected Journey - is now behind us, and it was still better than most blockbusters since. The Desolation of Smaug is a rung above. Show me a more heartfelt, inventive, well cast, exciting, and sumptuously detailed realisation of a fantasy world on screen and I will eat a sorcerer's sandal.<br/><br/>Thankfully, a year on, fans are now in a position to be able to sift out of professional reviews the irrelevant criticisms. 'These films are too long!' Not long enough for those of us who want more Middle Earth. 'Shallow CG spectacle!' cry the same critics who just hurled five stars at Gravity. 'Three films means three times the money!' Yes - and it is money some of us are more than happy to pay.<br/><br/>So here we have the continuing adventures of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and his crew, the Company of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage, now minus his oaken shield). Part Two of Jackson's sumptuous trilogy brings greater life and depth to John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's source novel - a tome small in width but wide in vision. The best addition is Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), an overdue she-elf heroine, who feels like a full character lifted from literature.<br/><br/>The Battle of Five Armies always felt a bit rushed on the page, so after An Unexpected Journey it was apparent that this mighty mash-up would constitute the third movie. That leaves the middle chunk: the elves, the spiders, the lake, and that dastardly dragon (Benedict Cumberbatch). But, strangely, sadly, we're left without any of those merry songs.<br/><br/>The dwarfs aren't such a merry bunch this time around. Bilbo's final line from the last outing echoes throughout the encounters of this second instalment: chattering spiders (arachnophobics beware); a nefarious Necromancer; and a new orc-nemesis in the form of Azog's son, Bolg (Lawrence Makoare). Like The Two Towers, a shadow has descended on this story. And, like The Two Towers, a new narrative complexity is introduced: Desolation is less linear than Journey, the action leaping between story strands like elves through woodland branches.<br/><br/>Perhaps as a result of having (original director) Guillermo Del Toro on board as a co-writer, there are some scenes of weird horror, particularly an early sequence in Mirkwood, where VFX and editing combine to bamboozle both characters and audience. It's as if the mighty Mexican has unlocked in Jackson the playful auteur - he of Braindead, Heavenly Creatures et al - who was conspicuously absent from The Lovely Bones and reined in for King Kong.<br/><br/>Towers was my personal favourite of the Rings trilogy, so my expectations for this bridging instalment were naturally high and mostly met. While the setpieces - particularly the head-hopping barrels sequence - are some of the most thrilling in the Middle-earth series, thematically there's nothing here to rival the bereaved drama that we once watched unfold at solemn Edoras. But it's clear that this trilogy's unique selling point is its levity. Tolkien's tome was equally whimsical but never this witty. In Freeman we have an expert comic actor, naturally likable and fussily British; almost the antidote to the imperious Hollywood superhero.<br/><br/>The flaws are few and forgivable. Lee Pace's Thranduil comes dangerously close to the wrong side of salted ham. There are some odd narrative decisions late on - the intercutting between Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain kind of removes some of the tension from the dwarfs' ruckus with Smaug. It seems churlish to expect a symphony a year, but Howard Shore's score seems to be strangely lacking in variety this time around. And perhaps Alfrid (Ryan Gage) is no more than a cartoon version of Grima Wormtongue - although he and the Master of Laketown (Stephen Fry) are a fun combination nonetheless. Also, some will probably turn their nose up at the suggested romance between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel, but I found it quite touching.<br/><br/>All the elements of direction, performance and design combine for a joyous romp - and, better still, we've moved beyond the Shire and Rivendell to romp in luscious locations new. It's the world's most spectacular fan fiction: Jackson and co have built a giant on the shoulders of Tolkien's Hobbit. Enjoy."

","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is the middle movie of the fantasy prequel trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The movie still has an enormous runtime, but the film moves at a steady pace backed by fantastic action sequences, excellent CGI (I'm looking at you, Smaug), great acting, and even a forbidden romance. We get some old, but welcome faces returning, most notably Legolas. The movie continues the same tone as An Unexpected Journey, but it is a little darker and at times, I felt like I was watching the Lord of the Rings tone-wise. Also, Smaug was impressive. His very words reeked of evil and Jackson did a great job bringing this literary beast to life.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's film continues the journey of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs as they continue their trek to the Lonely Mountain. They must fight through hungry spiders, blood-thirsty orcs, stubborn wood elves, a shapeshifter named Beorn, corrupt men of Laketown, and of course the dragon Smaug himself.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, I think. Martin Freeman makes a fantastic Bilbo and he is good at making some great quips. Ian McKellan is fantastic as always as Gandalf. Richard Armitage continues his kingly manners as Thorin Oakenshield. Orlando Bloom makes a wonderful return as everyone favorite elf, Legolas. We have some good newcomers here: Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, the she-elf who falls for the dwarf Kili, Lee Pace as the cold-hearted leader of the wood elves, and Luke Evans as Bard, a man who helps the dwarfs and yearns to kill Smaug.<br/><br/>Overall, the Desolation of Smaug is an excellent movie. The Hobbit movies deserve a lot more credit than people give them for. They are different in tone and story from the Lord of the Rings, but they are still entertaining in their own way. This movie is led by many action sequences. I particularly enjoyed the barrel sequence as the dwarfs escape from the wood elves while be attacked by the orcs. That was an entertaining sequence highlighted by the fiery moves from the elves. The movie ends on a high note and I'm eager for what comes next. I rate this film 10/10."

","Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield are on a quest to recover the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) and unite the dwarf armies. The group travels through Mirkwood where they encounter the wood elves. Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are elves who end up following the group. Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) goes off to investigate the true enemy behind the looming threat.<br/><br/>This is a good improvement over the first part. It is essentially one long road trip. There is no need for an introduction. There are several compelling action sequences. I especially like the barrel rides. Also there are a couple of good character sequences. Oakenshield and Tauriel have some good interactions and build up some good chemistry. Then Bilbo has some great funny moments with Smaug. It's a great ride and what I hoped the first movie would have been."

And the movie's Score !! for god's sake I still watch lotr movies because of its score ,, each scene has a perfectly matching music that feels like it was made for this scene .. this doesn't happen in the desolation .. In my opinion the lotr movies are a one time experience in a lifetime ,, i don't think that there will ever be a movie that matches these movies .. even their creator can't make a movie that is close to them .. I really wish the third installment of the hobbit franchise satisfies all lotr hardcore fans like me ."

It seems he can bow and arrow them from two Feet! The acting is okay, but the actors look bored silly. The script goes on and on over the same lines - how you can kill a good quest! The dwarfs and elves are like background wallpaper instead of real frontline characters, while Stephen Fry (playing basically Charles the First) is only slightly comical. And we have three more hours to go after the hours of boredom with 'Lord of the Rings!' Oh dear, can I stay awake in anticipation - the trailer for 'The Lego Movie' looked more interesting!"

","There is a warning uttered in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings:<br/><br/>""Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.""<br/><br/>Alas, the same cannot be said of Peter Jackson (despite his mastery of CGI wizardry) and his Hobbit movies, which meddle considerably with Tolkien's original plot and possess all the subtlety of a rampaging dragon.<br/><br/>In The Desolation of Smaug — the second chapter of Jackson's Hobbit trilogy — the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain continues, along with all of the flaws and missed opportunities that plagued the first movie. As with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this film is wonderful to look at, but many of the details are lost as the characters race through the movie, pausing every now and then for gratuitous action sequences. (In fact, they don't even stop for the worst of these, but engage in ludicrous combat while floating down a river in the world's most indestructible wooden barrels.)<br/><br/>The action sequences have (with perhaps one or two exceptions) only become more frantic and unsatisfying since the last movie. There's no emotional weight to most of the action, and no real plot or character- driven purpose either. It's just there to look good, and it often doesn't succeed. The main offenders here are the newly introduced Elves who bound about unconvincingly and make impossible feats look so commonplace that they become boring immediately.<br/><br/>Much of this mindless mayhem could be forgiven if the perpetrators were fun, quirky characters who felt at least a little like real people as opposed to cartoons with funny hair. Unfortunately, despite its length, The Desolation of Smaug does very little to develop distinctive characters or meaningful interactions beyond a few basics for the most important protagonists. Martin Freeman's near-perfect Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage's gruffly charismatic Thorin Oakenshield are given a few chances to display signs of personality, as are fellow adventurers Kíli (Aidan Turner) and Balin (Ken Stott), but such tidbits are few and far between.<br/><br/>Middle Earth newcomers Lee Pace and Evangeline Lilly (along with Lord of the Rings veteran Orlando Bloom) are unremarkable but respectable as superhuman and aloof elves Thranduil, Tauriel, and Legolas. Jackson even permits them to show a few flashes of personality in between airborne archery sessions. They actually get more non-action screen time than many of the characters from the first movie.<br/><br/>No discussion of The Desolation of Smaug is complete without mention of the titular villainous lizard. Here, at least, the movie rises to the occasion. Voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and gloriously rendered via CGI, Smaug is at least as fearsome as he was in the book, and the extra time spent (running, of course) in his mountain lair is a welcome expansion of the original material.<br/><br/>If you liked the first Hobbit movie, you'll almost certainly like the second one. Just beware of Elves, savour the dragon, don't hope for much emotional content, and you might make it through without too much disappointment.<br/><br/>http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/hobbit-desolation-smaug"

The only place where it looked fake I think it was in the extended Two Towers scene when Faramir almost choke him.<br/><br/>Pretty lame story, script and characters.

Not like LOTR, but we got Narnia style instead. The first one was better IMO.

","If the first Hobbit film was hampered by a treacherously slow introduction as the dwarfs wooed Bilbo, here Jackson jumps right into the action — and make no mistake, this is an action movie above all else. The battles are visceral and physical, Jackson's horror roots shining through in the vie's fondness for decapitations, and while there's no mistaking the aid of computer-generated imagery, the polish is so high it all comes together in a delirious frenzy.<br/><br/>This film was always going to be subjected to high expectations, and while Smaug is certainly an improvement over An Unexpected Journey it never hits the heights of Jackson's first forays to Middle-earth. Unto itself, that's fine; this is a different story, after all, with a different kind of appeal and charm all its own. However, it's that decision to turn Tolkien's children's book into a grand trilogy that continues to define the new series."

"stationary315","5","4","7","26 December 2013"," Extremely disappointed.
","This is lengthy, and riddled with small spoilers, but there really is no major plot line to the movie or cliff hanger at the end, so it won't hurt for you to read the whole review before seeing the movie.. The love-triangle between the dwarf, Tauriel, and Legolas was completely unnecessary. It was cheesy, predictable, and poorly done. Bilbo's character in the book is one of wit and clever remarks; one who sneaks his way through sticky situations. We get a Brief glimpse of this Bilbo in the beginning of the scene with Smaug, but the Bilbo in the rest of the movie is a conqueror of dead bodies- someone who he is never portrayed as in the book. Granted, this inconsistency was sort-of justified when he mentions to Gandalf that he found his courage, and Gandalf replies ""Good. You'll need it"", but the drastic change of his character for the movie was unnecessary. Up until 3/4ths of the way into the movie, when we finally get to the hidden door, I kept finding myself thinking I was watching another Narnia or Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and at one point I thought I was watching Harry Potter. When they finally get to their destination, I felt I was watching a LOTR movie, as the playful and witty side of Bilbo finally reared it's head, and he made me chuckle like he did in the first movie. Smaug was phenomenally terrifying, and as I said, he made the ENTIRE movie. Due to that, though, I found myself wondering if the reason that the green-screens were so obvious, much of the acting so terrible, and the writing so cheesy and predictable was because Jackson spent his entire budget pimping out Smaug with every special effect under the sun, and on lovely, convincing costumes and hair extensions. These movies aren't supposed to be people-pleasing movies; with the oh so popular ""love triangle"" plot-line that has every teenage girl of this generation begging for more and choosing teams (we don't need any ""Team Legolas!"" t-shirts); or where there are completely unbelievable and ridiculously lengthy fight scenes for the guys who have to live vicariously through Legolas standing on two dwarfs heads, shooting arrows at Orcs, who have incredibly poor aim. These movies are supposed to be ones that make LOTR fans smile with recognition of a line from a book, and applaud at the end because of how accurately the movie portrayed the books they fell in love with. In the first Hobbit movie, the dwarfs are all very intimidating, regal, and (while a few of them make you laugh impressive characters. In this movie, they are cast in a very different light. They're made to be significantly shorter than everyone else, which I know is how they are supposed to be, but it's reflected much more often and more obviously in this movie than ever before, and it seems they are looked down on by everyone else. They are made to be greedy and selfish; something I think is incorrect. While Thorin may be struggling with those traits in his self-doubt and personal journey, the struggle he's going through is made very subtle and unimportant in the film, when in fact it's something of great importance. There are also obvious inconsistencies sprinkled through the movie. The dwarfs miraculously have weapons to fight off the hoard of Orcs attacking them while they're floating down waterfall after waterfall in barrels that would have sunk the first 5 seconds of their long journey down the river, and then the weapons seem to just disappear by the time they reach the shore. The Elves are always portrayed as complete bad asses until they accidentally forget to pay attention to their surroundings and a huge horde of Orcs sneaks up on them and kills like 30 of them.Gandalf makes his way up a treacherous staircase into a black hole of a place (I think they are tombs, but whose they are is something we don't get to know. We just know there's 9 of them), where he finds Radagast. I'm curious as to why, if Radagast is the one who found the Necromancer's hide-out in the first Hobbit movie, he seems to not know of the Necromancer's presence in THIS movie. There were also scenes that were OBVIOUSLY placed in the movie to show off lame special effects and waste time. A prime example would be the guy who changes into a bear. Why did we need to hear his whole 30-minute sob story? The one and only purpose he served was providing donkeys. And what was the point of the 20-minute scene with Thorin talking to the Elf king? Or the 10-minute scene showing the relationship between the creepy sidekick and the really ugly human king? There are also a plethora of loose ends. They spend half the movie building up this romance, but then when Tauriel makes the decision to save the dwarf and not help Legolas in the slaughter of the really ugly Orcs, there's no consequence. After SO many different, and very dramatic looks between people, nothing happens when she finally makes her decision. There is a super weird part where she glows and says some elvish stuff and they touch hands like awkward 8th graders. So you have that to look forward to. And might I add, that as a girl, I was really unimpressed with the eye candy for this movie. Clearly that's the only reason Bloom was included, and he looked really weird the whole time because of his face. The dwarf guy was probably supposed to be hot too, but he is always cross-eyed, so I had a hard time taking him seriously Another loose end is how Gandalf is being held captive, locked in a cage, hanging off a cliff. But we're supposed wait for the other movie to see him figure his way out."
"itchy_de","6","4","7","19 December 2013"," Disappointed, but not overly so
","The Desolation of Smaug is not a bad movie and will certainly find its audience. But where I found the first movie to be refreshingly entertaining, because it took time to tell the tale of the dwarfs' undertaking, this second movie brought back everything I didn't like from the original trilogy. Legolas surfing on a shield on the stairs of Helm's Deep or on an Oliphant's trunk. I found these over-the-top action scenes childish and unfit for otherwise really great movies.<br/><br/>However, in this movie, there was simply too much of it. Peter Jackson's decision of bringing Legolas and Tauriel into play is not bad per se. But when these two characters add nothing to the story other than showing at least a hundred creative ways of how to penetrate orcish skulls, I could not help but silently pray for these scenes to just go away. It seemed that Legolas actually lost a lot of skill in the time between the Hobbit storyline and the Lord of the Rings story, because if he had kept up the same dead-orcs-per-minute rate, Gimli and the rest of the fellowship would have had a quiet vacation trip with Legolas enjoying his Orc genocide.<br/><br/>Which is disappointing, because Bilbo's and Gandalf's performances are just as one would expect: absolutely fabulous. Smaug is a beautiful creation of modern CGI technology. I really enjoyed the movie's more silent minutes."
"currywh1998","7","4","7","16 December 2013"," ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is King Under the Mountain!
","It's hard not to chuckle at the irony hidden within the fabric of the Hobbit trilogy. The Hobbit films are based on the 300-page story of the same name that contains such prominent themes of greed and materialism-was stretched into a 3-part ""cash-grabbing"" epic by Warner Brothers (it is not the first time they have done this). The good news is, despite the somewhat disconcerting motives, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is a fantastic adventure that establishes its place in adventure-cinema as one of the best.<br/><br/>In ""The Desolation of Smaug, the band of 13 dwarfs plus a hobbit and a wizard continue their journey towards the lonely mountain in hopes of reclaiming the dwarf kingdom of Erebor back from the dragon Smaug. I was one of the few who actually enjoyed ""An Unexpected Journey"". While far from perfect, the movie boasted superior performances to those in the LOTR trilogy and a lighter tone that I felt was in the spirit of the book, with the exception of scenes bordering on the ridiculous (i.e. any scene containing Radagast), though it was hard not to feel as if something was missing. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" fixes those problems, and in its place provides a tighter, more purposeful narrative, impeccably choreographed action sequences and a whole lot of valuable character development, while providing a darker tone that somehow maintains the spirit of the book. Director Peter Jackson takes a lot of creative liberty by drawing material from some of Tolkien's other works. The integration of this material works surprisingly well in ""The Desolation of Smaug"" due to the fact that most of it pertains in one way or another to Lord of the Rings and that ""The Desolation of Smaug"" feels a lot more like ""The Lord of the Rings"" in its presentation. Jackson and co. should be applauded for their work in this regard.<br/><br/>Although much of the ""excess"" material was taken from the appendices of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the same cannot be said for all of the additions. In particular, I am referring to the addition of Legolas and Tauriel. Nowhere in the book does Legolas appear, although his integration is logical in ""The Desolation of Smaug"" due to the fact that his father, Thranduil plays a large role in the story. Tauriel on the other hand is a character that was created for the film, as Jackson felt that a 21st century adaption of the book could not go without any female characters (the book has none). Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly is part of the elven- guard and is established as a fierce warrior from the first shot she is in. Her character was more interesting than I expected, which should be credited to Evangeline Lilly, who is the best actor of all of the elves that appear in this film. Overall, her character was awesome, while also giving meaning to the term ""wood-elf"" (from my adolescent perspective).<br/><br/>As for the rest of the crew, Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman was as good (if not better) than he was last year in ""An Unexpected Journey"". Freeman perfectly conveys the effect that the ring is starting to have on Bilbo, as well as having the adept ability to be a hobbit. You also start to see more shades of Thorin as the dwarfs near Erebor and the gold within. Thorin beings to falls prey to the seductive power of the treasure that plagued his ancestors and begins to care less about his comrades. Richard Armitage displays this transition admirably. As for the other dwarfs, it is more of the same, although more emphasis is placed on Fili and Kili this time around for reasons that those who have read the book know. The most impressive performance in this film belongs to Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug, whose voice shook the theater every time he spoke. The representation of Smaug is exactly as I imagined in the book and makes the third act the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>Even though ""The Desolation of Smaug"" possesses a darker tone than its predecessor, the film still has that charm that distinguished ""An Unexpected Journey"" from the ""Lord of The Rings."" The dark tone is relative, as the action sequences are filled with improbable acrobatics, minimal blood and little resistance from the attackers establishing the lower stakes and lighter tone simultaneously. The orcs in this film do not seem to have any ability in combat, even though they are bred warriors. While it is incredibly entertaining to watch these sequences, the movie does drift dangerously close to your typical action flick without ever being one--We have Peter Jackson's obsessive attention to detail and long run times to thank for that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a vast improvement over its predecessor. The ""meat"" of the story consists of the most iconic and memorable moments from the book. This movie contains the best action sequences of the year, some impressive visuals, great performances, an amazing representation of the iconic barrel riding scene that made everyone in the theater laugh out of pure joy, the best movie dragon ever, and an amazing cliffhanger ending in its purest form. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" does what a good sequel does. It improves upon it predecessor, increases the stakes, and makes you excited for the next installment. ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is fantastic!"

","And so, the pack's journey continues- on a quest to rid Middle Earth of the viscous dragon, Smaug. Bilbo Baggins has decided to keep the mysterious, golden ring (or we can just call it ""The One Ring!"") and his interest in it begins to develop even further. How much longer can he hold onto this secret and retain the group's trust, especially that of his old friend, Gandalf? The Desolation of Smaug is undoubtedly a more grandiose experience when compared to the trilogy's first installment (An Unexpected Journey). I was actually one of the biggest admirers of the first part, mind you, and discerning the greater praise for this film definitely brought me into a state of larger anticipation for its release. <br/><br/>With that being said- and to no surprise- the visual effects remain awe- inspiring. The spectacular production design will fully immerse you in this epic world that Peter Jackson impeccably constructed. You will never, for one second, sense the actuality of the events transpiring on a movie set- everything from the detailed, fantastical forests to the gloriously designed caves, suffused with gold and remarkable architecture. If you find these special moments beautiful to no end, wait until you see the dragon (Smaug) unleash fury and prove his utter formidability in the film's exhilaratingly action-packed and lengthy finale. Like I said, the production value for a movie has never felt more imposing. <br/><br/>I also immensely appreciated the thoughtful focus on each individual character as we witness certain dynamics and interesting arcs throughout, involving not only the dwarfs but a satisfying and significant inclusion of favorites like Legolas and enjoyable new additions like the badass beauty, Tauriel, and strong-willed Bard. However, its grandeur only goes so far before you start to notice detrimental flaws the film persistently carries along. First of all, the picture essentially lacks focus as a result of introducing countless characters/villains and extended peripheral scenes between minor characters and situations. There are so many subplots tossed in- considering Jackson's enormous ambition of capturing the entire lore of Tolkien's product- that the main storyline ultimately becomes muddled. Though I applauded the emphasis on numerous characters, the execution comes with a fault, and the characterization is subsequently more transparent than subtle. <br/><br/>Then, we have the lackluster script that's pervaded by hackneyed one- liners and overall clichéd dialogue. The screenplay basically attempts to implement the utmost menace into its villains by having them utter the most stereotypical (thus unintimidating) phrases. I honestly have no recollection of a similar issue in An Unexpected Journey, but let's continue, shall we? My next sentiment could be deemed controversial and that of a minority's opinion, but I'll reveal it anyways: I frankly sensed the 3-hour-long duration in this case drastically more than I did with the first entry. A large contributor is the confrontation between Bilbo Baggins and Smaug himself. Their conversation just went on and on, juxtaposing with the troubling events occurring in several other settings and again returning to this ever-prolonged talk. You'd think Smaug would get right to it, but no, his lonesome self apparently receives pleasure from conversing with others. <br/><br/>I was also surprised by the absence of a memorable and exciting score when regarding An Unexpected Journey's amazingly gratifying soundtrack (""Far Over the Misty Mountains,"" anyone?). The music continued on but never happened to stand out in any of the more thrilling and intense sections. In addition, the plot definitely suffered from a hint of predictability since every situation was so miraculously resolved that any predicament succeeding it lost its potential tension. It'd be important to note the changed tone from the predecessor's; taking the fact that this is not Lord of the Rings into account, I much preferred the lighthearted tone in An Unexpected Journey. There was just a superior amount of fun in that one as opposed to the familiarly darker tone of this follow-up's. At the end of the day, I understand that these criticisms could be seen as, at least, partially subjective, but Desolation of Smaug didn't hype me for next year's continuation the way An Unexpected Journey did."

","I don't mean to sound like somebody who complains just for the sake of complaining but why the heck was it so slow?! You can tell they are stretching it in order to create a trilogy out of the book and milk the profit. Good movie, don't get me wrong but way too stretched as far as I am concerned. I saw it in IMAX today and in all honesty if it was 60min shorter it would have been perfect. Special effects were absolutely superb, days of being able to tell what is CGI and what is not are long gone by the looks of it. It surely was a thrilling ride and I would have enjoyed it so much more if it was not for the periods of time when it was just dragging on and on and on. The good news was that dwarfs skipped the song and 30 min. plate washing scene so I suppose it was an improvement from the first one. The best part? Evangeline Lilly dressed like and Elf :-)"

","In my younger and more patient years I read The Hobbit and LOTR. I always loved the universe Tolkien created; but never considered the books truly entertainment In fact, after re-reading The Hobbit recently; I found it disorganized. This was really a tale for her children and the book looks like that. Enters Jackson who made a masterpiece of LOTR. He deserves all the praise; but he worked with very good material; which is not the case here. The book is underdeveloped. The quest is interesting; but there are many characters without any personality; and the way the events are resolved is not that interesting. In a decision I applauded; Jackson altered the book adding events and characters and resolving situations in more dramatic, dynamic way. The timid adjustments on the first movie made it just OK, This time; he free himself and the longer the movie is twice the fun and without really breaching from the book. ( I still do not see the point of Evangeline Lili's Turiel but she is involved in several action scenes and is always charming ). In terms of effects and action the movie supersede any action blockbuster since LOTR. The Dragon sequence is outstanding; but there are others on almost the same level. There are also several ""human"" situations that flesh out what otherwise could be taken as a total fantasy. In brief; clocking on two hours and forty minutes; do not miss it in cinemas and try to see it 3D since this movie really deserves that treatment."

","Hugely entertaining. Plot is fast-paced and much more interesting than the first one. Characters are very well developed - we are now beginning to see the gentle Baggins show shades of grey as the invisibility ring starts to get a hold of him. Thorin too, shows signs of greed. <br/><br/>Lots of funny moments and dialogues. A stunning scene is when Baggins is face-to-face with Smaug, and is at once hapless and sharp. This was Baggins at his most vulnerable...and to watch him pander to Smaug was simply hilarious. Voicing by Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug was just fabulous...not does he look terrifying, but he SOUNDS equally menacing. All in all, highly recommend watching this in the theatres."

They then find themselves captured by Elfs, barreling down a river, smuggled into lake town, all to reach the lonely mountain to find the Arkenstone to and to reclaim their homeland.<br/><br/>Gandalf heads to Dol Guldur, in order to face the Necromancer but discovers a more dangerous plot being conjured up by Azog the orc.<br/><br/>After entering the lonely mountain, Bilbo enters and tries to the find the stone, only to waken the sleeping, 90 foot dragon known as Smaug, who claims he is the king under the mountain and won't let Bilbo or the dwarfs leave without a fight.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug picks up the pace from the first film which sets up the adventure nicely leading to this epic sequel. The cast give an amazing performance and their new addition Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't do such a bad job himself. There's more action, more characters and more laughs as the lonely mountain calls the dwarfs home. <br/><br/>Ed Sheeran's song 'I see Fire' is so beautifully written and performed, it really sets the tone of the film and you can really feel/understand how Thorin Oakenshield and the dwarfs feel/felt about the destruction of their homeland and each other.<br/><br/>Can't wait till next year for The Hobbit: There And Back Again."

Few side stories crop along the way which will make even more sense in the next installment.<br/><br/>So much importance has been given to ""The Desolation of Smaug"", that it appears by itself on the screen rather than as a sub-title to ""The Hobbit"".<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has once again proved his mettle as have Ian Mckellen, Martin Freeman and the Hobbit brothers.

The plot, such as World of Warcraft can never be a trilogy like Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson's new film lacks freshness and a refresher, we know that the Lord of the Rings movies.Unfortunately, it can only be a fan of The Hobbit movie trilogy Lord of the Rings, and Tolkien novels recommended. Perhaps the film to good effect and it is highly entertaining. But overall the film for audiences who love the fantasy genre is extremely boring.

","I know you're tempted, but don't do it. Resist the temptation. There is nothing in this movie worth seeing - and I really looked forward to it.<br/><br/>Jackson serves us an effects-filled Christmas smorgasbord of running-and-screaming- character-sequences piled one on top of the other. The camera flies and spins, everything explodes and crashes - it's a visual onslaught for almost three hours. Imagine being stuck on a roller coaster for that long.<br/><br/>And the characters arrive in the dozens, screaming, shouting, making no sense and having no emotional impact whatsoever. Contrived love stories, ""threatening"" bad guys, we don't even get time to care about the real hero of this story, Bilbo. He seems to only have a use in this story when he is stabbing monsters, sneaks around or runs for his life. We don't care about him or the scores of characters that surround him.<br/><br/>If you want a 2.5hr shallow visual extravaganza, that leaves you feeling absolutely nothing but empty rage as you leave, go see it. Waste your time, money, and when you're done, ask ourself - is this anywhere near what Tolkien had in mind when he created this tale? Does it do the work justice? And I'm not saying a movie must slavishly follow the book, but when a movie version is as shallow and pointless as this one, It makes me upset and sad because now the work is ruined and probably won't be told again for at least a generation. Jackson's version will be the one most people think is The Hobbit, and that is truly sad.<br/><br/>And the worst part is, I gave him my money, and by doing so, encourage him (and others who chase the same big movie dollar) to repeat this sorry effect-spectacular excuse for a movie.<br/><br/>DO.

","Guess what this middle Hobbit has a distinct lack of (see title)? Setting the inherent issue of spreading a 350-page book into nine hours aside, this installment falls, to quote, ""utterly short."" Though An Unexpected Journey was nothing if not flawed, there were certainly high points that could ring well with the right set of mind. Unfortunately, there's a distinct lack of effort to help its sequel stand out, other than the looks and pedigree of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Being a mid-point movie, The Desolation of Smaug has the disadvantage of no real beginning and ending; though the opening scene does a fair job setting the stage and getting us back on track. Beyond that, it's a long, rough ride. The movie feels like it's going from scene to scene while doing little to leave an actual impression. Technically a lot of ground is covered, but this journey wears you out due to the runtime, as opposed to the impact of its scenes.<br/><br/>Many of the film's key moments (action) feel more like theme park ride attractions. In fact, shortly before the film's abrupt ending, I found myself thinking, ""this is a three-hour pitch for a Middle Earth theme park."" Speaking of key moments, the more serious points are always short-lived and tough to feel invested in. Why? Because this movie tends to have such a comical overtone, whether intentional or not, that the few seemingly dark points come off as out of place. The absence of blood during scenes where orcs upon orcs are slain only makes the entire movie feel more like a Saturday morning cartoon.<br/><br/>Then there's the part everybody wants to see: Smaug. The build up for this movie rests entirely on the last half-hour to forty-five minutes, where the dragon is woken up in a gold mine of a city. Not only that, but the dragon has a voice (Benedict Cumberbatch, no less). How is this entire sequence? Think back to how the Witch King died in Return of the King, oh so abruptly. Smaug's appearance is anything but brief, but the entire time I felt out of the experience. It's tough to pull off a talking dragon, but given the crew, I imagined a more convincing and intimidating beast. Instead, the best part about Smaug is what leads up to his awakening. Then the talking started. For every shot that Smaug appears in, I kept asking, ""Do I like this? Do I buy this? Am I enjoying this?"" Yet the answer resides in the fact I kept asking these questions in the first place. <br/><br/>As you can undoubtedly tell, I have a lot of issues and complaints to go around for The Desolation of Smaug. Though there are good aspects to find, they were also superiorly present in its predecessor(s). Even when Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers ended, they at least had enough of a transition to avoid that awful, arbitrary cliffhanger effect. Here, however, I could feel the air of disappointment and frustration in the theater. Rather than shock, excitement and anticipation, the reactions reeked of moaning and groaning.

"jakimiku","8","9","22","13 December 2013"," A Different View
","Some spoilers so please, be advised. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is Peter Jackson's continual of the adventures of Bilbo and the company. A lot of changes to the book, a lot of liberties. Overall I think it works well enough.<br/><br/>The main storyline resolves around the company of the dwarfs and Bilbo, as they set their sight upon the Lonely Mountain and reclaiming Erebor, now that they have come Under the Mountain of the goblins. This is portrayed very well and there is more depth to the characters. It was particularly interesting to see how Thorin is slowly beginning to change, not too much, but with a glimpse of what is to come. He makes some heavy decisions in Desolation and grows darker the more they close in on Erebor. The rest of the dwarfs get a chance to shine themselves as well and Bilbo is steadily crafting a serious reputation among them as a burglar.<br/><br/>I was very glad to see that the elves were shown in greater light. I have read the book a dozen times and more and the one concern I had was that the book is a classic fairy tale: the side characters are terribly underdeveloped and used as mere pawns to move the plot. This, however, ran in odds with the importance the elves hold in the story and Peter Jackson nailed the execution. My point: there are only two elves named in the book: Elrond and The Elvenking. None of the other elves are pointed out, save the guard from whom Bilbo steals the keys in the dungeon. That is why I am happy to see Legolas and Tauriel. Legolas is the son of Thranduil, a couple of thousand years old and it makes more than sense to include him in the film. Seeing him before friendship with Gimli and his dislike for dwarfs is an intriguing notion. Tauriel is a side character and therefore I don't think adding her suffers the film, on the contrary, she is a great character (and brings a female perspective otherwise nonexistent; keep in mind that Jackson also expanded Arwen greatly in Fellowship). As long as they are left as side characters and don't steal too much screen time from the company, it's acceptable.<br/><br/>The third part of the plot follows Gandalf and his quest to Dol Guldur. Like the elves, Gandalfs character is not treated with much care in the book: he disappears without any explanation and resurfaces in the same sudden manner. Jackson approaches it with concern, we know from the LotR books that Gandalf had a major role to play in Dol Guldur and this is shown in Desolation (and will be furthered in the next film). Mackellen acts with grace and great presence and is backed up by Radagast, who is more serious in this film.<br/><br/>The scenery was absolutely astounding. Thranduils halls and Erebor are done perfectly. The realm of the wood-elves is shown as their kin is described: less wise and more militiant, just compare their fortress with Elrond's Last Homely House. Thranduils halls are engraved in shadows and the elves are more aggressive. Lake-town also surprised me to great extent, it was built fascinatingly to float on the water. The fighting scenes in there were as impressive as others.<br/><br/>Now, there are some amazing scenes in this film, my favorite being the Barrel-ride. In the book it was quiet, the company escaped and then moved on. The stakes are much higher in the film which is not necessarily a bad thing. I won't even start with Smaug. Absolutely stupendous. Cumberbatch's voice gives shrills. Smaug is strong beyond words. The other adversary, Sauron, also portrayed by Cumberbatch, shows the strength that is to come and what we can expect from the third part. There is also humor in this film, and romance, but less and subsidiary. The world itself is wonderful and we feel like a part of it when watching the film. This is further helped by Howard Shore's amazing score.<br/><br/>In the end I would say that The Desolation of Smaug is a decent portrayal and improves on the first film. The changes to the book, the lot of them - everyone has their own opinions, mine is that they served the film well, the addition of Legolas and Tauriel is welcome and the increase of Bard's role as a man of Lake-town is as important. The dwarven company and Bilbo have reached the Mountain and unleashed the dragon. Next winter will conclude this epic adventure and this world and looking at how good The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is, we will be right to await it eagerly. I for one, am looking forward to watching Desolation many and more times before and after that."

","""The Hobbit"" would be adapted into three, and everyone reacted as if it was a Satanic action. The truth is that the first installment was disappointing, especially in its first half. It did redeem itself later. The second installment proves to be a complete success if you look at it for what it is, a beautiful adaptation loosely based on the novel. Peter Jackson fixed everything that was wrong with the first one. He left out the long conversations, the unnecessary exposition, and he concentrated on what he does best: a wonderful action movie, full of breathtaking scenery, incredible art direction and costumes and one of the most memorable scores in the last few years.<br/><br/>Our troop continues their quest to go back and take back their stolen loot and kingdom. Things won't be easy because they have the Orks chasing them, the Elves aren't exactly welcoming them, and Gandalf knows there is a bigger force behind everything that will eventually envelop the world in total darkness.<br/><br/>It is impossible to discover the amazing direction by Jackson. Just get ready for incredible sword fights, one thrilling race down the river, the lighting archery work by Legolas and his kin, and if you don't have enough, there is very nasty dragon who doesn't appreciate being awakened by the greedy dwarfs.<br/><br/>The magic continues, as spells as put forth, dwarfs are poisoned, and Smaug tries to stop the dwarfs from taking back what he has stolen. It is interesting to see events that happened before the trilogy because we can reflect on how these actions will affect the future. Ironically, the trilogy remains at the top, but this sequel in the prequel benefits from improvements on CGI and that terrific Howard Shore music score which brings every fight alive, and shows the good and bad in each of the character.<br/><br/>One of the best films of the year."
"Dragonsouls","7","6","13","13 December 2013"," The most unusual of the Tolkien/Jackson films.
","All in all, very disappointing...and here's why: <br/><br/>-Characters were no where near as fleshed out as the characters in the LOTR films. In those films, I felt Aragon's shame. I felt Frodo's pain. And I felt Gandaulf's concern. Not so this time around, and I thought Bilbo's character was second fiddle. Unlike the Hobbit: Unexpected Journey, which was a better film than this was IMO.<br/><br/>-No Gollum for the first time in a Hobbit/LOTR film. I love Gollum!! No Saruman, no Galadriel (except for a 2 second scene) Legolas was nice to see again, but he didn't have that chemistry with anyone, like he did with Aragon and Ghimli.<br/><br/>-Did I mention the few extras, with no large battle scenes with hundreds of horses and REAL people!. The movie felt small. Sure, the CGI was grand, but that doesn't add to the grandeur in my opinion. A couple of ORC's might be shown in make-up, the rest behind them were CG. I liked the Spider scene, and the best scene was when Gandalf faced off against...well, let's just say, someone very familiar! But, I can honestly say that my eyes got heavy during some of these action scenes...there were way too many...and I rather get some character development instead! This film is a prime example of being over-funded.<br/><br/>Despite my complaints, I absolutely loved Smaug. I just felt as if they spent so much money on his scenes to digitally create him that they forgot to pay Andy Serkis!! And I didn't even mention the simple, plain, mellow-dramatic soundtrack! The beautiful music of past films...don't expect to hear it in this film, or anything as masterfully composed.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's hard to rate a film of this magnitude under a 6. The end was fantastic, and the last 40 minutes of the film made up for the other 2, boring hours. I am a huge fan of the LOTR films and the Hobbit so I'm too committed to rate this any lower. Despite my huge disappointment."

Smaug is suitably terrible and terrifying. There are no weak performances and the story clips along at a fast pace.<br/><br/>If you've read the book, then most of the key elements of the story are addressed.

"boo_kitty327","8","6","13","13 December 2013"," Almost perfect....
","The Hobbit was the first book I ever read, and I've read it every year since for the past 20 years. I think that has put me at a disadvantage with the movie. When I saw the LOTR trilogy I had not yet read the books, and I loved every minute of it. With the Desolation of Smaug, I found myself nitpicking the changes too much to fully enjoy what I was watching. I had expectations for the movie and that was where I made my mistake. I should've walked into the theater with my mind clear and just enjoyed the artistic visions of the great Peter Jackson. I do love his work and he's a great director who surrounds himself with great actors. The good parts of this film are many and I will name just a few. I love the dragon. Great visual on him and I think Jackson was spot on with his character and Benedict was phenomenal with his voice role of both him and Sauron. I enjoyed the battle between Gandalf and Sauron too and with adding that into the Hobbit (although it isn't in the book) I felt it really adds extra depth to the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies. I actually love that they brought Legolas back because it only makes sense that he'd be in the woodland realm at the time. The barrel scene was an added fight sequence but they pulled it off well. When they finally enter the mountain, and Balin is teary eyed and overcome with emotion, I must admit I was too. I love Balin's character and I think that was a really nice moment. Now for the not so swell parts. In the first Hobbit movie, I absolutely loved how Jackson gave all the dwarfs their own special personalities. You got to know them on a personal basis and grow to love them as a whole, and therefore felt tied to their quest. That was missing in the second film. The dwarfs said very little, and most said nothing at all. Lets not forget that the story is about them and their journey, along with Bilbo. I thought that with being a trilogy, each movie being 2-1/2 hours in length they would have time to delve deeply into each scene of the book and really bring out the depths of the Tolkien world. Then you get to scenes like Beorn's and are sadly disappointed. I just knew Jackson would play out the scene in which Gandalf is slowly bringing in the dwarfs two at a time to Beorn, while telling the epic tale thus far to try to distract him from the number of dwarfs he would have to house, with lots of humor and be one of the best scenes of the movie, but the introduction was rather rushed and their visit even more rushed. The time spent in Mirkwood was rushed, the scene in which Bilbo saves the dwarfs from spiders was rushed, the amount of time spent in the woodland realm was rushed, and I kept hoping it would be rushed for some greater purpose in the long run. That leads me to the greatest problem of all. The character of Tauriel. I didn't care one way or the other that they made up a character for the movie. I was willing to give Jackson the benefit of the doubt. Then Tauriel is introduced and I was somewhat disappointed. She starts out seeming to have feelings for Legolas. Then she starts flirting it up with Kili minutes later. The whole drawn out scene in which she's talking with Kili about runes and his mother and all these tales, panning to a jealous Legolas watching in the shadows was completely pointless. This is what all those epic scenes were cut short for? I truly felt the scenes that mattered were cut too short, while the scenes that were not constructive to the story or just completely made up had way too much time. Tauriel got more lines than all of the dwarfs put together! From there it stays pretty much along those same lines. Rather then the day being saved by the epic and cunning moves of the great Bilbo Baggins from the woodland realm, he's a minor hero and Tauriel takes center stage in saving the day from a band of orcs. And just when you think they are now in Lake Town and we can get back to the real story, the plot gets totally changed around again, and just when you think all hope is lost for Kili, Tauriel jumps back into the scene and saves the day again. Much to the dismay of the jilted Legolas of course. I would never knock a good love story, but if I wanted to see the drama of a love triangle I would not choose to see it in The Hobbit. Had it not been for that, this could easily have been my favorite movie, as the first one started out to be. Still, it's worth watching and for anyone who hasn't read the books, I imagine this would be a great film. Maybe by next year when the third comes out I will be more adjusted to the twists and turns and can enjoy the finale. I think Jackson just wants to provide those familiar with the books the element of surprise, but that's treading on dangerous grounds for the die-hard Tolkien fan."

","The Hobbit: The desolation of smaug is beyond phenomenal,it's by far the best in the series and in my opinion the best movie of 2013.I had been waiting for this movie since I watched the final scene in last year's an unexpected journey and after watching the second chapter a few days ago I must say that Peter Jackson once again did not disappoint in making this film compelling and an emotionally fulfilling tale which once again leaves you eagerly waiting for the next chapter to be released.At the same time it's incredibly sad when you remember that next year this epic journey will come to an end.<br/><br/>The scenes with Smaug were stupendous .. the dragon was one of the reasons why this movie was so epic.All the characters were amazing.The cast and crew did a really fantastic job with this movie,I felt that there was an improvement from the previous instalment so they really deserve merit for their effort. I can't wait to see this movie for the second time.It was indeed impressive from start to finish and worth my time and money."
"caldaz-sheep","5","8","19","14 December 2013"," Very Disappointing. A shame to the series.
","I never wrote any reviews for the IMDb, but I was so disappointed by The Desolation of Smaug that I had to write one for this. I love all the Tolkien based movies and the Tolkien saga, and so I waited one year to watch this movie. Gladly went to the movies expecting a well made and epic fantasy adventure movie, and I get none of these.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug haves a incredibly terrible script, full of unnecessary scenes that it feels like an insult to the viewer's intelligence. The movie keeps throwing bad action scenes followed by cheesy futile discussions with dramatic scores. Differently from the other movies of the LOTR saga, the action scenes are just so unrealistic and you get that really boring feeling that nothing bad will ever happen with the characters. Not exciting at all. It feels nothing like reading the book. Its just a repetition of the same cheesy thing, over and over again.<br/><br/>It feels just like The Matrix all over again. Actually this movie could be called Hobbit: Reloaded.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, as it would be expected from an action-adventure movie, the story is good (it was taken from the book anyway) and the directing is really good, but it doesn't help how bad the scenes feel.<br/><br/>To summarize it, 50% of the movie is completely useless and boring, and it would do much better without it."
"juggernautkk","6","7","16","14 December 2013"," Desolation of Smaug crosses a line
","The Desolation of Smaug continues the Hobbit story in the second movie. Once again the there are the added story lines from the first movie and then some. After watching the second Hobbit movie I can only ask ""how much of story can be altered to keep the integrity of the book""? and while keeping an open mind to how closely most movies keep to their books (which is not much), I believe the Desolation of Smaug crosses this line. I understand and see why in this day and age more action was made out of the barrel ride, Lake Town and in Smaug's chamber, but after watching Kili the Dwarf hitting on a she-elf guard captain, I actually asked out loud in the crowded movie theater 'what the hell is this?' Without getting into too much geeky detail into the long history of elves and dwarfs and how this would never happen, I would presume after seeing this love scene Mr. Tolkien has rolled in his grave this weekend not unlike Bombour rolling over a half dozen orcs (with more precision than an Indy 500 driver). And how has this dwarf not lost a single pound after getting through Mirkwood? It seems as if he's actually GAINED weight since they've begun this adventure.<br/><br/>As in the first movie, the attention is taken away from Bilbo, his feelings, thoughts and actions, to me the crux of the Hobbit. Let's not forget the title of the book.<br/><br/>On a positive note the CGI of Smaug is incredible, his voice and movements were well done, as were the casting of Bard and the Laketown Master. Bolg is a much more believably goblin than Azog who has always just looked like an albino NFL linebacker to me. Why they did not attack Beorn in bear form seems to me a lost opportunity to show the power of the shape-changer which in the book comes into play later in the story, yet they just simply walk away from attacking him with 30 orcs because 'he is on guard'.<br/><br/>One element of the story that was added that was intriguing was the finding of the Arkenstone by Bilbo. This aspect of his job was not alluded to in the book and rather, Bilbo's job was to 'burgle', a point I always felt to be a weak part of the plot. Even in the book Bilbo, unknowing of the vastness of the hoard even points out after returning from the den ""...you didn't expect me to walk out with the entire hoard of the Thror on my back did you?"" By adding that he is to only burgle the Arkenstone to unite the Dwarfs, actually seems more plausible than what was once a truly impossible mission.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining and will certainly delight today's attention deficit audience. There is certainly nothing wrong with the movie if you've never read the book, but to a purist, the movie makers may have just bastar...changed it a little too much."
"modemanslutning","6","7","16","12 December 2013"," Really good, but it lacks the depth it needed
","To start out: I really liked this movie and didn't actually have a problem with the Tauriel character that is introduced (she is not in the book). Some of the fighting scenes are pure awesomeness in that way that they are original and (contrary to many other action scenes in other movies) do follow the law of physics, or bend them just slightly. The script is actually good but it needs character development, I would've given this movie a 9/10 if it had taken away many of the action scenes and replaced them with dialogue instead.<br/><br/>###SPOILERS BELOW, SPOILERS BELOW, SPOILERS BELOW###<br/><br/>OK, so I liked the character Tauriel, BUT, she was give a bit too much screen time. I liked the character Legolas in LotR a lot too, but it was a story about humans and hobbits, not elves, and therefore he was a minor character (not minor minor, but not as important as Gandalf or Aragorn) and they held it like that. As they should have. <br/><br/>But in these films it is a story about a hobbit and dwarfs. And yet we are given A LOT of action scenes with elves fighting orcs. And it feels unnecessary to have that many. And the scene when Tauriel says that Kili is tall, even for a dwarf, we (the audience) are told directly that they will develop some sort of romance. I really hated that scene, because it would have been better to skip it and then when she walked outside the cells she would have the conversation about the stone anyway and THEN start to care for him.<br/><br/>But what really angers me a lot is: Why was there only like 3 minutes screen time with beorn?!<br/><br/>This character has been on posters, he is important in the book, and it would be a good opportunity fo the audience to get a break in an action packed film so that the action will be better when we see it later. Also the reason that he likes these dwarfs and Gandalf is because he hates orcs and he has heard tales (from bird or something I don't remember atm) that they killed the great goblin. Seriosuly, skip some action and just have that small conversation about these things. The Mirkwood. The waiting with the barrels, that it actually will take some time for the dwarfs to escape the elven king.<br/><br/>Seriously, I really liked the action, but it's just too much. it can never reach full potential if we don't care about the characters, and we care about them if we know and understand them better. And to do that we need more dialogue. Cut away like 10-15 minutes with action and replace it with character development. It is possible.<br/><br/>But still, thanks anyways Peter Jackson."
"TwoWheelsFilm","10","3","5","5 March 2017"," Amazing Movie
","I felt compelled to write a review after watching this amazing film. The Lord of the Rings sequels are great but seeing these Hobbit movies just amazes me to see how far CGI has come. If you're looking for a movie with plenty of action and amazing cinematography then look no further than The Hobbit trilogy. These films will keep you on the edge of your seat and it's a family friendly trilogy as well."
"skyminster","9","3","5","11 November 2015"," The best Hobbit film, and a must see
","After watching various impressive trailers of the film, I expected great things from The Desolation of Smaug. And I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>This second film offers more thrills and adventure, and doesn't have the hour long intro. The action is intense right from the start and is paced brilliantly with dramatic scenes scattered throughout the 2 and a half hours running time; not impeding the progress of the story or the other segments of the film, instead, funnels it on – in exciting ways. But it doesn't just jump into them: the transitions between scenes work brilliantly with the superb cinematography — and often the patented sweeping long shots, which show off the spectacular places in which the film takes place perfectly. It's pretty much down to good directing by Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>And, yes! The sets and all that! They were perfect. Mirkwood was Perfect. Lake-town was Perfect. And the lonely mountain itself? Perfect. And then there's the sound, and that's also fantastic.<br/><br/>The story flows fantastically with some great character development of characters that were very much side-lined in the first film: like Kili – with his interesting romantic side plot with Tauriel, a female elf, who seems a great addition to the film. However, some of the dwarfs were still left untouched in that department, just travelling with the rest of them, not really doing or saying anything of interest. Nevertheless, as a unit, the development is interesting: especially in the dragon scenes towards the end, where they act as heroes instead of the bumbling idiots they were portrayed as in the first film. But I'm not saying that was a bad thing given the slightly more comedic feel to the first film, I'm saying it's a good thing that they were not portrayed as 'bumbling idiots' in the second film because of the more melodramatic atmosphere it has.<br/><br/>Most characters were portrayed brilliantly with great and expressive acting, for the most part keeping the characters true to the book (but tweaked when they needed to be). One actor that particularly stood out was, of course, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins; alongside Ian Mckellen, Orlando Bloom and Luke Evans. Also, Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin was especially good, on par with Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn – which is a pretty impressive feet. But these performances all paled in significance to Benedict Cumberbatch's incredible voice acting as Smaug. It was brilliantly expressive and stylized, and fit my favourite dragon perfectly, giving him an additional menacing air. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about it; it's truly awesome. Smaug really does steal the show; well, you'd want him to when he's the main advertising point of the film, in its title and the main focus of the film when it gets into the last hour and a half. Anyway! Benedict Cumberbatch, although I hate to say it, may well deserve the hype he gets (based on this performance, anyway).<br/><br/>Furthermore, Luke Evans is fantastic as Bard: who is a fantastic character himself. Also, Steven Fry's appearance is completely fitting, giving his character's situation.<br/><br/>Aside from the characters and their portrayals; the visuals and the 3D of the film were nothing short of spectacular – some aspects even impressing me more than Gravity (and that was impressive!). Although, the CGI was a little overused at various points where models would have possibly served as the better choice – of course considering whether the use of models is realistic. The Lord of the Rings seemed to do a good job with it, anyway.<br/><br/>Of course you're wondering: did it drag with its length like the first one? Well, it is a similarly long film, but doesn't really feel like it is; because of the stimulating action throughout and its fantastic pacing. So, yeah, it doesn't drag at all.<br/><br/>This film is obviously trying to be as good as The Lord of the Rings, and it is so agonizingly close to doing it; but that isn't the way I want to think about it, because no film in my mind can quite live up to the perfection of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But this Hobbit film is pretty damn incredible.<br/><br/>PS. The best parts of the film are in Mirkwood and scenes towards the end involving Smaug.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>In The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug, Smaug is the centerpiece of what is a fantastic thrill ride, with the perfect blend of action and narrative paced perfectly, helped by some superb acting and amazing cinematography. The only thing inherently wrong with this film I can think of is that it has a tad too much CGI; but, what the hell: it's a must see and definitely the best Hobbit film.<br/><br/>So I give it: 96/100."

","After successfully passing through the Misty Mountains, Bilbo Baggins and his dwarf companions must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest...unfortunately without Gandalf. If they reach the human settlement of Laketown it will be time for Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and find out how to open the Secret Door which will give them access to the vast hoarde inside along with the Arkenstone that the dwarfs all seek. There's just one tiny problem...the great dragon, Smaug, has claimed the treasures inside as his own.<br/><br/>Everything that is in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - the cinematography, the occasional dry humour, the massive scale, the great fight scenes, and the absolutely amazing special & visual effects - can be seen in this next installment. Unfortunately, one thing that is here that wasn't in An Unexpected Journey is the slower pace because the first 1½ hours of the film does seem to drag on a touch. Thankfully it picked up much more in the last hour which bumped up the rating for me.<br/><br/>While I feel the the majority of the film was made fantastically and looked great, I think that some of the fight scenes between Legolas and the orcs, lead by the Necromancer, was a touch over the top i.e. Legolas balancing on two dwarfs heads, travelling at speed down a river, while fighting orcs with his bow and arrow. I know that the elven community are graceful warriors in these films, but I just felt that some of the fighting was too much.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is still a must-see film, and for those moaning that the film is different from the book...it's a film ADAPTATION, folks! Plus, the films are beefed out, so to speak, because The Hobbit, unlike Lord Of The Rings, is not a trilogy.<br/><br/>This may be not as good as the 1st part, but still an enjoyable ride nonetheless. Looking forward to The Battle of the Five Armies now."

"geocraftsman","1","3","5","23 March 2014"," The hobbit; ruins the spirit of the original book.
","This movie is based upon a book named the hobbit, and another series called the Silmarillion, wrote by J.R.R Tolkien. This is a bad decision because it leaves the story unfocused, jumping to other plots that do not pertain to the story of the hobbit at all! And the camera do not help this jumping around at all. These camera move all over the place! If you want to make an epic adventure movie with atmosphere, a steady camera is important. There is no time to breathe or look at the world around you! The entire movie is a blur of information that goes by too fast and messily for you to take a break and and say; ""Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, here's the story so far..."" It feels disjointed and overblown.<br/><br/>But camera issues aren't the only problem. The main problem is that it ruins the original spirit of the book! The best example are the orcs that follow around the dwarfs. I hate them so much! And not in a good way. I hate seeing them on screen because every other second, they are in another action fighting scene with the dwarfs! I am SICK of them! It is the same every time! There were no orcs on the dwarfs' butts in the BOOK, so why does the movie need them? <br/><br/>The best example of how the movie ruins the spirit of the book is the barrel scene. Gee, I HATE this scene! In the book, the dwarfs have to escape the elves by hiding inside barrels and floating down the river toward Lake town. It is clever and it is also like; ""Yeah, we escaped those elves and they don't even know it! Ha ha ha! Suckers!"" But here, the elves know they escaped and start attacking them! With a battle scene like this, you can't appreciate how sneaky it is because a battle scene is being forced into your stupid face. It is as if Peter Jackson is waving keys in front of our faces. We aren't stupid! But the again, ho can we APPRECIATE the sneakiness if the elves learn about the plans before the dwarfs leave! In addition to that, the orcs come to fight the dwarfs. What commences is a battle scene with the dwarfs, elves, and orcs all together. And it is over the top! For example, in the scene, for a few seconds, Bofur the dwarf receives dwarf barrel battle armor. Sounds silly, huh? That's because it is. <br/><br/>So that is my diagnosis of this film; a fast-paced, unmemorable, disrespectful to the books MESS nd large disappointment to Tolkien fans."

TV programme where you expect the director to shout ""action"" and where we view the filming from 'outside' before seeing a 'finished-product' clip. Totally spoilt the experience.

"CMTiago","8","3","5","3 January 2014"," A far more impressive outing
","Having recently seen the first hobbit movie for the first time, I wasn't expecting to watch the second one until after the Oscar nominations, where I was hoping to watch it as a contender in the technical categories. By a stroke of luck, I attended a midnight showing with a few family members, and left the theater amazed by how this picture had captivated me.<br/><br/>Following the quest started in ""An Unexpected Journey"", this movie begins with an initial flashback as to how the whole plot to take back Erebor came to fruition through a meeting between Thorin and Gandalf. Having set the foundations for those that missed the first part, the story then moves us to where we left off from the previous film. From then on you will be taken on a ride full of thrills, as you witness the perils of The Company facing the constant threat of the vicious orcs. But all is not gloomy as allies will arise in the form of two rebellious elves (the return of Legolas) and the despaired lake humans, with it all leading up to the epic encounter with Smaug, the dragon everybody had nightmares about when they were kids.<br/><br/>As a whole production, The Desolation Of Smaug is a movie adventure of epic proportions that provides us with a variety of aspects to enjoy, from the incredible visual effects that bring Smaug to life, to the beautiful photography that takes us to Middle Earth once again and makes us glare at its beauty, all while adding a little light humor to amuse the audience. The acting is once again on par with what is required, as leading man Martin Freeman brings his witty and goofy charm to the character of Bilbo Baggins. Other standouts include Sir Ian McKellen as the wise and determined wizard Gandalf, and the voice of Smaug, done splendidly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Peter Jackson manages to make this second entry more exciting and riveting, by never directing an action packed story that never lets us breathe. One particular scene that wowed me was a chase fantastically choreographed through battles between the elves (arrows), orcs (wooden clubs) and the dwarfs in the barrels (pieces of wood and stone), that closely resembled the one in The Adventures Of Tintin (produced by Jackson)<br/><br/>Running nearly three hours long, Desolation Of Smaug once again stretches the story so that the one book can be accommodated to three feature films. Nonetheless it doesn't drag at a slow pace like its predecessor, and with the combined efforts of the effects and narrative, it flows perfectly towards an ending that leaves us sizzling for the final entry in the series.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

While it's not on par with the original trilogy, it left me totally excited to see the final Hobbit film be released next year.<br/><br/>First, let me point out the negative things I do have with the movie. The pacing does drag the film a bit too fast and while the ending is very exciting, it's very abrupt much like the previous movie.<br/><br/>Flaws aside, everything else is great. The acting is brilliant especially Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, and others including the return of Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Benedict Cumberbatch (who played Khan perfectly in Star Trek: Into Darkness) pulled it off very well as the voice of Smaug the dragon. He really terrified me with that voice it would get stuck inside my head for a few years. The storyline is faithful to the spirit and tone of the middle half of the book and the action sequences are beyond epic.<br/><br/>The music score from Howard Shore is solid with some great new action cues while keeping the atmospheric tone it brought to the first Hobbit. The direction from Peter Jackson is great and flows the story very well. The CGI effects have improved a bit and it's a start. The visual effects and scenery is great and gives an epic feel to the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an epic improvement over the first Hobbit and it leaves you excited for The Battle of Five Armies in the final installment next year.

This has plenty of orcs slashing, magical powers, dwarf fights going all out, stealth, romance and dragon fighting. Oh and Legolas who wasn't mention in the book, using Elvish combat like he never used before in a film. Plus it has Evangeline Lilly as another made up character for the movie as Tauriel (who in my opinion is the most attractive female character to appear in Middle-Earth on screen). This is a fantastic movie which I thoroughly enjoyed, although the end or the climax seems to be dragged out a bit. Just about everything good about this movie is topnotch. I wouldn't mind seeing this one again. Oh and also when it comes to Legolas's dad, I thought he was a jerk until one of my friend gave me more insight on the Elvish way of life, their purpose and the way they do things. How they really have connections with Middle-Earth and how the natural environments have their backs. Anyways this is a amazing movie that is one of the top movies of 2013.<br/><br/>9.2/10"
"bhalodi-dhruv","10","7","17","14 December 2013"," One Word - FANTASTIC
","After i watched the movie 5 times i can only tell there is no greater power in world than Tolkien + Peter Jackson . Great Acting by all the actors. Mighty smaug was marvelous. Legolas retains the class he has in killing orcs. Thorin though getting affected by the greed but a king has to compromise. Already you can see the courage of the hobbit is growing though the ring is corrupting his mind. What can i say about Brad - The Bowman, He reminds me of the great Aragon. Both have failed Ancestors, Both struggling to get honor for their family and Ancestors. Gandalf the grey as always has his mind on all things trying to save all. he worries of his friends. wants to save the world though he is killed."

","Putting Middle Earth on screen and making Middle Earth are not the same thing. Jackson didn't create Middle Earth but he pictured Middle Earth and made it cinematically visual for all of us to watch. By doing so he is strongly influencing us and making millions of people around the world today, and generations to come, see what Middle Earth looks like. I am incredibly grateful for the world that Tolkien created, which later went on to Peter Jackson and they together created such a wonderful fantasy world.<br/><br/>I have seen the Movie twice now and it continued to entertain me as much as it did on it's premiere or maybe more?!<br/><br/>I thought to myself ""Finally i have been waiting for this since last year"" I was so hyped and happy because i knew that Peter again had created a fantastic movie. From beginning to the end, i was stuck to my chair with a big smile on my face!<br/><br/>This trilogy has the lack of seriousness and with that comes people that finds this movie not as enjoyable as the former Jackson's Middle Earth movies had, I didn't really care because i found it funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>I really think the jokes and the humor fits perfectly in this movie because of it's softness compared to the LotR movies. The thing which i find most touching is the character growth, For a little Hobbit like Bilbo who was scared to leave his home has now evolved into an entirely new character and i can't wait to see him the next time on the the cinema screen!!! It really felt like the characters and not only characters but also Tolkien himself came back to life and put on screen, although I could not see him, I knew that it was he who took me on an adventure. somehow Peter has managed to create this visual world of middle earth that we all know and love. I am very very grateful for the hard work that Peter Jackson has put into making this movie and i really look forward to the last part!<br/><br/>Score: 10/10"
"spikee5697","8","4","8","4 January 2014"," A slight improvement over the first entry to the trilogy. It might not be Lord of the Rings, but its pretty damn entertaining!
","Lord of the Rings has become the bible for the geek community. Now I'll admit, that I have never read The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, but I am huge fan of the films. I adore Peter Jackson award-winning trilogy and really dug the hell out of the first Lord of the Rings prequel The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Now this year we've gotten the second installment in this trilogy, which is called The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. <br/><br/>Before you see this film, you need to do your homework and see the previous installment or you will be completely lost. The film picks up where we left off last time. Bilbo and the Dwarfs are on the mountains and the movie goes from their. In this film the they are back on their quest to take back the city of Erebor and to do that they must take down the dragon known as Smaug, voiced by the menacing Benedict Cumberbatch.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting in this film, it is excellent! Martin Freeman is still awesome as Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage is so great as Thorin, the leader of the dwarfs. Luke Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch join the cast for this installment and are both fantastic, especially Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch voices Smaug the dragon, and gives one of the best performances I have seen by a voice actor. Ian McKellen is wonderful as Gandalf but it is disappointing to see that he isn't in the film as much as he was in the first film.<br/><br/>It seems that archery has become something big in media all of the sudden, with characters like Katniss Everdeen, Daryl Dixon and Hawkeye. Back in 2001-2003, the most bad-ass archer in media was Legolas and he is back in this film. Orlando Bloom was awesome back the Lord of the Rings trilogy and he is still equally as awesome in this Hobbit film.<br/><br/>When it comes to special effects, this film does not skimp on them. WETA Digital has been the effects force behind some of the most visually impressive films of the last decade like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Avatar, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Avengers and much more. They do a phenomenal job on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, by making this world look beautiful and by creating Smaug, who I would say is one of the most visually stunning CGI characters of all-time. For a huge-ass CGI dragon, he looks pretty damn great.<br/><br/>The film is full of action-packed scenes from beginning to end. Peter Jackson is able to juggle action and drama very well and everything flows perfectly. You can tell Jackson really has heart in these films and it defiantly shows in this installment in the franchise. The movie is paced very well for a two hour and forty minute film.<br/><br/>Now I do have a problem with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The first fifteen minutes or so of this film didn't totally have me. One thing about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and even the first Hobbit film was that from the start you know you are in the world of Middle-Earth, that's not the case in this one. It took me a couple minutes to really get me back into this world. I might be the only person who thinks this, but it was honest problem for me.<br/><br/>One word that can describe this film is ""epic"". 'Desolation of Smaug' really is an epic film that improves on many things that were wrong with its predecessor but does have some little issues. When it comes to good things in The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, it is full-of-them. The acting, action, effects and story of the film are great. Even if this film wasn't a good film, I would still be excited for the next one and I am very excited. When this film ends, it gets you even more excited for the next film, The Hobbit: There and Back Again due out December 17, 2014. I had a great time with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and I hope you check it out because it is truly a great time at the movies!"

","Unlike most of the people here, I really loved the first movie - it was a bit long at times but it had it's moments ( prime examples being Smaug's attack while Bilbo said ''The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the north'') or Thorin's dwarven song ''misty mountains'' that just won't leave your ears. It had the pacing, was visually stunning, had proper music, lighting and had a proper ending - NONE of which are present in the second movie.<br/><br/>The movie has no intro - we are just thrown into a orc chase while the dwarfs are hiding, and it just becomes more incoherent after that. The story is nowhere to be found, it's mostly just a bunch of action scenes one after the other - pretty much it's orc attack, Beorn, orc attack, Gandalf leaves, spider attack, elf attack, orc attack, elf dungeon, orc attack, elves vs orcs, barrel ride, orc attack, Sauron, orc attack, dragon, orc attack, dragon, END.<br/><br/>The music was weird and out of place, at least they could have used some lotr-esque music like in the first part - the whole lighting in most of the movie was weird and wrong, as if unfinished - and several GoPro shots during the barrel chase - what the hell PJ?<br/><br/>The movie started at a weird moment and we are cut off in the middle of an action sequence, and for all the praise I have for Smaug's design and PERFECT evil voice by Benedict Cumberbatch, a dragon does not a movie make. Mixed feelings about this one."

"en-213-762617","10","6","14","17 December 2013"," Brilliant! The Best Move Of The Year!
","Coming a year after the underrated and under-appreciated ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" Peter Jackson strikes again with the year's best movie- ""The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug."" After a brief prologue featuring an excellent flashback conversation between Thorin Oakenshield and the wizard Gandalf, the movie hits the ground running and pretty much never looks back. This is a much more action packed movie than its predecessor, featuring an intense giant spider attack sequence in Mirkwood Forest, a thrilling river barrel chase sequence as the dwarfs attempt to escape from Elvish captors, an intense battle between Gandalf and Sauron, and a non-stop battle with the Dragon Smaug at the end. As is to be expected, all technical credits are first rate, from the often brilliant special effects, to the stirring Howard Shore musical score, to the excellent use of High Frame Rate 3D. In addition, the film delivers some outstanding acting, with particularly good performances from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Luke Evans as a well-developed and sympathetic Bard the Bowman. It is also great to see Orlando Bloom's Legolas back in action, and despite the initial controversy, the addition of Evangilne Lilly as the female elf warrior Tauriel is a welcome addition, even if she does not appear in the book. The crowning achievement of the movie, however, is the Dragon Smaug (the best dragon ever portrayed on the silver screen) and his initial reveal in the ancient kingdom of Erebor is absolutely perfect. This is followed by an Indiana Jones style climax that ends in a real cliffhanger that might irritate some. For me it just means that the final movie, ""The Hobbit: There And Back Again"" will launch with an absolutely incredible action sequence. Like ""The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers"", ""Desolation"" does not really have a beginning or an end, but like that brilliant movie, it is definitely one hell of a middle."

","There were many filmmakers who envied Peter Jackson and there will be many more. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a cinematic experience to be rued forever if missed. The first was an experience as well, but this is better. The quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon is beyond enticing each second. And then finally we do get enough to worship the creature we were seduced with in the first part.<br/><br/>Bilbo Baggins, our cherished hobbit, has ultimately become a significant member of the quest headed by Thorin Oakenshield and ghost-headed by Gandalf the Grey. Together our beloveds embark on a journey sprinkled with increasing Orcs throughout. There is a skin-changer. There are weird spiders. And then there are the Elves ruled by Thranduil. Tauriel is the only girl in the film, and is a beauty indeed. Legolas' arrows are still captivating. The escape cum river cum river bank cum waterfall sequence is worth whistling. Gandalf's epic face-off with the Enemy is surprising. Finally the advent of the dragon Smaug sends chills across the theater.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman just like his character never ceases to amuse us with his performance. Although Ian McKellen once again emerges favorite as Gandalf. Evangeline Lilly (Tauriel) does catch our eyes, being the only lady onboard. Orlando Bloom (Legolas), Ken Scott (Balin) are also poignant. Benedict Cumberbatch (voice of Smaug) will always be special to give the greedy Sherlock fans their two stars in a frame.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's direction will be eulogized till the end of all times. The screenplay writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro have outdone every living screenplay writer. The real immortal is J.R.R. Tolkien whose antique novel is the heart of venture. The 160 minute film has a better pace than its predecessor, courtesy of the brilliant editing involved. A special salute to the entire team for filming the entire trilogy together and taking film production to its novel epitome. The 3D is mesmerizing and has to be watched to be believed.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is worth the wait. The writing, visuals and performances are scintillating to the core. It's a must watch. Ironically, one cannot wait for the final chapter!"
"3xHCCH","8","5","11","14 December 2013"," How to Fight a Dragon
","I'm glad I was able to watch the first Hobbit film before watching this film. This film did not really go into much detail in explaining who the characters were and what they were up to for those who missed the first film. Though you may eventually pick the story up if you were very attentive, those with less concentration may get lost. <br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug picks up from the first film where our hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the 13 Dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) continue on their way to the Lonely Mountain to reclaim the lost Dwarf kingdom of Erebor, as Gandalf (Ian Mc Kellen) went looking for the Necromancer in Dor Guldur. Along the way, they encounter deadly Orcs, Giant Spiders and Elves who throw wrenches into their quest. With the help of Bard, a human from Laketown, they reach their destination and encounter Smaug, the fire-breathing dragon that had taken over the Dwarfs' old realm.<br/><br/>Again like the first film, there are several memorable action sequences that make this a film to enjoy and remember. That scene with the vicious Giant Spiders will chill your spine. Then there was that entertaining and breathtaking sequence where the Dwarfs were escaping on wooden barrels down a river while being attacked by Orcs, then the elegant Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and she-elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) come to their aid with their awesome bow and arrow skills.<br/><br/>Most of all though, this film will be most remembered for Smaug himself. The special visual effect was very convincing that this was a living breathing beast. Its voice, lent by the versatile Mr. Benjamin Cumberbatch, is tauntingly sinister and evil. That entire last hour with Smaug as the Dwarfs were doing all they can within their ingenuity and ability to kill him was worth the price of admission in itself. <br/><br/>The story telling of Peter Jackson dragged or stretched on a lot of occasions during the film, but you will eventually get your bearings straight when the next scene comes on. Editing could have been more judicious. A romance angle was introduced by Jackson where there was none in the book, which though not really necessary, was not distracting at all from the main story. <br/><br/>The cinematography was as usual top-notch all throughout, though the CGI was overwhelming. The production design was hiked up another full level from the first film with such spectacular sets as the Elves lair and dungeons, the Lake town and the lost glory that was Erebor. The sound and the music were all very effective in establishing mood and atmosphere."

"PassPopcorn","8","5","11","13 December 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","It is no secret that the first Hobbit movie – An Unexpected Journey – was somewhat of a let down. The fact that it makes no sense to create a trilogy from a 300 pages book has often been reasonably ridiculed/criticized, and because of this unorthodox (money grabbing) approach to the source material, An Unexpected Journey suffered from serious pacing problems. And when it didn't suffer from pacing problems, it suffered from poorly executed action scenes which looked like something that came straight out of a video game (the sequences in Goblin Town) and from unrelatable and undeveloped characters. After this disappointment, it was hard to tell what to expect from the second installment in the trilogy – The Desolation of Smaug. After watching The Desolation of Smaug, I can safely say that is, if nothing else, better than it predecessor.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug continues where An Unexpected Journey ended. Our party, consisting of thirteen dwarfs + Bilbo (Martin Freeman) & Gandalf (Ian McKellen), are hiding from the orcs and their leader Azog (Manu Bennett). Fortunately, they find a shelter inside a house of a strange being called Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), who is a skin-changer (shape-shifter), and they spend the night there before leaving for the strange mystical forest of Mirkwood, which is nearby. In front of the entrance to the forest, Gandalf leaves the party since he has to tend to more serious business. Without him, the dwarfs + Bilbo enter Mirkwood where more adventures await.<br/><br/>Without any exaggerating, I think The Desolation of Smaug is the most beautiful movie in the whole Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit franchise to date. The scenery and the cinematography are breathtakingly astonishing. It's worth to see this movie on the big screen for the imagery alone. Everything is beautiful: from the mountains of Erebor to the haunting city of Lake-town. The Desolation of Smaug is a magnificent example of amazing eye candy. Moreover, the characters in the movie are handled better than in An Unexpected Journey. We see how Thorin's (Richard Armitage) dedication to his goal is slowly taking the best of him, and even the other dwarfs have more screen time and lines of dialogue (mainly Fili, played by Aidan Turner). Of course, I have to mention the dragon Smaug, who is definitely the movie's best aspect. It was worth to sit through almost two whole movies to see that dragon. Benedict Cumberbatch (who also voiced The Necromancer character) did an awesome job at voicing and supplying the motion-capture for the dragon. In addition to all this things, I thoroughly enjoyed the sequences in the 'trippy' forest of Mirkwood, up until the elves arrived.<br/><br/>Speaking of elves, they are what nearly ruined the movie for me. Prior to the release of this movie, everyone was wondering how will they deal with the character of Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), a character who was completely made up for the sake of this movie. From my perspective, her character was dealt with rather poorly. She serves no actual purpose, other than being a generic romantic interest, and her whole relationship with Kili was rather cheesy – especially the dialogues. Unfortunately, the problems with elves don't stop here – most action scenes including elves look ridiculously goofy and campy. Furthermore, the character of king Thranduil (Lee Pace), Legolas's father, is as charismatic as a bowl of soup. Apart from the elves, the only major problem I had with the movie is its length and pacing. The Desolation of Smaug handles its pacing much better than An Unexpected Journey did, but I can't shake the feeling the movie would have been even better if it were 20 minutes shorter. However, if you can overlook the flaws I mentioned here, you'll probably enjoy The Desolation of Smaug more than almost every other blockbuster movie released this year.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"arhanisch","5","2","3","14 April 2018"," Does not stand on its own
","This movie is pretty boring, and its accolades pretty much ride on the success of LOTR and the first movie. The best scenes were throwbacks to LOTR. Overall feels like long periods of dull atmospheric build up punctuated by scenes of gratuitous orc-killing. Some neat scenes. As a movie does not stand on its own. As an episode, however... As a movie it feels too much like filler. ""The Hobbit"" probably should have been two movies, IMO."
"tapio_hietamaki","7","2","3","2 February 2017"," A follow-up that doesn't live up to what Tolkien deserved
","'An Unexpected Journey' showed promise. I was hyped at the end when we get a shot of Smaug's eye buried in a mountain of gold. There were goofy battle scenes, especially the ones with the goblins under the mountain, and it was much too long, but after that movie I still believed there was some hope for this trilogy.<br/><br/>After 'The Desolation of Smaug' I knew that there was no hope. This trilogy was not going to come even close to the predecessor trilogy, 'The Lord of the Rings'. Of course it was a tall order to begin with.<br/><br/>The pacing is bad, the CGI fight scenes are laughable, the addition of a love triangle doesn't work. Eagerly awaited scenes such as wandering in Mirkwood, or staying the night at Beorn's, or knocking on the secret stone door simply fall flat emotionally. Gandalf blasting white forcefields in Escherian ruins was certainly not what I had in mind for his research of Dol Guldur. The movie has its moments - at least Bilbo's conversation with Smaug was tense and the dragon really had a presence, but overall it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>I still gave it 7/10 because I think that if you disregard the source material and its utter failure to live up to it, it's still an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Compare it to titles such as 'Conan the Barbarian' (2011), 'Eragon' or Jake Gyllenhaal's 'Prince of Persia' and you will notice that it is a worthy addition to the rather narrow selection of high fantasy movies. It has orcs, elves, wizards and a dragon, the story runs along smoothly although it's rather generic, and the production design is appreciable. You just have to ignore the brilliance that could've been."

One - Film, and Two - Entertainment. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, this film scored more highly than Hitchcock's, The Birds.

","This is the only one of the three Hobbit films that I watched, and only because I wanted to see what they did with Smaug. Well, what they did was over-do absolutely everything. Smaug makes a pretty cool appearance, and then slowly morphs into a laughable cartoon character. We last see him flying towards Esgaroth proclaiming ""I am fire, I am death,"" even though we just spent forty-five minutes watching him incompetently failing to kill or even injure even one out of fourteen dwarfs in a ludicrous, blushingly over-the-top, Scooby-Do video game series of scenes. Oh, did I say video game? Well then I shouldn't neglect the tedious, endless, infamous river sequence, where the Dwarfs race down the rapids of a river in barrels, but Orcs somehow manage to keep pace just running along the banks, only to be slaughtered over and over like hapless teddy bears. We even get to see Legolas balance on two Dwarf heads...forwards and backwards! Peter Jackson and crew should do public penance and allows us to dump ashes on their heads for this debacle."

The first three movies only slightly murdered the first three books. The first Hobbit movie was tolerable. This movie was so bad that I will never, ever watch the last one.

","And I'm not only talking about Smaug here, although this being part 2 you can imagine there is a lot more to come (obviously). No I'm talking about Peter Jackson and the Tolkien universe in general. It's obvious that some people will get fatigue after a long series. Especially one that gets stretched even more than necessary. The movie itself is technical on a level that is really great. The acting is solid and the story holds its own.<br/><br/>Still I won't tell anyone how to feel about this. Especially considering the fact that we get a teenage formula integrated into this. The very well known two male fighting over one girl thing that worked for Twilight, Hunger Games and other movies that came out recently. It's obviously to reel in a bigger female audience or at least to keep them interested, while the male audience is there from the get go (Fantasy, action, adventure, who could say no to that, with Special effects to enhance it all).<br/><br/>So while it feels stretched and Jackson does take liberties (giving us new characters like the one played by Lilly or inserting ones that weren't there in the original book), you can still have a lot of fun watching it.

","The jist of this one? A lightweight fantasy trifle with an all-world effects budget and a seriously inflated sense of self-worth. There's a classical adventure formula stuffed snugly at the core of this letterbox behemoth, but it's so thoroughly entrenched in a world of fluff and fat that it can sometimes be difficult to keep in view. A certain degree of self-indulgence for the sake of fan service and depth can be excused. In fact, The Hobbit's light moments of fancy are where it has the most fun, showing off the strange little touches and quirks that make Middle Earth the puzzling, appetizing realm it truly is. At some point it's time to cut to the chase, though, and like a drunken slacker on holiday, this picture often hasn't the willpower to heed that call. For a hundred-thirty minutes it lingers, drowning its audience with padding, and just as the getting's finally getting, er, got... we slam headfirst into a flat black wall dubbed ""to be continued."" It has its strengths: the aforementioned visuals are a true revelation, the cast is wildly varied and dazzlingly colorful, and the dragon at the center of it all is truly awe-inspiring, a sight well worth seeing. The weaknesses, however, are just as numerous: most of the action scenes are carried-away bits of unreal CGI madness, it's overloaded with cameos and redundant, over-acted characters, and the constant pacing issues are downright crippling. As daydreams go, it's magnificent. A complete story it isn't, though, and it's rife with holes and faults. Perhaps the services of a bold editor would be appropriate for the closing chapter of this trilogy."

","Absolutely fail to compare with original LOTR trilogy. In Hobbit 2 there are too much CGI, and, for my surprise, it wasn't the best kind of CGI. Every action scene looks clearly CGIish, fishy. Aimation could be so much better, it feels SUPER cheap. I didn't get ANY fun from action scenes. They all are predictable, repetitive, dull. <br/><br/>The story - same here, characters try to joke, but they fail miserably, there is not real depth in characters. This ""Finding his father"" story weren't in the book, Dwarwes just wanted their gold back - and it would be better in movie to add a little grey color to characters.<br/><br/>I can't find anything spectacular about this movie. Just an average action flick in much-loved Middle Earth universe - that's why i rated it not 5/10, but 7/10."

","The Hobbit is an average movie with incredible scenes, and some memorable. The Dragon Smaug interpreted by Benedict Cumberbatch makes it a masterpiece of acting, the part when the dragon infuriates and says: ""Revenge? I will show you Revenge!!!"" It's, at least, breathtaking. All the dialog between Bilbo and Smaug it's incredible. A masterpiece of story, of visual effects and sound effects. Just the scenes of Smaug worth it the entire movie. The rest it is nothing more that complement. The spider scenes at the beginning of the movie it's nice too. Bilbo reveals a great fighter.

"omega_work","8","2","3","31 December 2013"," Not as good as Rings but still a lot of fun
","The Hobbit was filmed at 48 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps. In the first Hobbit film I actually didn't notice a difference, but I really did in this one. In fact for the first half of the movie it was still bothering me. It felt like watching British television. Strangely it seemed even more-so during scenes that were filmed on a studio and had no music. For some reason the 48 fps seemed to actually make it feel LESS epic.<br/><br/>The actual story was similar in tone to the book with one calamity after another befalling the dwarfs.<br/><br/>It was the stuff they added that wasn't in the book that really slowed down the pace (Gandalf's investigation into the nature of the necromancer and the love story between Killi and Tauriel). That said I thought putting Legolas in was a great idea.<br/><br/>Smaug was a highlight of the film. Every scene with him was really exciting and they seemed to do a good job of deflecting the story holes, for example, the absurdity of Smaug determining to attack the river city to get back at Bilbo and the Dwarfs.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending I'm of two minds about the ending. In the first two Rings movies and the first Hobbit movie we were sort of lulled towards the end which left you wanting more, but wound down giving a sense of contentment. This one made no such attempts and was very abrupt. It was either a brilliant move or a terrible one, and I haven't decided yet which."
"gorbadoc25","6","2","3","27 December 2013"," Whatever happened to the hobbit himself ...
","After the disappointment of 'An Unexpected Journey' last year, I went to 'The Desolation of Smaug' with seriously adjusted (= lower) expectations as compared to those I had for the first installment. Nevertheless, my experience of DOS was quite similar to – although probably slightly better than – that of AUJ: an entertaining, but flawed movie, with one excellent scene, but also too much unnecessary filler.<br/><br/>***THE PACING***<br/><br/>Many people complained about the Hobbiton sequence in AUJ being too long, but I certainly wasn't one of them, as I felt that the pacing of the first movie was done quite well. In DOS, however, the first half feels extremely rushed: Bree *blink* Beorn's house *blink* Mirkwood *blink* the Elves' realm *blink* etc. Not a single scene in the beginning of the movie gets the time to breathe and to build suspense (which is a pity for Mirkwood and its spiders ànd the imprisonment of the Dwarfs by the Elves). The pacing does improve significantly from the barrel escape onwards (a quite enjoyable action sequence), reaching its peak with the one excellent scene from the movie: Bilbo's encounter with Smaug. I assume it's no coincidence that, just like the Riddles in the Dark scene in AUJ, this was the only moment that stood out for me in a positive way, since finally a scene was allowed to develop in a both calm and suspenseful way (probably no coincidence either that the scene that works best is the one that stays closest to the book ).<br/><br/>***CHANGES FROM/ADDITIONS TO THE BOOK***<br/><br/>I have no problem with changes from or additions to source material as long as they work within the adaptation. I liked the way the character of Bard was expanded and I didn't mind Tauriel, who is charmingly interpreted by Evangeline Lilly. However, the ""thing"" between Tauriel, Legolas and Kili feels extremely forced and clearly only serves the purpose of setting up something dramatic in 'There And Back Again'. Also, the cat-and-mouse game between Smaug and the dwarfs suffered severely from too many improbable actions (Thorin on Smaug's snout, really  ?), with everything falling too neatly in place to even have the slightest notion of tension. I understand the need to give Smaug more screen-time (he is after all brilliantly realised by WETA and wonderfully voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch), but was there really no other solution than this tedious action sequence in the vein of Spielberg and Lucas at their weakest? I couldn't believe my eyes when that grotesque golden Dwarf statue appeared <br/><br/>***ENOUGH ALREADY WITH THE SELF-REFERENCING ***<br/><br/>Obscure figures in the corner of the Prancing Pony, Gandalf involved in a fight that mixes his encounters with the Balrog and Saruman, a Morgul shaft instead of a Morgul blade, Tauriel glowing just like Arwen, the use of Kingsfoil all over again  As was the case in AUJ, all of these eye-rolling echoes to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are plain irritating and deprive the 'original' sequences.<br/><br/>***WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BILBO?***<br/><br/>I suggest the film makers to change the title of the third film to 'The Hobbit: (Oh) There (He Is!) And (What Do You Know, Bilbo Does Appear) Back Again (After All)'. While we witness every event in the book through the eyes of Bilbo, which creates a strong connection between the main character and the reader and which is the strength of the book (we care for Bilbo!), Martin Freeman seems to be degraded to play a supporting role: often, Bilbo just disappears from the screen (the forest river, most of the time in Esgaroth). Therefore, we hardly see any development in his character, which makes him look equally brave throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>More than anything else, I think this is the biggest issue with the Hobbit movies: they cut off the emotional core of the story by focusing on everything related to LOTR but Bilbo. While you have many (more) characters and story lines in the Lord of the Rings, it was clear at every moment that Frodo was the real main character and the emotional centre of the story. Instead of investing in Bilbo's character, we now have action scenes that are ""AWESOME!!!"", ""COOL!!!"" and ""EPIC!!!"". I have no problem with the latter as such, but if that's the only thing a movie has to offer (especially a Middle-Earth movie), then you know this is an incredibly missed opportunity.<br/><br/>I'm sure Howard Shore will deliver another musical masterpiece for 'There And Back Again', as he has done for AUJ and now DOS (listen to it on CD to discover its full richness!). As for the third movie itself, I guess it will get stuck in mediocrity as well, just like the first two movies."

","This is a very strange film in many respects. At times, marvellous and at times truly annoying!<br/><br/>I wonder if P.Jackson has listened too much to his critics and tried to emulate LOTR. The hobbit is a different film, targeted at a different audience. Naturally, it will not have the same excitement as LOTR, but then that is partly the risk you have when you stretch a short book across three films.<br/><br/>(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS -START) As a result, Jackson has had to make up several sub-plots and characters. You can decide yourself if you like this. But what infuriates me, is the fact he is literally copying, particularly quote for quotes from LOTR. If I had wanted to watch LOTR again, i could have, so why do this here -<br/><br/>e.g. the elven king saying --""do not give him hope when there is none"" thorin saying ""what say you!"" (this is trademark aragorn line!) the way gandalf gets locked up and witnesses an army brewing<br/><br/>and there's just so many of these copies lifted from LOTR..Arrgh!!<br/><br/>Like other people have said before me --the film is very loosely based on the story and understandably some bits are rushed as they are slow in the book and would be quite tiresome to watch ie the forest and the spiders, but there are parts which i am perplexed for whys he's strayed from the book such as Baird (who should be captain of the guard) and lack of coverage of Beorn the Bear.<br/><br/>there are parts fabricated, such as the effect of the ring. and the strength of Sauron whom is ridiculously stronger in the hobbit then LOTR and the dwarfs mocking the dragon on a never-ending chase. (SPOILER END)<br/><br/>overall, this is much more action packed than the first (as most of the intros are out of the way) but certainly less true to the book.The effects are fantastic again, Bilbo definitely under-used, but it builds up a nice story for a finale end."

"keithbrown-90195","6","1","1","7 September 2016"," Bloated, but Some Bright Spots
","I think with each movie that Peter Jackson has made in the Middle Earth universe they've grown more bloated and meandering. I think The Lord of the Rings suffered from this as well, but not to the detriment of the quality of those movies, and not to the same extent as it happened to The Hobbit. This is because The Hobbit movies are filled with some of the ugliest and more garish CGI I've ever seen. The cast is full of characters who are very hard to feel sympathy for. And the story, full of lightheartedness in the book, is continually thrust into epic-mode when the backbone of the story can't really handle it. <br/><br/>I think The Desolation of Smaug is quite fun when it's focused on being weird. I liked the scenes in Mirkwood, with the hallucinations and the spider. It's full of classic Peter Jackson weirdness and creepiness. I liked a few of the fight scenes and Smaug is great, as well.<br/><br/>However, the Dwarfs completely bog this down into mediocre territory. They're terrible characters for a variety of reasons. I'll give you two: you can't tell any of them apart personality-wise; no wonder they made some of them so ridiculous looking. Secondly: they're all just a bunch of greedy and selfish characters who don't ever listen to anyone. They bring all their hardships on themselves and they don't seem to respect anyone else's opinions or advice. When they were running away from Smaug in the mountain I could hardly keep my eyes open. <br/><br/>I love Martin Freeman as Bilbo, however. The movies shines whenever the spotlight is on him. It's too bad he spends a lot of this as a bystander to less interesting character's plights."

Great songs, excellent dialogue and voice characterization, and memorable.<br/><br/>LOTR from Peter Jackson was awesome, everything I'd hoped for. Elijah Wood kicked butt and everyone was on task. Great effects and scenery, super battle scenes (even if the siege looks directly from Army of Darkness). Characters have plenty to do, and we CARE!<br/><br/>The first Hobbit from Jackson was a travesty. Rude dwarfs invited by a disjointed Gandalf plunder a pleasant Baggins abode, and this take an HOUR. By the end of the first film, I actually wanted half the dwarfs to die. Arrogant, not worthy of anything. The ""roller-coaster"" rides were unending, and the fall through the Goblin kingdom was worse than a video game. Bilbo was cool, as was Gollum, and so I gave it B+.<br/><br/>This Hobbit is better, but not by much. Smaug, as many have pointed out, is an idiot. He may have a fine speaking voice and a vocabulary, but he has ADHD issues, and it's not funny, and not TRYING to be funny! Sad. The dwarfs are even MORE ungrateful, and Thorin's turn for the Arkenstone is tired after knowing the Ring is of the same persuasion.<br/><br/>I also found there to be many problems with logic. For example, if the eagles are willing, why bother with a land quest? Just take Eagle Airlines to Lonely Mountain.<br/><br/>As well, I'm really tired of Orcs who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, and have no talent with weapons. Remind me again why we should be afraid of these pathetic creatures? Oh yeah, there's lots of 'em. Like cockroaches.<br/><br/>Bilbo's innocent act also wears thin. He doesn't grow weary OR that much more courageous, as both Frodo and Samwise do in LOTR. Bilbo acts like it's just a ride at Disneyland.<br/><br/>I'll stop now. I feel bad dumping on it like this."

","Peter Jackson continues to stretch out Tolkein's timeless classic, no doubt building himself a pile of treasure almost as impressive as that of Smaug in the process. In this second part of three, the thirteen dwarfs, accompanied by one brave hobbit, continue their quest to reclaim their homeland of Erebor and retrieve the precious hoard guarded there by an ancient evil dragon. On their way, they are attacked by giant spiders in the forest of Mirkwood, escape from the woodland elves in barrels, travel to Laketown and find their way into the heart of the Lonely Mountain to confront the mighty fire breathing reptile. Plus lots of other stuff that wasn't written by Tolkein.<br/><br/>With the rather slight book (at least when compared to LOTR) being turned into a trilogy, there is a lot here that has been completely made-up by Jackson and company, a fact that will no doubt upset many Tolkein purists. Those viewers who are not that bothered about the additional new material might be rankled by the overuse of CGI, the overblown set pieces that see our death-defying heroes surviving numerous dangers against the odds, and an unnecessary romance. Anyone not bothered by these trifling matters will probably have a whale of a time, happily sitting through all 161 minutes with a big dumb smile on their face; I wish I could be so easily pleased.<br/><br/>To be fair, I did have a marginally better time with this part than I did with An Unexpected Journey: there's not so much puerile humour or singing this time around, there are no silly battling stone-giants, and my favourite bit of the book—the barrel escape—is in this chapter (although Jackson does his best to muck it up by having the dwarfs pursued by orcs along the way). Overall, however, I still consider this another disappointment from the once great director, a ridiculously padded adventure that could have and should have been absolutely awesome, but which ends on a particularly duff note by pointlessly drawing out the confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug by chucking those bloody dwarfs into the mix for an over-the-top CGI-fest of a finalé."

Characters are introduced one after another so fast that it's nigh impossible to keep track of who's who- and the inter-cutting between The Quest and The Rest does absolutely nothing to make matters clearer. In fact, this constant cutting back and forth effectively undermines any attempt(s) at building suspense; there is NONE whatsoever. And Bilbo's big confrontation with Smaug is milked for far, far more than its worth: by the time the movie abruptly ends, it's almost impossible to give a s--- one way or the other.

Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said, it's big, it's loud and it's full of elves, dwarfs and Stephen Fry. <br/><br/>For Middle Earth nerds it's highly likely there might be bits of this movie that actually hurt, like the bit where Legolas is retrofitted to the storyline as one of the morally questionable wood elves or the love interest that develops between a dwarf and a ninja wood elf. Such purists would point out the significance of the relationship between Gimli (passing reference is made to the small bearded one in this film) and Legolas in LOTR is that it is the first positive engagement between elf and dwarf in hundreds of years that's why it's so important. But this isn't a film for Middle Earth nerds, they'll generally still be lost in the convolutions of the Silmarillion, this is an epic for the masses who like dwarfs and swords and dragons and seeing orcs skewered three to an arrow in a rocking-rolling barrel chase (this bit is undoubtedly the best bit of the film).<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is pitch perfect as Bilbo, with that I've-just-lost-something face and halting way of speaking that endears all but the most hard-hearted of Hobbit haters. Ian McKellen's Gandalf now looks so wizened his eyes are almost closed for the entire film, his grey coat and crooked pointy hat the high fashion mark of dilapidated wizardy. Gandalf doesn't feature greatly in this movie, trundling off to face the mysterious Necromancer, who turns out to be the reincarnating Sauron, arriving ninety years too soon for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the rumble-throated Smaug with suitable Shakespearian grandiosity and the dwarfs are variously cute, hairy and mischievous, although James Nesbitt's role in this one seems much reduced which is a shame.<br/><br/>Having taken the 300 hundred odd pages of The Hobbit and spread them over what will be 9 hours of film I do wonder what is going to happen in movie 3 as this instalment finishes about 3 pages from the end of the book. The one could have done with being a good 40 minutes shorter because by the time we meet the magnificent dragon we're really beginning to flag.<br/><br/>Enjoyable enough, but it did feel a little marmitey, you know the kind of thing, too little flavour spread over a large area.

","After being pleasantly surprised by the first movie I was probably anticipating this movie a little more and in a way was somewhat let down. Where in the first movie Biblo seemed to dominate the action, in this film it seemed as if he had slipped a little further to the back and a number of other characters began to move to the front (such as Legolas, Tauriel, and Bard). Okay, Bilbo still plays an important role, but in a way it felt as if this film simply exists to tie the other two films together, and I am still struggling to understand how Peter Jackson is going to turn the third film into a full length feature. Mind you, if this film is anything to go by, I suspect I already know the answer to this one.<br/><br/>The reason I say this is because there are a couple of scenes in the movie that had somewhat been dragged out a little too much, and also that seemed to be a little obsolete. For instance, there is the scene where they are hurtling down the river in barrels and we have two of the elves running along the banks killing bucket loads of orcs. Mind you, in the book we do not actually have the Dwarfs being relentlessly pursued by the orcs (and also Legolas does not actually appear until the first book of Lord of the Rings). The other scene involved the fight with Smaug in the Lonely Mountain, particularly when they set up an elaborate trap to immerse him with gold. It seemed that this was going a little overboard, especially those of us who know that Smaug does not actually die in the Lonely Mountain. This, however, is left for the final movie.<br/><br/>This wasn't a bad movie, and Jackson has added a lot more to the story than was originally there. For instance the who situation in Laketown where the town is being run by a tyrant and has numerous spies out watching the population has been added to the film (as have the whole thing about the orcs). However he has also borrowed some of the story from Tolkien's other writings, such as the rise of the necromancer in Dul Gulder, as well as Radagast the Brown (who is mentioned in the stories but we do not actually encounter him). The thing about the Wind Lance is also an addition.<br/><br/>One of the themes that seems to run through this movie this is the idea of how greed is destructive. We see this in Thorin Oakenshield and we see this in the dragon as well. We all know what is going to happen to the dragon, and those of us who have read the book also know what is going to happen to Thorin. However, I will not spoil the ending here (though I may have already done so, but then this is why I marked this review as containing spoilers). What we don't know is how Peter Jackson is going to end it, though I suspect, based on the title of the third movie, that Biblo manages to get home."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","13 January 2014"," Questionable content, but the production values save a lot
","I honestly and truly love The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Peter Jackson was a miracle director that suddenly appeared to our collective consciousness and somehow managed to film three films that were pretty much all we had ever wanted from LotR films. All the characters felt just right, the visuals were absolutely gorgeous and Jackson had this gift for selecting just the right scenes and filming them in just the right way so that the films, long as though they were, never felt like they were either too long-winded or too hasty in order to cover more ground quickly. Of course not every decision Jackson made was the right call and there were some things that could have been done better, but as a whole they earned all the hype they received.<br/><br/>Alas, it would seem that Jackson cannot repeat this feat a second time. The first Hobbit film wasn't yet so bad. True, the tone was at the same too goofy to function as a proper prequel to the LotR films, yet it was too dark for it really feel like they were adapting a children's book to the silver screen. Jackson tried for the middle road and in the process didn't fully please either of the camps. This same problem continues in the second Hobbit film, in which all of Jackson's worst tendencies from the previous films come back with vengeance. The adoration of elves above all else (I'm looking at you Legolas), his disdain for dwarfs (they're more than comic reliefs, you know) and overly choreographed fight scenes (there's really no tension in it when your first reaction is to laugh at just how absurd some of the fight moves are). And this time Jackson even covers some new ground by starting to skip over certain scenes that all fans had been waiting for in order for him to add in new non-canon content that wasn't wanted or needed. Admittedly some of it works, like the upgrade to the legend of Black Arrow, but some of it falls flat instantly, like the weird romance between an elf and a dwarf. I would have much preferred to spend more time with Beorn instead of spending a single minute with that study in awkwardness.<br/><br/>All that being said, I still can't deny that I didn't enjoy the heck out of this film. Most of the cast is still rock solid (McKellen, Freeman, Armitage are especially delightful to watch), the visuals are at worst just merely beautiful and at best they're mind-blowingly gorgeous. I was somewhat dreading the introduction of Smaug in this film, but he turned out okay. Not sure I understand why they with a wyvern-style design for him when the original Smaug in Tolkien's drawings clearly isn't one, but that's me nitpicking.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the action scenes, while more than a bit silly and non-threatening, do look nice and are pleasant to follow. And as stated, some of the new additions are genuinely interesting and patch up some of the inconsistencies and flights of fantasy of the original book. It's a shame that we have to take all these good inventions with the bad ones.<br/><br/>Is it worth watching? If you've liked the films so far, then sure, you'll get your fix of Middle-Earth from this. If you were dissatisfied with the first Hobbit film, this isn't going to change your mind."

","This is a very pretty film, and the 3D is pretty good - especially the bees. If you want to spend nearly three hours looking at great scenery and impressively realised sets, not to mention the scariest spiders ever, then this is the film for you. If you like dragons too all the more so.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you are looking for a story then you may be left wanting. Okay it is the middle one of three, but for quite startlingly long periods of the film nothing happens, or if it does happen, happens very slowly. Indeed. Or to put it another way, at one point - after the main characters had arrived in a village - I fell asleep. I woke up 10- 15 mins later and found I had missed (in terms of advancement of plot) absolutely nothing. At all.<br/><br/>Quick summary. Film opens in a pub on the edge of The Shire. We discover one member of Bilbo's merry band has upset lots of people who all want him dead. Galdalf arrives. Threat averted.<br/><br/>Bilbo et al now start treking towards the mountain. Arrive a seriously dodgy wood (Mirkwood, but maybe McGuffin Wood would have been more appropriate). Obviously they have to go through it (one is strongly reminded of that classic book ""We're Going on a Bear Hunt""... and then slightly horrified to think what Peter Jackson would come up with if he had the rights to that!). At this moment Gandalf leaves for no terribly good reason other than it needlessly puts the band of travelers in peril.<br/><br/>They enter said wood. This is actually quite a good bit. Admittedly the future (I nearly said ""imminent"", but that word has no place in a review of Hobbit 2) arrival of the spiders is telegraphed waaaaayyyyy ahead, and you kind of wonder what bunch of thickos would wander into a dark wood full of spider silk (and I mean full) without anyone actually saying ""this white stuff... doesn't worry anyone a bit does it?""<br/><br/>Anyway - big scary spiders appear. Mayhem. But no-one dies as a chap from Lord of the Rings shows up (with friend) and spiders leave.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Gandalf has gone off to meet the Seventh Doctor. This is confusing as quite why Doctor Who is in Middle Earth, or where he has put his Tardis, is never explained and - although The Doctor accompanies Gandalf for a period - as soon as it gets remotely interesting Gandalf sends him away. As with much of the film this section is pretty but utterly pointless, plot-wise, but does fill a good 20 minutes or more of screen time. Gandalf now deals with a hornets' nest of nasty creatures by shaking said hornets nest and then bumping off large numbers of them, thus ensuring he is too late to meet up with Bilbo's Band as arranged.<br/><br/>After some fun with Lord of the Rings guy's friends (who have taken against them) said Band have arrived in a town where Stephen Fry is king. As usual, Stephen Fry plays the part of Stephen Fry flawlessly. Nothing of any real significance happens for a long time.<br/><br/>They arrive at the mountain, and Bilbo is sent off to find a stone alone by his brave band. Finds the stone, plus a Smaug the Dragon, who has clearly been watching Goldfinger as - in a homage to every Bond villain throughout time - his proceeds to talk A LOT to Bilbo about... almost anything... thus allowing Bilbo to escape, rather than simply killing him immediately. Unless his first aim really was to talk Bilbo to death - because he does come pretty close. Again you wonder about how stupid a character can be as Bilbo's target is a stone shining out like a searchlight - but Smaug never seems to cotton on to this. <br/><br/>After that... long, long battle between Smaug and Bilbo's band during which... no-one dies, not least because whenever anyone is at the Smaug's mercy he decides to talk to them instead of doing the proper dragonly thing.<br/><br/>Eventually everyone gets bored (or something) and Dragon flies off to attack Stephen Fry's village. Roll credits.<br/><br/>Summary - a 160 minute film whose story could have been told in 60 minutes. Or less."
"Prichards12345","7","1","1","30 December 2013"," Not bad but not really an adaption of the book and too much filler
","I'm really torn in two here with this movie. The fundamental mistake with The Hobbit trilogy is that it would have made an excellent single 3 hour movie; and therefore padding it out to three films has nothing to do with art and everything to do with money.<br/><br/>The 2nd film in the series, The Desolation of Smaug, has exactly the same faults as the first film. It's very good in spots, and then very stilted and overlong in other areas. A romance between a Dwarf and an Elf, which takes place here, merely serves to convince that Peter Jackson, having made vast amounts of cash from The Lord Of The Rings, cares little about the reaction of fans of Tolkien's work.<br/><br/>I was able to enjoy it because I put the book completely out of my mind, some cannot and I sympathise completely with their view - give it a 1 or a 3 or whatever if you wish - I won't argue. But THERE IS enough good stuff here to keep you interested. Biggest problem is each good idea is dragged out beyond all reason and flogged to death.<br/><br/>Tauriel is not a bad character in herself, but Tolkien purists are going to go all JAR JAR on her. Jackson's idea to get her romantically linked to one of the dwarfs is just jaw droppingly bad. If that's all you can come up with Peter it might have been better to just leave it out.<br/><br/>I liked Beorn and Mirkwood, which perhaps are dealt with too briefly, while Jackson frequently goes off on his flights of fancy which are nothing to do with the book. I also admired the Barrel Sequence, until it ran on too long, and ditto Smaug.<br/><br/>Ah, yes Smaug. Brilliantly realised, but the Erebor climax to the movie is way way too long. Might have been better to cut part of it (including the truly silly lighting of the furnaces) for an extended edition.<br/><br/>The movie is certainly better than a lot of other Hollywood product out there but the reasoning behind it is way too cynical. Still, better this than Avatar...."

","Saw this at the cinema today and as with the 1st hobbit film i was eager for it to end, Far too much bad CGI the action scenes move so quickly and cut from one to another so fast i was annoyed by them not amazed. at least with the LOTR films the action scenes were done mainly using people in costumes with only CGI for the epic stuff, in this film its everywhere and so in your face you quickly tired of it, Im a big fan of the 1st films but The Hobbit films are a big disappointment. You have to go see it just to add the middle piece to the story but if your a serious fan of middle earth then don't expect the characters or the story to be a patch on LOTR ..."
"iceice93","6","7","18","14 December 2013"," The Hobbit: The Desolation of Staying Awake
","This will be lengthly.<br/><br/>Okay, let me start with saying I like the LOTR trilogy just fine, thought they were great. On that note, I saw the first Hobbit and fell asleep in a theatre for the first time in my life. That movie was terribly boring and utterly pointless. So much happened in hopes of aiding the plot but it didn't move an inch. It took over 3 hours for them to tell the audience where they needed to go. And they (finally) arrive in Hobbit 2.<br/><br/>This movie has over the top CGI action everywhere and I honestly think they just did that so you don't pay attention to the terrible plot and pointless screen fillers Peter Jackson throws at you. Desolation of Smaug introduces so many characters that have no substance and have no reason to be on screen, like ""Legolas #2"" near the last 30 minutes, or the forced relationship between a dwarf and Legolas's interest. It served no purpose. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson has a huge hard on for visuals and this movie delivers in that regard. It's a gorgeous movie with an amazing art design behind it. But if you choose to put more focus on that detail rather than the pacing/dialogue, the movie will suffer; and it did. I appreciate the art direction but when I'm asleep I can't--and yes, I was nodding off during this movie too. Luckily for The Hobbit 2, the action scenes woke me back up for a short while.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman once again is the perfect Bilbo but has hardly any dialogue or focus as a character. The hobbit of ""The Hobbit"" is overshadowed by 4 of the 13 dwarfs. ""Aragorn"" Oakenshield also hates Bilbo again even though they all respected him after the first movie. Basically, Bilbo and Gandalf are the only characters I cared about. Everyone else on screen was basically there to speak in a serious, English accent and fill a role. <br/><br/>Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, is what saved me from hating this movie. His introduction, the CGI, the voice...man. He is one intimidating and awesome s.o.b. You truly are in awe when he shows his full size and moves and breathes fire. My god when he breathes fire...it's the most amazing thing to see. Smaug is one of the better dragon adaptations in any movie that I've seen in recent years. BUT THEN HERE COME THE Dwarfs. Let's just title this movie: ""The Hobbit: Convenience."" How does the dragon that destroyed an entire city of dwarfs fail at killing/injuring 13 of them hiding behind the most conveniently placed walls in his lair? How can 13 small little warriors outrun and dodge a ball of fire that stretches from wall to wall in that huge f***ing lair?? I was seriously angry laughing in the theater at how stupid and worthless they made Smaug after amazingly introducing him. <br/><br/>And then, just like the first movie, we have a villain getting away. Smaug gets away yes, but right now I'm talking about Ogre #2. Not the one with the claw arm from the first one who serves NO PURPOSE (who is there again), but Ogre #2 who also IS WORTHLESS to the movie and DOESN'T DIE. You introduce two meaningless side villains and you don't even off them, yet the other ogres get their heads cut off willy nilly and for comedic value? I just don't understand.<br/><br/>How in the world is this going to wrap up in one more movie? There are so many loose ends to tie up it's not even funny. <br/><br/>I'm just going to go ahead and guess Peter Jackson wanted everyone to remember he made LOTR and decided to make these. Not because he cares, but because he new that there would be a sum of money equal to that of Smaug's treasure room if he did. <br/><br/>Even though this review appears very negative, I'll still give this film a 6/10, only for the action, which was admittedly entertaining and humorous, and the scenes with Gandalf, Bilbo (alone), and Smaug, which were the backbone to this watchable but mediocre tale."
"shepherd3","10","6","15","16 December 2013"," Jackson Back On Form. An Easy 10.
","Although I enjoyed Jackson initial return to Middle Earth The Hobbit:the desolation of Smaug is undoubtedly a vast improvement on its predecessor, as was the case with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now the Hobbit has found its feet with in middle earth every element of the film has grown stronger, it is compelling from beginning to end with some of the greatest fight sequences Middle Earth has ever seen of which are both funny and technically superb. Thankfully there is no milling around in hobbit hole's for unnecessary amounts of time in this film.<br/><br/>Although the Tolkien lovers will most likely disapprove of Legolas and Tauriel making an unscheduled appearance I personally found both characters a very gratifying addition to the narrative as undoubtedly many of the best action sequences fell to the elf duo. Legolas's presence provides a sense of nostalgic glee as witnessing the elf glide across a battlefield brings back memories of Helms Deep and the fields of Pelennor; although it must be said the action sequences in the Hobbit certainly stand on their own two feet and do not leave any viewer wanting. If anything technically Jackson has improved swapping sheer numbers for intricate choreography.<br/><br/>Although evident in his first outing as Bilbo Baggins casting Martin Freeman as the unwilling adventurer was truly a master stroke. In his second epic excursion into Middle Earth he has has grown yet further into the role. He plays the part superbly capturing the vulnerable but brave hobbit who if you do not already, will love by the end. His encounter with Smaug is enthralling as Freeman captures the moment perfectly, he is a pleasure to watch and if anything the encounter doest go on for long enough. Jackson certainly found the perfect Bilbo.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's Middle Earth is as beautiful and captivating as ever with the cinematography on this picture possibly outdoing even that of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. You find yourself unable to take your eyes off the screen for even a second as every change of setting provides something new and stunning to look at, certainly the crispness of the visuals benefit from the film being shot at 48 frames per second.<br/><br/>This film provides great entertainment with massive spiders and literally barrel's of laughs, a must watch. It gets a 10 from me for sheer entertainment, a brilliant return to Middle Earth."
"jfsinil","6","6","15","14 December 2013"," Not LOTR.....
","While this is a fairly enjoyable film, and well-worth seeing, the second Hobbit film is marred by over-reliance on CGI that either looks fake (molten gold anyone?) or, applied to the characters, unrealistic. It is jarring to be distracted from the narrative when during a fight scene one is presented with the impossible contortions of the Nimble Ninja Elves as they take out what should be over-whelming gangs of powerful enemies. There was some of this back in the battle scenes in the LOTR films - but there now is an over-reliance on CGI to the point of distraction in this film (seen in 2D).<br/><br/>Back to that CGI gold - Thorin in one scene travels quite a distance precariously balanced on a metal shield that neither heats up or melts as it floats on a trough of molten gold. Really? All that raging fire and molten metal in the climatic scenes and not one dwarf or Bilbo looks even flushed from the heat? And - what would make Thorin think molten gold would harm a dragon that generates fire from within? C'mon! That said - Smaug himself was a successful CGI creation, and looked (and sounded) very real. Which reminds me of the LUDICROUS shot of Thorin balancing on the dragon's snout....just because you can do ANYTHING with CGI doesn't mean you should! Such an unbelievable predicament just jerks the viewer OUT of the story/film! (Like the ludicrous stampede in King Kong where none of the principals gets stepped on - does no one tell Jackson ""No, boss, bad idea"" anymore?)<br/><br/>What I did like about this film, apart from Smaug, were the introduction and use of Tauriel, and showing Bilbo's growing ""attachment"" to the Ring. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is one of the best parts of this film. However - so far neither of the Hobbit films is of the stellar caliber Jackson achieved with the LOTR trilogy. Sigh. I fear the third film will simply be more CGI battles at the expense of real storytelling."
"ratemymovietoday","10","6","15","14 December 2013"," Hobbit comes of age !
","Well, to start with, let me answer the most fundamental question which everybody's been asking. Is this movie better than the first Hobbit? The answer is Err  you will find below :) It's very difficult to make sequels which are better or at least on par with the original movie and you can imagine the herculean task it takes to make not just one but multiple sequels (and prequels too) which arguable are as good if not better. Only a couple of directors can do that and without a doubt Peter Jackson is one of them. LOTR series was an outstanding success and one of the major reasons for that is every time a sequel is released it didn't only exceed the expectations of the viewers and critics alike but it also remained true to the original story. May be it's due to the fact that Peter directs all the movies at once and then splits it into three during the post productions. Okay..hmm. So now, what about the Hobbit movies? Hobbit movies brings with them an aura of their own, different from the LOTR but as much immersive. Everyone would like to see middle earth more but without getting bored. An important thing to note is that although, Hobbit and LOTR may be connected in more than one way, they are as different as it can be. Peter again takes us through the amazing places (real or CGI?) but each one of them different from what that has already been shown. Take an example, Lake Town which feels like Rohan from the LOTR with its decaying ruler and all that but that's where the similarity stops. As the case with earlier movies, you will feel that you have actually transcended into a different world with its own chaos.<br/><br/>The movie starts immediately after the events of the last Hobbit movie. Thorin and the gang continues with their quest of the Misty Mountains with Gandalf and Master Bilbo and in the process makes few friends and foes (more foes actually). Last time, Bilbo found his courage (a la The Ring) and this time he makes sure to use it to the fullest, there were quite a few instances where Bilbo's obsession with the Ring is shown but then, he also utilizes it to bail himself and the Thorin company out at the same time. After going through elves, human settlements they finally reach Dragon's Dungeon, and oh boy! Smaug is truly stupendous. You need to see it to believe it. Many people criticize HFR but in fact, the true beauty of the work that is gone in making the movie can only be appreciated when you watch this movie at 48FPS. Every frame looks so crisp and clear as if you are standing right in front of them. The river stream chase is so masterfully done that it would surely put many a car chases to shame. There is may be one another reason why Peter went HFR and that is, he is so confident with the CGI work that is done on the films, that he can show you the movie in the clearest way possible. I am not exaggerating but the CGI work is best, in fact better than the last movie. It's very sharp and incredibly life like. The dialogs could have been better and the scenes look like a bit stretched sometimes, but then when you have a visual spectacular going on, it can compensate that a bit. The film follows the basic modus operandi as with the previous movies. There are parallel stories which pan out and finally start merging in to a big climax and that's exactly what is going to happen in the next. The buildup is pretty awesome this time and I would say better than the Two Towers and the next movie is surely going to be an epic finale."

","I grew up watching the Lords Of The Ring trilogy and I watched an Unexpected Journey as soon as it was released and then read the book of the Hobbit and loved everything.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug was amazing, the main problem for me with this film was the CGI I watched it in 3D HFR at 48fps instead of standard 24fps and this seemed to heavily effect the CGI, with a lot of it seeming to be quite video game like apart from Smaug himself who was 100% perfectly created and looked real.<br/><br/>I also didn't like how Kili, Fili, Bofur and Oin stay in Laketown as I felt this broke up the party and we kept checking between two locations.<br/><br/>I felt that with parts of the book that seemed to be long and enjoyable there was hardly any time spent on these scenes during the film bits sticking out being Beorns House, and Mirkwood. I felt far to long was spent in Laketown. I also thought that the scenes with Gandalf alone seemed to be quite boring compared to those with the company.<br/><br/>Probably my favourite sequence from the whole film would be the barrel sequence along the river with non stop action full on bad ass moments and a little bit of humour as well.<br/><br/>another thoroughly enjoyable part is Bilbos first encounter with Smaug which is both breath taking and tense.<br/><br/>Just waiting for the 13th December 2014 now...."
"battlecow-1","8","6","15","13 December 2013"," Disappointed but greatly amused
","*** Minor Spoilers*** The good: If you're looking for a visually stunning, edge-of-your-seat film with an awesome dragon and a hint of romance (or miss the Super Kill Action of Legolas from LotR), you absolutely must see this film! The bad: If you love Tolkien's work or are a die hard fan of authenticity... drop the word ""Hobbit"" from the title and you can still immensely enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Bias: Huge Tolkien fan... read The Hobbit at least 14 times, LotR 8 times, blah blah. That said, I don't watch a movie expecting it to be word for word, scene for scene with the book it is based on.<br/><br/>The bad: After watching a loosely interpreted LotR in the theater with Hollywood embellishment I felt prepared for ""An Unexpected Journey"". While it journeyed off the road many times, it still managed to find a side path to the same destination and held on to the playful and light climate from the book.<br/><br/>Part II, however, was so loosely based on the book that ""Bored of the Rings"" seemed a better retelling of Tokien's trilogy. They took the standard big screen cheese and heaped on all the cheese from the LotR films on top, then tossed in the beans.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand... I think it is inventive and enriches the story when they break away for a flash-back of Gandalf's adventures that connect it more strongly with LotR. But to add in ridiculous characters, drama and love scenes that are not only absent from the books but in fact distract from the movie and ruin the essence of the book is completely demoralizing to Tolkien fans.<br/><br/>On top of the unnecessary and confusing scenes to add an extra hour to film, taking away from the focal characters and scenes from the book make the movie simply an exercise in futility (except making a wonderfully scenic and exciting super-CGI film!). For example, making Beorn into a Neanderthal was upsetting and completely altered the fun scene in how they met with the intelligent animals and booming laughs, and only to drag on the ridiculous ""orcs can now comfortably travel in daylight"" hunt of Thorin that never existed. <br/><br/>Next film: Dwarf-Elf marriage legalized, Smaug is a protected endangered species, Sauron the Boy Scout Troop Leader, Galadriel drops to 1/4 speed."
"maya-maya","8","6","15","13 December 2013"," No longer a children's movie...
","If you found 'An Unexpected Journey' too childish, you can breathe more easily. 'Desolation' is more serious than its predecessor; gone are the silly songs and even then slapstick jokes have been reduced. Especially the Dol Guldur storyline and Lee Pace's portrayal of Thranduil add to the noticeably darker tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lily does a good job depicting the non-canonical Elf Tauriel, and while the resulting romantic tension might not have been necessary, it's good to see some variation among the Elves apart from the strict Sindar. Stephen Fry cuts a delightfully corrupt Mayor of Laketown and I hope we'll see even more of him in the next movie.<br/><br/>Book-purists might be somewhat miffed that a few plot details were changed, and some scenes were cut short while others, especially towards the end, were padded to ridiculous lengths, but that was to be expected considering the sheer size of the project. Needless to say it will be interesting to see how things play out in the trilogy's conclusion. However, once again it's great to see Dol Guldur, and the inclusion of this story feels natural and integrates well into the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is more grown up than 'Journey', with good acting throughout."

Of course we don't expect much from them because its a small book. Smaug episode was promising but it takes too much of time for the final act. <br/><br/>Gandalf didn't have much screen presence this time. Its the Elves leaded by Legolas that bring smartness to the film and Tauriel is a scene stealer. In the end the Dwarfs, Gandalf, Elves, Orcs, Smaug were thrown to different places so they have to get together for ""There and Back Again"". 'Arkenstone' and 'Black arrow' will have much to play in the grand finale. <br/><br/>Its always a treat to watch middle-earth films but Mr.Jackson please do not stretch ""The Hobbits"", they aren't ""The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>Overall, DoS is a better film than AUJ.

","It physically pains me to give a Tolkien film less than 9, but this movie was closer to a 6.5.<br/><br/>Gripes 1) The most overpowering is also not new: the story told in this film doesn't match the one in the book.<br/><br/>To get that mini-epic feel from an ambling adventure story the pacing is relentless. It's like being on a 5 day tour of 12 countries around Europe. Where Thorin and Co. spend weeks recuperating in the book, they spend a single night in the film. There is no sense of wonder, only urgent CGI action. <br/><br/>2) These prequels are destroying the continuity of wonderful Middle Earth created in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Honoring the history and depth of ME, in LOTR all the races clearly have different origins, folklore, language and civilization. <br/><br/>Due to what I can only imagine as temporary insanity, this film consistently humanized the enemy, sometimes in direct conflict with the book. Though the Goblin King in the first movie was probably the worst offender, there are several scenes in this film where untranslated orc grunting, mob mentality or simple snarling would be better than English voices coming out of monster mouths. (And no, I'm not referring to the dragon who was played perfectly)<br/><br/>3) Extra characters that hurt more than they helped. <br/><br/>The Hobbit is supposed to be about the hobbit. And Bilbo absolutely crushes it in the book. Time after time he gets the dwarfs out of scrapes with no loop holes and stacked odds. And he does it by being clever and quick and all kinds of lovable underdog ways. He becomes the quiet hero. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--I'm happy we got the elves. Tauriel is utterly a dazzling addition to the story that fits seamlessly into Middle Earth. Watching Legolas in action is pure satisfaction. You don't realize how much you missed him until you see the iconic jump-shots with his old Mirkwood bow. But so much of the flash and glory was given to the elves at the expense of Bilbo. The connection to our unlikely hero was traded for blatant fan-pandering where pretty people kill a lot of orcs really, really well.<br/><br/>I want to love this movie that way I love the annually watched extended LOTR films. But instead of exploring a deep, magical world with characters you grow to love, all I get is a string of cut scenes from the PS4 video game. Too much action, too little wonder, and less depth."

"mcampbelljh1","10","5","12","9 April 2014"," Part 2 is Necessary for Developing the Richness of Middle Earth
","Another triumph for Peter Jackson and his fantasy creative team! The visuals and special effects were superb, and the best dragon rendition yet. Benedict Cumber batch did a great job with this performance modeling and voice of the dragon. In addition, who could not like the beautiful New Zealand scenery reworked to make it Middle Earth. <br/><br/>I read Tolkien when I was young, so the story is not new to me. I think Jackson's enhancements for this 2nd version of the trilogy were interesting and necessary for building the characters inner dimensions and to develop the richness of middle earth. <br/><br/>In the 1st part of the trilogy, I loved Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin. He really captured the strength of the character and his desire to save his people, and regain their homeland. I felt the 1st sequel of this trilogy, dragged me in because of Richard's acting. He really had me believing in the quest. His relationship to Bilbo, and Gandalf gave the storyline its interest. To me the 1st part of the trilogy was all about Thorin's strength of character, and leadership as a displaced King of the Dwarf's on a quest as Tolkien wrote it. In this 2nd part of the trilogy, we begin to see the other sides of Thorin's character developed further (his pride, his inability to forgive and make concessions to the elves even though he needs their help, his despair when the keyhole could not be found) along with his strength and leadership in fighting the dragon and other creatures found along the quest. This gives Thorin's character a more well-rounded humanness with his flaws, as well as his strengths displayed. Again, I have to say so well acted by Richard Armitage, who has such a great dramatic range that he can portray any of the character he takes on well. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman's character was also developed further his intelligence, courage and bravery as he saved the dwarfs and their quest over and over again; proving his true value to Thorin, and the quest which totally would have failed without him. Part 2 was more about Bilbo's growth, his improved relationship to Thorin, and his value to the quest.<br/><br/>Although Richard did a great job with Thorin's character development in this part of the trilogy and Martin with Bilbo's character, and they were was still prime to this storyline. Part 2 of the trilogy was not so much about Thorin, Bilbo and Gandalf but rather it allowed Peter Jackson to introduce more of the characters and to further develop all of middle earth's richness. The enhancement of the elves storyline was such a nice addition. I loved the addition of Tauriel character so well played by Evangeline Lilly. The story did need a female heroine as it was too male dominated for us liberated women and the female children who will flock to the movie (perhaps not in Tolkien's day, but a definite necessity for the year 2014, Thank-You Peter!!!) And what woman wouldn't swoon over Orlando Bloom's Legolas and Aidan Turner's Kili, every girl loves a bit of a love story. I know the Tolkien purists will find this difficult, but to me it was such a nice addition. I also like Laketown and its characters. I think Luke Evan's character was also being set-up to take a more dominant role in Part 3. Luke did a great job playing Bard. Perhaps I'm wrong but I can see how Bard/Girion will be the one to really finally destroy the Dragon in the next part of the trilogy. <br/><br/>So yes, this Part of the Trilogy is needed to complete the development and richness of Middle Earth, and give substance to the quest. I think Tolkien if he lived today would totally approve!<br/><br/>If there was any flaw in this part of the trilogy, it was in its title (which like many others I totally misinterpreted the word ""Desolation"" to mean ""Destruction"" vs ""to lay to waste or deprive"" the Dragon of his treasure) My fault entirely LOL!!! But because of that lack of understanding, I was expecting the Dragon to DIE when the dwarfs covered him with gold. So until I reflected on why he was still flying away at the end, I was a bit disappointed in the ending of Part 2. It didn't seem to have the movie conclusion I expected. I suppose again this was by design so I will want to come back for part 3!! Kudos to you Peter Jackson, you do have me hooked and I will definitely be there for the conclusion. Although, I know I will miss Richard's Thorin when Part 3 concludes, for it was he that got me here to begin with and allowed me to experience the richness of Middle Earth and all its wonderful characters. Well done to all involved, and great fun for children and adults of all ages."
"ilovemrjandhislaugh","10","5","12","1 January 2014"," MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! It exceeded my expectations!!
","It is still a bit far from the LOTR movies but not too much . The Smaug CGI is the best I've ever seen (so far) but yet other CGI at the beginning was a bit bad for WETA to have made it. It may not be 100 percent close to the book but I think Peter Jackson managed to adapt it well to the screen. I liked Tauriel even though she is'nt in the books. Legolas' appearance was a little bit forced I think the movie could have gone well without him. Martin Freeman was practically born to play Bilbo, Ian Holm was alright but Martin Freeman IS Bilbo! Benedict Cumberbatch's voice is great for Smaug,everything about Smaug was great,It's just how you would imagine Smaug to be.I gotta say I was expecting much less,and it exceeded greatly my expectations."
"aj-confused","9","5","12","16 December 2013"," Truly Magnificent!!!
","While watching the movie in theater, I was absolutely stunned by the special effects, characters and the behemoth creature ""Smaug The Dragon"", seriously the most dangerous and enormous dragon I have ever seen in my entire life. Talking about the film, Peter Jackson has made a wonderful movie and totally justified Tolkien's book. I liked the first installment of this series, but it was lack in action and creatures (still was a beautiful movie). While in theater, my eyes were wide open by seeing the imagination of Peter Jackson and how beautifully he created every character, creature and mountain. I have read the book and i can recall every moment from it and watching this movie was like the book has come alive. This movie will make you laugh at some point and will also force you to hold your breath. Though, Peter Jackson did some changes and additions in the story, but still, you will love to watch those scenes which you didn't read in the book.<br/><br/>I would give 9 stars for this splendid movie. It should definitely go to the Oscar, at least for the amazing special effects."
"jakx118","9","5","12","13 December 2013"," I loved this movie.
","Seriously. I just got back from seeing it and, well, it's like my childhood come to life on screen. I think I have finally found what is different about these movies from LOTR. Compared to LOTR (which still happen to be my hands down favorite movies ever), these movies are just pure fun. Pure, unadulterated fun. These movies are what the Transformers movies should be. Great, action-adventure movies with great music, acting and cinematography based on fun, but not artistically masterful source material. Let's be honest guys, compared to LOTR, the hobbit ain't exactly a masterpiece. It's pretty great, but there is a lot that could be added. If you want a movie close to the book go watch the Rankin Bass film, which is good in its own right.<br/><br/>The things added to this story added to this movie too imo. Whereas I felt the first (even though I love that one too) dragged on in some parts, this one seemed to be non stop from start to finish. I plan on seeing it asap again. Man, and Smaug...Smaug man. And that ending. That horribly beautiful ending that made everyone groan in agonizing joy. I was so fixed on what was happening when the screen went black I nearly had a heart attack. A whole year! I cannot imagine what the final film will be like."
"rgcustomer","8","4","9","17 December 2013"," An improvement over the first, still outclassed by LOTR
","I saw this film in 3D high-frame-rate, which is I think the only way 3D should be seen. It does have a bit of that soap-opera look to it as a result, but I think that's far preferable to the choppy flip-book effect that marred other recent 3D flicks like Gravity. Why aren't other films done this way? <br/><br/>Bad stuff first. Let's be honest, that's why were all here.<br/><br/>Let's complain about the cinematography for a while. (1) Even in HFR, there are some scenes where motion blur is required, and it needs to be painted in if it doesn't happen naturally. For example, the scene where it is snowing, and you see the snow in front of actors' faces, would have greatly benefited from motion blur on the snow. It's very chunky snow, and snow that big shouldn't just pop into and out of existence. Similarly, some of the rapid fight scenes should also have been blurred. The vast majority of motion in the film is luxuriously smooth, and it's jarring to see the strobe effect when things start getting fast. (2) The cinematographers & directors just don't understand how a 3D film should feel to an audience. Quick cuts, hand-held cameras (or equivalent CG effects), and crazy swooping camera positions DO NOT MAKE SENSE in 3D, and make even less sense with HFR. It's almost nauseating. (Almost). With this level of realism, you need to return to stage ideas. Take a cue from Les Misérables (the stage musical). The stage can move, but there better be a reason for it. It needs to make sense. This team may be filming in 3D, but they're directing for 2D. Stop it. Stop it! (3) Some of the close-ups looked perfectly flat, or worse yet, projected onto a tilted flat surface. I have no idea what to say about that, except that I'm glad I only noticed it twice. It's almost like it wasn't finished.<br/><br/>My other major gripe about this film is the writing and acting (and directing), which SHOULD combine to produce characters you care about, because you understand them and their lives. I know the source material for The Hobbit doesn't really lend itself to that. I don't care. It's not my problem. They should have made it work, but instead they clearly said ""f--- it"". There are a grand total of zero interesting characters in this film, including the two title characters, although they are slightly closer to being interesting than the rest. Ultimately most are merely cogs fit into a machine that produces a defeated dragon in the upcoming 3rd film. We all know what's going to happen. We want to feel it. Where is the feeling?<br/><br/>And the credits, which I sat through, just sucked. Bad. Really, Peter?<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>The good stuff.<br/><br/>This film is not just a middle film, and it does deliver the goods you were looking for. Fortunately, The Hobbit's ""middle film"" was got over with first (Sorry, Gollum). This is really the first film that matters in The Hobbit trilogy. You don't even need to see the first one to understand it.<br/><br/>Some of the images on screen were really, really beautiful. They remind you what the artists of cinema can do (like in Avatar). One of many shots that I found remarkable was just after Legolas leaves his home to search for Tauriel, and finds her. It's just an amazing image of the two of them there in the landscape (and to be clear, I am speaking of the landscape, not them).<br/><br/>Once again, cinema has crowned a new dragon. It happens every once in a while, and we've come such a long way since Dragonslayer (1981). If you do not actually feel the heat on your face from this one, you're not breathing. I'm going to miss him when he's gone. I know he's ""the bad guy"" but honestly almost nobody has good motives in this film anyway (and I think that's the point of the story). He just wanted to sleep with his (admittedly stolen) trinkets and now people have come to kill him.<br/><br/>As thrilling as it is when it happens, I am surprised that we see Sauron in this film. True, we sort of saw Sauron in LOTR prior to his ring-finger getting lopped off, but we never really saw Sauron in all his fiery glory. This time we do, in a stunning battle with Gandalf the Grey. I'm not sure what to think of it, but it was spectacular to see. Also somewhat interesting is the not-subtle suggestion that Smaug and Sauron are more than simply on the same team, evidenced by their near-identical eyes, and use of the same voice actor.<br/><br/>And the first song during the end credits was very good. I wish I could have heard it over the bustle of people heading for the exit... (Peter, this is why you need to make credits INTERESTING again).<br/><br/>In summary, I am very glad I saw this film, but it should have been better. I am expecting better from the final film in the trilogy. And I hate that you're making me wait a year to see it."
"ad_upclose","9","4","9","14 December 2013"," A fast-paced fantasy action blockbuster!
","Desolation of Smaug is a marked improvement from the first installment of The Hobbit. From the onset, I was quite surprised at how much of an action-movie this actually was; it barely tries to settle down to breathe. Despite being impressive, I noticed via the editing that many scenes with Beorn and in Mirkwood forest were left on the cutting floor for Jackson's inevitable extended editions. The adventure develops a new sense of urgency as we are now exposed to lands & characters previously unseen in Middle Earth and the escapade gets darker harking back memories of the greatness of LOTR. I have little doubt that once all 3 movies are released and seen as one, these will be worthy, but slightly lesser, companions to the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>Once again, Jackson nails the epic adventure feel and the material is immediately transportive and captivating. We are introduced to some compelling supporting characters with varying screen-time. Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) is visually rendered quite differently compared to the book and thankfully is not generic as described therein. He is given 'manimal' features & an alluring mystery that will surely make him a memorable character by the time we get to the final movie's climax & extended edition. Thranduil gives of this ethereal vibe and is superbly played by Lee Pace; giving us a different side & hence more weight to the Elves.<br/><br/>Smaug, an iconic beast of Middle-Earth, is as magnificent as the book describes him to be. Cumberbatch's heavy vocals (with the help of some digital alterations) and movements (yes this is our first motion- captured dragon) make the villain more intimidating than merely size. Peter Jackson also nails his interactions with Bilbo as he did with Gollum in the last movie. The attention to detail on to the dragon is sublime and watching it talk and move is a truly mesmerizing & unforgettable experience. Avid fans were hoping Smaug would be the greatest dragon in cinematic history and that is the case as the character delivers in terms of both menace & personality. Smaug on screen encapsulates greed & bloated ego just as Tolkien inscribed.<br/><br/>Even the characters not in the book, Legolas & Tauriel, added substance to the subplot. It's not a far stretch to imagine that Legolas would be present at the time the Dwarf-company passed through his father's realm. Also, I found Tauriel very likable indeed (nothing to do with her looks I assure you); her character brought both warmth & fierceness whereas the source had completely overlooked the gender.<br/><br/>Other than character moments, the choreography of some of the action sequences was impressive. The spider attack and the barrel escape were tremendous; but the Bilbo's banter with Smaug & his resulting rage leads to an unexpected battle & fantastic cliffhanger that sets us up for another 12 painfully long months of waiting.<br/><br/>Overall, while Desolation of Smaug deviates significantly from the book's lighter tone, it marvelously captures the grandiosity of the LOTR films & is technically masterful."
"tomgiles","9","3","6","24 March 2015"," This movie is tremendously enjoyable
","This second Hobbit movie was for me not just a pleasure, but a revelation. For the first time, I ""got"" the JRR Tolkien/Peter Jackson experience. I tuned into the frequency. I tasted the fusion cuisine. I heard the eccentric but weirdly rousing choral harmonies. And this is despite – or more probably because of – never having been a Tolkien fan and being agnostic about the myth-making and, indeed, the prose quality. I never had any dogmatic sense of how the original should be represented or any loyalty to childhood fandom, and in fact I came to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring in 2001 with some unbelief, though as the Rings series progressed I was forced – with some churlish ill-grace – to admire those movies' mighty ambition and scope. With the Hobbit series, the penny is properly dropping: it's not about Tolkien, it's Tolkien-plus-Jackson, of course. It's morphed into something new.<br/><br/>This movie is tremendously enjoyable, and considering how exotic it is, The Desolation of Smaug is weirdly unassuming. It rattles along, never drags, and is always terrifically likable: open, genial and good-natured. The legend is revealing itself to be a rich and potent source of entertainment. Perhaps the point is, as Graham Greene once said about God, you need a sense of humour to believe."
"TxMike","Null","3","6","26 April 2014"," Meh! A very long movie that leaves you without a conclusion.
","OK, I admit I am not a big ""Ring"" and ""Hobbit"" fan, I didn't read the books growing up and have a moderate appreciation for the movies so far. The very first ""LOTR"" movie is my favorite, it introduced the themes and the characters. But now I see these movies just for the novelty and for the sound. Yes, the sound. I like theater sound. In my home theater I have a nice surround sound system with a monster powered subwoofer. I would enjoy this movie as much with my eyes closed.<br/><br/>But I must mention one revelation, Evangeline Lilly as the Elf Tauriel. I had not heard of her before seeing this movie and I find her just about the cutest thing on screen. At first she reminded me a bit of Cate Blanchett, but a lot more attractive. A lot more attractive. And a good actress also.<br/><br/>(I took the liberty of looking up more web images of her in a bikini and she is a real doll!) <br/><br/>Anyway Ian McKellen is of course Gandalf and Martin Freeman is of course the young Bilbo Baggins. This is actually a big spoiler throughout the movie, because we know Bilbo grows up to be the old Bilbo we see in the LOTR movies, so any time he gets in danger we are certain he will escape to safety, we just don't know how.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of the cast are interchangeable, almost generic actors. In costume and with the Hobbit languages it is hard to distinguish one from another.<br/><br/>So, while I enjoyed the visuals and the great sound, the ending was a big disappointment. The last scenes were inside the mountain with Smaug in the dragon form, lots of fire, lots of close calls. But Smaug is not destroyed, in fact flies away as the movie ends, and all the others wondering what kind of evil they might have sparked Smaug to do now. Sort of an ""Oh, spit..."" moment.<br/><br/>I will see the next installment, as I watch pretty much all the movies my public library gets on DVD or Blu-Ray. But these movies are definitely for the fans who can immerse themselves in the make-believe world of the Hobbits."
"ckormos1","1","3","6","19 March 2014"," middle earth porn
","The Lord of the Rings succeeded by making a world beyond movie-goers imaginations into a reality. The Hobbit took that reality and turned it into pornography. Middle Earth isn't real any more. In LOTR a viewer could actually believe that a hobbit could kill Shelob and an elf could bring down an Oliphant. The Hobbit destroys all that with ""Road Runner"" cartoon physics and fights totally exaggerated for no purpose other than a few seconds of WTF? One fine dwarf was replaced by a gaggle of ""Star Trek"" Ferengi space Jews. One unlikely romance was replaced by one nonsensical. Trying to be true to JRR is one thing but thinking you can do better results in trash."
"kyle-takacs","6","3","6","29 January 2014"," Smaug is better than the sum of its other parts
","I want to give it an 8, but that's just because the third act leaves a lasting impression that makes you almost forget many of the flaws in the film, which I'll begin with.<br/><br/>One major issue is that the movie is hard to look at. Being a hardcore Lotr fan, the cgi orcs looked horrible compared to the gritty make-up wearing actors from the original trilogy. I understand the Hobbit story is more cartoony by nature, but cgi was overused to the point of stupidity. Even all of the scenery and structures look bad and every shot seems overexposed.The Hobbit trilogy had a much bigger budget than the original, and it's clear they were too trigger happy with their money. Also, one thing I noticed was the overuse of decapitations/headshots to try and make you forget how cartoony the movie was. The fighting just looks like Legolas dancing around a green screen. Also, out of the 5 films made so far, Desolation deviates from the book the most, continuing the storyline of Azog, who I hated since the last movie, and Tauriel. Adding a female elf to a male dominated movie is a change I don't mind, but her love story with Kili seems forced. Lastly, the pacing was very odd, with some parts going to fast and others too slow. I assumed that would happen considering one book is being dragged out over three movies so I was ready for that. <br/><br/>Now for the good things. The acting was great as expected, and I enjoyed the dialogue driven scenes more than the many action ones. Smaug, with the talents of Benedict Cumberbatch, is amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with Bilbo and the dragon. The ending was great, although it does worry me how they plan on executing the 3rd film. And of course we all love Gandalf, even if he wasn't in it for much. It's hard not to compare the new trilogy with the original, but even so, it is an enjoyable film the problems I had were mainly personal preference over visuals. Overall, Desolation of Smaug is definitely worth watching if you like fantasy movies or just want to see an awesome dragon."
"saschakrieger","8","3","6","4 January 2014"," A human journey
","And so the journey continues. With The Desolation of Smaug, Peter Jackson has now presented the middle part of his trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. A difficult task as it has to serve as a bridge between the beginning and the end of the story but also be capable of standing on its own. In his Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson decided to narrow the view, focus on key episodes and thus offer a contrast from the panoramic vision of parts one and three. Still, The Two Towers was arguably the weakest installment of the series. This time, Jackson again departs from the style and focus of the first part: Whereas there he adopted a much slower pace, allowed scenes to play out for as long as they could and chose a much more comical as well as fairy-tale like tone, he now gets down to business. The Desolation of Smaug is faster, narratively tighter and way more serious than An Unexpected Journey. Thus, it is much closer to The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>As it is meant to be. Much more so than I the first part, Jackson adds characters and story lines not in the book that serve one purpose mostly: embed the adventure tale in a darker, larger one, an approaching battle of good and evil. So the film basically tells two stories: that of the company of dwarfs and a hobbit to reclaim the old dwarf kingdom from a dragon and the buildup to the events of the earlier trilogy. For much of the film the two strands run parallel to each other, but Jackson succeeds, as it goes on, to atmospherically intertwine them, lifting the adventure tale to a battle in a much bigger war. This does not go without some arm twisting and results in a not entirely consistent film but it works better and better as it progresses, suddenly infusing the smaller story with an importance it might not have had before.<br/><br/>As the tale gets more serious, so do the characters, first and foremost hobbit Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman. His is a true coming-of-age story (despite his advanced age), enfolding like a Bildungsroman. It is fascinating to watch Freeman subtly add muscle and courage to his character, augment the comfort-loving Bilbo with a maturity he did not have in the first firm. For this is still a story of the most unlikely of heroes, a – literally – little man rising to the stature he needs to make himself and those in his charge survive. The darker the surroundings, the brighter his light shines and the more he can inspire those around him. Jackson's strength lies in creating three-dimensional characters in just a few sketches – and Freeman is the perfect actor to achieve this.<br/><br/>Sure, not everything works out. Such as the addition of the elvish woman Tauriel and her love story with dwarf Kili. This adds little to an otherwise very tightly-knit narrative, threatening to derail it occasionally. On the other hand, Jackson's obvious love for the powers of the current generation of CGI is less pervasive here. The visual effects are mind-boggling again, but they serve the story. Easily Jackson moves from place to place, episode to episode without any sense of the fragmentary. There is a wholeness to this that the first part lacked, everything belongs together, woven delicately into a rich and fascinating texture. Far from being a stretch, embedding the tale into what is basically the eternal struggle of life, to live and make sense of it, makes the film stronger and the individual journey at its hard even stronger. For this is what the film is: a tale of human perseverance, far from naïve but not without optimism. This way, The Hobbit becomes a parable of human life. And a convincing one, too.<br/><br/>http://www.stagescreen.de"

","A lot of Tolkien fans are upset because the trilogy seems to neglect the content of the book. It is true that the story line goes off, nevertheless it is an interesting plot.<br/><br/>I'll explain why I didn't give it a 10. First of all, it seems like a problem that the dwarfs and Bilbo barely interact with each other. Also, the movie has the tendency to need an elf to ""come and save the day""; which draws much mood from the movie. Some shots seem to be made to show VFX rather than using VFXs to enhance the story.<br/><br/>Staying away from these mistakes, the perspective of the Desolation of Smaug from a film point is fantastic. Amazing cinematography, I have to say I enjoyed the 3D with the extra frames. I am a big time Tolkien fan, and being able to travel through all the unexplored areas of the North Eastern region of Middle Earth is fantastic! The story being told outside the book is mainly taken from Tolkien's unpublished notes, of course they need a made-up story line because Tolkien never made a story out of the notes.<br/><br/>A lot of people fail to see that Jackson is creating the rest of middle- earth and at the same time he is giving insight of how Sauron came back to power before the War of the Ring (LOTR trilogy). <br/><br/>Great job and production, I do hope to see more dramatic danger in the last movie as Sauron appears to gain more power. I am also curious to see how they make the connection between the last movie and the Fellowship."
"Callum_Hofler","9","3","6","3 January 2014"," Another Awesome Addition To Jackson's Middle Earth!
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a film directed by Peter Jackson, and stars Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Ian McKellen and Benedict Cumberbatch. The film picks up from where the previous installment, An Unexpected Journey, left off, with Bilbo, Gandalf and the dwarfs venturing to Erebor. Along the way, they meet elves, orcs and eventually, a great dragon, in one hell of an adventure! <br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of An Unexpected Journey. It didn't, to me at least, feel like a Lord of the Rings film. It certainly wasn't bad; it just didn't compare to the trilogy that we saw beforehands. I gave it a 6.8. An admirable, but disappointing score for a film so hyped. Desolation of Smaug, on the other hand, feels like a proper Jackson Middle-Earth film. It's grand, emotional, epic and ultimately, a bliss to watch. We finally get into a rhythm which I enjoy, and this time, we don't have to sit through half an hour of Shire to get to the good stuff. We can dive in from the word go! <br/><br/>Performance wise, this film does really well. Martin Freeman is fantastic as Bilbo Baggins, although he doesn't get nearly as much time to himself on screen as he did in Unexpected Journey, to my disappointment. It's not too much of a problem, fortunately, because the rest of the cast performs pretty damn well! Ian McKellen as Gandalf never fails! He's amazing as an old, but certainly badass wizard, who actually gets to do some badass action scenes here, unlike Unexpected Journey! And Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield... He was formidable and awesome in the previous installment, but here, he really stands out as the leader. The rest of the dwarfs do well, as well as the rest of the ensemble. Performance wise, I think this is a really awesome film! <br/><br/>The score... Something I have mixed feelings about. As a solo listen, it's not fantastic. Not nearly as good as Unexpected Journey or any of the Lord of the Rings scores, although it does fairly well within the film. It conveys dread, which is a real theme within the film, so on that count, Howard Shore has excelled. The post credits song, I See Fire by Ed Sheeran is something I truly adore! I think Peter Jackson made the right call on getting Sheeran to give us a song which wrapped up the film in spectacular fashion!<br/><br/>I love where the story goes here. Desolation feels a little like Two Towers, for me. They just get straight into the thick of it from the beginning, run with it, and send you off on some really awesome notes, leaving you anticipating the next film. I loved seeing Bilbo become a popular figure in this group in which he originally was a complete outcast from. From saving the group in a fight, to figuring out a puzzle, to, you know, running into a mountain in which an incredibly dangerous, gigantic, powerful dragon lays, Bilbo helps the group out and gets his hands dirty, which was good to see. I certainly liked the pacing, as well. I feel like Jackson can make long, drawn out scenes work very well, and this film is a perfect display of that. From beginning to end, this film keeps you invested, interested, and ultimately, incredibly entertained! <br/><br/>I do have some specific positives and negatives that I feel I really do need to talk about. Smaug the dragon. Honestly... One of the coolest things in general, I've seen from a film in 2013. Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon was a stroke of genius, and to be honest, it made the character so much more menacing than he should've been. When Smaug crawls out from under his pits of gold, it literally takes your breath away. Smaug is huge, terrifying and quite mesmerising. He easily sold the show for me. To add to this, I also found the action so much more better than the action in the previous installment. Whilst this film does defy logic and physics a few times, it does turn a little grittier than An Unexpected Journey, which refused to cut off a single head! How dare Jackson! Fortunately, we get some brutal, awesome action here, that remedies the lack of brutality An Unexpected Journey had. On the negative side, I do have a problem with the character of Tauriel. As we all know, Jackson added her in despite the fact that she wasn't included in the source material. Was that a good move? I don't think so, unfortunately. Yes, she was formidable and she was slightly interesting, but when she suddenly falls for a dwarf, I just couldn't take it seriously! It was a bad story telling decision, and one that really didn't need to happen! As well as my hate towards Tauriel, I do have a problem with a little of the CGI. WETA seem to have stuffed up various shots, and there were a few CGI characters which felt so disconnected to this world that Jackson had created. Fortunately, WETA did very well for the majority of the running time. It was just a few stuff ups here and there that bugged me a little.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a powerful, awesome addition to the Peter Jackson Middle Earth film collection. The film advances all the characters, includes some awesome action and gives us one of the best CGI monsters I've ever seen in Smaug. Jackson may have stuffed up at few points, and they aren't all forgettable; nonetheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Desolation of Smaug is a wonderful film, and one of the best films of 2013! <br/><br/>9.4/10"

","While I do love Tolkien, I am not a purist; I understand that what works in a book will not necessarily work in a movie, so I recognize that movies based on books will not simply be readings of said books. That being said, this movie is an abomination, bearing only a passing resemblance to Tolkien.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson made two mistakes: The first,in releasing LOTR first, he became at least philosophically attached to the darker themes of the later work and appears to be unable to back away from it in deference to Tolkien's intent in his first work--to entertain children. The second is in attempting to take a single, short, children's book and trying to make it into an epic trilogy a la LOTR. It cannot be done, reasonably, but in making the first trilogy he perhaps became addicted to his own press as the maker of miraculous trilogies and thus everything he does must be a trilogy.<br/><br/>To make this short book into an epic trilogy and maintain the dark tones, he all but throws the book out the window and leaves us with a heavy, leaden, useless succession of overwrought battle scenes which appear intended to impress the audience with the effects creators' skill, but in no way advances the characters or the story. Bilbo's character development is completely fallen by the wayside. Whatever happened to the humor of the spider scene in the book with an invisible Bilbo running around insulting the spiders in Scottish? Instead we have a series of mini-Shelobs getting stabbed and torn apart. The depiction of Beorn is also less than satisfying; no evidence is seen of his remarkable menagerie--he simply has a few beasts and oversized honeybees.<br/><br/>And once again, the higher projection speed is distracting at best and sickening (quite literally, for anyone prone to migraines or motion sickness) at worst.<br/><br/>If you must see this, save yourself the price of admission and wait till it comes out at Redbox. That's what I'll be doing with the next one."
"MattRigby","8","3","6","1 January 2014"," Keeps Getting Better
","Contrary to popular opinion I actually liked The Hobbit an Unexpected Journey, I no it had some tempo issues but in all honesty as a Tolkien fan I easily overlooked it. However, The Desolation of Smaug starts off more or less right where it left off and certainly proceeds at an entertaining pace. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) witnesses the ferocious beast Beorn who looks pretty spectacular on screen. The party then make for Mirkwood forest, a dangerous and ominous route on their quest.<br/><br/>Their journey through the forest has plenty of action as the party of travellers are tormented by the forest and battle against giant spiders. During their dark, dank walk through Mirkwood, Bilbo climbs a tree popping his head above them into a sea of autumn leaves and fluttering butterflies. He inhales the warm fresh air as the reassuring sun shines upon his face. It's a beautiful scene and despite perhaps a lack of narrative explaining the journey these sort of scenes manifest it clearly. They eventually run into a group of woodland elves and once again the hobbit makes use of his magic ring to their advantage.<br/><br/>The viewer has the pleasure of seeing a tremendous barrel sequence were the travellers flow down the fast moving river. It's a long scene but not for one second does it bore or linger. We also see not just Azog the Defiler but another intimidating orc named Bolg both of which answer to a much darker evil. <br/><br/>The love triangle between Kili (Aidan Turner),Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) however feels slightly insignificant as we don't really connect with these characters very deeply and on the whole is very brief. I would prefer to of seen a happier Legolas, a character we are already familiar with from Lord Of The Rings pursuing his love for Tauriel against his farther Thranduil's (Lee Pace) will. <br/><br/>Despite my minor issues there is a lot to be loved and enjoyed in this movie and holds true to Tolkiens English style. Smaug the dragon was executed superbly as were all the special effects for that matter. We get a closer look at Thorin (Richard Armitage) which is definitely needed and as usual Bilbo and Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) play their roles brilliantly.<br/><br/>We are left with a heated and action packed ending as the party continue their search for the Arkenstone, the heirloom of Throins kin, which will crown him king and unite his people once more. <br/><br/>8.5/10<br/><br/>MattRigby"

","Specially being a middle part of the story, this was really entertaining movie. This time we saw more personalities of the dwarfs and I still have crush for Thorin. Martin Freeman is sympathetic and human Bilbo. Visually the movie was magnificent; my favorite was city of the wood elves. Have to say that the dragon was more impressive when it was still hiding. Fight between good and evil is interesting in all Tolkien fantasy; special in this story were thoughts what greediness can make. One thin that wasn't working in this movie was Legolas character. It was hard to believe that this was young Legolas before what happened at the Lord of Rings trilogy."
"collinddean","8","3","6","14 December 2013"," Why Are We Overlooking the Brilliance?
","Bottom line this movie is an experience! If you go into it looking for something other than such, you probably will leave whining like the other pundits of this film. A lot of people are wanting another Lord of the Rings film, and by doing so their missing out on ""THE HOBBIT"", which is quite an awesome experience in it's own right. The genius of Peter Jackson is he did not make the Hobbit to be anything like the Lord of the Rings, rather it is something completely different, and if you accept it as something different, you will be amazed how much you will fall in love with this film. I personally enjoyed the first Hobbit, but agreed with most that it lacked something. But what the first installment lacked, it makes up for ten-fold in this film. Simply put this movie is brilliant! Beginning to end, the film just pulls you in and doesn't disappoint. Sure the ending leaves you hanging, but honestly was there anyone who didn't see that coming? The Cinematography, visual effects, score, and writing all exceeded expectations in this film. It was a long film (running 180 minutes), but you never got the sense that it dragged on like the previous Hobbit and even some LOTR films did. As the end approached I found myself not wanting it to come to and end. Everybody has there own opinion but this is one of my favorite films of the year. I guarantee anyone who watches it for the soul purpose of wanting to see a brilliant and entertaining film, they will certainly not be disappointed."
"l-vrtis","5","6","16","18 December 2013"," The worst of the five but still worth watching
","The good: Still feels like the previous movies. Smaug. New beautiful sets.<br/><br/>The bad: The comic relief goes way too far. Some parts resemble Asterix and Obelix and just feel wrong. Still no dwarf charisma apart from Thorin. Legolas and his GF behave like teenagers rather than ancient elves. The lord of Laketown is even worse than the goblin king. Gandalf's added detours are not explained within the movie and very confusing for people who haven't read the book. Completely pointless last 15 minutes (Peter added something extremely stupid, which makes a certain dragon look really dumb. No end to speak of, no climax. The Two Towers had a very decent ending compared to this mess. There was apparent confusions in the cinema when the titles appeared."
"motorheadlovro","7","6","16","17 December 2013"," Peter,something wrong happen here!
","10 reasons why this Hobbit didn't work for me:<br/><br/>1.No magic at all.Everything is here,the darkly picture,mystic places and castles but..no soul in it.I think the main reason is because there was no thrill in the air,like in LOTR movies where at all time you can smell the fear of things that will come unless the task is being done and the ring destroyed. 2.I really don't care about none of the protagonist.Filly,Killy,Dory,bla bla etc..I'm lost.I mean its not their fault they didn't get enough time to like them(Hobbit 1 failed in that).And its not only with dwarfs,its a problem with all others.I didn't remember the names of elf's too-reason again is poor writing(screenplay). 3.Too much mindless action and killing.For all i care Legolas and that elf girl could kill an entire army(they did)of orcs and all i want at that point is to be done.In LOTR every orc they killed was one less too worry about,and i really mean one orc. 4.No pace,no tone and rhythm.Screenplay is disaster and is dancing and jumping all around like it is retarded. 5.One of the main reason why i didn't feel this movie is because i really don't care about dwarfs quest.OK,what is there to care,they want to reclaim their kingdom and gold and to awake a sleeping dragon Smog.Dragon is personification of death,but he is sleeping and didn't kill nobody in years.Let him have his gold and chock in it for all i care. 6.Whats wrong with Thorin and Bilbo story?From the beginning Thorin has no thrust in Bilbo.At the beginning of the quest that was nice but after Bilbo saved him and his company 15 times and stood in front of Azog nothing has change.Absolutely nothing.Thorin is still dumb ass. 7.The One ring supposed to be the source of all evil and Bilbo is playing with him like a child with a candy..should i putt the ring or not..should i putt the ring or not...just to remind us that the ring is all the time here..bad,just bad. 8.The movie is tryng to be funny but its not.I don't wanna see Legolas jumping on dwarfs heads and kill orcs while doing it.I don't wanna see a useless fat dwarf at one point and the real killing machine trapped in barrel at other point.Sorry,I'm not 10 year old kid. 9.I think Hobbit movies are made without any passion.In LOTR you can feel it,all of them was in just to destroy the bloody ring.Here, i forgot whats the reason of all this race and even dwarfs seems and looks like they don't know too and now and then they remind you by saying something like ""hey,we must get there before Durins day..""or something like that. 10.NO DIALOGUE AT ALL.AFTER I SEEN THE MOVIE AND COME HOME,I SAID TO MY GIRL:DID YOU REMEMBER ANY DIALOGUE OR A WORD AT ALL?WE BOTH SAID NO."
"valentino_weber","5","6","16","16 December 2013"," As a real fan of the Tolkien world I've to say...
","First of all I've to say that the first part ""The Hobbit: An unexpected journey"" had much mysticism and charisma. I'm gutted about the second part of the trilogy due to the fact that is such an other story than the book tells. I know that you can't turn a book, which was written for children, into a spectacular movie without adding some extras but this was kind of another movie at some parts. In addition to that I missed the deepness within the characters and their relation to the whole journey. Despite some more or less nonessential and dummy conversation there are a few moments in which you feel you're part of the world. I really appreciate Peter Jackson for what he did especially due to the Lotr-Trilogy but this time he missed the target by far. Moreover, one can not simple appropriate some special effects like the big golden dwarf turning into liquid gold or the moment Sauron appears in Dol Gundur in front of Gandalf which are so lame it looks like a ten-year-old had given photo shop and a half an hour of time. I read all the books of Tolkien (Lotr, Hobbit, Silmarilion etc) but this second movie of the Hobbit Trilogy appears as a thorn in my flesh and it's frustrating that is now a part of the whole Tolkien-World. I really hope that the 3rd part is getting much better again."
"Ladiloque","4","5","13","15 December 2013"," For children
","I loved LOTR trilogy. For sure there were childish moments which were partly detrimental to the movie in LOTR too. Don't get me wrong: both LOTR and TH were written for young and curious people but it's a thin line the one separating fun and silliness. LOTR had few moments of silliness but was also able to deliver drama, tragedy, awe, tension, greatness and beauty. The first Hobbit instead had too much silliness, too much children stuff, no drama, no tension and it was nearly painful to watch just like those films you're ashamed to be watching due to the high expectations you had. This second film is just slightly better simply because the stupid dialogues are less and the action is everywhere: you can hardly spend some seconds thinking about what you're watching before the next cascade of fights, arrows, jumps and on and on. Sure the film is exceptional from the graphic perspective but this planetary success should be due to the fact that Tolkien's books are great stories: and here again - as in the first episode - the story is a complete, uninteresting, boring, childish, mess. So great visuals are not enough at all. The few relevant lines pronounced by characters are usually stupid and unable to create any tension or sense of emergency. Out of combat characters seems to be standing on the stage of a ghetto theater or in a serial studio caring for the camera angle. Only Ian McKellan is able to deliver few emotions and to take you to Middle Earth: the rest of the cast sounds like they're part of a farce no one cares about. The (high) votes here make me think that lots of people appreciated LOTR without even noticing all the precious gems that the production was able to deliver to readers of the book. Whatever: look at the Hobbit, enjoy this bad product with its nice landscapes, CGI, continuous action and go on avoiding books since your brains' capacity of imagination is too low to enjoy books anymore (and appreciate Cinema versions). Which vote should we give to multimilliondollar productions that turn out to be bad cinema? I suggest the lowest possible."
"hamboTjorvi","10","5","13","15 December 2013"," Lived up to expectations
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a movie i had been waiting to see since i left the theater after seeing the first one. i really liked the first one, it did not let me down like it did to some people so i had some pretty high expectations fore this one. This movie however did not fall short to the first movie and was actually quite a lot better than the first one. This movie like i said before did stray quite a lot away from the books but in my opinion that was not a bad thing, Peter Jackson did an amazing job at making this film both watchable for die hard fans of the Lord Of the Rings series and the casual fans who have only watched the movies, and he did have a few Easter eggs in there who in my opinion were funny and very funny but they were not needed. One of them is just the presence of Legolas in the movie, it made sense to me that is was in the movie but the created a hole story line for him and Tauriel and thereby leaving 4 Dwarfs in Laketown which was my main problem with the story, this extra story line that they put in with them and the love interest between Fili and Tauriel and the fact that Fili was almost killed with the Morgul arrow was not at all necessary and it was in my eyes just an excuse to have Legolas in the movie a bit more. But now to other things, Smaug, Smaug was AMAZING, that is all i have to say about him, there was nothing that they could have done better with him, both the CGI and the frightening voice of Benedict Cumberbatch, it all mixed in one amazing character and it was better than i could ever imagine. Now to the ending, The ending in my eyes was great, it was a total cliffhanger and it left you wanting more and in tears that you had to wait an entire year to see what how it ends. The part where the Dwarfs tried to kill Smaug with the melted gold was for me a good climax of the film and a really good setup for the beginning of the third one. The song ""I See Fire"" by Ed Sheeran did actually work quite well i did calm me down after the crazy cliffhanger that the movie ended on.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie similar to like the first one did not disappoint at all everyone was just perfectly cast and everyone did an amazing job. Some characters were a surprise to see performed so good(Like Stephen Fry as the Laketown master) and some were not so surprising(Like Ian McKellen as Gandalf.<br/><br/>Overall i thought the movie was fantastic and it was worth waiting in line for 5 hours and lives up to expectations."
"sandrapiercexxx","10","5","13","15 December 2013"," Nothing like it
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, is the 2nd part of The Hobbit, which is written by one of the most well known and talented authors of all time, J.R.R Tolkien, and is directed by Peter Jackson (who i personally think as one in a million, because of his incredible originality with films and special effects). <br/><br/>I just got out of the cinema and The Hobbit (2) is still paying on my mind. The movie was such a marvellous MASTERPIECE that i can't really find words to describe how absolutely outstanding it was. <br/><br/>From the beginning we have a little interesting flashback of the past, and then it goes straight into amazing action. There is NOT A DULL MOMENT throughout the movie. I strongly recommend you don't drink a lot in the cinema because you would have to go and pee a lot ( like i did), but there will not be time as something epic will keep on happening. I felt sorry for the dude sitting next to me, he kept on having to let me through. <br/><br/>Another thing i want to mention are the special effects. Me, being the critic that i am, constantly kept on carefully looking for movie mistakes. I found none. You'd think with all the special effects there would be quite a lot, huh? Well, i didn't see ANY. There was so much detail and i was literally sitting in the cinema overwhelmed and astounded by it all, and finding it impossible to believe how talented the crew AND actors were. Just unbelievable. <br/><br/>The cinematographer did a fantastic job on keeping the camera straight, and giving us different angles to see things from. <br/><br/>In truth, i feel like this movie is FLAWLESS. I can't remember myself enjoying a movie this much since Avatar and Rapunzel hit the screens, much less one that's nearly 3 hrs long. <br/><br/>The characters in the film are fabulous as well. They are one of the things i love the most. Their personalities are very different and unique. I CARED about them all, and it felt at times as if i KNEW them. I wanted to be there with them on that adventure. Because, and if, you care for them, the movie will be much emotional for you, like it was for me. <br/><br/>My emotions were flying all over the place. One minute i'm laughing, then i'm at the verge of a panic attack, next i'm rooting the characters on, swooning over someone or wanting to slap a character across the face (i'm talking about you Thorin), and lastly i'm at the verge of tears. For a movie to tug at my heart strings like this is a miracle in its self, and it really proves that The Hobbit (2) is an extraordinary film that cannot be missed. <br/><br/>The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug is a movie i recommend to all Fantasy and adventure lovers, and to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit: An Epic Adventure (1) fans. You will not be left disappointed. There was so much stuff going on. The majority of the time i was literally at the edge of my seat, holding my hand against my mouth to not squeal in either excitement or shock, and biting the edge of my popcorn box. TWISTS AND TURNS AROUND EVERY CORNER that had me hooked and holding on for the ride. I am DYING to see the next one after that cliffhanger at the end, and i bet you i'll be the first to buy the tickets, even if i have to wake up at 6 am or stay up till 4 at night. WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! That's an order."

I know these movies are long for some people, but I enjoy the time away from everything.<br/><br/>The detail has always been impressive, but this time around the sub plots give way to a larger target audience, and his epic size evolution of the story is intoxicating. Well done Peter Jackson, well done.<br/><br/>The cliff hanger style movie has yet still to be perfected, the old 1930s cliff hangers had down pat, but since we view everything in completions, we still have yet to discover how to balance that need to complete the film yet leave enough open to invite the audience back. It is a special thing in timing to do and I haven't seen anyone do it right in a long time, not even in matrix.<br/><br/>This one lacked that one crucial feature, closure, I felt no closure in the film.

I know a lot of the reviews has been very negative and hasn't come with any constructive criticism, but to those who hasn't watched the movie yet, should definitely go. It's one of the most beautiful and magnificent movies i have ever seen, i watched the movie in 3D HFR and it was absolutely stunning. One of the things i think was best about the movie was that Peter Jackson didn't follow the book to the detail, and that's because the book was written for children, and not for adults which is the target group of the movie. I also liked the length of the movie, because it made it possible to get so many details in the movie and the landscape overview scenes are stunning in 3D HFR and is worth the time! <br/><br/>My advice is not to look at the little mistakes the movie makes, but to look at the beauty and magnificence of the movie. I will finish withe the words of a review from a big danish newspaper, who wrote: the Hobbit Desolation of Smaug, is like a pure Wagner opera. It's definitely worth to watch and i personally can't wait for the third part of trilogy to come out!"
"legolaa369","7","5","13","13 December 2013"," An improved, but still not at its best movie
","Again, we are back into the Middle Earth. Nothing could be more exciting than this! After the disappointment of watching the unexpected journey, this time, I just went in and tried and enjoy, and it did not disappoint. I think there is a few reasons for that I am convinced this one is an improvement. 1.) The storyline has a greater diversity, since more and more characters would get involved. 2.) All the characters got a good development of who they really are. 3.) The ambition of Jackson finally makes it an independent trilogy. Obviously, in the Unexpected Journey, there are too much connection Jackson tried to build between LOTR, and it turned out somehow weird. This time, everything looks in place. A 60 years younger (in reality, an older Bloom) Legolas somehow impressed me! And the lack of romance things in Tolkien's story, definitely had its improvement here, although somewhat unnatural. Of course, there are more than a few things you can be unhappy about, like the music (and oh god, when will there be such a masterpiece again like LOTR?). But overall, I could see Jackson is finally trying to get on his new trilogy and make some attempts for new elements of his film making, rather than trying to copy the old things he did, which is nice to see. Next year, hopefully we will see a great ending. Personally I do not hope it can top LOTR anymore, because, to be fair, it is impossible...."

","I've never been a fan of Sci-Fi or fiction till I've watched the LOTR trilogy. I was astonished with almost every aspect of the series starting from the actors their voices and acting, the magnificent and matching background score. But the most important thing that left me astonished was the way each movie ended. Bearing this in mind, I've watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Unlike the LOTR series, it failed to give the vibe towards the climax. <br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug starts with showing events of an year before the time where TH:AUJ was left at. The movie took no time to escalate into its ravishingly stylish background score with breathtaking visuals and sound effects. The plot was interestingly and carefully laid. It was not just well written but it was just something which cannot be seen on screen for every movie. Movie was full of pulses that won't make the audience sit with boredom. <br/><br/>With the word ""desolation"" in the title, non book fans were deluded about Smaug's desolation. Until the half time you'll be lost in the beauty of the screenplay stunningly covered by amazing background score ( as usual and as expected from the movie) although the second half completely relies on the story. A lack of powerful score could be seen. At times, movie felt a bit over-dramatic. And towards the climax you won't even realize that the movie is about to come to an abrupt end. Actually, we have to (non book fans) wait for the next part. <br/><br/>Few scenes including chase sequences and some scenes with Smaug are literally iconic. One can only watch it to understand the beauty of it. The essence of Smaug's mighty is completely justified with the right skill in showing it in the way which it is meant to be shown. 3D and 48 fps is clearly felt in the said ""iconic"" scenes. Its like ""you have to see it to believe it"" ."

Nice to see Gandalf in action in 'Dol Guldur' reminded me the epic scene of ""You Shall not Pass"". Voice of the 'Smaug' is perfect so far. Peter Jackson ended the story at a good position that everybody will be eager to watch the next part definitely. In this part three new characters is introduced, think they will play important roles in next part. Though the name suggests it is ""Desolation of Smaug"", but 'Smaug' is not completely desolated here. Overall the movie is superb. Happy Watching :)"

","I read these stories when I was in High School in the 80's, and they weren't new at that time. The movies followed some 20 to 30 years after that. I have been immensely entertained by all of them, and think that it is a testimony to Tolkien's stories that such movies could be made and be so successful on all levels, financially, popularity etc. The books are books, the movies are movies, true fans I imagine had images in their minds what Bag End and all the rest of Middle Earth must look like, and that is the wonder of the truly fantastic stories. And I have to confess, the first time the scene rolled up of the path leading to Bag End in the Fellowship of the Ring, my eyes softened and my breath was taken. Wow, absolutely beautiful and amazing. Was it exactly like the images I formed in the 80's, well no, but it certainly wasn't a mediocre effort and it was truly wonderful. Movies don't follow books, there simply isn't enough screen time, and they do cost a substantial amount of money and work to bring to the screen. There success has proved it was worth the investment, and the creators are to congratulated for bringing them to us. For all who can do nothing but complain about what you see in the movie, no one is stopping you from doing it the way you think it should be done, but to complain as you do is an insult to the rest of us who are thrilled to have lived to see the stories come to the screen at all. Your loathing of the movie and your ridicule suggest that you didn't go to enjoy a movie, but to nitpick at everything about it that deviated from the book and suggest that if we left the movie having had a terrific time watching it that we couldn't possibly be fans of the books is a sad event. I went, I enjoyed it immensely, and my books still have a prominent place on my bookshelf in my bedroom. If you think that you can do better, go for it, fans will go see it, and if you stick to the books more closely then you can be at peace. Good luck with your financing and all, it is, after all, designed to provide entertainment and make money, and you'll need more than a movie admission to bring your version to us on the big screen. Sure, I would have liked to see Tom Bombadil in FOTR, and others things that didn't make it in to the various movies, and I am sure that all of this was thought out very carefully, and that those in charge did the best they could to satisfy all the requirements of the project, and I am delighted that it happened at all.

His low, euphonious voice suits the part of a revengeful dragon perfectly. A second applause goes to Martin Freeman, who's acting never ceases to amaze me. Without giving any of the plot away, his character development is tracked superbly and is a highlight of the film. The whole film wasn't a slug to sit through either!

"paperback_wizard","7","4","10","13 December 2013"," THAT Was a Dragon
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is the quintessential fantasy movie, with quests, monsters, fair maidens, heroes, villains, revenge, intrigue, magic, dungeons, and, of course, a dragon. All of these elements are present in Tolkien's novel ""The Hobbit"" (with the exception of the ""fair maiden"", that is), but not all of them are there throughout the novel; so, in trying to turn one novel into three movies, Peter Jackson had to stretch a lot of elements across all three movies, and introduce whole new elements in some places. It's less of a problem with ""Desolation of Smaug"" than it was with ""An Unexpected Journey"", which is partly why people say this film is superior to that one; but it's still a problem.<br/><br/>Jackson has taken some serious flack for reusing characters from The Lord of the Rings in a trilogy based on a novel that never even mentioned them. But, there is a valid and even important point to adding these characters. In the novel ""The Hobbit"", when the company enters Mirkwood, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) leaves them, claiming he has business elsewhere. While this may seem like a vague justification to give Bilbo an excuse to step up, Tolkien did actually have something important for Gandalf to do at the time. He leaves to investigate reports of a Necromancer in the crumbling stronghold of Dol Guldur. Many dark creatures in Middle Earth have a connection to this place, as you'll see in DoS. Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) alerted the White Council to the Necromancer's plotting in AUJ, which is why we see them all together there, and why Gandalf travels to Dol Guldur in this film. I mention this to show that not everything Jackson does in the Hobbit films is about pandering.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of what he does is all about pandering. While Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and company are battling Spiders in Mirkwood, they are ""saved"" by Wood Elves, who promptly take them all prisoner as trespassers. Included among the Elves is Legolas, who, in the Tolkienverse, is the son of King Thranduil (Lee Pace), so at least there's a logical explanation for him being there. But the female warrior Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) is completely new.<br/><br/>I understand that Tolkien didn't include a lot of female characters in his stories. But the least you could do is not include a woman who has only two roles to fill, one of them being purely romantic. Sure, Tauriel is seen slaughtering at least as many orcs as Legolas, but that doesn't make her a strong character; that just makes her a character who happens to have a talent for killing.<br/><br/>Her other role was, apparently, being in love with Legolas; and with the Dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner). Between the awkward flirting with both men, the lack of any substantive contribution to the narrative, and Jackson shoehorning in a brand new subplot for Kili just so Tauriel would have some more screen time in the final act of the film, there's no real reason why her character should have been added to DoS.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with Tauriel is she seemed completely out of place in the narrative, and not because she had never been there before. They interspersed tense and dramatic moments between Bilbo and the dragon Smaug with ""romantic"" and, frankly, quite silly moments between Tauriel and Kili. If they had eliminated the ""love triangle"" between Tauriel, Kili, and Legolas, even if they had left in the romance angle between her and Legolas, then it wouldn't have wrenchingly distracted from what were, in my opinion, the most powerful moments of the film.<br/><br/>Setting aside all the ""extra"" plot lines, whether Tolkien intended for them to exist or not, the ""Hobbit"" parts of the film were, in a word, fantastic. The way they wrote and handled the scenes with the Spiders, the escape from the Wood Elves' dungeon, and the climactic confrontation with the magnificent Smaug were my favorite moments, and Freeman's Bilbo virtually carried every scene. He melded tension, suspense, and even humor into a performance that kept me grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>Smaug the Golden, the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities, in no way disappointed me. Dragons are magnificent creatures, and Smaug has set the standard for dragons for over 75 years now. Benedict Cumberbatch's voice undoubtedly lent to the powerful portrayal, but there's nothing that quite matches simply seeing the massive beast on the screen, emerging from beneath a sea of gold and jewels (with a cowering hobbit in the center adding no small amount to the feeling of awe at the sight). And to hear the words, only slightly altered from Tolkien's original text, as Smaug taunts Bilbo with his insignificance, teasing him with the prospect of near-instantaneous destruction, and even taking time to instill a sense of doubt in the hobbit's mind about his companions, the conspicuously reluctant-to-enter Dwarfs. I could watch the film over and over just to see Smaug again.<br/><br/>I shook my head several times throughout the film, though not as much as during the first film. I think some scenes (and characters, obviously) just didn't belong. But, some scenes that Jackson added helped the movie, and the larger narrative of the trilogy. And, as I cannot say enough times, the dragon was incredible. Much more so than after An Unexpected Journey, I'm looking forward to the next film.<br/><br/>(Read the full review at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2013/12/that-was-a-dragon/)"

","*This review may contain spoilers that will only come at 3rd movie*<br/><br/>Well this was the first Middle-Earth movie that I was ''not happy'' after leave the cinema. Although I saw the LOTR movies before reading them, still liked also the first Hobbit (even though at that time hadn't readed the book for a while) ... I just readed the Hobbit book a week ago and never thought it could be so different. Had high expectations since the big score the film and thought that this movie would end after the battle of 5 armies ... Instead of doing the more detailed scenes like Bilbo 's conversation with Smaug , dark forest, Bilbo walking through the palace Thranduil , Beorn ... '' ''time is spent with fight of the Dwarfs with Smaug , or orcs to attack the elves + lake- town , the dwarfs to stay at lake town ... I do not remember who said when we left the cinema: The Disillusion of Smaug.<br/><br/>Was '' scared '' the dwarfs would kill the dragon, but then it would remind me that if the Bard had 1 black arrow was to shoot him . I do not see me re-watching this movie anytime soon , contrary to the other when I exited the theater and could not wait to see them again. It was cool to see in 3D , sometimes seemed the things were right there :D<br/><br/>Why the 7? Because we already knew it wouldn't be as same as the book, and its thrilling to see, but they went to far in my opinion.<br/><br/>All the best."

","With this review I mainly wished to turn to all the fans of the book that dislike the film - if you just could scale down a bit being so strict about the book and its accordance to the film and give yourselves a favor of enjoying one of the most heartfelt, visually stunning adventure films of all times. If you truly believe in Middlearth, why don't you give it a chance of having more than the given plot lines, more than a certain amount of dogmatic legends... You could kindly let others to tell their story of Middlearth and see it as a widening of your beloved world.<br/><br/>One thing I wanted to talk in particular about, that has provoked so much negativity and so undeservedly - the purely beautiful ""impossible"" love story of elf maiden and dwarf lad... Now tell me, how can it meet such intolerance? Who says these two different ""races"" of the Middlearth couldn't fall in love? It is actually very racist and a very limited opinion, if you think about it. How can you argue the fact that love is between two souls not two races? This love story is so subtle and pure in the film... Like none of the two characters has even given a thought of falling in love, when the purest form of attraction strikes them and they get unexpectedly fascinated by each other widening each others horizons... And knowing what destiny awaits Kili in the third film makes this story line so deeply bittersweet, like this love was never meant to be, but still happened to give him a chance to experience life in all its beauty. It makes me listen the title song ""I see fire"" from Kili's perspective tearing my heart out and giving me deep appreciation of the moment I am living here and now. All these powerful emotions and revelations in me have been reached by this little sideline of the story that so many people find hate-worthy.<br/><br/>As for the 48 frames per second that gets criticized so much I can only say that it is truly breathtaking to participate in. I wish you could just switch off your mind, which is criticizing video games, and let your heart experience an amazing adventure and future of cinema.<br/><br/>And as for the ending, I don't know what people are so shocked and disappointed about. For me the film ended as exciting as it could just to leave me with such sweet longing to know how all the threads of the plot will resolve.<br/><br/>To conclude - love and respect the director, who has given so many years of his life in hard work and all the warmth of bis heart to bring us this overwhelmingly kind and exciting story that makes us realize that thankfully the child is never entirely gone. Respect his vision and creativity, as we all should be thankful to him for the long hours of happiness and deep emotion, that he has given us.<br/><br/>Love, Vita"

","Having read the original book, I went into this film with mixed feelings about Peter Jackson adding characters such as Legolas into the story. However, the changes and additions to the plot worked perfectly and flowed smoothly. Overall, the film had a great pace and really embraced the world of Middle Earth. Like the LOTR trilogy, the second film in this series was much more exciting and fast paced than the first. Smaug was excellent and Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for the role. While I thought the reveal of Sauron was creative and unique, I feel like it could have been saved for the next film. Although there are some minor points in the film that didn't seem to work, I gave the film a 10/10 because it truly brought the viewer into the world of Middle Earth. In addition, making a small children's book into three films is an achievement that few people can accomplish, yet Peter Jackson shows that he is fully capable of such a task. After seeing the film, I am no longer asking myself ""how are they going to spread this story out over three movies?"" but rather, ""how are they going to finish this story in only three movies?"""
"josephkalaivanar","5","5","14","16 December 2013"," The Desolation of Peter Jackson
","Watched it over the weekend in HFR 3D. My mini-review:<br/><br/>But first a note about HFR 3D - simply unreal experience. It was like watching a 3 hour demo of the most expensive 3DTV in a store. The HFR makes everything just pop out the screen. Very video game like. Though I'm not sure if I had an actual 'cinematic' experience. See it to believe for yourself if you can.<br/><br/>My grade: C+<br/><br/>Overly long. I love the Tolkein cinematic world more than most and like spending time in it but this movie was too much of a stretch. Definitely feel that Peter Jackson has lost what it means to tell a compelling story - more in love with his 'precious' CGI tech instead.<br/><br/>The plot ducks between two and half narratives: 1. Journey to Erebor 2. Gandalf's Necromancer quest 3. Love triangle (Kili-Tauriel-Legolas) / Legolas + Tauriel Orc hunt<br/><br/>The love triangle element was tiresome and seems forced. It wasn't compelling - as compared to that between Aragorn and Arwen. Completely unnecessary and distracting. However the Tauriel character was welcome and well portrayed by Evangeline Lilly.<br/><br/>Bilbo's and the dwarfs journey to Erebor was getting tiresome. Also Thorin is not a leader / hero you can root for. His motives seem suspect. Unfortunately the film spends more time on him instead of Bilbo who remains for me, more compelling a character showing most growth.<br/><br/>Gandalf's Necromancer quest to me was more interesting but we already know that the bulk of that is not the meat of this trilogy.<br/><br/>Jackson unnecessarily weaves in and out of these narratives stretching the patience of his audience. He seems more comfortable showcasing the setting of the quests rather than why the quests exist in the first place - and thus not propelling the plot faster.<br/><br/>Smaug - very well done. Cumberbatch's voice-work and the dragon animation were superb.<br/><br/>The movie itself suffers an even worse case of middle-movie syndrome than The Two Towers. At least in that film, the dread was palpable and victory sweet, setting the stage for an even bigger dread. This film on the other hand, failed to do so. It ended with a ""is that all"" kinda feeling. We already know how Smaug will die.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this movie and I did in parts. But overall, it was average at best."
"mdimba","4","5","14","16 December 2013"," I expected much better
","I was looking forward to ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"", but was quite disappointed by the result.<br/><br/>In the beginning the film felt hectic to me, spending too little time on some scenes and jumping right into the next one. Then, as soon as Gandalf and the dwarfes+Bilbo were split, the transitions between the two or three plot lines were rough and were always created as cliff hangers which I found quite annoying. (I don't have a problem with cliff hangers per se, but the frequent crude switches made me nervous and pulled me out of both plot lines).<br/><br/>Apart from the exchange between Bilbo and Smaug, most dialogue was overly lofty and dramatic for my taste. I expect talk of ""evil itself"" and the like from a LotR/Hobbit movie but every once in a while an ordinary, mundane exchange would be nice.<br/><br/>Lastly, the plot: the quest started out fast paced and I thought it was on a good way. But then needless side plots and distractions were integrated. I don't see why this had to be a 2,5h+ movie at all. And the ending is an extreme cliff hanger that could have been resolved within ten minutes. The dragon flies off but with all the foreshadowing we already *know* what is going to happen. Of course there will be more side plots and a huge battle, but still, so much drawing out was unnecessary. Moreover, in Gandalf's plot line almost nothing happens. He goes on a quest to find out about the necromancer that takes a lot of screen time with very little happening. He walks around in several ruins and speaks about ""the darkness spreading"" but that is all. Similarly, the whole evil mayor against Bard plot was basically superfluous. That the dwarfs think only of themselves was clear without being spelled out. And that Bard is the one who will kill the dragon with the black arrow didn't need to be telegraphed for twenty minutes. On the other hand, the addition of Thauriel and some more inside view of the Wood Elf King's motivation is nice. (Although Thauriel's healing scene was way overdoing it with bright, shiny elf-lighting). Lastly, the change of ""the villain Orc"" felt really weird. I can't see a reason why Azog was replaced by another big, evil Orc. I'm sure Azog will now lead the Orc army into the final confrontation and have his big showdown against Thorin, but that could easily have been accomplished without introducing ""generic-big-evil-orc IV"" into the plot.<br/><br/>I did like a lot of the ideas, the special effects, locations and characters were as great as always, but this movie just felt drawn out and histrionic."
"dhattier","5","5","14","16 December 2013"," Why Mess with a perfectly good book that stands on its own.
","As many have stated the CGI and action are OK, though it was very slow at some points. But to constantly change what Tolkien wrote like the botched ending in LOTR is some thing I don't understand. Jackson seems to think he can improve on greatness and all he did was seriously mess it up. If any one really read the book and enjoyed it don't waste your time on this series. You will be disappointed. Personally I didn't see part one in the theatre. After the ending in LOTR was so badly handled, I wasn't going to waste anymore money on Jackson. Then the part one was fairly close to the book and I thought OK maybe he learned something. NOT!!! He has added love interests, Sauron where he doesn't belong, invented whole new characters. re aligned plot etc etc. <br/><br/>The sad part is that those who have not read the books will think that this is what Tolkien intended. And this movie is way far from that. What a waste. It is sad that my first written movie review has to be an attack rather than some thing positive. <br/><br/>Nope wont waste any more money on this guy. Maybe once it hits the redbox at a dollar I will watch the third part but not in the theatre."
"harpreetc","10","5","14","13 December 2013"," Fantastic!!!
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was fantastic. There are no real endings to the movie, but the movie is still fantastic. It moves at a faster pace than its predecessor. It veers off from the book in more places than one. It is over the top at some points. But. It is fantastic. That being said, I must say the script is well written. Tauriel, who I expected much less of, is surprisingly well developed. Evangeline Lilly has done an excellent job. She is an obvious love interest, but she is much more than another Evening Star. Arwen's strength is of a different nature – Tauriel is more elemental. The digression from the book is not a necessity but I am happy to allow this bit of cinematic license only because it is done so well and it doesn't mess with anything cannon. Forgiven. Gandalf is as usual beyond par. The character and Sir Ian McKellen have nothing but praise to accept. We see a glimpse of the power that the wizard sustains in a duel of strength he has to contend with, and though there are evident imitations of the challenge with the Balrog in the Fellowship, this one sustains its energy and interest. I love the additions despite my penchant for being a pedant. The High Fells of Rhudaur and the subsequent journey, the move into Dol Guldur, which ascertains Sauron's identity, is very well managed. None of which we see in the book but which feature as the Appendices in the Lord of the Rings. Well-written. Thranduil, a Silvan elf from the First Age, is wonderfully played by Lee Pace. We see little of him in the first part, but in this one he holds the character with assurance. I am very glad to see that with him Peter Jackson gets the aspect of the size ratios right. He belittles even Legolas, and that's lovely to see. I expect Galadriel to have the same height. Thorin Oakenshield shows his descent into greed well. As does Martin Freeman with Bilbo's dark attachment to the One. Martin is indubitably the star of the movie, easily holding his own against a stalwart like McKellen and, who cannot mention, Smaug the Magnificent. The dragon is the pièce de résistance. The worm you have waited so long to see. The graphics are mind-blowingly good. The live motion capture from the very villainous Benedict Cumberbatch is astounding. Of course, we deviate again from the book when the dwarfs play hide and seek with Smaug the Golden in the halls of Erebor, but that is just to show how lovely the dragon looks on screen. Forgiven. The story moves fast and the movie gets over too soon. Nothing really ends up happening as such, all the story lines have no endings because naturally we have another part to go through. But I am sure that we shall be seeing the return of the White Council members, Galadriel, Elrond, Radagast, (don't know if they will be showing Gil-Galad or Glorfindel) to fight at Dol Guldur and the Battle of the Five Armies will culminate the movie surely. My favourite scenes? Bilbo climbing through the canopy of trees in Mirkwood and scaring off blue butterflies. Gandalf's duel with Sauron. Thranduil speaking with Thorin. The escape in the barrels to the River Running. Smaug, Smaug, Smaug. I for one thoroughly enjoyed this fare. Shall be seeing it several times more, I am sure, because, have I mentioned this? It is fantastic."
"cathrinevo14","8","5","14","12 December 2013"," Good quality-whaaat
","Firstly I want to say, I am an enormously fan of Tolkien and his books, and all the films too. I know everyone think the first movie was a little boring and less interesting than what was about to come in the second and third. What I think is, the first movie was excellent.<br/><br/>When I saw the Desolation of Smaug I don't know how I felt afterwards, the watching experience was not as I expected. I know there's been talking about Peter Jackson's picture resolution and HD quality but I didn't quite enjoy the experience. The scenes looked weird and disturbed and badly executed. The acting felt weird, and the mood of the previous films was totally missing. The music was way too dramatic, and it didn't match, as I would have wanted it to, with the scenes and happenings. I don't know if it was my bad luck, but it kind of ruined the experience. I think I'll go see it in 2D, and maybe then it'll get better. <br/><br/>That said, I really liked the film, I thought it was thrilling and exciting, I especially want to praise the scene where Bilbo enters the mountain and have a chat with Smaug. That was my favorite part of the movie, Smaug was insanely good made, and I just loved that part."

From the perspective of having never read the book I can honestly say it was incredible! I love that it has the ability to bring out so many different emotions. There were moments where I couldn't stop laughing, moments where I felt heartbreak, and moments where I was overcome with joy. The previews made this film out to be much darker than the first, but I found there to be plenty of upbeat scenes. Wonderful graphics. Great LOTR references! It was perfect!

","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Like 'An Unexpected Journey' is's a flabby film that doesn't care a great deal about character. It#'s very pretty (especially Evangelne Lilly), but crow barring so much Middle Earth canon from other tales and, less forgivably, made up toss that is so alien to Tolkien as to be laughable, makes for a leaden and sloppy narrative, whose only concession to pace seems to be having a CGI action sequence crammed in every twenty minutes to keep the audience awake. Cumberbatch's serpentine voice-work as Smaug is the only redeeming feature. They say every good film has a beginning, a middle and an end. This is ALL middle."
"CinematicInceptions","7","3","7","8 September 2014"," Excellent action and story. Lovers of the original, prepare to be surprised.
","I liked the first movie of the trilogy better than this one, but the second film surpassed the first one in some areas. The trilogy so far has raised some controversy as to its differences to the original story. I like the book as well as the two movies, and I am looking forward to the third one. Personally, I don't really prefer one over the other, but before I get too much further into my review, I want to just give a couple of other points of view on the matter. Firstly, that the movie company's primary job is to make money, sad as that may be. Therefore, its best marketing tool is to attract fans that aren't necessarily fans of the book. To be perfectly honest, Tolkien's literary style and story structure doesn't fully appeal to modern audiences, so the filmmakers modernized it slightly. Secondly, the filmmakers have a difficult task in making three movies out of one book. This requires them to add a few action scenes to keep the plot going. Thirdly, they might have wanted to put a slightly different take on the story. After all, the old Bilbo says at the beginning of the first movie that he did not tell Frodo everything. Perhaps the added bits are things that the secrets that Bilbo wanted to hide for whatever reason. Now onto the real review, for anyone who I haven't lost already. For me, this movie is tied for the best display of CGI with Avatar. Smaug is absolutely spectacular and the choreography of the elves fighting is beautiful. Honestly, watching Legolas take out orcs along the forest river was some of the best action I have seen in any movie. I was slightly let down by the score of Howard Shore since I've come to love his triumphant scores from the other four middle earth films. I don't really blame him in this case, though, because a triumphant film score wouldn't really fit the mood here. Some of the music is still good though. Moving on to the story, I do agree that there were a few points that were lacking. The introduction of Beorn was not executed as well as it could have been. I felt like they made him a little to dangerous, when he is really a pretty nice guy in the story. I thought the master of Lake Town got a slightly inflated role, but maybe it's setting something up for the third movie. My biggest problem in terms of deviation from the story is the reduced importance of the spider battle. It works out fine with the transition into capture by the elves and the action is good, but I felt like that was a very pivotal point for Bilbo's leadership role among the company in the book. The elves saving the dwarfs rather than Bilbo kind of reduces the respect that they owe him. I know that the added character of Tauriel is another point of controversy. I thought it was a little unnecessary for four dwarfs to remain in Lake Town just to compensate for her role, although the battle there is pretty good. It also opens up room for more error in getting Fili, Kili, Oin, and Bofur joining the others later. I'm guessing Fili is going to have to choose between Tauriel and the company and it's going to break everybody's heart when they die side by side in the climatic battle (that's all just a guess by the way). That's the end of the low points. On the upside, I liked how Gandalf's lost adventure was finally told. Some people might say that it was just to make the film longer, but I had been very curious as to what happened there. It seemed a little dumb in the story for Gandalf to just leave the company without a good explanation. The early introduction of Bard was okay with me because it might have been a little odd for him to just show up in the third one and (SPOILER ALERT) kill Smaug. He's a pretty good character besides and gives a good argument against the greedy persuasion of Thorin. This greed makes Thorin a good subtle antagonist later on. He quite blatantly uses Bilbo to do something he knows he can't bring himself to do. The courage Bilbo shows in his encounter with Smaug is very inspiring and impressive, though not as dramatic as his heroism in the first film. The fact that he is even able to look at Smaug shows a pretty fair amount of courage. An unexpected surprise for me was the dragon chase scenes at the end. The nine dwarfs and Bilbo make a pretty solid effort to kill Smaug. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the majesty of Erebor. I had always kind of imagined it as a series of dull caves within the mountain, neglecting the fact that it used to be a grand city. The treasure room of Thrain is also quite breathtaking. My last surprise was the sudden ending. I had anticipated the movie to end with the death of Smaug by Bard so I was slightly shocked by the cliff-hanger ending. In conclusion, I give it 8.8/10 and recommend it to people who like fantasy action and a tense story (in the sense of the duplicity between the dwarfs, Thranduil, and the Lake Men which will no doubt come to a head in the final film). To avid fans of the book, I would say, try to have an open mind to the added stuff and remember that you can always watch the 1970's cartoon version."

","How can anyone give this masterpiece low votes. Its a good thing Jackson changed the story a Little. All you low voters do not watch the third and final part, I dare you. Are you not entertained. Whats wrong with you. All in all, Desolation of Smaug is a greatly welcomed installment to the series, and it's a great improvement over the first movie. It's more-so like An Unexpected Journey was actually just building up to the events of this film. This movie capitalizes on a lot of what it's got; the characters and action are spectacular, while the overall scope and tone are going in the right direction.

"tardisbond1250","10","3","7","7 January 2014"," The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug
","Okay part 2 of Peter Jackon's second Middle-Earth trilogy. So The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug continues the story of Bilbo Baggins who joins a company of thirteen dwarfs in order to reclaim their homeland from Smaug the terrible. Okay, so how was The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug? AMAZING! I could not believe the sheer amount of impact this film had given me when I walked out of the cinema. I have seen the film twice now, and I can safely say that I was very impressed. Having read the book, the filmmakers have split this film appropriately. I think that The Desolation of Smaug was probably the trickiest of the 3 to make because there's no beginning or end, it's the middle of a trilogy which is one story. From beginning to end this film really keeps you interested. The pace is surprisingly brisk for a film that is 2hrs 41min and only covers about 6 or 7 chapters of 1 book. Also the added material that isn't in the book really gives the story more detail and also ties into The Lord of the Rings. Also The Desolation of Smaug has a lot more action than An Unexpected Journey. I loved the spiders scene, that was just tense. What impressed me about that scene was Bilbo(Martin Freeman) and how he realises just what the ring can do. It gave me chills. Also the barrels scene is extremely exciting accompanied by Howard Shore's brilliant score. I laughed when Bombur's barrel knocks around on the land and he starts spinning around fighting the Orcs. The sets are gorgeous and I love the visual style of the film. Also Orlando Bloom returns as Legolas which makes sense because his father is Thranduil who is the elven king during the time line of The Hobbit and it also adds a lot of nostalgia for The Lord of the Rings fans. And Legolas contributes heavily in a lot of the action sequences in the film. Also we have some new characters. The main one is Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lily. Who does a good job with what she has to do here. It seems she is just shoehorned in as a love interest for Kili. However, the love story is handled well enough and doesn't come across as forced.Also Luke Evans plays Bard who is good also and Stephen Fry plays the Master of Lake-Town and he is far to brief in my opinion. Another brief character is Beorn who had a much more longer section in the book, I hope the extended edition adds more of Beorn. The highlights of the film are definitely the scenes with Smaug, played brilliantly by Benedict Cumberbatch. The scenes are really tense and Smaug's voice is really booming. Smaug could quite possibly be one of the best villains of movie history. The climax goes on a bit, but that's good in my opinion because it cannot just be a 2 minute throw down, it needs to be big and spectacular which it is. And the very last scene is tense with Smaug's lines and him flying towards Lake-Town and by the time the credits appear, I think everyone, or most people, wanted to see more. Also Ed Sheeran's song ""I See Fire"", is very good and fits well with the film. Overall, I loved The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug it was incredible. My favourite film of 2013. The acting was fabulous, the action was spectacular.Howard Shore's musical score was phenomenal. The visuals were fantastic. Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug killed it. It was better than The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey. The pace is extremely brisk which is impressive considering the length of the film. A film that I will remember for many years to come. I am very much looking forward to The Hobbit:There and Back Again and I will be stunned if Peter Jackson and co can top this. Bring on There and Back Again! :)<br/><br/>The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug-10/10 :D AMAZING piece of film!"
"the_only_warrior","5","3","7","4 January 2014"," Pretty, but not a good movie
","I haven't read the Hobbit in about ten years at least, so I'm a bit hazy on what is in the book and what isn't.<br/><br/>That said, once again, the second movie is way too serious for the Hobbit, which is a kid's book. The first movie, an Unexpected Journey, grappled with tone, not quite deciding whether it was serious or light-hearted, while the second movie has decided that it is more of a drama.<br/><br/>That said, the story is really slow. There are lots of side-elements to the actual quest which are distracting and pointless. Why are the orcs so hell-bent on chasing the dwarfs for instance? None of the characters are really sympathetic or have any kind of back-story that makes you care about them. Thorin in particular is like an Aragorn without a heart.<br/><br/>The movie contradicts a lot of the Lord of the Rings films by including detail that doesn't really fit into the second film - a lot like the problems that the Star Wars prequels do as well.<br/><br/>I actually fell asleep at one point where they were in a town trying to find some supplies for way too long. Gandalf's story feels very irrelevant - I wonder if it will go anywhere in the final movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, I only feel it has such a high rating because it bears the title ""The Hobbit"".

","When Jackson adventured making ""The Hobbit"" a film in three parts, I thought it was doomed to be overkill. It was actually, in contrast to The lord of the Rings, a mere children's fairytale. But I am overwhelmed: Jackson has achieved to lift ""The Hobbit"" to almost rival The Lord of the Rings in grandeur, drama and epic storytelling, much more than even Tolkien had imagined, I think, when he wrote it. The deep and weighty matters of the world are understated, but lurks under the surface. The desolation of Smaug is a breathtaking journey. Starting with the meeting with the mysterious Beorn, the clamp and misty Mirkwood, the meeting with the strange and hostile wood-elves and the incredible hunt of the hobbits in barrels on the the wild river. Jacksons adding of a little love story between an elf and a dwarf is a little masterpiece, and adds only to stress Tolkiens points in the overall theme of middle-earth. The nearly Dickensy description of Lake-town urges for a deeper investigation. And in the end, the grandiose meeting with Smaug, with all the layers of Tolkiens description of the little hobbit's meeting with the great cunning dragon. Every scene is a masterpiece in itself. The only minus: The scene of the dragon pursuing the dwarfs in Eriador is far too long! I hope very much, that Peter Jackson has prepared a spectacular film number three, which will wind up all the threads from the six films, and make this an epic masterpiece to stand out in film history. <br/><br/>.

","This may be actually the first time that I'll complain of an adaptation (of a book that I love) being unnecessarily prolonged. Seriously, a trilogy??? Of one little book?! While the first installment was enjoyable though in a juvenile way, it becomes apparent in Desolation of Smaug the fillers that Peter Jackson has to add just to make the main plot last all the way to the third installment. And that irks me. It really does. It would have been kick-ass if it was a two-part adaptation, but a trilogy it never should have been. <br/><br/>Despite my issues, I didn't regret seeing it (you should too, if only by principle) and I would still watch the last installment.

","It rarely happens that you return back to a franchise and you are as mesmerised by it as you were the first time around, achieving that feat 5th time in a row is outstanding in itself, and Peter Jackson does it with such ease and charm that one is left breathless. The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, is one extravagant adventure that is a treat for your eyes. The camera catches every scene every piece of action and adventure as it its happening right in front of our eyes. The sheer epicness of this can be can be seen in the chase and fight sequences, but if you are watching closely, you will find the same epicness in the scenes where Jackson introduces the landscapes to us or creates these imaginary worlds. Jackson introduces new characters and they do justice to the part they are to play. All the known and little known characters are given enough screen time for us to not forget them. This movie might be just a fragment of a novel but the way Jackson tells the tale is mesmerizing. It is story telling at its very best. This movie is one of the best examples of a well oiled machine, the actors play their part well, the story holds you and the scale at which the movie unfolds is simply breath-taking. Special mention goes to Andrew Lesnie for catching this movie in the true essence of the world it belongs to. The CGI in the movie are also at par with any of the LOTR movies if not better, check out the scenes with smaug and you will realise we have come a long way. The movie eventually belongs to its director, he seems to be possessed with this world and that should explain him doing justice to it every single time he takes up this project. This goes without telling that like all other movies in this franchise, this one too runs long, but it's captivating enough to keep you glued to your seats and with all the new story lines unfolding in this instalment I can't wait for the next instalment to hit the theatres."

","Well, let me first state that I am a huge fan of the book and I think the first Hobbit stays true to the book. Though it lacks a little and is not as good as LOTR, it is still a great film. The second Hobbit is even better in my opinion. Jackson is brilliant again! The acting is superb. I love Martin Freeman as Bilbo. He also brings humor to the movie. Ian Mckellen is brilliant as usual. Orlando Bloom gives a strong performance as well. The last scene with Smaug was a cliff hanger ending. I think that this film is better then the Two Towers. Overall great film definitely check it out!<br/><br/>9/10"
"griffolyon12","8","3","7","16 December 2013"," A Step Down for the Franchise
","Sometimes you really want to love a movie, and when you wind up only liking it, it's more painful than if you just flat out hated it. That's how I am with this second installment of The Hobbit trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug. I wanted to love this film so much, because I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the first part of The Hobbit, An Unexpected Journey, but The Desolation of Smaug is further proving that perhaps Peter Jackson should have just made The Hobbit one long three-and-a-half hour movie, rather than three separate three hour films.<br/><br/>In this installment, we catch back up with Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs, still pursued by a pack of orcs as they try to reach the Lonely Mountain and take back the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the vile dragon, Smaug. Of course, as is par for the course, nothing goes according to plan and our heroes must face many trials and tribulations before they actually get there.<br/><br/>The biggest difference between The Desolation of Smaug and An Unexpected Journey is that this film just isn't as much fun as its predecessor. An Unexpected Journey was a lighthearted adventure film that perhaps played to a far younger crowd than most die-hard Tolkien addicts would have wanted, but it is what made that film both different from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and also an enjoyable adventure film in its own right. <br/><br/>This time around, most of the humor is gone and there is a serious lack of emotional beats, which was one thing An Unexpected Journey had in ample supply. A large part of this is because the events that are adapted here are purely action beats that have been dragged out in every possible way, adding in characters that never existed before, while also expanding upon characters who perhaps didn't need as much screen-time as they've gotten. Personally, I loved seeing Legolas again, as portrayed by Orlando Bloom, and I rather took a liking to his elf love interest, Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lily, but these characters were not necessary for this film, the same goes for the extremely broadened role for Bard the bowman. All of these new characters take the focus off of Bilbo far too often. <br/><br/>Unlike The Lord of the Rings trilogy where these films were really ensemble films, featuring multiple character arcs, The Hobbit has always been purely about Bilbo Baggins and his going from a mild-mannered hobbit, to a great hero. We kind of already saw that arc play out in its entirety in the first film of this trilogy, so now there is very little room for Bilbo to continue growing, and therefore I guess that's the reason that there is so much more focus on everyone else, but this is still supposed to be Bilbo's story, right? Then why do we spend so much time fleshing out all these other characters and not showing how these events that Bilbo is experiencing are affecting him? Without any moments for Bilbo that really test him emotionally in this film, I never felt tested emotionally by what I was seeing, and it saddens me, because the emotions of all the previous Middle Earth films have always been so potent, to see a film set in that world that isn't as emotionally potent is just heartwrenching. Even still, this makes me sound like I hated The Desolation of Smaug, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.<br/><br/>What I've been speaking mostly with is disappointment, but there are elements of The Desolation of Smaug that delivered, in particular the action sequences. The spiders of Mirkwood are creepy and realized beautifully, the same goes for the titular dragon Smaug, but perhaps the most awesome sequence of the film is when the dwarfs escape the woodland elves by jumping inside wine barrels floating down a river, all while fighting off orcs. Then there are the new and expanded characters that manage to at least create a nice diversion, even if they are not essential and might have been better served being relegated to an Extended Editon Blu Ray. I for one enjoyed Tauriel and her story arc, and I really enjoyed seeing this odd romance that she develops with the dwarf Kili. As well, I found Bard the bowman a welcome addition that, while does not replace the gaping hole that is Aragorn, it at least gives you a human hero to root for.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you have loved every film set within Middle Earth up to this point, you will find enough in The Desolation of Smaug to enjoy, and hey, you might even love it, but this outing just left me disappointed. I think the truth of the matter is, is that Peter Jackson and company just spread this small children's book out too thin and have already resolved majority of the primary story and character arcs, therefore there is nowhere to go other than to introduce new characters that draw away focus from our main heroes, while barreling forward with action. Plus, am I the only one that was underwhelmed by the special effects and Howard Shore's music this go around? The effects often looked very rushed and unpolished, which is very unlike Peter Jackson and WETA, and Howard Shore's score completely ignored the awesomely memorable main theme he wrote for the last film centered around, ""The Song of the Lonely Mountain,"" which is also very unlike him. Here is hoping they step up their game in order to make next year's final installment in the trilogy, There and Back Again, the film that rights the ship.<br/><br/>I give The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug an 8 out of 10!"

","REVIEW WRITTEN BY HAMZA POONAWALA http://www.yusufpoonawala.com/movie/desolation-of-smaug/<br/><br/>The Hobbit is back with a bang with Then Desolation of Smaug. One would assume, that the dwarfs reach Erebor, slay the dragon, and claim their homeland! Well we'll find out shan't we.....<br/><br/>Bilbo Baggins, the young well mannered hobbit (which he's not any more....Just kidding) is drawing closer to the mountain day by day but, his journey is not over yet. He'll have to go through Mirkwood forest which is a perilous task across the lake and through Lake town, find the secret passage which is a problematic task and finally slay Smaug the Dragon, which is dicey.<br/><br/>But as the dwarfs are moving, so is evil. Gandalf the Grey goes to the Nine Tombs and discovers that the evil dead spirits have been summoned by, our fellow Necromancer. But who is he, someone from the past or someone else? <br/><br/>The action is mind blowing. I love the last scene of the battle with Smaug with fires everywhere, resulting in molten Gold! The fight between the elves and the spiders, read GIANT SPIDERS, in Mirkwood and the chase of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) along the river are amazing.<br/><br/>The 3D was legendary. The scene I loved most was when Smaug took the gold off him. It looked like gold raining from the sky. Just breath taking. I strongly recommend you to see this film.<br/><br/>See you for the last time in Middle Earth..<br/><br/>The Y Factor Review by YusuF: All LOTR fans, rejoice cos we have Peter Jackson back once again to transport us to the land called Middle Earth.....<br/><br/>Continuing with his new HFR (High Frame Resolution) technology, of shooting the film in 48 frames per second, Jackson along with his writers adds a lot of his own matter in this film. Whilst The Hobbit did stick a lot to the book, this instalment has Jackson introducing characters such as Legolas, who were never a part of the original story, to bring in more twist and pace in the tale. For it is the chase of the Dwarfs and Orcs on the river by Legolas, the son of King Thranduil (Lee Pace), that takes the film way above the standard set pieces offered in some other such flicks (and even in this one too). The river chase is by far the best action sequence of late, highlighted by 3D, especially in IMAX!<br/><br/>Benedcit Cumberbatch, as the evil voice of Smaug, is simply brilliant. Again a brilliance of CGI and motion capture by Jackson.<br/><br/>Don't jump off the cliffhanger of a climax!<br/><br/>Does it have The Y Factor : YES<br/><br/>Rating : 4/5"
"wolfe-andrew","8","3","7","14 December 2013"," The Meat and Potatoes of the Hobbit Story
","The Hobbit is my favorite book in the world, and I am not tolerant of anything in this movie trilogy that distorts the original story. Hence, I was not extremely tolerant of part of the 1st movie. However, I believe this movie got it right. <br/><br/>Is it as good as any of the 3 original movies? No. But you can't expect it to be when you know: 1. Bilbo, Gandalf, Legolas, and Gloin survive 2. Bilbo keeps the ring 3. Sauron doesn't die, though he might get vanished as the necromancer 4. Smaug dies (it's implied)<br/><br/>And you know all of this by the first 3 movies. And with any book-turned-movie, it adds complication to create a quality film because the audience already knows the plot from the books, at least if they follow the storyline, like they should. Instead, they need increased emphasis on character development, acting, and special effects. And those are the reasons why I came back from the movie satisfied.<br/><br/>The magical parts of Mirkwood, the elven halls, and the halls of Erebor were visually described wonderfully, as well as the darkness and mystery of Dol Goldur, which actually wasn't in the Hobbit, but in the Silmarillion. <br/><br/>There was vulnerability shown in this movie: Kili getting poisoned by a morgul arrow (which I believe never happened in the book), Thorin's mental struggle, and Gandalf's choice which spelled doom in all scenarios. <br/><br/>And perhaps what made the first 3 so famous, is the wonder and creation of an unimaginable, magical realm, which cast a medieval look upon it's culture and landscape. The halls under the mountain convinced me fully that they were made by a Dwarf race that has perfected it's art for millenniums. The lake-town was constructed masterfully as a fallen people, surviving off the limited resources. The Elven halls of the woodland wove elegance with nature. <br/><br/>My thought would be a reminder that this whole story is about the development of Bilbo as both a person, and as an idea of the Hobbit in the minds of others as a valuable resource. You will find yourself rooting for him the whole length of the way, emotional invested into his sake, which shows Peter Jackson and the crew did their job."
"stevendbeard","8","3","7","13 December 2013"," Good Action-Packed Sequel-Better than the First
","I saw ""The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug"", starring Ian McKellen- Magneto in the X-Men movies, Last Action Hero; Martin Freeman-The World's End, Hot Fuzz; Richard Armitage-Captain America:The First Avenger, MI5-t.v.; Evangeline Lilly-Real Steel, Lost-t.v.; Orlando Bloom-The Three Musketeers-2011, Black Hawk Down and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch-Star Trek Into Darkness, The Other Boleyn Girl.<br/><br/>This is the second of the Hobbit trilogy, which is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings films, which are all based on the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Peter Jackson is the director. The title, 'Desolation of Smaug', refers to where Smaug-the Dragon-lives and the wastelands surrounding his home. Ian-Gandalf-leads Martin-Bilbo-and the 13 dwarfs on the quest to get the fallen kingdom of the dwarfs back from Benedict-the Dragon/Necromancer. FYI: Benedict does the voices of the Dragon and Necromancer, but they are two separate characters. Richard- Thorin-is the dwarf leader. Along their journey they cross paths with some Elfs, including Orlando-Legolas-and a new character, Evangeline- Tauriel. And when I say a new character, I mean she was written specifically for the movie and was not in the books. Evangeline is pretty bad-ass in her role, too; she has quite a few good fight scenes. Martin is a little more heroic here, too. He does get to put his new found ring to good use. In general, this movie is better than the first part, which I did like, but it was a little slow. This one is more action-packed. My only problem is the abrupt ending. It reminded me of the same thing they did in 'The Hunger Games:Catching Fire', a few weeks ago. It just stops in mid action, which is supposed to set you up for the next installment. It is rated ""PG-13"" for violence and some frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 41 minutes. It was better than part 1 and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"ersinkdotcom","3","5","15","16 December 2013"," Another Overlong and Tedious Journey
","I really wanted to have a good experience going into ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. "" Ten minutes in, I realized it would not be the entry in the series that would change my opinion of the long-winded and over-stuffed franchise. It's more of the same sweeping scenes of walking, overlong action sequences, and bouts of mind-numbing dialogue that only a literature major or studied fanboy or girl could understand or even care about. <br/><br/>Bilbo Baggins and a band of dwarfs follow the wizard Gandalf on a journey to reclaim a great kingdom conquered by a dragon. Not only has the dragon stolen their homeland, but he also greedily guards the dwarfs' treasures of gold and a mystical jewel. Orcs and elves try to stop the group every step of the way. <br/><br/>Let me be the first to scream a couple of things from the mountain top and say what everyone else is too afraid to. First off, Peter Jackson is a liar. ""There is no desolation by Smaug in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."" If you count him banging around and destroying the Lonely Mountain as desolation, I guess you could excuse the title away. I would consider that to be grasping at straws, however.<br/><br/>Secondly, would somebody PLEASE stop Jackson from being allowed in the editing room when these movies are being trimmed and tightened up. It's very evident that Editor Jabez Olssen is working with a metaphorical gun to his head when working on both ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ANYONE in their right mind knows there's at least 30 to 45 minutes of completely useless footage that could be chopped out of any of the films. Jackson should direct the movies and then all the footage needs to be taken away from him. He shouldn't be allowed to touch them after that.<br/><br/>Jackson overdoes everything in ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."" He's one of those directors that takes a good thing and runs it into the ground. He's the wife or mother whose family tells her they love her pasta, so she makes it for them every day from then on.<br/><br/>He knows we want to see Smaug. However, we don't necessarily want to watch him sneering and leering at Bilbo and the dwarfs for fifty minutes.<br/><br/>This is the fifth film in ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" franchise. We get it. New Zealand is beautiful. You don't have to keep beating us over the head with long stretches of footage of people walking through the country over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Here are the few things I can say positive about ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug."" The special effects, for the most part, look great. However, they do devolve horribly in a scene where a gold statue is melting.<br/><br/>Any sequences featuring the Necromancer are awesome. Interestingly, I was told that those scenes aren't even in the book.<br/><br/>The first time you see Smaug is very impressive as well. Unfortunately, the novelty wears off after the first five minutes pass. Suddenly, you realize that the sequence with the dragon talking to Bilbo is going to be as tedious as the one in ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" where they quiz each for twenty minutes.<br/><br/>There's nothing new to say about ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" that I haven't already covered in the past. It's long. It's tedious. There's a smothered hope that somewhere amongst the two hours and fifty minutes you invest is a good movie. ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies are both sources of frustration. Never have I been so ready for a film to be over, yet utterly frustrated by the way it ends. The ""desolation"" in the new movie's title doesn't even happen. I really hate these movies! Why do I keep going to see them?!?!?"
"Patruso-Steiner","8","5","15","12 December 2013"," A movie for the Jackson-eye and the Tolkien-heart (and a bit too much of some things)
","The Tolkien Moments<br/><br/>I hope the divide of fans will calm down after a while because I think all of us can find a lot of pure Tolkien in this and I still do not dare think what this whole franchise might have become with another creative team.<br/><br/>But back to the Tolkien moments... I think Beorn, the atmosphere of Mirkwood (the editing and cinematography here is first class), Thranduil's Halls and Laketown should be scenes that even the most ardent critic of these movies and what they did to the novel might occasionally watch on Youtube for decades to come. They simply have the handwriting of the great Professor all over them - as to many characters such as our Hobbit, Thranduil or the Master. Others might be different to the novel but will feel very Tolkienesque too most I am sure - such as Thorin or Bard.<br/><br/>What always works very well to let the Middle-earth spirit come alive are historical references. Girion references and flashbacks, the dead dwarfs in front of the sealed gate, hints at Fili and Kili's mother, ruins of a greater city within the structures of Laketown etc. However, we do not get the time anymore to actually look at locations long enough to take in their feeling to full extent. Sometimes it is quite harsh how we are thrown into a new surrounding.<br/><br/>The biggest Tolkien moment - and it is telling that it is yet again a scene some critics call ""too slow"" is the conversation between Smaug and Bilbo. Pure joy. Pure Tolkien. Well done.<br/><br/>Smaug<br/><br/>I have come to terms with him not dying in DoS. Although I predicted it long ago, I slightly changed my mind when I realized there wasn't a major Dol Guldur climax in this movie. I could not really see them go for the most massive cliffhanger imaginable. But they did - and it works.<br/><br/>And I am sure TABA will benefit from it, having Smaug's demise and what happens after it (IMHO the single MOST important story aspect of the novel) in ONE movie.<br/><br/>Smaug is simply what he needed to be and thanks to Crumberbatch even a little bit more. He could have broken the whole trilogy. He works and that is an achievement that would make other franchises with less expectations from different sites loaded on them a critics' favorite instantly.<br/><br/>Tauriel, Legolas and ""the other man""<br/><br/>Tauriel just works. If there is a character we did not need, it is Legolas, not Tauriel. She is the perfect opponent for Thranduil, especially from the political point of view that will become SO essential in TABA. I am actually convinced that she is an improvement.<br/><br/>And what also works is her relationship with Kili. Both actors bring a very natural feel to it... everybody knows it will never be possible. But it is not so much about actually going for a relationship and making little Taurilis. It is about the curiosity those two show for another race that their people has become so estranged to.<br/><br/>Unfortunately PJ and Co gave the opponents of the whole idea some reason to complain with some (not much, but it is there) bad dialog. I wished they had been more aware here of how hard this scenes will be to take for some and not make it harder by Kili's horrible one-liner about his pants.<br/><br/>Gandalf<br/><br/>His fight against Sauron was the absolute highlight for me. The way Sauron's form turns into the pupil of the Eye is one of the best scenes in all Middle-earth movies.<br/><br/>The High Fells scene feels a bit out of place without the Nazgul actually showing up... I hope they will have something good to do in TABA.<br/><br/>CGI<br/><br/>I watched the movie in HFR 3D - it was such a joy. Scenes like Bolg and Azog interacting left me totally immersed, I only realized after it was over that this had been two CGI characters talking. Also moments such as the Necromancer is first class, as is, of course and already mentioned, Smaug.<br/><br/>Issues<br/><br/>As I said, despite mostly great written dialog there are the occasional missteps. Also, the stand between Smaug and the dwarfs is too long and undermined the otherwise outstanding CGI in this movie.<br/><br/>PJ was more harsh with himself in terms of editing - but not always harsh enough. Especially the last minutes of the Smaug confrontation could have been trimmed and would have made for a more perfect climax. No gold statue, much shorter Legolas vs. Bolg fight, last 30-60 seconds of almost each action sequence trimmed.<br/><br/>Moments of glory<br/><br/><ul><li>Bree and PJ cameo - Beorn's shape-shifting - Laketown introduction - Gandalf vs. Sauron - Bard reciting the prophecy and the rumors spreading in Esgaroth - Tauriel healing Kili - Smaug shaking the gold of himself and leaving Erebor - the Laketowners seeing the fire ""inside the mountain""</li></ul><br/><br/>Cringeworthy moments<br/><br/><ul><li>I could have anything in my trousers. - Legolas' stupid looks - Thorin surfing a river of gold - the statue</li></ul><br/><br/>Verdict: This movie goes farer away from Tolkien than anything we have seen from Jackson so far, yet it nails the Tolkien feeling very often. The Tolkien moments are almost all there and work perfectly, while smart additions make the story more urgent, more adult and ultimately more human. The best vistas of this movie year (together with those of Gravity) and some very good screen writing cannot fully overplay the long running time with an overdone ending. It is a very good adaptation that fails to be a masterpiece of a movie b"

From the first frame to the last, the movie is a thrilling achievement of Peter's. The action is none like we've seen in any middle-earth installment. The visual effects are much improved, the pace is seamless, and the danger is ever more present.

"whistler118","9","4","11","17 December 2013"," A fantastic film which captures the real essence of Tolkien's world!
","The Desolation of Smaug can be seen as a new high for both Peter Jackson and the Middle Earth Saga. From beginning to end this film entertains and immerses you into Tolkein's and Jackson's world. From the actors to jaw dropping environments that the band travel through this film is very well delivered. Having said this, there are times that the director's artistic design does leave you questioning the decision making, of which chief of these is the over use of CGI. <br/><br/>The use of CGI in the film may be my only negative point from the new Hobbit films. Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, almost every aspect of film has been touched upon by the rendering teams. This is most obvious during the numerous fight scenes where over emphasised movements are replaced by a CGI model. I feel that this will not only cause the films to age quickly but it throws the audience out from their immersed state as they recognise the unnatural movements and graphics of characters. <br/><br/>Despite this, Jackson has hit a near perfect note. The second part seems to be more mature and refined that the first in almost every way. For example, the 3D never took away from the overall production like it did at times for the first. <br/><br/>For many people, they will be drawn to this from the book. Of which I must defend the director rather than the hardcore Middle Earth enthusiasts. There are 'new' parts to the film which Jackson has added himself that the book does not cover. As we know, legolas' return was a surprise to many, but in no way does it take away from the overall feel. Jackson has done a very good job to build upon the short remarks and comments that Tolkien only mentions in passing and this not only adds to the film but arguably the story of the Hobbit.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is bounds ahead of its predecessor in terms of design and production. The added story lines only adds to the narrative and the cinematography is consistent with our expectations of a Peter Jackson production. Whilst disappointed with the over indulgence in computer graphics I would still highly recommend this film in either mode, although the 3D does have some truly spectacular moments which should not be missed. I give this a 8.5 - 9 as Jackson has excelled himself with his latest release."
"RevRonster","10","4","11","16 December 2013"," Always a pleasure to return to Middle-earth!
","I can't get enough Middle-earth.<br/><br/>I don't nitpick the films because Peter Jackson decided to make it a trilogy or about what frame rate it was filmed in or that they pulled elements from the appendices for the stories—I ignore all of that and just look for something that feels authentic to the Tolkien-created universeand Peter Jackson is the man for that!<br/><br/>I really felt this was a step above ""An Unexpected Journey,"" and I absolutely LOVED the opening film in this series. The story picks up like the last one never stopped for a credit break and what follows is a story that flowed so smoothly that I was sucked in and the time flew by. The pages of the book came to life with humor, drama and unbelievable action. Once again, the visuals look amazing, the special effects are great, the sets and costumes look how you imagine this fantasy world to be and, most of all, Smaug is a wonder to see! <br/><br/>The dragon's special effects are incredible and, more importantly, Benedict Cumberbatch proved to be the perfect man to give the creature life; his voice was chilling and command the authority that you would imagine a dragon to command. I admit I'm biased because I love Middle-earth and Tolkien's stories endlessly but what Jackson and his crew made honors the author and his world to no end. This film was so much better than my already high expectations set for it that my anticipation levels for the final film are hitting critical massand I'm okay with that! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some second breakfast that is calling my name! Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching. You can read a more in-depth review of this film (and others) at revronmovies.blogspot.com."
"abouhelier-r","9","4","11","15 December 2013"," The Hobbit: The Review of Smaug
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug has been released on December 11th i-e four days ago, and it's already made up to more than $65 mil and on its way to $254 mil total. I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, and I was pretty excited to watch this next episode of the saga. I wasn't disappointed. I read Tolkien's books and let me tell you that Peter Jackson did pretty well so far. He knew how to focus on characters emotions and personalities with a full of actions as visual. Plus, it's interesting to see the evolution of those characters throughout the two first films, actors tried to wide their characters as tight as they can under their tragic forms. It's good to see them be careful of what they deliver. Obviously, we met for the first time Smaug. Who I think is the key character as we saw him briefly in the first film and imagined him since then, mostly through the story telling. Stories promise us an enormous dragon, much bigger than anything we could ever imagined. In this case, scale is very important as he is not just a dragon but a real threat. Therefore, Peter Jackson has done a brilliant job embodying Smaug with the Bafta winning actor Benedict Cumberbatch's voice. I have to admit that his voice is not easily recognizable but it fits well. I guess it should have been a massive challenge for the production to create a speaking character where the most dominant thing is his personality. In fact, Smaug appeared to be a total psychopath and in one way his physical appearance is really important but on the other way people will more remembered his voice, personality, how he behaved and how he moved and talk than how many teeth he has. The Hobbit is efficient and the special effects are beautifully orchestrated. The director know where he is heading to, as well as his very talented actors. I highly recommend this film and all Jackson's adaptations of Tolkiens' work. Now we just have to wait for the third film were I hope the establishment of the first two films are gonna be played out, especially characters stories and how their relationships between each others end up. Plus, the Five army Battle promises to be epic!"
"zkonedog","9","2","4","4 March 2017"," Complete Fantasy Immersion
","""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" is a two hour and forty minute movie. When the closing credits rolled, however, this was my first thought: ""Bring on Part Three!"". Once again, director Peter Jackson managed to completely immerse me in the fantasy realm of the LOTR universe.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie picks up right where the first one leaves off. Fresh out of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Dwarf Co. continue to venture forward towards the Lonely Mountain. Along the way, they encounter:<br/><br/>-Giant spiders in the forest -The woodland Elvish warriors led by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). -Escaping the Elves in the iconic ""barrels"" scene. -The rising of Sauron and his army of Orcs. -The Lonely Mountain itself, inside which the mighty Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) dwells.<br/><br/>Anyone's enjoyment of these movies comes down to how fully they are able to fully immerse themselves into the fantasy atmosphere. I am able to 100% ""buy in"", so I love it. I enjoy practically every aspect of the picture, from the action/adventure to the music to the ""canon"" material and even the dwarf bumbling humor. This is one of my favorite series of all-time, so I'm probably not being too objective here, but to me there is nothing here in this movie to shy away from.<br/><br/>It has been awhile since I read the ""Hobbit"" book, so I can't comment on how closely the movie follows the text, but from what I've heard/remember Jackson takes quite a few liberties. To be honest, though, I didn't care one iota while watching the film. I didn't feel as if any of the ""new stuff"" was boring or dramatically changed the main storyline. Again, of course, that could just be because I'm not intimately acquainted with the novel as I once was.<br/><br/>A final comment on this movie (and the series so far): The one thing I DO remember about the ""Hobbit"" book is that it is very much more light-hearted than LOTR and almost more of a children's book. However, these movies (with their horrifying creatures and graphic battles) are not marketed for the kiddie set. Thus, I can understand why Peter Jackson would want to incorporate more mature themes into the storyline. Too much of ""book Hobbit"" is childish (for better or worse).<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" was one of my favorite cinema experiences of the year. Like I said, I could have EASILY sat through the entire third segment the same night!"
"jokerswild1","8","2","4","16 January 2015"," The first great film in the LOTR/Hobbit series
","I find The Lord of the Rings films quite dull on the whole. They have their moments, but overall I have no interest in seeing any of them ever again. <br/><br/>Unlike those films, The Desolation of Smaug is actually quite fun and exciting. Bilbo is a much better protagonist than Frodo was, he has much more charisma and likability. Sequences like the barrel ride are quite fun, and Smaug is an amazing villain, by far the best one in any of these films. Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job for the motion capture with his voice and mannerisms, I was fascinated by every movement the creature made and every word he said. Peter Jackson compared Smaug to Hannibal Lector if he were a dragon, and that's not far off. Howard Shore's score isn't bad, but it is forgettable.<br/><br/>Haven't seen The Battle of the Five Armies yet, but the quality of this movie gives me more hope for it than I would've had previously."

","Firstly I loved the Lord of The Rings trilogy, but these Hobbit movies are so bad that they need to be tossed into the fiery pit of Mount Doom more so than the ""One Ring"" itself. Imagine Peter Jackson stroking and clutching them as they plummet to their fate.<br/><br/>As Sméagol was once a good, decent hobbit, corrupted by the One Ring, Peter Jackson too was a good director, full of love for these stories. But Jackson too, has been corrupted by power,'gollum!', murdering his friend Tolkien as surely as Sméagol murdered Deagol.<br/><br/>He is tricksies and false, yes! He makes up stories in the hobbitsies movies that didn't exist in the hobbitsies books! GOLLUM! GOLLUM! He adds boring, nasty tasting chase scenes to stretch the story into more movies. GOLLUM! and adds nasty, false characters that we never reads of in ""The Hobbitsies"". GOLLUM! GOLLUM! He lies to us about characters like Bard and creates love stories that are false. GOLLUM!"
"bigjackfilms","9","2","4","1 January 2015"," Fantastic Action Fantasy Movie!!!!
","The Hobbit: The Desolation Of SmaugI LOVED IT! So much better than the first one. Its fast paced and exciting. Feels allot more of a quick sit then the first one. But how is the movie in detail<br/><br/>The Characters are once again great. And even the new characters are really cool. Beron, who I had a bit of a concern about, is a fun character. That bear design alone was so cool. I love Legolas in this; he's such a showoff, almost Gaston like to try to impress his girlfriend.<br/><br/>BTW, Tauriel, I'm in love people. Not only a badass fighter who can hold her own in battle, but DAMN is she a fine elf. I wasn't really all that invested and got all goo goo for the previous female characters in the other films, hell most of my favorite female characters are in Anime. But, this elven warrior is gorgeous. :D<br/><br/>Also, Thrandull is a cool guy too. You can tell that he's got a bit of a David Bowie Labyrinth tone in him. <br/><br/>And then there's Smaug. WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING DRAGON! ONE OF THE BEST I'VE SEEN! He's almost ties with Draco from Dragonheart. He's that good. Bennedect Cumberbatch is bone chilling in the performance. It's almost Sh*t Your Pants terrifying. I also noticed something in his design and behavior. It seems looking at him closely; Jackson obviously wanted to create something larger than life, which he succeeded in. Smaug was gigantic. The BIGGEST Dragon I've EVER SEEN. But I noticed that his design was based on a combination of different reptiles. With the teeth of a crocodile and almost snake like movements, his design and behavior was more of that of a Water Monitor Lizard or Kamodo Dragon. Now keep in mind, I've worked with large sized monitors in the past, and I've seen how they moved and behave, although granted, most of them acted like house cats, I'm not kidding. Smaug was defiantly that of a wild one, his head was indeed that or a monitor along with movement. And I thought that was really cool. <br/><br/>The Action is FANTASTIC & TOP NOTCH! Its great fun! The whole Barrel Sequence from beginning to end was a roller coaster ride. Especially the Jump The Shark moment with Bomber. It felt like something outta Donkey Kong Country. Legolas's fight with each orc is great, he's decapitating them left to right. The scenes with Gandalf in The Old Fortress were a WOW to be hold. This is the Gandalf I've wanted to see for a long time, using lots a lots of Magic attacks. He's even able to put up a good fight with Sauron.<br/><br/>Then the 3-D. That was great, some of the best 3-D I've seen. The scene in Mirkwood Forrest with the spiders is really trippy and scary, with lots of jump scares. <br/><br/>However, I do have a few nit picks...<br/><br/>There are probably two or three scenes of the group giving up and then like minutes later say ""We can do it!"". It's a cliché that is mostly found in kids movies, and honestly its about as painful to sit through as ""The Liar Reviled"" cliché. Especially in one scene, that was only put there for padding and filler. Its the scene where they find the gate to the hidden passage. They say in order to enter they have to be at ""The Last Light Of Durins Day."" so they think it's the sun when it turns out its the moon.<br/><br/>Remember the scene in Fellowship where we find out that most dwarf doors can only be seen by moonlight? Well since most of the movie going audience had probably seen that film, when that scene is on, we know most of this. But OMG, they drag it on and on when the sun sets and ""Oh Boo Hoo, its hopeless. Game Over. We done, finished. Let's cry in the corner"" I felt that whole bit could have been cut out. And you think the dwarfs would know their own designs on how these things work. They could have just said ""Hey, wait, it's the moon. Let's just wait till tonight."" <br/><br/>Its just so painful to watch and you think ""Oh God, get on with it."" I think that's just one of a few tiny complains I had with the film. But lets get onto what I missed and the other stuff I liked.<br/><br/>Well for one thing, when Kili get shot by a Morgal arrow, I'll admit I was shocked and hoped he'd make it though. But seeing it a second time, it's actually really funny why he can't join the group. I'll give you a hint. <br/><br/>""I was gonna help slay a dragonuntil I took an arrow to the knee."" XD No Joke.<br/><br/>I do wish it was allot more focused on Bilbo, since its called The Hobbit! Also the business with Sauron felt like it could have been toned down and not so obvious.<br/><br/>I felt the way it ended was kinda Bullsh*t. It ends on a cliff hanger and cuts to black. But it didn't bother me too much.<br/><br/>Finally, the song ""I See Fire"" What a GREAT Song. I just recently downloaded it. It fits the end and the movie so well. <br/><br/>If I could recommend on how to see the movie, defiantly on the biggest screen possible, IMAX 3-D or AVX HFR. It truly is an experience. <br/><br/>So overall, this movie is AWESOME! If you have no clue what I'm taking aboutread the book. 10/10. One of the series best! You've done it again Mr. Jackson."
"classicsoncall","9","2","4","29 November 2014"," ""No matter what may come, stay on the path.""
","""The Lord of silver fountains, King of carven stone, the King beneath the mountain, shall come into his own"".<br/><br/>With those words of Durin's prophecy, the rag-tag bunch of dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) continue their journey through the elf-land of Mirkwood, the village of Lake Town and on to Ereborn, home of Smaug the Dragon, guardian of dwarf treasure of legend. I have to wonder what Tolkien might have thought about his characters and locations put to the big screen to earn him a new generation of fans and followers of the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>To be sure, there's some poetic license taken with this installment of the original Hobbit story, so if you're a Tolkien purist the movie will probably give you fits. Personally, it's been a considerably long time since I've read the books and my memory is hazy on specific points. However I find that overall, the films provide a rich tapestry of characters and geography set in a fictional universe that's the rival of any work in literature or entertainment."
"adamscastlevania2","8","2","4","18 October 2014"," The adventure continues mostly in fine form
","(80%) The second chapter offers more in terms of action, a degree more excitement and more peril for the group of adventuring hobbits, but also the is a tad degree less charm and humour than the first instalment, which had it in spades. And despite the series now looking very likely to turn out to be nothing more really than ""Lord of the rings Jr"" this still remains a mighty fine, well made, fun adventure movie that is well worth a cinema ticket and 2 hours 40 of ones time. The final chapter is shaping up to be maybe the longest fantasy battle in cinema history, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to it."
"megmays5","9","2","4","14 June 2014"," Best film in the series yet!
","I'm surprised this movie gets so much hate. The acting is good, the action is intense, the characters are likable... I'm not seeing the problem. I liked this movie a lot better than the first one. In my opinion, it was paced better and more immersing. The effects were amazing (especially in 3D), however they could have been a little better at some parts. The first film was too much cheese and not enough macaroni, depending on slow, character developmental scenes to get by. Basically it was all just one big exposition scene. However, thanks to that movie, we get to jump right into the action with this next film, which does a better job of showing, not telling. Despite all the hate this film will continue to receive, I will still view it as one of my favorite movies, and I am happy to say that I am definitely looking forward to the third one."
"buddhaflow","3","2","4","21 May 2014"," Train wreck, saved only by a few visually stunning scenes.
","I was compelled to write my first ever IMDb review, just because of how profoundly bad this film was.<br/><br/>A Caveat: I watched this movie on an airplane, on the little 3""x5"" display on the seat, which is surely NOT the way you should watch a movie like this. But I was still blown away by some of the visuals, and still feel my criticism is valid.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1) The CGI looked like video games. This is hard to describe. When I watch Game of Thrones, I never feel like I am watching any CGI at all. As far as I can tell, I am just looking at a lot of elaborate sets. Not here. From the first scene, in the rainy town, I wondered ""Am I watching someone playing Assassin's Creed?"" It didn't really get better.<br/><br/>2) Stupid, pointless, boring action scenes. First two that come to mind are the spiders and the barrel riding scene. Just horrible. Worse, boring. Deadening. Don't do anything to advance characters or plot, and don't hold up on their own. They should have been cut. The elves dance about like superheroes, dispatching with umpteen faceless, boring orcs and spiders. It's just so repetitive and boring. Both scenes should have been max 90 secs. But they drag on, and on, and on, for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>3) Horrible characters. I didn't care about any of the characters. The development sucked. The dialogue sucked. The acting sucked. The movie felt like it was directed by post-2000 George Lucas.<br/><br/>4) Too long, not enough meat.<br/><br/>5) Turning the Hobbit into a 3 part series just seems like a cynical profit grab, totally unnecessary. They dragged the book out into 3 movies just so they could pad it with hours of pointless action scenes? What madness is this?<br/><br/>I hadn't watched 1, and probably won't watch 3, so this was profoundly disappointing. You're dropped in to a bunch of actors you don't care about with minimal exposition. The movie ends just as it feels it's starting to pick up; the credits rolling dropped my jaw as I was expecting the scene to continue. This isn't a TV Serial. Maybe, that is what Peter Jackson should be making instead. But movies should stand on their own, and this just doesn't.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>1) I am a complete sucker for movies and video games that set out to create vast, expansive interior spaces. I LOVE them. And in this respect, The Hobbit 2 did not disappoint. The Elven Kingdom, while not as magical as it should have been, was still quite grand. The Dwarven kingdom, and the action sequences with Smaug in them, were superb. It was just a beautifully crafted space, and these were the only gratuitous action scenes that payed off for me. The massiveness of it..of the forges, of the throne room, of the central walkways..of the treasure room!...this really fed my fetish for vastness, and even on the crummy little screen left me spellbound. This was absolutely the strongest point of the movie for me. Sadly, just about the only strong point.<br/><br/>2) Smaug was an interesting character, I loved how he was introduced, although perhaps not so subtle or deep. However, after displaying human intelligence, he manages to not kill a single dwarf when he has a chance. He blows lots of fire, but always hesitates when he has a kill shot; he is distracted as easily as a dog by their tauntings. This does the character disservice.<br/><br/>3) Nope, sorry, I've got nothing. It's 20 minutes of visual splendor surrounded by 2 hours of valium. Pass."
"JaydoDre","7","2","4","21 April 2014"," Fun action and characters at the cost of common sense
","Desolation of Smaug has the job of convincing audiences that this new Tolkien trilogy is worthy of their attention, after a somewhat dragged out and toned down first part.<br/><br/>This time the action has been boosted. Introduction of elven characters, especially the return of Legolas, is essentially the introduction of acrobatic super-warriors, but the dwarfs also do more fighting this time around and even the hobbit has turned into a fighter. And as the title suggests we also finally brush up with our dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>The actors are more fleshed out. While most of the dwarfs remain nameless background characters, at least a few of them get developed a bit more and get their own scenes. It's nice to see more variety in the type of characters and Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a great evil dragon.<br/><br/>Maybe it is just me getting increasingly higher standards, but while the action is nice, the script of Desolation of Smaug really starts to get on the nerves towards the 2nd half of the movie. Characters say and do whatever serves the story at that particular time. It's contrived and obvious. It is clear that the animators wanted to create particular scenes or special effects, and the characters act as set pieces in those scenes, whether it makes sense for them to be or not.<br/><br/>The increased action, however nice, causes a problem for the story that I fear many people do not think about. For example, the whole point of the hobbits is that little and seemingly weak creatures can overcome huge challenges through bravery and perseverance....not through becoming sword wielding spider fighters like Bilbo did at one point. That's missing the point! The movie does have charm and it is fun to see known characters mess around gorgeous environments, as long as you are able to suspend your disbelief."
"Foxbarking","3","2","4","29 March 2014"," A Dreadful Movie
","I thought all three of the Lord of the Rings films were enjoyable because they, in my mind, improved on the source material. It is not that I don't enjoy the books, they are just sort of dull in my view. The plots are fine, I just have never been a fan of Tolkien's writing style. So, in spite of the differences from the source material, I thought the first trilogy of films was great. <br/><br/>Both Hobbit movies have done the exact opposite. Where the first trilogy cut much from the books, this movie adds way too much that is not part of the story. I am well aware that some of the included stuff is from Tolkien's other work and notes, but some is completely made up by the film makers. There are so many needless action scenes thrown in. They are long, pointless and drag down the story. Then, in between some of the action scenes, we are treated to a glimpse of the actual story. <br/><br/>So, what we get is a movie called ""The Hobbit,"" which almost has nothing to do with the titular character at all. These movies have none of the charm of the book, and none of the light hearted feeling that accompanied the story.<br/><br/>If Peter Jackson, a man I generally have tons of respect for, and company wanted to make a movie with all of their fluff, they could have done it better. They could have done The Hobbit as it was meant to be done and thrown all this trash into a separate movie.<br/><br/>For this second installment, subtitled ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" we do not even get to see Smaug until two hours into the film. And that is a shame because he is really the only good part about this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect choice to play the character and he may have been able to save this dismal script if he were in the movie if it was actually a film about him. <br/><br/>But it's not. This is not ""The Hobbit."" I have no idea what it is, other than a huge failure that the film makers should be ashamed of."

","Sadly this movie is strongly affected by the Hollywoods commercial interpretations. You can unfortunately not even see this movie without getting a penis-joke.<br/><br/>However that said, it has more action than the first Hobbit movie. Its good entertainment, but it becomes too standard.<br/><br/>For those who read the book, Beorn is presented as strong, but not nearly as incredible as you would hope.<br/><br/>Also I would say that the last part of the movie is filled with trunk conversations, but the effects are quite unbeatable.<br/><br/>I have seen the movie 3 times, and it is much less disappointing than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.

","Now I am sat in quite a bias position here, as ever since I was in my early teens I would be first in line at the ticket office for any of the Lord Of The Rings movie's. Now I am in my twenties its been the same with the first Hobbit movie and now this one. I am what you would call a big fan of the Tolkien book's movie franchise's. Im just a sucker for an elf to be honest.<br/><br/>I think this movie is a little more grown up then the first Hobbit movie. The first was a little slow getting into the movie but this one throws you straight into the action. Its a big imrovement on the first movie. Better characters are introduced as the first movie's characters lacked depth this one makes up for it. Overall its still dragged out to long and you still come away with the feeling that they should of cut the trilogy down to just the one movie. Legolas is back, looking much more sinister then I remember him being in the Lord of the rings movies, Gimli is even mentioned. But what disappointed me most was no gollum. Benedict Cumberbatch voices Smaug the dragon and thats probably the highlight of the movie. As a piece of cinema its not the best, no where near the heights of The Lord Of The Rings but much better then the first Hobbit movie.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman puts in a comfortable performance.<br/><br/>http://raroe.wordpress.com/"
"michael_the_nermal","7","2","4","6 February 2014"," Goes on Longer than Needed
","WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of people, I preferred the first ""Hobbit"" movie to this. This is not to say that I hated the second ""Hobbit"" movie; far from it. I just thought that the middle installment had too much padding and plot development that did not need to be there. Even if one accepts the fact that Jackson was correct to fill the plot with elements from the appendix of ""Lord of the Rings,"" and that these elements add to the moviethere's still too much stuff here for this to be a completely satisfactory film. I once played devil's advocate and argued that Jackson was right for stretching ""The Hobbit"" into three films; now I regret that statement. If Jackson wanted a trilogy, he should have made each movie no more than two hours long, and that's being generous. The second film should have been no more than ninety minutes.<br/><br/>The first half seemed okay. I actually thought the action sequences in Mirkwood were *too* rushed, particularly with the spiders. I like that Jackson kept the Azog and Necromancer elements from the first movie in this one, if only to give the trilogy some consistency. I was more annoyed with the second half than the first; specifically, with the final quarter of the film, where Bilbo and the dwarfs fight Smaug. This sequence was padded beyond belief. There was no reason to stretch the fight against Smaug to half an hour, only to have the film end anticlimactically. The action sequences were not exciting; they were repetitive filler, and it was not right of Jackson to have taken the audiences' time with this.<br/><br/>In short, I thought the pacing was uneven (the first half moved events along too quickly, while the second half bogged down the pacing) and padded with unnecessary and ultimately boring elements. The thematic elements of the film were interesting, and character development was inspired. I liked how Bilbo has grown to be a strong, confident and brave individual compared with how he started in the first film. His diminutive stature and humble appearance only make him a more endearing protagonist, for whom the audience will sympathize with and root for all the way. Also intriguing is the change apparent in dwarf leader Thorin Oakenshield, presumptive ""King Under the Mountain."" He wasn't all that likable in the first movie, being a humorless, abrasive fellow. Here, he seems more sinister, seduced by greed and willing to sacrifice the life of Bilbo to gain power. While Thorin's malevolent nature is addressed in the movie overtly (via dialogue), I think the ""Hobbit"" addresses the nature of greed and power more subtly than the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. There is no supernatural Ring of Power to lead Thorin astray; his dual nature is entirely within himself, influenced by no outside force, like Sauron or an evil talisman similar to the Ring of Power. The Lonely Mountain is less severe a goal than the destruction of the One Ring. The audience sympathizes with Thorin's quest to regain what is rightfully his; however, the means by which he will achieve this goal are questionable, and the prize itself does not seem worth the toll in lives Thorin is willing to pay (sending Bilbo alone to face Smaug; angering Smaug, etc). In all, the stakes are lower than ""Lord of the Rings,"" but the subtle nature of the ""good versus evil"" struggle make this a more mature movie than the original trilogy.<br/><br/>I still recommend this movie, but advise patience. I wouldn't blame the audience if they walked out in the final thirty minutes. Still, if you like action for the sake of action, you'll probably love this film and will gladly sit through the whole thing."

","THE HOBBIT: DESOLATION OF SMAUG<br/><br/>Part 2 of the pointless trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie continues on from the original one where Bilbo Baggins goes on an adventure with Gandalf and a group of dwarfs... they are heading towards a mountain which homes a very dangerous dragon.<br/><br/>The movie is made very well. The effects are again very good much like the original movie... and you can tell Peter Jackson made this just by watching it. It has the same feel to it as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>What I love about the film the most is the fantasy element. The creatures look amazing and really does drag you into their world. It is a great form of escapism. The dragon, Smaug, was amazing. He looked really good and huge. I was very impressed with the effects.<br/><br/>The acting again was brilliant. These movies really have been cast so well, I can imagine this Bilbo growing old into the Bilbo at the beginning of LOTR. The movie stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo. It is great that Hollywood is starting to really see the potential in some of the better British comedy TV stars. Some of them really does deserve a shot at the big time... and Martin is one of them. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf. Ian is a legendary actor and can be very intimidating in places. He is the perfect Gandalf... it is hard to imagine anyone else playing him. Other cast members were Richard Armitage, Ken Scott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman... the list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I suppose the main thing I have against this film is the whole point. I loved the Lord of the Rings movies and you had 3 very long movies to cover 3 very big books... that I understand. Why must Peter Jackson and the greedy movie industry make the Hobbit into 3 long movies for 1 small book? The movie has a lot of filler in it that the book does not have. I liked the book a lot and was happy that Peter Jackson was making it... but I am disappointed that it is a long trilogy. It seems a waste.<br/><br/>My favourite bit in the film though was the barrel scene. If you have seen it or read the book you know what bit I am talking about... it was really well shot and a lot of fun and action. By far the best scene of the film.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.

","When I first heard P. Jackson is planning a Hobbit trilogy I was more than excited cause I'm a huge Tolkien fan. However, as the movies come out, they disappoint me more and more. 'The Desolation of Smaug' is just another proof that P. Jackson and the whole team are literally sucking the juices of the book as much as possible, adding even their own details, just to manage to make 3 movies out of a 320-pages book. Of course, no one can doubt the well-made and well-directed production. All I'm saying is this trilogy becomes more and more disappointing and does not meet the expectations as a prequel of Lord of the Rings. Now, as far as this movie goes, the plot is kind of slow and there are scenes that weren't included in the original book. On the other hand, the acting is great, of course. Oh, small detail here but i thought i should include it, the soundtrack ""I see fire"" by Ed Sheeran, is a good song but does not fit the whole Hobbit/Tolkien atmosphere for me."

","For Tolkien fans, probably the 'best' section of the movie is Galdalf in Dol Guidur - though there is the White Orc who is completely outside the book's storyline. In spite of this, this aspect of the original story, which Tolkien did not flesh out, expands the story a bit.<br/><br/>Beorn - a major character is poorly portrayed, with a chase scene to his house rather than what could have been a fairly entertaining take-off from the book's approach.<br/><br/>Mirkwood - should have been handled as was Frodo crossing the Plains of Gorgoroch. Clockwise not a large investment but maintaining the importance to the story.<br/><br/>Elves - Too much. Their presentation did need to change since the book's elves and those in the Lord of the Ring were not compatible. So I agree they needed to fit the mold of the later books, but their role in the story was too enhanced.<br/><br/>Escape from the Elves - The book would have worked - it was somewhat fanciful but no more than the movie. Would have decreased the time to the Lake-Town and made entry easier.<br/><br/>Lake Town - Sure OK.<br/><br/>Gandalf - Ian Murray McKellen does a great job with the character. And why does he seem 'lower or less powerful' than Galadriel? The dwarfs - I guess Oakenshield needed to look more 'human' to be one of the main leading characters, but really is overdone in that regard.<br/><br/>Radagast - Why the bird sh** on his head? Does this enhance the character? The rabbit drawn sled??? Where Beorn was aloof and distant this would have fit an Istari that was more aligned with the wilderness and wildlife of Middle Earth than it's human and humanlike races.<br/><br/>With the LOTR movies, though there was not strict adherence to the books, his artistic license remained very true to the story. The Hobbit movies are more akin to the Asimov ""I Robot"" and the movie. The names the same, but that is about it. The later did a better job because it was clearly a completely separate story. The former comes up short by flirting with following the storyline and then fails."
"phenomynouss","4","2","4","31 December 2013"," The bloat starts to set in
","I absolutely love long movies. I hate seeing book adaptations slashed to 90 or 120 minute things, and thus am thrilled by such movies like ""Gettysburg"" which turned a 350+ page book into a 4 hour and 10 minute movie, and thus was able to cover essentially everything in the book.<br/><br/>For a series like Lord of the Rings, where the movies tend to drone on for many many hours, the length is in some cases justified. For ""The Hobbit"" I figured 2 movies should be more than enough for a tight, thrilling adventure.<br/><br/>But whereas the first movie managed to be fun despite the overly long dinner sequence and other scenes that meandered on, this one gorges itself on pointless dialogue and sprawling scenes that could have been cut down substantially or cut out entirely, and the movie suffers for it.<br/><br/>By my own admission, I don't particularly like Tolkien or the LOTR movies---I think the themes are overly simplistic, the action overly ""Hollywood"", and the dialogue is stilted, dumb, and often grueling to sit through, but for a kid's thing, or as a solely visual thing, it's great and entertaining. And yet I thoroughly enjoyed The Two Towers and the first Hobbit movie despite this.<br/><br/>By comparison, The Desolation of Smaug feels like the last hour of ""Return of the King"" spread over 2 hours, with action sequences littered in. And it's more than just ""Great scene, long droning exposition, good scene, bad scene, good scene""---the ""bloat"" is spread almost evenly throughout the entire movie. Virtually every scene goes on at least a few minutes more than it should, like a hair stylist leaving a long luxurious mane of hair rife with split ends and not bothering to clip them off. Even the ""big reveal"" of the Necromancer being Sauron (not a spoiler) went on just a few seconds too long, and whilst I previously mention I don't particularly like LOTR, I was blown away by the spectacle of the reveal, only to have it ruined when it went on long enough for me to realize, ""it's like the White Stripes' video for 'Seven Nation Army'"" The confrontation between Bilbo and Smaug is tense and thrilling to watch for all of 5 minutes, and yet it keeps going and starts to become repetitive and dull. At the very least, Smaug openly says he's having fun so you can't bitterly ask ""Why doesn't he just kill Bilbo already?"" but then this escalates into an even longer sequence (the molten gold plot) that, whether it was accurate to the book or not, could have been completely removed without hurting the movie in the slightest. It seems to even acknowledge what a waste the whole sequence was when Smaug shakes off the gold completely.<br/><br/>Another big complaint I have, which is rather unfair given that it was the same in the LOTR series; the battles. So much emphasis---much more than even LOTR, since they had Uruk-Hai---the Orcs are trumped up as this unbelievable scourge of death and destruction that is seemingly unstoppable, and yet in every single battle scenes, the ""good guys"" easily waste Orcs with such immense ease that they never break a sweat.<br/><br/>In fact, the only surprising battle sequence is the brief fight between Legolas and Bolg, because Legolas actually ends up with a slight nosebleed at the end of it. That's about as far as any character in The Hobbit has come in the way of having any trouble fighting off the hordes of Orcs. It makes them look like piles of crap, and strains credulity when you have Thranduil panicking hard enough to close the borders of Mirkwood out of fear of the Orcs when the only Elves that get killed by Orcs are the ones taken by surprise.<br/><br/>It's been more than ten years since I last read The Hobbit, so I don't remember much at all or how it unfolds past Smaug. I only hope for the sake of the audience that all the sluggish doting on the story and Middle-Earth lore was done here, and ""There and Back Again"" is at least as tight and thrilling as the first Hobbit movie was."
"brickmoviereviews","8","2","4","29 December 2013"," The Reutrn to Middle Earth is Anything But Desolate
","Set in Middle Earth, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up where we left off in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. After a brief opening scene showing Gandalf (Ian McKellen) approaching Thorin (Richard Armitage) and convincing him to take back the dwarf's home at The Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). Time jump twelve months to where we left off in the previous movie, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), Gandalf, Thorin, and the rest of dwarfs frantically run to get away from a pack of Orcs, led by Azog (Manu Bennett), who have been hunting them. After Gandalf leaves to report the coming of a greater evil, Bilbo and the dwarfs venture into the Mirkwood Forest.<br/><br/>The string of bad luck that seems to follows the dwarfs continues, as the lose their way in the forest, get ambushed by a pack of giant spiders, and then are taken prisoner by the woodland elves, led by King Thranduil (Lee Pace). With the help of Bilbo and the ring he found in the goblin lair in An Unexpected Journey, the dwarfs escape the grasp of the elves and eventually make it to Laketown, a small town at the foot of The Lonely Mountain, and eventually back to Erebor, where the dragon Smaug awaits.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is easily better than it's predecessor. An Unexpected Journey was warm and friendly, while DoS was much, much darker. The movie is gripping beyond belief. Being a continuation of the previous movie, DoS jumps directly into the heart-pounding action with the immediate Orc chase. The plot is well thought out and written extremely well. Martin Freeman outperforms himself as Bilbo Baggins since the last movie, and we get to see the true leadership side of Richard Armitage's King Thorin. The movie does jump around quite often, from the dwarfs, to Gandalf's mission, to the elvish troubles of Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom).<br/><br/>While there is nothing glaringly wrong with The Desolation of Smaug, there are a few things here and there that I found fault with. First of all, is found that Gandalf was underused. Granted he had to go off on his own mission that got him in some trouble, there was, honestly, significantly less screen time of Ian McKellen compared to An Unexpected Journey. Secondly, I found that some events of the movie were a tad predictable, and this is coming from someone who has not read the book The Hobbit. Personally, I feel that a greater sense of danger could have been introduced to the film, but, in the grand scheme of things, this is a minor setback, especially since it is the second movie of a trilogy. The CGI, however, needs to be addressed. The imagery was absolutely fantastic. The work on the dragon Smaug, in particular, was breathtaking and seemed as if they had an actual dragon.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug did its job; it perfectly continued the story left off in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and it perfectly set up for the third film in the trilogy, The Hobbit: There and Back Again. The movie ended with a seamless and gripping cliffhanger, and leaves feelings of satisfaction, desire, and, to an extent, un-fulfillment – a feeling that has a justified place in context of the movie. If you have not yet seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy you can still enjoy and understand The Desolation of Smaug, so long as you see An Unexpected Journey first.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 of 10<br/><br/>BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com"
"jdkraus","8","2","4","24 December 2013"," Fun, cheap style over earthy substance...Peter Jackson, what has happened to Middle-earth?
","I am probably in the minority who love ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey."" Yes, it does not have the same epic feeling that Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" has nor does it have the flawless combination of old-style effects and CGI, but it is still fun, large in scope and imagination. And besides, who cannot despise the magical world of Middle-Earth? In loving the first Hobbit movie, I had high hopes for Smaug. A more promising Metacritic score of 66/100 appears to boost both the hype and my anticipation of this film. Within the first 10 minutes of the feature, I knew I was in for a ride...and not necessarily the one I was expecting or hoping for.<br/><br/>This Hobbit film unfortunately does not have a real plot like ""An Unexpected Journey."" Rather, it is a series of events based around Tolkien's book that are then meshed into a completely different concept. First, there is the Hobbit Bilbo and the company of dwarfs who seek the reclamation of their lost home Erebor, overtaken by the dragon Smaug. There is the wizard Gandalf, who suddenly abandons his post as a guide to the dwarfs in order to set off on a more vital matter, which foreshadows to the enemy that is present in ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy."" There are the elves, Legolas and Tauriel, who pursue the dwarfs to stop their quest, only to stumble upon something that is even bigger at stake. Lastly, there is Bard, a fisherman turned smuggler that aids Bilbo and the dwarfs, who is destined to become an unlikely hero. This is a lot of ground covered in the 161 minute film. At times, it becomes discombobulating as each story jumps to and fro. <br/><br/>With so much information happening, characters are quickly thrown in and then some are just as swiftly forgotten--often left without further reference. In some instances this works whereas others, it just feels like bad writing. I have read the book twice and Tolkien did this with some of his characters. I understand his reasoning for that. In the movie, however, I do not. Making matters worse is a love story that is thrown in between an elf and a dwarf. This has absolutely no meaning or purpose to the overall story arc. It is just a lame way of drawing in the young, female viewer demographics. Peter Jackson has drifted so far off from the original novel, that this is something entirely different. This surprisingly does not bother me so much though. I expected him to add padding for cinematic effect. He did the same thing for his first Hobbit film. What bothers me though is that cohesiveness in storytelling is no longer present. The ending in particular left me cold and without any closure or sense of a resolution. It feels as if Peter Jackson has decided to turn his movie into a simple marketing stunt for money rather than give us an enjoyable, plot and character-driven narrative that we have seen from his first trilogy. I feel kind of bad writing this, but it is honestly true. <br/><br/>Another big drawback to this movie is the visual effects. Some scenes are very impressive, specifically with the dragon Smaug and the Necromancer (both miraculously voiced by the awesome Benedict Cumberbatch). Most other scenes are lower quality, like out of an XBOX game console. The CGI orcs and the famous barrel sequence are like something out of a 3D cartoon rather than a big-budget movie. The soft focus and dim lighting on Orlando Bloom as Legolas is really bad--no doubt a cheap method to make him look younger. Multiple times, I found myself groaning inside. <br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is not a complete loss. I was still entertained. No boredom kicked in. Indeed, it is a very fast-paced movie. The action is fun despite its corniness and lack of photo-realistic detail. The other elements of a big budget such as make-up, costumes, and elaborate set pieces are great enough to bring a sense of realism to Tolkien's world. The city of Laketown is really noteworthy in terms of its production values. I have no real regrets in seeing the movie. I just wished Peter Jackson held up to his marvelous magnificence instead of sink down to the level that Lucas did with his ""Star Wars Prequels."" My final comment: Peter Jackson, what has happened to your creation of Middle- Earth?<br/><br/>My generous rating: 7/10"
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","2","4","24 December 2013"," We're still waiting for the three-part adaptation of Tom Bombadil...
","There was a time, during the early years of the twenty first century, when each December would herald a new Lord of the Rings (alongside a new Harry Potter film and maybe a Star Wars, if we were lucky). The height of this lasted only as long as the three years over which Peter Jackson's original trilogy were released, but was already becoming something of a tradition.<br/><br/>With ITV serialising Harry Potter over the Christmas period, and a brand new epic trilogy in the Hunger Games series coinciding with the release of The Hobbit, it really does feel like it did all those years ago. Certainly, Peter Jackson wants to do it all over again, and why not? It's a treat to indulge in almost three hours of fantasy on the big screen, and there can be no denying that The Hobbit is indulgent.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the seemingly unnecessary decision to stretch a meagre prequel out to the length of the epic three-book Lord of the Rings trilogy. Strictly speaking, this series rounds out Peter Jackson's version of Middle Earth as both an adaptation of The Hobbit and the numerous appendices and preambles that were cut from The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I read The Hobbit – so long, in fact, that it may have been read to me by my parents. I can't quite remember what's original, and what's just filler, but these films are ticking all the boxes for me. Last year had the encounter with trolls and Bilbo's riddles with Gollum, and this time around we visit the foreboding gloom of Mirkwood, the distant settlement of Laketown (where Stephen Fry appears as the greedy master) and the lair of the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>The star of these films as always been the visual effects and epic scope, and this instalment is no exception. CGI spectacle integrates seamlessly into the breathtaking New Zealand landscape. While largely flawless, some of the green screen shots are regrettably obvious, and the final sequence, involving much molten gold, is decidedly lacklustre.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman shines as the unassuming Bilbo Baggins, who has much greater confidence, a result of both his experiences in the first film and the slow but steady corruption of the ring. Similarly, the deposed king Thorin (Richard Armitage) appears to come under the influence of his lost wealth as the party nears the ocean of gold below the mountain.<br/><br/>New material includes the presence of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Jackson's original character Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly, providing the film's only female lead) who flesh out the scenes in the Elven kingdom and provide some intrigue into the relationships between Elves and Dwarfs. They also help drive the film's most high paced action sequence, the famous barrel escape.<br/><br/>With a hindsight that Tolkien himself was not afforded, the film is tied neatly to Lord of the Rings continuity by Legolas, along with references to his future companion Gimli and the Eye of Sauron. The latter is the focus of an expanded sequence with Gandalf (Ian McKellen, delivering a typically winning performance) in the spooky ruins of the fortress which casts a pall over the surrounding region. The final sequence, a battle with Smaug through ruins of mighty Dwarven industry, provides another thrill ride, and prevents the film from ending with an otherwise unsatisfying cliff hanger.<br/><br/>Inevitably, with thirteen dwarfs and one hobbit in the main party (and countless other wizards, elves and humans filling up the story) the cast is too large, and many of the characters slip into the background. Thankfully, Bilbo receives a lengthy scene one-on-one with the film's most stunning special effect, the dragon Smaug, voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. The performance drips with ham and cheese and the beast occupies every inch of the cinema screen.<br/><br/>So while this film strays occasionally into overblown fantasy dialogue, and it can be a challenge to keep up with all the characters and everything that's going on, this is an enjoyable, if lengthy movie, at least the equal of its predecessor."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","8","2","4","21 December 2013"," Now, that's more like it.
","The desolation of Smaug was really great. I don't usually start my reviews like this but this movie was breathtaking. Without prolonging, let me begin to dissect the movie piece by piece.<br/><br/>1) The acting and characters. Unlike the first movie this one really got the characters going. Each and every one of them had their moment on the screen and all of them were presented in a manner that pictured their character's personality perfectly. The dwarfs were brilliantly played and were as entertaining as they were presented. Ken Stott as Balin had a little less screen time that in the first movie, but that opened room for the others to shine. Here one actually had a feeling that all of the dwarfs were present at all time. Armitage was as good as in the first movie and he really presented Thorin as a leader. One you could follow without question and/or doubt. His charisma was flawless. Freeman's transformation from that scared-of-everything in the first movie to this real live epic hero is beyond me. How he did that was a question only he can answer, and I believe that this is his life role. His final statement before the end credits was so powerful and so lifelike one forgets he is acting. The only real problem was McKellen. He was literally shoved out of the move. His storyline was extremely short and his character was not able to impose himself on the screen. Of course, if no elements of Silmarillion were implemented, there would be no McKellen, so all is forgotten because even if he had a small amount of screen time he was, as usual, great. Legolas and Tauriel. Now that was a nice surprise. Evangeline Lilly's out of this world beauty and elegant acting made her a believable elf giving the movie a nice touch of new. Bloom's character was darker, more violent. The LOTR Legolas was nothing like this. A much more interesting character than one can expect knowing him from the LOTR movies. Luke Evans was a nice surprise. His character was nicely played. The duality of his persona was done nicely, but could have been done a bit better. He, I thought, was a bit lost in his character, not knowing what to play at certain points, but even with that remark he was amusing and intriguing. And last but not least - Smaug! I have seen horror movies scare people less that this calamity that we saw on the screen. What a character! His voice, his size and evil were magical! It spilled from the screen into each and every one of the people in the audience. Fear and terror was what we felt when he appeared, and I must say, I have never been so afraid of a character like that in my movie watching life. Benedict gave him a soul and I do not believe a meaner character could have been presented to us. Brilliant. Now, as you can tell, this movie is less focused on the environment and more focused on the characters. I have not evaluated all of them because that would take a lot of space and time, so just watch the movie and decide for yourself.<br/><br/>2) The music. A bit of a disappointment. Only a couple of new tones - e.g. Laketown. Heard over and over again, nothing interesting.<br/><br/>3) Dynamics. The movie is fast. Almost so fast that I was amazed how much time passed since the movie began to the end credits. The spider battle and elven captivity were presented in a couple of short sequences (at least it felt like that). Everything felt like Jackson was rushing us toward the end of the movie. And then, after the magnificent sequence of the barrel ridding fight with an orc pack (one of the two best sequences of the movie), everything slows down. The movie splits into four story lines and terrible editing begins. Jackson tried to create an effect of simultaneousness. All of the story lines violently crashed into each other, they were harshly ended and some of them were way longer than necessary (e.g. Killy and Tauriel's extremely unnecessary ""love"" tail). Now, if we just examine the Smaug fight (the second of two best parts of the movie) it is SPECTACULAR with one minor problem - it's too damn long. And this is where we come to the worst problem - the crossing over of story lines gave an effect of unnecessary time overdue to a storyline that deserved way less time, and because of that a storyline that deserved to be the climax was cut into many smaller segments not giving the chance to climax in total.<br/><br/>4) The ending. Looking back after a good night sleep, it ended great. With two magnificent phrases and an angry feeling of - WE WANT MORE!!! It is clear that Jackson wanted exactly that kind of emotion.<br/><br/>One thing is clear. An unexpected journey was boring and too long, The desolation of Smaug is fast paced, filled with great story lines and characters but with bad editing. I cannot escape the feeling that everything is somehow just a preparation for the third movie. If so, I believe that the third installment of the Hobbit trilogy will blow our minds. Still, a bitter taste remains. As an amateur critic, a movie fan, a Tolkien fan, a Jackson fan I will state that The Hobbit would have been a way better project if split only into two movies. This way, the third installment better be a masterpiece."

","DOS was good! I just don't get why the relationship between Tauriel and Kili had to be added. Do not think it was necessary to have Kili injured- the director probably wanted some dwarfs to start trusting elves again? still, I rather Peter Jackson didn't change the storyline of the movie because of a character that was originally NOT in the book.(Tauriel)Instead of having the scenes with Tauriel and Kili in Laketown, he could have used that time to elaborate on the spider scene, elves dancing scene or dragon scene. Wish that the scene with Beorn was like the one in the book though, not suspicious enough of strangers in his house i think. still, can't wait for the last movie!"
"DrTuvok","8","0","0","18 May 2020"," Still a fairly unique monster
","Peter Jackson operating on one cylinder still beats any other blockbuster director operating on all. This film is a strange amalgamation of horror, physical comedy, and epic fantasy storytelling that I really can't compare to anything except the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies. (In the 80s these types of movies were also known as Indiana Jones films). The action scenes are definitely praiseworthy, especially the orc-elf-dwarf-in-barrel battle scene, where the fighting is complemented by a kind physical humor that still somewhat sticks to physics in between all the CGI. Compare this to the prototypical modern blockbuster-Fast and Furious, Marvel films, Dwayne Johnson flicks-and note the difference. Those movies get all their 'humor' from snarky, meta dialogue straining so hard to be clever and usually not succeeding. (Avengers Endgame was the worst offender here). You could place all the Marvel and Dwayne Johnson action scenes end to end and never get something so ridiculous and entertaining as Bombur impaling an orc with his barrel and then rolling down the riverbank smacking more and more over.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film isn't perfect, especially because of the extensive, bad-looking CGI which somehow doesn't apply to the dragon, thank goodness. It also appears more rushed, which it was because Jackson had a studio breathing deadlines down his neck. I don't care though. It's magnificently creative, Jackson's camera work is more stylish than ever, and world doesn't have a lot of good high fantasy movies anyway.<br/><br/>A note: the hobbit trilogy is often compared to the Star Wars prequel trilogy which I think is a pretty apt comparison. However, it insults the magnificent acting from everyone in this trilogy. The performances are better than critics would have you believe."

"hptmbedra","3","0","0","16 December 2019"," How can The Desolation of Smaug fail on so many levels?
","I recently started reading the LOTR series, and though the books are not mind blowing, they are very good. I enjoy them a lot also due to a fact that they explain what was sort of unclear in the movies - interesting details or things that make click in the head and allow you to see the whole picture. And although the movies lacked those here and there, they followed the books very closely and did the source material justice, to viewer's benefit.<br/><br/>Now I can't judge Hobbit the same way because i didn't read it yet, but I suspect that 300 pages book isn't enough material for 8-9 hours of screen time, and this is how the second installment feels. I found many parts of the story unnecessary, like the politics in the lake town, skirmish with orcs on river banks and honestly also Gandalf's quest in Dol Guldur. The quest didn't reveal anything new about the Dark Lord; on the contrary it presented him (and the whole place) in pretty underwhelming fashion.<br/><br/>The film tries to keep you on the edge of your seat with never ending action and ubiquitous dangers, but it fails miserably. The fellowship always survives, no matter the situation, and I am not even talking about elfs being invincible ninjas. It is clearly established that nothing can happen to our heroes, so the opposite of suspension is actually achieved.<br/><br/>The CGI is somehow worse (maybe from overuse?) compared to LOTR and together with the endless bombastic action the movie feels like video game, which isn't good.<br/><br/>It also tries too hard to capture the magic of the original movies by showing familiar characters and objects. Thorin is another Aragorn, but with less charisma and not many likable characteristics. I felt really bad for him when he had his speech in the Lake town about how he will share the gold from Lonely Mountain ... and not much else. The dwarfs are another fellowship, but much less likable? The whole company seems to use Bilbo rather than treat him with respect which doesn't make sense - he saved them all multiple times. I am really curious how it is in the book, but here I couldn't care less about any one from the company due to how they behave. Then Gandalf - he had such presence in originals, but here he is just a shade of himself. Legolas is completely different, jealous, always serious looking killer without traits. And Bilbo has barely any dialogs going for him, which is strange for a Hobbit movie. And there is of course the Arkenstone - the Ring overloaded. I don't know how much from those was in the book, but maybe it would have been better to separate itself more from the first trilogy.<br/><br/>Reading reviews here I am surprised nobody mentioned music. It felt off in many places, like when in the Lake town they found that they lack on good weapons and are spied upon. A dramatic, urging music goes off but nothing is really going on on the screen, no danger is approaching.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the ending is, mildly said, over the top, but what disturbs me the most is that the dragon just flies away after they pour gold on him. What kind of plan was that? To make a huge gold statue and drown him in it once it melts? Not only wasn't this plan ever discussed, it is just plain stupid.<br/><br/>To summarize, I am actually glad that I have seen the movie, because it makes me want to read the book pretty bad, but in and of itself, the movie is really bad."

"jamesjustice-92","7","0","0","11 March 2019"," I used to like it better than An Unexpected Journey
","I just finished watching the extended version of this movie and I can tell you one thing - it is long. Very long. Super duper Alice Cooper long. Most of the plot stands still on one spot and doesn't move at all, scenes are very lengthy in runtime and don't extend the plot the way I expected it from this version. Sure it's gotten bigger in the SGI/action sequences but they look so unbelievable (even for Middle Earth) that you cannot fully appreciate any character and empathize with anyone. It's the second movie and we still don't have any answers about who all those people are and why we should worry about their troubles; even Bilbo, the main protagonist is left forgotten because of the jam-packed action that still manages to bore you to death. I could barely sit through the dragged-out and overbloated Smaug scenes. Visual effects' crew has done a wonderful job and you can almost not see their work. I still don't like Martin Freeman as Bilbo no matter how hard I try. Maybe the final chapter will change things but in the meantime ""The Desolation of Smaug"" suffers from the ""trilogy's second movie"" syndrom - it builds up for the final chapter and fills the movie with nonsensical non-stop action that you get tired of very easily, it rushes everything up but doesn't explain almost absolutely anything. I was left disappointed although when I first watched it in 2013 I liked it better than the first movie which goes without saying that it didn't stand the test of time. I will not be getting back to this movie ever again."
"maxglen","7","0","0","18 February 2019"," A Worthy Successor to An Unexpected Journey
","I have very conflicted emotions about this film, there are aspects I absolutely adore and others I couldn't really care less for and I'm going to try and tell you what those are and why. First off let's start with the bad, this film introduces the notorious Dwarf/Elf romance plot line and although not the worst I've seen these moments do feel like an incredibly forced attempt to make us care about characters who didn't really have a purpose and inject some love into the movie. The next thing I'd like to mention is the Skin Changer seen at the beginning of the film, it was cool to see him as a bear but I feel like his design as a human was somewhat half handed and cheap, I also feel like this character could have been completely cut and the film would be no better or worse for it. Other than those 2 things and a few irritating or useless side characters I don't have too much else negative to say. A lot of people have complained that Legolas was not in the book and was only put in this film to put bums in seats and that may be the case but his inclusion doesn't feel all that out of place so I am indifferent to the decision. Now the good stuff. I LOVE a good creature feature, seeing big mythical beasts and monsters is a guilty pleasure of mine and this film has plenty of that, from big spiders, giant bears, dragons and spectral beings this film probably has the most out of the middle-earth movies. I would have probably liked these scenes regardless of how well executed they were but it was a nice surprise to see them done so marvellously. The sequence in the forest is creatively shot and creepy and the scenes with Smaug are tense and jaw dropping with fantastic performances from Freeman and Cumberbatch. I was slightly disappointed with the lake town stuff but I must admit the sets are stunning. All said and done I think this is a pretty enjoyable entry in the series despite its shortcomings and I think like An Unexpected Journey before it and The Battle of the Five Armies after it this film if looked at on its own merit you will enjoy it, I'm going to give The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug a 7.7 (quick disclaimer for context I am watching the extended cuts of these films)"

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the sequel to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The movie is the second part to The Hobbit trilogy. The movie continues following the same characters as they continue making their way to the mountain home of the Dwarves. Along the way they are hounded by obstacles and Azog.<br/><br/>The second installment to The Hobbit trilogy is truly a bloated mess. The first movie, An Unexpected Journey, at a least had more focus than the second movie. This second movie had many elements of it that had no bearing on the rest of the movie. For one, when the Dwarves go into Mirkwood they are captured. This is a fun side adventure by itself, but it creates a pointless love story-line. In this story-line Tauriel a Wood-elf played by Evangeline Lilly falls in love with the Dwarf Kili and vice versa. The movie continues to explore this story-line even though it felt like needless time padding.<br/><br/>The movie has loads of new movie only characters that never existed in the book. This adds so much more padding to an already overloaded movie that there really does not have to be. The series really should have ended with this movie and the previous one being three hours each. This movie meanders for a long time focusing on character that it really should not be. A lot of characters from The Lord of the Rings trilogy return here and it only serves the purpose of setting up The Lord of the Rings. This is a bad way of setting up the Lord of the Rings trilogy as it was done at the expense of The Hobbit trilogy. As a retrospective, The Hobbit could have done better with the Lord of the Rings foreshadowing in the background rather than the foreground.<br/><br/>This movie is of course incredibly stunning visually. The effects are great at a standard frames per second and the 48 frames per second. The movie's barrel sequence and dragon sequence are the most memorable. Both of these scenes have interesting visual choices and direction that makes them fun to watch. There is nothing I did not like about these two scenes. The audience had a blast watching them.<br/><br/>The casting choices in this movie are great. Just as in The Lord of the Rings, I could not see any weak links in the cast. Each actor and actress fit their role. Even Benedict Cumberbatch that voiced Smaug fit the role perfectly. Listening to Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman, and Smang banter is entertaining to listen to.<br/><br/>I would still recommend The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The viewers should check their expectations and not expect the same quality as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug is more action-packed than the first installment, but this movie suffers because it can't stand on its own. The events of this film are all building up to a climax that isn't resolved, which leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. The visual effects are spectacular, though. Smaug, in particular, looks (and sounds) fantastic. I look forward to seeing how this trilogy wraps up, but I still don't think Peter Jackson needed to divide the book into three movies."

","Bilbo (Martin Freeman) has been traveling with a band of dwarfs, encouraged by Gandolf (Ian McKellen) to see a bit of the world. The little folks, led by Thorin (Richard Armitage), are going to a well- known mountain where a dragon sits on a huge pile of gold. This wealth was stolen, long ago, from the dwarfs. On the journey, there are many dangers. Once in Laketown, a village burned once by the dragon, they try to get advice from a wise gentleman (Luke Evans) but he doesn't want to join the party. Also protecting the group are two very skilled warrior-elves (Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly). At last, the wee folks arrive at the mountain, where a secret door only shown when the last rays of sun light it up, reveals itself. Bilbo has the key. Once inside, the dragon is a formidable foe and there more dangerous incidents. So, what if they do defeat the dragon and regain their lost treasure? Will this bring peace, especially when the dwarfs have promised to share the bounty with others? Hobbitually, I don't watch fantasy films like this. But, over a holiday weekend, my relatives chose this one in my company. Surprisingly, the movie was quite entertaining and beautifully filmed. There are so many characters that it is, initially, very hard to come on board but, soon, one learns who to cheer and who to scorn. Freeman is perfect for Bilbo, portraying a quiet, peace- loving Hobbit with subtle charm. Of the others, each one has strengths but I especially loved Lilly and Evans. Also scary is the voice of the dragon, fashioned by Benedict Cumberbatch to perfection. Indeed, the dragon is a wonder to behold, being very real in its inception. The scenery from New Zealand is glorious while the costumes are fun, too. Okay, maybe you will never get ""stuck"" watching this with family. But, in truth, if you take a chance, you might find it has more to offer than expected."

","If Peter Jackson directed ""The Three Little Pigs,"" the (first) movie would end as The Wolf was about to blow down the house of straw.

He seems to have forgone that to make sure we pay to see the next one. I'm tired of watching only part of a story. The acting was very good. The dragon was reminiscent of Satan toying with Father Karras in The Exorcist. I wish the dragon retained his wit throughout the picture. I would sacrifice some of the well-done, but repetitive, action scenes to allow the story to have a sense of closure."
"jelazos7","5","0","0","6 June 2014"," Good film, but badly tripped the finish line
","Most of the film does as well as its predecessor, mixing Middle Earth lore into the classic Hobbit tale to turn a children's story into an epic, while maintaining the folksy, fun, adventurous tone that the first movie established to differentiate itself from the darker LOTR trilogy. I'll even say they did a good job integrating Legolas, who would indeed play a part in the capture of the dwarfs as a prince of Mirkwood.<br/><br/>And then Bilbo met Smaug, and that point through the end of the movie erased any interest i had in watching the final installment.<br/><br/>After seeing Bilbo and Gollum's dialog in the first movie, I had the highest expectations for Bilbo's inevitable dialog with Smaug. I imagined a terrifying but witty Bilbo goading Smaug into boasting his prowess and revealing his weak point. Instead we are given the longest drawn out dung heap of a scene in which Bilbo spends all his time with a dumb look on his face (most of the movie, in fact) and the dwarfs go about ridiculous plan to defeat the dragon with a plan that we already know won't work because it won't exploit Smaug's previously revealed weakness. What I am most upset about: how can these writers call themselves professionals after screwing up a dialog between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman?! Really?!<br/><br/>I ended the film feeling so disappointed I wanted to forget it existed and go back to watch the first film, which I enjoyed much more. But how can one watch a good beginning knowing how disappointing the rest is going to be?"
"khfan250","8","0","0","24 April 2014"," Great fun, but again, I ask: WHY DOES IT NEED TO BE SO LONG?!
","""The Lord of the Rings"" are not just some of the best fantasy films of all time, but three of the greatest films of all time. Period. Jackson's return to Middle-Earth in ""An Unexpected Journey"" was an enjoyable time, but suffered because of its length, pacing, and effects. Now we have ""The Desolation of Smaug"", Jackson's second installment in his new ""Hobbit"" trilogy. <br/><br/>There's much improvement in this film from ""Journey"", especially in terms of pacing. ""Journey"" took a little too long to get going, but in ""Desolation"" you are launched immediately into the action. This film is also a bit darker from the first, with the threat of war beginning to reveal itself.<br/><br/>The casting is still top notch. Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage do a great job in their respective roles, as they did in the first film. Jackson also does a lot better with identifying the other 12 dwarfs in this film, though some of them still aren't quite too developed. And the newest additions to the cast are great, as well, particularly Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon, Smaug, and the Necromancer.<br/><br/>The problems with this film are still ones that arise from the first film. Why does ""The Hobbit"" need to be split into 3 movies, each with a 2 1/2 to 3 hour length? If you want to make it a trilogy, by all means, do it. But they don't need to be that long! You can justify that sort of length in ""The Lord of the Rings"" because they are suppose to be these huge, epic movies. But ""The Hobbit"" was meant to be a children's story. <br/><br/>The effects in this movie have improved slightly over the first film. The crowning achievement in the movie is definitely the dragon. But the orcs still look really fake in this movie and there's a couple of scenes that you can tell they use too much green screen. This is a huge disappointment, especially considering that ""The Lord of the Rings"" had so many practical effects that made it look great.<br/><br/>Final verdict: ""The Desolation of Smaug"" does a much better job of telling the story of ""The Hobbit"" than its predecessor. It's fun, exciting, and makes for a good time in the theater. But the problems that plagued the first film sadly follow into this second installment, which prevents it from becoming a truly great fantasy film like ""The Lord of the Rings""."

","Visually stunning, the acting is pretty good too, Martin Freeman is so perfectly cast I think even Tolkien would have approved, how much else he would have approved only he knows, or maybe his son really does know,<br/><br/>It fees disjointed, but then, that seems to be in keeping with all the initial releases of Jackson's films. Its only when one gets the extended versions that so many more things make sense and you are left with a much better and rounded film, i only hope this time when the extended version of DoS comes out we get a little less background and a bit more film. I also wonder why the extended versions don't get cinematic release, after all, the colour, the incredible scenery and the visualisation is almost crying out for a massive release. <br/><br/>I guess I prefer Tolkien to Jackson and introducing new characters that i don't feel - at this stage that is-lend themselves to the whole concept has helped a great deal in changing that opinion and i am always left with the thought that Peter seems to have issues with the Elves, he always seems to want to make them tragic figures or is that a wild guess? i guess i will have to wait and see when there and back again comes out, preferably in its extended version. <br/><br/>I am left with the thought that normally the middle film of a trilogy is the weakest one and i guess that, unless the extended version amends this thought, this is hopefully the case here."
"eddie_baggins","7","0","0","13 January 2014"," An improvement over the first film but still to much filler
","It might not be easy to admit but we as film-goers have been well and truly spoiled over the last decade with films full of spectacle and wonder, worlds come alive with life due to the wonderments of modern technology. One only needs to look at any of Avatar, Harry Potter series, The Matrix series and the daddy of them all The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Peter Jackson's epic saga will always remain one of the best loved and amazing of journeys so when the first Hobbit was met with an overall meh reception it was somewhat blamed on perhaps to many comparing it to its great predecessors and now with Smaug released onto audiences it will allow us now to get a better idea of just how this trilogy is tracking and to answer that in my opinion it must be said pretty mediocre.<br/><br/>I am no way denying that I to am amongst the spoilt generation of film goers and I can not but help myself in comparing these films to the LOTR and when doing so the Hobbit films pale in comparison. It's no easy task putting your finger on exactly what makes this film lesser to the original trilogy but upon careful consideration it has to be put down to padding, plain and simple. Making a short book into a 3 part nigh on 9 hours worth of film was always an interesting choice and a choice that seriously could only have been to make more money as what has been designed to the pad the story out is easily the films weakest points.<br/><br/>Love stories, return of past characters and brazzingly unneeded opening scene director cameos fill Smaug and puts a dent in the story which is and basically should be a bunch of dwarfs walking around dangerous country side to sneak into a mountain and steal from a slumbering dragon. Great scenes from the novel are adapted well by Jackson but are always separated by scenes that bring the mood back down and a consistent checking of the time will be in order by the viewer as the 160 minute run time is interrupted by these segments. Sounding so petty in the written word it may seem like mere 1st world problems but there are elements to this film that can not be ignored, the film featuring some stand out action scenes, Jacksons typical eye for detail (Middle Earth still feels amazingly alive) and a great introduction of the ominous dragon Smaug. For these moments alone Desolation needs to be seen on a big screen and remains an at times must see entertainment spectacle that will please many a Tolkenite the world over.<br/><br/>Pondering how to best sum up Desolation over a couple of weeks has been no easy feat and by now all know what to expect from Jackson's film so here goes nothing.<br/><br/>Desolation is a step up from the first snooze worthy adventure and has moments that could stand equal to the original trilodgy (barrel river sequence in particular). Desolation however again feels bloated in parts and still doesn't have a Frodo or an Aragon to lead it forward, with the dwarfs again remaining frustratingly hard to appreciate. Desolation needs to be seen on the big screen and hopefully now after 2 somewhat lacking start up entries the finale will be what we have all been waiting for – a film with heart, spectacle, characters we care for and one seriously angry dragon.<br/><br/>3 and a half Steven Colbert cameos out of 5"

","The hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the fresh new film in the hobbit trilogy that follows Bilbo's adventure with the dwarfs to reclaim their homeland of erebor from the foursome dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>Well, before I start I would like to point out that I did really really enjoy the first one so that probably tells you already that I thoroughly enjoyed the second one and would rank it on par with the first.<br/><br/>First, lets start with the changes from the book. There are several, yes but as i said in the first one, none detract from the story and only add to the epic, web of plots and story arcs that peter Jackson has created. Not only has he brought in classic characters from the book such as Bard the Bowman, Thranduil (the elven king) and Smaug. He has greatly developed the characters and enhanced the characteristics shown in the book to give them all fully-fledged personalities and help create tolkiens vision on screen.<br/><br/>I think, with regards to changes to the book, one must take a step back and realise that Peter Jackson is making some of these changes to appeal to a wider audience (people who haven't read the book). For example, (SPOILER) when the dwarfs have their showdown with the dragon at the end, which i will admit could of been a couple of minutes shorter, you must note that this happened purely to build upon the story and to make it more plausible to people who hadn't read the book. the dwarfs had travelled all the way across middle-earth so as a casual viewer, you would probably expect some sort of a showdown between them. You also have to remember that this film needed a climatic finale, as i don't think Bilbo talking to smaug would of satisfied the ending of an epic film such as this. My conclusion is that this and pretty much all other changes were justifiable and only add to the story.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Tauriel , as a female character was greatly welcomed and fit perfectly as an elf of mirkwood. Her and Legolas seemed to effortlessly kill orcs and you really get the sense that they had been doing it for years.<br/><br/>Overall, I had only 3 minor, very minor problems with the second instalment. problem 1: some areas of the romance between tauriel and kili were cringe-worthy and didn't feel right to me. Luckily, they decided not to make this element a major part of the film and this is easily forgettable. Problem 2 is the use of a particular type of camera in the barrel sequence. It seems to be a go-pro camera and whilst some thought it was ""cool"", i thought it had really bad quality, and didn't look right at all. Although, there are only 3 quick shots with this camera during the sequence, it doesn't work for me. However, the scene swiftly redeemed itself with a brilliant set piece with entertaining action. Truly, a highlight of the movie! My last problem was with the last action sequence with the dwarfs and Smaug. This is a really picky problem and I still believe this scene was relevant but maybe could of been drawn back a couple of minutes (not an exaggeration, literally only 5 minutes maximum).<br/><br/>There are so many good things about this movie and I will touch on the best of them briefly.<br/><br/>The barrel sequence. Probably, the best sequence in the movie. I love how peter Jackson took this iconic sequence in the book and adapted it into an action packed sequence, and see no shame in it at all. It is brilliant as so much is happening and features brilliant moments from Orland Bloom's Legolas, who has his usual Badassery. <br/><br/>Smaug. What can I say, Samug looks and sounds AMAZING. the CGI is as realistic as I've ever seen. They got his appearance and his size just right and the voice-over work from Benedict Cumberbatch is mixed perfectly to create an amazing voice for the creature. You truly have to hold your breath when Bilbo first see's him in Erebor.<br/><br/>Laketown, the set for Laketown was really impressive. you really got a feel for this struggling, worn and old town ruled over by Stephen Fry's the master, another character who's personality is envisioned in the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Lastly, Bilbo. As in the first film, Martin Freeman delivers another fantastic performance as Bilbo. Freeman perfectly captures the rings effect on Bilbo at the start of the film and his courage which has become more apparent since the end of the first film, and is even stated by Bilbo himself. What I especially like is, so far throughout the first two films, you can spot several moments where Bilbo is captivated by the world around him and is actually enjoying his adventure. For example, when he visits Rivendell, or where he gets a ride from the eagles. In this film, we see it when he pokes his head above the tree's in Mirkwood. These are the moments that define Bilbo's change in character and whether intentional or not, they are brilliant to watch!<br/><br/>There is more I could talk about, but I wont bore you with my Fandom! The bottom line is that Desolation of Smaug retains its charm from the first film and explores new areas of middle earth with magnificence. This film definitely builds tension for the final film and in general, is a very entertaining film for all ages."

","I have immensely enjoyed the LOTR trilogy and even found the first Hobbit movie to be a competent adaptation of the Tolkien novel. Yet DOS is easily Peter Jackson's weakest, most desperate entry: completely smothering, diluting, and contradicting the source material. Worse, it even fails as its own adaptive entry in Peter Jackson's Hobbit tale with paper thin characterizations, bloated and empty action sequences, and a series of plot holes added not only to the Tolkien lore, but also in the plot line concocted by Peter Jackson's team.<br/><br/>MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT: <br/><br/>To keep this a proper length, I'll just say that the first 30 minutes is a mix of abridged Tolkien and weak filler.<br/><br/>The first most glaring plot shift in this alternate Jackson plot line involves Legalos and Tamriel as a betrothed couple, characters who were never in the book, and a preposterous love triangle involving Kili the dwarf. This really insults the intelligence of anyone vaguely familiar with the Tolkien-verse and is just stupidly contrived even when divorced from Tolkien lore. The romance is so undercooked and contrived between Tamriel and Kili that it is extremely difficult to take seriously. A wood elf, of a race/species that had been mortal enemies of dwarfs for centuries, suddenly starts a serious love affair with a dwarf after some clichéd banter and forced sob story. All the while willing to break up with Legalos.<br/><br/>At any rate, everything Tolkien wrote in the Hobbit to expand upon and add charm and suspense to everything up to the Wood Elf fortress narrative was completely pared down to the bone. If not for the love story involving Kili, Bilbo would have rescued them all within 10 minutes of capture--a complete mockery of the Tolkien narrative.<br/><br/>Of course it's clear to see why that part needed to be rushed through: to get to the wall to wall river action! Not only does this whole scene look patently phoney, it may well be one of the most mindless sequences yet created in Jackson's Middle Earth. The heroes become nigh immortal, characters become weightless and defy physics for no other reason than to kill as many orcs as possible as flashy as possible, and the elves apparently have limitless arrow ammunition and can subdue orcs by sheer brute strength. The elves in particular are essentially gods that can only be touched through painfully awkward plot contrivance. Even the most near-impossible stunt in the LOTR trilogy doesn't approach this level of fan-wankery.<br/><br/>However, late in the film, we get more idiotic and pointless action sequences in Laketown. Apparently, orcs manage to infiltrate to town and for some reason the dwarfs and elves are the only residents willing to fight back despite heavily armed guards roaming the streets previously. 'Cuz we don't want anyone else hogging the glory of the elves beating down orc fodder like something out of an Asian martial arts film. To further insult the viewer's intelligence, not a single person is known to have been killed in the assault. Why are orcs considered a threat again? By far the stupidest scene is the depiction of Legalos chasing the orc leader across a bridge to the mainland. That's right, a bridge to the mainland--a conceit that makes the entire infiltration of the city, the entire premise of the island's isolation a complete and utter farce. Why there's not so much as a drawbridge is mind-bogglingly lazy.<br/><br/>Firstly, Bilbo never again wears the ring even though it's the only sane thing to do under the circumstances. Supposedly, Bilbo is being corrupted by the ring which is complete bullocks considering Hobbits are suppose to be immune to its effects for long periods of time. In the Jackson-verse narrative, Bilbo seemingly only got the ring days ago. Bilbo is completely unaffected by it during his adventure in the Tolkien novel with much more time passing with the ring in JRR's narrative. Also, Smaug can supposedly sense the ring on him while he's invisible, but he never does again even while Bilbo is stupidly running around visible. The contradiction especially apparent while Bilbo spends a lengthy amount of time to grab the Arkenstone but somehow it never dawns on him to do it while invisible.<br/><br/>Once the dwarfs enter the Erebor (Smaug's lair) is when the movie goes completely off the rails into sheer camp. They bait the dragon and go through a 20+ minutes chase sequence with Smaug being constantly outmaneuvered and outsmarted by these dwarfs despite living in Erebor for almost 100 years. What was once a dangerous and crafty creature turns into one of the Keystone Kops, unable to torch even one dwarf despite all the foreshadowing of Smaug being aware of the scent of dwarfs. Yet, when they walk right over or under him, he's completely oblivious. At one point, Thorin stands on Smaug's snout, yet instead of slurping him up with his tongue or roasting him with a brief blast of flame from his nostrils, Thorin is given ample time to escape and still impossibly dodge a pillar of flame without so much as a sunburn.<br/><br/>Through all this, Bilbo's role is sidelined for Thorin's Batman-esque heroics. Smaug doesn't even seem like he's really tricked by Bilbo's ""barrel-rider"" boast 20 minutes earlier--why he even mentions it after being harassed for so long by the dwarfs is anyone's guess. Even when Smaug starts for Laketown on his own (finally!), the most mind-numbing scene occurs where Smaug is lured and then engulfed by a giant dwarven statue melting on top of him like molasses, completely engulfed, then shaking it all off like a wet dog. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes. How Bilbo himself managed to keep himself from being liquified by the splashing molten gold dripping off of Smaug is irrelevant at this point. It's a real capstone of ""what were they thinking?"" that pervades this film."

"Aimar_the_hobbit","10","4","12","16 December 2013"," Different from the book, Still a good adaptation!
","I went to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug on its opening day and it totally made my day. Firstly, I must say it is quite different from the book. All the middle chapters are there, but the details are different, and there are many additional scenes apart from the book. The additional scenes of Gandalf and Legolas served well as a connection to LOTR, while the addition of Tauriel character seems to serve fan girls and add some love story to the adaptation. In my humble opinion, the additional scenes work pretty well. However, let's wait and see how it will unfold in the third film.<br/><br/>Now that I've seen the film in both HFR3D and 2D, I'd say I recommend the HFR3D. The images are far crisper. The action scenes look more thrilling, especially the spiders scene and the barrel-riding scene. However, the 2D version is also good for the dramatic scenes. I tear up a bit when watching the dwarfs finally back in their home, Erebor.<br/><br/>I can say that fans of Legolas, Thranduil, Kili and Bard will be happy watching this second Hobbit film. They have lots of scenes. A little disappointment may be for Beorn fans (actually myself included). Beorn scene is quite short, compared to his long chapter in the book. But that's understandable because film is different from book. Anyway, it would be better if they reduced some air time of Smaug and give it to Beorn. The Smaug scene, though important, is somewhat overlong.<br/><br/>Overall – 9.5/10 This is a great film, so please go watch it with your own eyes. :)"

The rest of the bunch does a fantastic job supporting and carrying on in the ever-so-slightly parts that tend to drag. <br/><br/>The action is dynamic and captivating, and the suspense is easily amplified from most films, which is led by one of the biggest yet satisfying cliffhangers in a film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>However, if I am to review Hobbit 2...I need to review the stand-alone title-bound character that kicks the bad-assitude level to 11:<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug the Magnificent Dragon.<br/><br/>Holy. Sh*t.<br/><br/>Smaug just fills the screen with sheer beauty. The way he slithers in the gold, the way his facial expressions curl as he speaks, and his size in general made me need a new pair of pants! His fight scene is pure awesomeness, and the end, when he is briefly encased in a body of gold, it may have been the most beautiful creature scene I have seen since I first saw Godzilla in action!<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has created, once again for the 5th time, a remarkable experience of Middle Earth. The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is...just reminiscing of every scene is enough for me to say it.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is my favorite movie ever.<br/><br/>11/10, if you leave the theater disappointed and annoyed, you probably saw a different movie, because there is just no way you will not leave satisfied...unless you hate cliffhangers-but that only adds to how much you will want to see how Peter Jackson closes out the Hobbit Franchise.<br/><br/>F*CKING SEE THIS MOVIE!"

Then the missing scene from the first part of 'Hobbit' commence where the great wizard Gandalf the Grey offers the help to the dwarfs to reclaim their kingdom. After that the narration continues from where it ended in 'An Unexpected Journey'. The nonstop exciting journey of dwarfs proceeds in the middle-earth nothing lesser than its earlier part with the company of a Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. So the hope remains in Thorin, the next king of Erebor to fight back their enemy and take a revenge.<br/><br/>The missing in this movie is the Gollum, I don't think he will come back in the next installment as well. A little disappointing for Gandalf fans as well. He was not in action as much we aspired to see his magical stuffs. If you are a die hard 'The Lord of the Rings' the list goes on. In another way it is great to see new faces around. But you must remember it is not the movie(s) about the 'ring', it is the dwarfs tale where it all happens before Gimli, son of Gloin.<br/><br/>Like I said the good thing is the reintroduction of the Elvin prince of Woodland Realm, Legolas. Last time we saw him in the final battle of middle-earth in the movie 'The Return of the King'. The 'Lost' fame Evangeline Lilly was the newest major addition of the series and she was amazing. She lonely fulfilled the due of women's contribution of this particular movie of 'Hobbit' trilogy. Like she Luke Evans was also had a prominent role but I guess his major action sequences will come in the next part.<br/><br/>In this and next paragraph I gonna write some good's and bad's of this movie. I wanna begin by saying HFR was unbelievable, the picture quality was very good with no blurs in fast panning camera sequences. I know few people may get hard time to adjust with smoothness in motion but you will get used to it if you already saw the first. Compared to 'An Unexpected Journey' it had a little more drama in story narration but as usual it had the adventures that happen in a tight situation. There's a similar kind escape scene what we had seen under the mountain kingdom Goblin. Here which happen in the water I mean the river where dwarfs are getting escaped from the Elves and of course the Arcs.<br/><br/>""My arm is like tenfold shields, my teeth are like swords, my claws are the spear, the shock of my tail is a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane and my breath death"" is what the Smaug describes himself angrily. In this whole movie all I expected was to see the Smaug, the last great dragon of middle-earth. As we know it was an adaptation of children's book so I was curious to see Smaug to talk. In all the last four movies I have not seen talking animal as per my knowledge. The first time I got the impression of the root base of fantasy touch like we had seen in 'Narnia' and 'Harry Potter' movie series. The British actor Benedict Cumberbatch gave his incredible voice and performance through motion capture to the Smaug.<br/><br/>There's nothing we can do than have a peek while it is in the cinema hall. As usual this movie will bomb the box office. I am already beginning to think about the 2015 Christmas holiday, without 'Hobbit' it will be most disappointment festival season. As for now I gonna end 2013 with this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Tolkien would have been blown away to see his own creation in a breathtaking motion picture. He wrote it keeping in mind children, as based on a children the movie achieved the heights that no one ever imagined which attracted the adults more than children. So all the credits go to the man behind it, Peter Jackson and then the his cast and crew. Now I have to wait another 365 days to have the grand finale of the 'Hobbit' series, feels like one more decade to go. In the mean time I might see it again and wait for the Blu-ray. So what's your plan..."
"raghid-karam-868-78368","10","4","12","14 December 2013"," Excellent Film
","This movie for me is perfect unlike some reviews state...from filming to acting to the storyline, it all adds up to one extraordinary film. I have been a huge fan of JRR Tolkien and LOTR trilogy are my favorite movies and i think The Hobbit Trilogy should earn at least as much appreciation as LOTR. The first Hobbit Movie (An unexpected Journey) has already been taken out of the IMDb top 250 thats already a mistake, but after seeing the Desolation of Smaug, i thought that this one would at least earn as much acclaim as the two towers. anyone who gives this movie less than an 8.5 is wrong in my opinion because it deserves much more than that. it keeps you interested and hooked till the last second and even after the last scene, you still want more. i agree that the addition of the love story between Tauriel and Kili isn't the highlight of the movie but it still adds a feminine touch to the film that is absent in the book. Plus,i think that it is crucial for us to know about When Gandalf wonders alone into Dol Guldur to check for the evil there. It is part of the story and it is crucial for the third movie where the Battle of the 5 Armies occurs knowing that dwarfs, elves and humans are uniting against this evil coming from Dol Guldur and also knowing that Sauron was trying to come back slightly before LOTR started."

"johntomccarty","10","3","8","17 October 2014"," I see it and enjoy it very much
","As a rather quiet, conservative person, it's surprising to all I know that I am so hooked on this series of movies. From a visual perspective, the scenery is gorgeous and the backgrounds stunning with marvelous attention to fine details. The action scenes lend themselves to breathless anticipation and quite a few hearty laughs. Smaug is as awesome and fearsome as Bilbo declares in his wonderful encounter with the dragon. Overall, the characters develop with layers that lend a richness I see in very few films. I enjoy Bilbo and his rise from a somewhat shallow existence. Gandalf is secretive, humorous, and determined. I love the fresh background on Legolas, and Lee Pace is captivating as Thranduil. Richard Armitage's portrayal of Thorin is masterful when it comes to building his character with the finest nuances of expression. I know this movie in particular doesn't follow Tolkien to the letter, but the result is no less satisfying or captivating for the changes."
"terrellrobinson71","8","3","8","10 April 2014"," Peter Jackson breathes fire (and makes more magic) in the middle chapter of The Hobbit
","Just as I predicted, a middle chapter, like ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", that manages to be better this time around. As we all know back in 2012, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (or ""snooze"", if you didn't feel like sitting through another Middle-earth journey), we got to know Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, Thorin Oakenshield and the dwarfs as they go on their quest to destroy the vicious dragon Smaug and to reclaim the dwarfs' homeland of Erebor. As if we didn't know, but giving the fact that it is based on one whole book by J.R.R. Tolkien (Author of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), the first part of the three-part series took them on unexpected adventures and it felt kind of natural to see it come to life. Now we enter with ""The Hobbit 2"" or as we like to call it ""The Desolation of Smaug"" and thank Durin for Peter Jackson for bringing us a spectacular adventure that is magical, epic and sharp as a sword. Continuing on their Quest, Bilbo (the always reliable Martin Freeman), Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the dwarfs, including Balin (Ken Stott), Kili (Aidan Turner), Fili (Dean O'Gorman), Dwalin (Graham McTavish) and Bofur (James Nesbitt) are hiding from killer Orcs including Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett) and their Wargs who wants nothing more than Thorin's head on something. Gandalf (The always remarkable Sir Ian McKellan) joins too, but goes away to search for more clues involving The Necromancer along with Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy). Along the way, as they make their way back to Erebor, Bilbo and the dwarfs encounter some wickedly dangerous spiders, Mirkwood Elves, including returning regular Orlando Bloom as Legolas and Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel, and also traveling in a town full of Men called Lake-town before trying to reach the almighty dragon known as Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). When they go back to Erebor to find Smaug and the Dwarfs' heirloom known as the Arkenstone, you wouldn't believe me when I tell you that it's one of the most spectacular moments ever brought on film. Here's the thing: You have to wait 108 minutes of that to get to see Bilbo meeting the dragon. Other than the meeting with Gollum and a rather nasty run-in with three trolls, Bilbo seeing Smaug is one of the more iconic passages from the book. And Peter Jackson brings it to life, proving once again that he is a visual genius who refuses to back down and let the special effects, no matter how brilliant they are, tell the story. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" surprised me from beginning to end. It had to, despite the fact it's 8 minutes shorter than the first film and I still happen to be one of the skeptics who believes that 1 book does not create a trilogy of films. But having seen both of the films, I actually realized that, so far, they are not that bad. It breathes the story a bit more and the characters happen to grow a bit more stronger and the films tends to get a bit more darker while it happens to be lighter than ""The Lord of the Rings"". And while I admire Bilbo's bravery, Thorin's stubbornness and courage as well as developing some impressive leadership skills and Gandalf's wiseness (even though he has limited screen time than the rest), it's the supporting characters that gives ""The Desolation of Smaug"" a bit more sting, like Bilbo's sword. Lilly's Tauriel, a new addition to the film, is feisty, strong and rebellious and she's got a crush on Kili. Bloom as Legolas is awesome and is always good with a bow with arrows. Mikael Persbrandt drops by as Beorn, a skin-changer, a character I remembered very well from the book. And Stephen Fry commands his scenes as the likable but very corrupt Mayor of Lake-town. But for me, the scene-stealers are Lee Pace who is excellent as the Elvenking Thranduil, Legolas' father and Luke Evans (from ""Immortals"" and ""Fast and Furious 6"") who delivers a exceptional performance as Bard the Bowman, a character very expanded from the book, but amazingly, it works. I hope that everything falls into place when ""The Battle of the Five Armies"" hits theaters later this year and that it does not disappoint Tolkien enthusiasts and audiences who are so desperate to know what happens next, when it ends with a few wickedly stunning surprises and a cliffhanger so stunning that proves that when the time comes, all Hell will break loose. I'm so relieved that ""The Hobbit"" has managed to get an upgrade this time with the second chapter, and it's not just because of the awesome special effects, but those who love the story will get to see that there's a bit more heart and soul and that the magic of Middle-earth is not going anywhere. Plus, you get one cool barrel ride and some good Orc decapitations to go along with it."
"sahdia","9","3","8","25 February 2014"," Great interpretation of the beloved book
","Having read the book several times by myself and to my children, I had my own set of expectations of course and was especially hoping to find certain scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>The fear of finding a movie which ruined the story wasn't there, because I trust these film makers. <br/><br/>The movie was even better than I expected. Yes, some scenes I hoped for weren't in it, one of my favourite ones from the book included and there were new additions, but it was all done in taste and it didn't hurt the story the way the movies are telling it. And we should consider this movie more of a prequel to LOTR movies instead of just a screen adaptation of the book alone."
"atedmon2","8","3","8","8 January 2014"," The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug Review
","So the second installment of The Hobbit came out this past weekend, Peter Jackson's newest blockbuster film from the world of Tolkien that acts as a set of prequels to the original Lord of the Ring movies that came out from 2001-2003. These films were considered the most ambitious film projects ever attempted in terms of budget and scope; they were also a critical success. About a decade later in July 2012 Peter Jackson made the announcement that he would be making The Hobbit into another big epic trilogy and it earned him heaps of backlash. After all, JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit is a 300 page kid's book. It would require a ton of padding, little artistic liberties and additional character development to draw it out into three whole Peter Jackson length films. The whole thing still smacks of exploitative franchise marketing kind of in the same vein of George Lucas's Star Wars Episode 1-3 prequels. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey didn't really do much to help negate this opinion at all since it felt slow and suffered from bad prequel-itis, trying to tack on as many tie-ins as it could to the original movies. If you weren't a big JRR Tolkien fan like myself than you would have found it dragged in places. <br/><br/>That being said, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug has accelerated the pace and it is a much stronger and more thrilling film than it's predecessor. There are still parts of the film that sedate you into a bored stupor but then you have incredibly exciting scenes that instantly knock you back into consciousness. The barrel scene feels like the roaring rapids 6 flags ride, with dozens of fights going on between elves, orcs and dwarfs up in the trees above the water, in the water, the amount of stuff going on speeds these exciting segments along and turns what was originally barely two pages of brief narration in the book into a good half hour scene. I was really glad that some of the parts in The Hobbit were drawn out longer than they needed to be in this movie because they make the characters seem less like fanciful fantasy creations invented for children and more like the action-oriented badasses that belong in the same world that The Lord of the Rings movies created. The Desolation of Smaug takes a much darker turn, abandoning the dwarf songs and quirky snot humor, focusing on thematic elements of greed and possessiveness that go beyond just the dominion of the ring. Thorin battles with his desire to obtain his kingdom under the mountain once again even when it comes into conflict with what's morally right. These are little conflicts that were considerably downplayed in the original Hobbit story but they make for interesting character development in a film. Though regardless of how long Peter Jackson makes these movies no one is ever going to know every dwarf's name by heart. JRR Tolkien didn't even bother giving each and every dwarf nuanced and defining personality traits; it's interesting the lengths that the director is taking in order to create memorable characters here. <br/><br/>On the subject of memorable characters I'm going to move onto the real reason that you want to go see this movie. Smaug the Terrible, Smaug the Impenetrable. Smaug the Magnificent. This could easily be one of the most malevolent movie characters of all time that should be included up there with Darth Vader, the Joker and Hannibal. Peter Jackson mentioned in an interview that more than anything he wanted to convey terror with this character by the impressiveness of his size. So this monster's head would be the size of a bus. His body would be the size of a 747 and everything else would be to scale accordingly. I highly highly highly recommend going and seeing this movie in a theater and in 3D because Smaug is well worth it. A little television screen is not going to do this character any kind of justice. Benedict Cumberbach is the voice of the dragon, which fills up the entire theater and rattles every bone in your body as he plays psychological mind games with Bilbo. Without a doubt the Smaug scenes are the most impressive and for me personally, just for this particular character, I am very glad the divided the book up into a trilogy just so the audience could spend more time with this famous dragon.<br/><br/>Read entire review here-> https://www.facebook.com/jen.tedmon/posts/776910072334863"
"bobbylikeajoe","10","3","8","2 January 2014"," What a great film
","Well, great, but not LOTR great. <br/><br/>It is clearly very well done and hard work done by Jackson and crew really shows here. <br/><br/>I can't understand why people can compare these to the Star Wars Prequels. Those were at an extremely low quality, with bad acting, bad story, and bad special effects. The Hobbit is so much better, though still not as good as LOTR.<br/><br/>The action sequences are engaging and entertaining, but a lot of room for character development is still left. And that dragon: wow.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie and a spectacular achievement in filmmaking."
"alexsearle7848","10","3","8","27 December 2013"," Up to lord of the rings standards !!!!!!
","The Hobbit: the Desolation of smaug was exactly what this trilogy needed and peter Jackson did an excellent job! <br/><br/>The first hobbit movie to me was a great movie but didn't have the intensity like the lord of the rings first movie did and it didn't feel like much was on the line but while watching the Desolation of Smaug i once again felt the amount of pressure and intensity like i did when first watching the lord of the Rings <br/><br/>this movie straight away is filed with action and shows us middle earth like never before, each character does get there own special moment in this movie which i think is great and martin freeman really is the best possible choice for Bilbo. <br/><br/>The things i thought might go wrong for the movie like having legolas in it worked perfect and i didn't know how peter was gonna do smaug but what he did was amazing <br/><br/>SMAUG no doubt earned himself a spot as one of the greatest villains of all time along with villains like the joker,Darth vader etc.. he really was terrifying and the scenes with smaug are some of the most intense moments in the hobbit or lord of the rings... Benedict cumberbatch voice for smaug is as memorable as andy's gollum voice... <br/><br/>if you are worried about this not having as much action as lord of the rings then fear not because this movie has one of the greastest action scenes i have seen this year and is filled from start to finish with amazing action scenes <br/><br/>Thorin and all the dawfs are still as amazing as they were in the first hobbit film and Gandalf the Grey is one serious bad ass as usual<br/><br/>the only problem i have with the hobbit is some of the cgi!! i much rather the orcs to be real people dressed up instead of cgi. i find it lazy and doesn't feel as real but other then that i have no problem with the film and enjoyed it.. <br/><br/>a must watch film and defiantly one of the best of the year"
"iris-teparic","10","3","8","29 December 2013"," My thoughts on ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug""
","First of all, I would like to point out that my jaw dropped while watching this movie. I did not expect it to be this good, and I have to congratulate Peter Jackson for doing such an amazing job. I was afraid that it would turn out too childish, but the sequel to ""The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey"" is a bit darker, more powerful and serious than the first part of the trilogy. And I like it that way!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were minor things that I disliked:<br/><br/>The character of Bard was very predictable. He is the champion of the common folk, a good but poor man that is obviously going to be the one to slay the dragon. I didn't even have to watch to the end to know that he has the third black arrow somewhere or that his ancestor has failed to kill the beast and let the town down. No, Bard just didn't work for me, he was way too perfect to be a realistic person. I didn't hate him, but I can't say that I loved him either. The actor (Luke Evans) was good, though, so I can't say that Bard was a total failure.<br/><br/>The Master of Laketown and his loyal servant Alfrid annoyed me quite a bit. Regarding that they are evil, I wanted to be scared of them, not just annoyed every time they show up. Alfrid just reminded me of Wormtongue from the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Another thing that I didn't like was Thorin's relationship with Bilbo. In the first movie, there is a really cute scene in the end, where Thorin hugs Bilbo and accepts him as a companion and a friend. But, in the second movie - it's like that scene never happened! If you watch the trailer, on example, you will see him speaking of his 'friend' Bilbo with Balin, and he refers to Bilbo with just ""burglar"". Oh, come on! I thought that we have passed that stage, he saved your life! But, even though this mood swings sometimes made me angry at the character, I enjoyed Thorin much more than the perfect Bard.<br/><br/>These details almost made me lower the rating, but there were so many things that I loved about this epic story that I just couldn't force myself to rate it under 10/10. <br/><br/>The thing that amazed me in the very first half hour of watching this movie was the way they created the giant spiders. They were so realistic looking that I felt like I was standing right there, with Bilbo, in front of them. Of course, because of that and because of Martin Freeman's amazing acting, I felt connected to Bilbo and was rooting for him until the very end. What more can I ask from a main character?<br/><br/>I also loved the elves. Legolas appeared, and at first - I was afraid that he won't fit in the story. I mean, in the book, he isn't even mentioned, and isn't supposed to be in this movie. But, after seeing the whole thing, I have to admit that I'm glad that they put him in. His fight scenes were unrealistic, but fun to watch, and his little love interest for a she-elf that doesn't really love him back was interesting too. Speaking of Tauriel, while reading the other reviews, I noticed that people didn't really like the love triangle that the writers decided to put in. Well, I need to say that I did! And I'll tell you why:<br/><br/>I didn't expect one to appear. I thought that this love thing will be just as predictable as Bard is. Legolas falls for a fellow elf girl, and oh look - she loves him back! Isn't that just perfect and unexpected?! Well, no it's not. It would be much more boring to watch, trust me on this one. No one even thought of a dwarf-elf romance before the movie started, and no one knew how it would end... I was hooked, and I could barely wait to see how it turns out. I must say that I don't really understand why everyone is so upset by their little romance. I don't think it's love, because they don't know each other long enough, but they obviously have a crush on each other that might turn into love with time. Who knows?<br/><br/>Oh well, enough with the romance part. Let's move on to the best part of this almost three hours long movie: Smaug. <br/><br/>The best word to describe him truly is: stupendous. The voice acting done by Benedict Cumberbatch was more than perfect, the dragon was frightening and very realistic. His interactions with Bilbo were very interesting to watch, and I think that the most memorable scene in the movie is either the barrel scene (in which Legolas shines, by the way) or the great finale in which Smaug rises from the molten gold, flies towards Laketown and you hear him say: ""I am fire... I am... Death!"". That simple sentence was the best ending I could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>I was so blown away by this movie that I just wanted to stay there two more hours and watch it all over again. It would be even better to see the third movie, of course, but I'll have to wait a year to enjoy the finale of this great trilogy."
"akchouksey","8","3","8","18 December 2013"," Better than its prequel...a good watch
","Peter Jackson has once again brought out a movie so beautiful as expected.Once again he takes the viewers to world of middle earth. The film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is nicely done, and the 3D adds to your viewing experience, especially in the ""white water rafting"" scene.The whole movie has good editing. The movie has a flow throughout unlike its prequel in which I felt little stagnation.If you are going to watch it in 3D, believe me you are gonna have hell of a good experience.As far as the ending is concerned it is sudden.Anyways I would highly recommend you to go to theaters and enjoy it."
"YJLcool","8","3","8","18 December 2013"," Still a worthy fantasy action adventure epic to watch
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues the exciting adventure of the hobbit Bilbo with 13 dwarfs and Gandalf (although he left halfway to investigate an important matter) to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor, which happens early before the events of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>As a prequel to famous The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug proved to be an entertaining, engaging and enjoyable fantasy adventure epic, much better than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in terms of action, humour and CGI and makeup effects for the beasts and creatures of the lore. The scenery shots for the film were magnificent as well. It's nice to see an old character again, the fan favourite (for females), Legolas, the brief mentioning of Gimli and the resurgence of Sauron and his dark forces.<br/><br/>Although there are various subplots found in the film (introduction of a movie-only character, the meeting with Beorn and elves of Mirkwood, Tauriel and her brief romance with Kili, Gandalf's investigation and his eventual confrontation of an old and powerful foe, introduction of Bard and the people of Lake Town, the appearance of Smaug), Jackson managed them well by balancing the subplots with some exciting action scenes. Notably, the barrel chase, confrontation between Gandalf and 'Necromancer', Bilbo and Smaug scenes were well made enough to be considered the best scenes of the trilogy so far.<br/><br/>Tauriel, the silvan elf is a great new addition to the LOTR lore, proving to be a capable fierce warrior like Legolas. It's always interesting to see a strong, capable woman in a male-dominating story. On the other hand, the appearance of Smaug is truly a presence to behold as we don't often see dragons of this scale in films.<br/><br/>Despite its merits, it might be too far of a stretch to make a trilogy from a single book as it never feels as epic and grand as the LOTR trilogy...seemingly lacking a compelling central plot to move the story forward for a 161-mins film. The film also suffers from numerous contrivances, a common problem to many fantasy films...just to name a few: the spiders that manage to catch the group are not eating them immediately, Legolas & Tauriel seemingly always arrive in the nick of time to rescue the main characters, Bard the Bowman just happens to be around when they need help to cross the river, Smaug doesn't kill Bilbo immediately when he knows that he's there to steal the Arkenstone for the dwarfs...<br/><br/>Although the film ends in a cliffhanger (and its shortcomings), which may upset some audience or fans, it's still proved to be a satisfying fun watch and I find myself excited to watch the last instalment of the trilogy, The Hobbit: There and Back Again next year."

","Holy-Moly! That was one hell of a dragon. By far the best I've witnessed. Benedict made him sound even more vicious. Good call by Peter on those realistic cameras. You almost doubt all those creatures' authenticity. Dol Guldur is superbly portrayed. Cameras there would scale across the hideout. It reminds you of all those epic games you played growing up. HFR was pretty dope!<br/><br/>Tauriel and Legolas are magnificent as archers. Their fight sequences would make you jump on your seats. Teamwork of Dwarfs is impressive. The chemistry between Tauriel and Kili too is heart melting. Martin Freeman is perfect in The Hobbit shoes, as usual. Lee Pace carves his character of ElvenKing just brilliantly. <br/><br/>Smaug: Visual effects, the grandeur, expressions, dread that it caused, havoc that it created - simply out of the world! The conversation between Bilbo and the spectacular dragon is beautifully portrayed. You wouldn't miss Golem at all!<br/><br/>Necromancer is laconic yet his presence - profound and revere again for Benedict Cumberbatch \m/. Now an Epic ending is in the making. All hail Peter Jackson. All hail Smaug!"
"philipp-620-836082","6","3","8","16 December 2013"," could be better
","The CGI is great and the story a bit richer than in the book. ""Desolation of Smaug"", however, has not the fast pace of ""An Unexpected Journey"". Unfortunately, the audience is ""robbed"" of two beautiful book scenes. First, when the party arrives at Beorn they're chased by the angry bear Beorn. In the book they march pair-wise each 5 minutes to Beorn's door and introduce them beautifully and very politely. Of course, this does not work in the movie as the party's constantly chased by Azog. Second, in the forest they're attacked by the giant spiders. The whole ""attercop"" dialogue of the book is missing. Instead, it's a slautherhouse. Then, there are a few question marks in the logic of the story line. First, what sense does an unguarded ring ghosts jail on a mountain top make if no one guards it? Why put an unsafe jail up there in the first place? Second, why fight a dragon insight the mountain who decided to leave anyway to take revenge on the lake people? Third, why doesn't Sauron just kill Gandalf once he gets hold of him? Gandalf's of no use for Sauron. Fourth, when the drawfs and the elves fight the orks in the lake city there are absolutely no inhabitants or guards in the city. However, the noise of the fight is horrendous. As soon as the dragon wakes (but is not yet seen and no noise at all) the city is populated again and all are shocked."

","A lot of people were waiting for this movie. One year passed and here it is! <br/><br/>Same music, same faces in the big screen! <br/><br/>I liked this movie almost the same as I liked the first one. But I can't give it 10 points. I don't know why, maybe I don't liked some actors, maybe some scenes or the movie was a bit too long, maybe HFR 3D sometimes wasn't so good, and I thought how it will looked in the good old 2D format...<br/><br/>As I understand some viewers of this film are die-hard fans, some just like it for one or another reason, some are angry for changing the storyline from Tolkien's book. <br/><br/>Now I want to say that it's know only about LOTR and Tolkien. Now it is about Peter Jackson too. He does what very little people have done. All in all, Peter Jackson do not fails. This is why he enters the cinema (and popular culture) history. This director put Tolkien in the whole new level of understanding, he showed us new perspective to this brilliant piece of literature. <br/><br/>This is how I look at The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Not as this film could be understood on it's own, but in the wider perspective of popular culture and fantasy cinema."

","I have not read any of the LOTR or Hobbit books, but I am a big fan of the LOTR movies.<br/><br/>After watching 'The Hobbit – An Unexpected Journey', I did not have great expectations from this sequel. However, within 10 minutes into the movie I felt much better. It is much more creative and more entertaining at various levels. The Lord of the Rings experience was back and I would even say The Hobbit : desolation of Smaug has taken entire LOTR package to another level.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Gandalf meeting Thorin at 'The Prancing Pony' pub at Bree, same place where the hobbits in LOTR will meet Aragorn. Gandalf convinces Thorin to go to the Lonely Mountain to fetch Arkenstone and lead the 7 dwarf kingdoms into a battle and this fetching the Arkenstone is what this sequel is all about. Thorin is then seen journeying with other dwarfs and Gandalf towards the lonely mountain. Midway, at the forest gate Gandalf parts ways with the Dwarfs+Hobbit company and advices them to 'not leave the path' as they cross the forest. While crossing the forest the Dwarfs lose the path and are attacked by a group of giant spiders (similar to the one 'Shelob' seen in LOTR 3). The scene where Bilbo looks down the canopy to discover the spiders till towards the end the elves come (Legolas and Tauriel) is intense and keeps you glued to your seat.<br/><br/>The dwarfs are captured by the Elves and imprisoned. We are introduced to a younger Legolas who likes Tauriel. During the captivity, Bilbo had used the ring to stay invisible and later comes to rescue the dwarfs. The entire escape scene starting from dwarfs entering the barrels till the end of fight amongst orcs, elves(Legolas and Tauriel) and dwarfs is one of THE BEST fight scenes ever. I repeat it is one of the best fight scenes ever in the movies. There is good humor in the movie and introduced at places and in ways that seems extremely welcome. <br/><br/>After the escape from Elvish town the Dwarf Company meets Bard, who is introduced as a man trying to feed his family. He agrees to help the dwarfs in exchange for money. After entering the lake town the movie slows down a bit, and probably the slightly boring parts of the movie are during this time. However during this time the audience is told about the prophecy and other essential elements of the story take place. The last scenes of using the furnaces to melt gold and casted into a giant statue to kill Smaug the dragon is one of the best in CGI. The entire treasure scene with fights and runs is stunning graphics. The golden dragon emerging out of cave and then flying into the sky dusting off the solidified gold from its body looks brilliant. The movie ends with a good 5 second pause when Smaug escapes, with clear intention of destroying the lake village.<br/><br/>Some expectations have already been build up during this movie for the sequel to come. Bard should play a lead role in killing the Dragon. The Black Arrow remains hidden on a boat. The budding love between Tauriel and Kili will have some impact in the future. The talks of a war that is being raged are already there. Sauron is growing powerful. The Dragon has escaped. Arkenstone may, or may not have been picked by Bilbo. Lets wait for the next and find out. <br/><br/>Great movie and good entertaining 3 hours."
"ajs709","7","3","8","15 December 2013"," Elves and Dwarfs shouldn't mix.
","After trying my hardest to argue ""for"" the adaptation of the hobbit into three movies, I suddenly find myself adopting the counter argument. This movie is the reason. I believe that the storyline is largely incoherent with whole segments being largely superfluous (Gandalf climbing the mountain to have a chinwag with Radagast, for example) or attempts to force unconvincing subplots. I still don't understand why Bard is in prison at the end other than an excuse to up the tension for film three; the whole idea of ""the prophecy"" of Lake-Town seems slightly confused (is it good, is it bad?); and the dwarfs, at times, seem quite indifferent to their task - indeed it is quite easy to forget what their task actually is even though whole segments of the first film in this trilogy establish it quite firmly. Are they trying to kill the dragon, trying to reclaim Erebor or trying to get back the shiny jewel? I don't know, Jackson doesn't seem to know and I'll swear they don't know, but they seem content enough to run around the place, giving the long-neglected industry of Erebor a shot in the arm for no particular reason while they're at it, and play hide and seek with the dragon. I understand the book is not heavy on detail, but it seems to me as though the film-makers have overthought things. In attempts to explain ""why is this character doing this?"" they feel it necessary to shoehorn prosaic motives and set-ups into the story which, in my opinion, just stretch plausibility and make the film bloated and flabby in places. Maybe it is necessary when dealing with a book which is so light on detail, but then we come back to ""why three films?"" point. If the three films are full of subplots and tangents (and cringeworthy saccharine love stories that are more High School Musical than Tolkien) that ultimately add nothing to the bigger story then why bother? The strength of the Lord of the Rings trilogy was the clarity and focus in the story; there is none of that in the Hobbit and ultimately I found myself asking ""why?"" quite a lot, particularly during the incessant and prolonged action sequences. For all this, it is a cinematic experience. It is still very much a thrill for me to see iconic scenes, places and characters from books that I have been reading since I was a child and I do think they are rendered expertly. It is worth a watch and I wouldn't have missed it for the world...indeed I'll probably go and watch it again because I really want to like it. However, I will always come back to ""why three films?"" and two films in, I'm not convinced of the answer. The fact I'm still asking the question suggests this film does nothing to clear this up and it has become the unfortunate tagline of this franchise, however much I don't want it to be. Sadly my sympathy for the film-makers is waning, particularly when they come up with the indefensible romance between Tauriel and Kili; I heard rumour of it, but nothing could prepare me for just how bad it was! The love triangle doesn't work. It makes Tauriel appear coquettish, Kili appear stupid, Legolas appear like a jealous school boy and the script-writers appear lazy. Singlehandedly dumbing down elves since 2013."
"sesht","Null","3","8","15 December 2013"," Elementary, my dear Wat (ahem) Bilbo...
","One the first things that struck me was this - how much better this would have seemed on IMAX 3D (not the DMR variety, which IS playing in limited release in India, but if they had actually filmed few sequences using that format, and then we got to watch it in a good IMAX cinema - not DigiMAX/LieMAX).<br/><br/>The next thing that struck me - why did it have to be another cliffhanger ending? I get it. The story continues. But, why not have each movie be self-sufficient as well? I don't think it's too much to ask. I've read the books, so I know what happens, but still I felt cheated. Esp. coming off 'Catching Fire' just last weekend (in India at least).<br/><br/>The 3rd, and possibly more important, more responsible thing - when the initial LOTR movie came out, there was an uproar about PG13 rating allowing filmmakers to get away with a certain amount of gore, as long as there's no bleeding. We have Orcs in this, who get decapitated in all sorts of gruesome ways, and we're used to it all now, considering the 4 movies that have had 'it' abundantly. Perhaps this is the one that has it the most, flying at us in 3D. I'm all for hard R-rated stuff, but considering this is what our kids are gonna be watching, I am skeptical about the PG13 being awarded to this. It does help that we do not feel sorry for the Orcs in any way, but I think that was by design, and makes it all video-gamey, allowing us to immune ourselves to the violence that is being meted out, and somehow, that's not a good thing, IMO.<br/><br/>All that apart, this is one rousing, spectacular swashbuckler, with all the fat trimmed off, so naysayers of the first one have literally nothing to crib about (but you never know with cribbers, seeing how I spent my first 2 paragraphs ranting). Jackson has made better movies, but it is nevertheless great to watch this one on the big screen. Sure, he could have avoided the Twilight-triangle, but it does not consume much screen time, and 1 of those scenes is actually tender, coming off of an unintentionally funny sequence (you'll know it when you see it).<br/><br/>Holmes and Watson (ahem), Cumberbatch and Freeman, get together again, and do quite a bit of (this time, unintelligent, when compared to Gollum's and Bilbo's 'encounter' in the 1st one) verbal jousting before (literally) taking off. Armitage, McKellen and Bloom all continue to be good, while Fry, Pace and Evans are wasted. <br/><br/>One of the big items on my wishlist (for this series) has been the re-creation of the battle from which Sauron has vanquished, and when I heard that Jackson was actually adding stuff not there in the books, I dared to hope. Alas, that is not to be, though he seemingly has added a lot of exhilarating stuff that's also not present in the books, along with plot arcs and characters.<br/><br/>Here's hoping I catch it once again on IMAX, and await the final instalment next year, when Jackson takes us all 'There and back again'. Knowing how he chooses to tie everything with a bow (think 'Return of the King'), I think we're all in for a spectacular finish.<br/><br/>Note: Freeman acts by never allowing us to acknowledge that there's an actor under all that hobbit makeup, and that's no mean feat. Here's lookin' fwd to more from dear Watson......"
"YasheshJ","8","3","8","15 December 2013"," A definite improvement on its predecessor, an entertainer that is bound to grow on you with repeated viewings.
","A definite improvement on its predecessor, but falls slightly short of an ardent fan's sky-high expectations— nonetheless, an entertainer that is bound to grow on you with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>Plus Points: Good to see Jackson venturing into the relatively uncharted sections of the book, things that J.R.R. Tolkien left to reader's imagination or just briefly mentioned, for example: <br/><br/>Expulsion of Sauron from Dol Guldur by Gandalf and co.<br/><br/>Jackson also gives some identity to the otherwise generalized evil characters in the novel, like, Azog the Defiler, Bolg. This does give evil-side some counterparts to match against plenty of known good characters.<br/><br/>Addition of Tauriel and Legolas in the film was a masterstroke too, and will work really when film reaches the crescendo in the battle of five armies. Inclusion of Legolas in the 'Hobbit' storyline is quite a shrewd move, since there in nothing in Tolkien's writings that denies it. However, it means Legolas and Bilbo were acquainted to one another prior to the fellowship's meet at Rivendale (in LOTR)—there is nothing in LOTR film that indicates this or otherwise! Open barrel ride was another great modification; the low-key and secretive barrel-escape of the novel, wouldn't have worked with the audience not familiar with Tolkien's work.<br/><br/>Some Drawbacks: In Hobbit 1, exclusion of Gwaihir the Windlord—the king of magnificent talking eagles—was the one of the biggest disappointment for me. In this film, it is the mistreatment of Beorn's character; got his grandiose represented horribly wrong. To rub salt to the wound, script completely abridges Beorn's role to a meager sneak peek. Hope they redeem Beorn's to its deserving glory in the final battle.<br/><br/>Length of the film is not an issue here; it is the improper utilization of length that makes the film drag at times. Could have worked on Visuals and special effects are undoubtedly brilliant...just like all the previous films. Hence, 'humdrumness' of visuals work well for someone new to the franchise, whereas, for someone who has followed it all through, film's special effects offer nothing new. It wouldn't be counted as a drawback for any lesser director...but from Jackson we expect magic every time! Overall, a good film that seems more of a stepping stone to the grand final, or so I hope! 8.3/10"
"horsethief24","9","3","8","15 December 2013"," An excellent film
","OK, so I may have been a little generous in my review of this film, but it was an excellent film in my opinion. In terms of character development, the film has not fallen short. Because of Martin Freeman's excellent display of hesitancy, the Bilbo character has nailed, and I feel the same about the other characters. My primary issue arises in terms of plot and story. I am an avid fan of the books, and while I felt the directors took a lot of creative freedom in The Hobbit part one, I feel like they almost completely ditched the book in this movie. Sure, the companions end up in the same place by the end of the movie, but damn if they took a lot of extra turns before then. If you have never read the books and can enter the movie with no idea as to what is going to happen, than enjoy an excellent film. If you have read the Hobbit, enjoy a rendition that has a Tolkien base. All in all, a very good film, unless you believe the movie should be the book in visual form, with nothing added or removed."
"michael-sengwah","9","3","8","15 December 2013"," A satisfying improvement over An Unexpected Journey
","It has never been easy as a middle film of the trilogy, but Peter Jackson has successfully proved himself once again to start and end it at a right scene. While the song ""I See Fire"" seems a bit awful to attach immediately after the last scene and the lost of emotional feel from An Unexpected Journey, the great cinematography, set up and setting of barrel wine scenes, lake town, searching of Sauron and Erebor, enhancing humors, straightforward storyline, tensed middle earth action, great and terrifying Smaug as well as cast's performance have overall made the sequel an improvement over the predecessor, and to make audiences craving for the final chapter desperately."
"mikeymcdo","8","3","8","15 December 2013"," This film maybe overlong but it ain't no King Kong.
","Has some pacing issues and is perhaps too character cluttered but the second chapter of the Hobbit is a great romp. It starts with a bang with the chase still on from the previous film leading onto some trippyness and great action scenes in the forest, to the inclusion of Legolas and his lady friend Tauriel who's appearance isn't as forced as it could have been. <br/><br/>The film grinds to a halt once Bilbo and the gang enter laketown where not a lot of consequence occurs but the grand unveiling of Smaug makes plodding through these scenes worth it. Smaug the dragon is definitely one of the best CGI creations in a movie. The size and scale of this character is immense with Benedict Cabbagepatch lending his refined and silky voice to the vain unstoppable dragon. <br/><br/>An amazing score from Howard Shore, just heightens the tension and the atmosphere of these middle earth movies significantly. Although I think Tolkien must be rolling in his grave hearing Ed Sheeran's warbling. <br/><br/>The Hobbit part 2 is most memorable for it's inventive action set pieces such as the barrel sequence, the spider fight and Gandalf's showdown with some evil dude in a tower. All these scenes make the film very episodic like a Saturday matinée. Martin Freeman is also a delight to watch as Bilbo Baggins, he is a great physical comedian as well as verbal and all these qualities are very chaplinesque which adds great character to this unexpected hero."

","I enjoyed this movie, very much ! I will be honest I am really effected by other peoples reviews and Desolation sadly had a mix bag. But mate were they wrong. The time flew past and I didn't notice it at all. The acting was superb, action was good and Smaug was glorious !<br/><br/>Martin Freeman was a superb choice for the role of Bilbo !Although not in the book I also really enjoyed the addition of Legolas ! <br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug is better then its predecessor, with better action and for being darker too. However I can't underline enough that it is not LOTR, if you want to enjoy this movie you should come to terms with that! its different it is its own thing and that's OK.<br/><br/>Now if you like middle earth go and see the movie ! I'm glad I did and I watched it in HFR 3D it still feels a bit odd but my eyes thanked me for it. My eyes normally feel really tired by 3d but it wasn't so this time around.

"connork97","8","3","8","14 December 2013"," A completely satisfying and entertaining second film
","""Such is the nature of evil, in time all foul things come forth"". This has never been more true then in the Desolation of Smaug. It clearly reveals itself as more of an action-pact film over the first, and it seems to waste no-time in getting you completely immersed in the landscape, and complex fighting scenes.<br/><br/>It carries us into the Shapeshifter ""Beorn"" lair, and pulls us threw the dark, complex and deceiving Mirkwood forest, while keeping us on our edge as we behold the more unwanted guests to the forest, some who you may not expect. This is all of-course before they enter the mountain. Where the legend and tales of Smaug serve no justice, to what you will behold as he wakes from his gold bedded slumber, and shows his immense figure with his truly haunting voice.<br/><br/>Yes, The Desolation of Smaug, is a great action filled movie, but it also holds many of the same undertones about war and greed that we see in the other Lord Of The Rings films, and that reflect us humans in a big way. I very much enjoyed how many more great characters are revealed, giving the story very valid points against the dwarfs mission. When we arrive in Laketown, we actually begin to understand why people would not ""deem it wise"" to enter the mountain, and as the story comes to a close, that statement has never been more true. Also the darker turn that I felt this film trilogy will take is beginning to show its ugly head. As Gandalf enters dol guldur, he is presented with a force of which one of the most powerful wizards can not handle, and may never will for a long time.<br/><br/>This is a great epic film, and despite its long running time, the action makes you want to see more, especially after the ending, which will leave you on the edge of your feet thinking ""oh sh*t""."

","First of all I'd like to say that I'm a massive Tolkien fan and I love his books and I've read them several times and I'm actually one of those people who see a movie and a book as two separate things. I never actually understood why AUJ got so much hate, it really is impossible to make a movie exactly like the book. Why aren't anyone of you purists hating on the dwarfs for not having a blue beard for example? (And it doesn't make you a 'better' or 'bigger' Tolkien fan for hating on the movies in my opinion).<br/><br/>'The Desolation of Smaug' was so amazing, I can't even choose what was my favourite part/thing about the movie, that's how good it was. I loved everything about it! There was a lot of action, the cast was spectacular, Beorn, Smaug and Bard was just what I imagined them to be, Tauriel wasn't annoying (I actually liked her!), the CGI was well done and Martin Freeman was amazing as always. And the fact that they're making three movies of one book doesn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>I decided to go and see it in HFR again cause I saw AUJ in it last year and I really liked it. I don't know about the rest of you but I really feel like I'm in middle-earth while watching it in HFR. The image is so sharp, the colours are beautiful and I loved the way Peter shot the barrel scene. I loved how the camera went underwater a couple of times, it really felt like I was there in a barrel with the rest of the dwarfs.<br/><br/>I'm going to go and see it again before it leaves the cinema and I'm also going to pre-order the DVD. Can't wait for the last part of the trilogy, It's going to be epic!"
"josmille","6","5","17","13 December 2013"," Disappointed
","Visually, Smaug was pretty darn good. They loosely based his appearance off of Vermithrax (Dragonslayer), and the voice of Smaug was also chosen well. However, after a while, the dialog and character portrayal did not indicate a old, powerful, keen dragon. He felt more like a young dragon with ADD and no common sense.<br/><br/>There is a scene with Gandalf, in Dun Guldur, that felt more like a bad music video than the epic scene that it should have been.<br/><br/>The lighting continues to be my biggest complaint in this series. I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV movie, rather than a major motion picture.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were lack-luster and poorly choreographed.<br/><br/>Everything felt rushed, and not done correctly."

It took forever until it got to the good scenes and I felt that it dragged on quite a bit at times. But ""The Desolation of Smaug"" was completely different than ""An Unexpected Journey"", and better in every way; from the first scene I knew it would be a much better film. I won't give away any particular movie details, but the action scenes were top notch, especially the barrel scene. Also, Smaug was EPIC. He was the best movie dragon I've ever seen, just amazing in every way. I think any fan of Tolkien's will love this movie."

","Before I get started, know this: HFR did not, in my opinion, take away from the experience. Instead, I felt like I was watching the next step in the evolution of cinema, and it was not unlike the first time I experienced 3D.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, you are an asset to the college of film dear sir. It has been awhile, and only a handful of times, since I've actually set on the edge of my seat at the movie theater. Desolation of Smaug caused my eyeballs to attempt transfusing with the screen for the entire last quarter of the film.<br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug feeds off of the wide-open stage that most of us trudged our way through to build by first viewing An Unexpected Journey. Thanks to that, this second film was a non-stop barrel ride down the rapids of anticipation, and my friends, I got drenched.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into details on what this film does in the animation department that sets the bar for other films. Also, there will be no details on how well the story does, or does not, adhere to the text from J.R.R. Tolkien. Since I've not read the book, and the animation can really only be truly appreciated by viewing said film yourself (seeing how HFR is 48fps, and a picture is worth a thousand words, and it's nearly three hours long, that's more words than I care to type), I'll leave those details for you to discover.<br/><br/>The one thing I would like to add, since I can't seem to find the subject matter online, is that that Smaug seems to be an analogy for religion if I followed the story correctly. Basically, the dwarfs are set to be the equivalent of humankind. The dwarfs (humankind) became greedy and things started falling apart. Along comes a dragon (religion) to take control of the wealth, since humankind couldn't resist the disease of greed. And, well, that's as far as I've taken the idea, but I think there's merit to the theory.<br/><br/>To wrap up my transient flash of this film fan's take on The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, I'll simply say this. Go see this film. At the theater I went to, there were children as young as seven or so in attendance, and given the fact it was nearly a three-hour movie and I didn't once hear the impatience of young jabbering, that tells you something."

","First off I wanna state that I am in fact in between a regular human being and a LOTR/hobbit fan etc. This review is not based on a full fledged fan but a viewer of this movie. So this is the second installment of The Hobbit series directed by the same director of LOTR's by Peter Jackson. If you didn't already know this takes place before any of the LOTR movies. Although one book, Peter Jackson split it into three films to fit all of the book at an equal pacing. I thought of the movie as being great and very similar to the LOTR. As in traveling loads of the movie with a melody going and than stopping at a important plot point, than doing the same. Smaug is a very very big dragon and from all these wide angle shots, he looks ginormous. I didn't keep my eyes away mainly the whole movie it was like taking me back to the LOTR days. Throughout this movie it sets up for the third and final installment coming next year, making it not a new concept rather continuing what little scenes were shown and help the start of the story of the final segment. In summary, I liked it and i'm looking forwards for the final movie in 2014."

","Fantastic addition to the Hobbit trilogy. I was thrilled to see so much of the Elves, especially Legolas (oops) and Laketown in this film (by far my favorite parts of the book) people who aren't familiar with the issues of adapting a book into a film tend to complain about the plot inconsistencies, but I think that tonally this film matches the previous Lord of the Rings film trilogy much better than the hobbit book matched the Lord of the Rings books. ""Purists"" will complain about the plot inconsistencies, but anybody who has read the Lord of the Rings appendixes or parts of the Silmarillion will recognize the elements of other works of Tolkien woven in; very little ""made up"" if you're familiar with his works. Tauriel could have fallen flat, but as it is the ""captain of the guard"" who briefly appears in the Hobbit realized as Tauriel in this film works quite well. Hm... all in all, cons: a little heavy on the fight sequences. The cgi on the orcs & wargs could have been closer to Lotr and a little less cartoony but that's an afterthought; other than that, great character development. Pros: Incredible production design, especially Laketown and Mirkwood; beautiful character design on Thranduil. Tauriel is a much needed breath of fresh air, a beautifully complex and realized character; a nice balance to the other, more serious attitudes of Thranduil and Legolas. I think if you can appreciate the books and the films as separate entities in their own right, and go in without too many preconceived ideas, and willing to experience the beauty of the incredible artists who have worked on realizing Middle-Earth, it will blow you away."

Some explanations: Some explanations why Legolas is in the movie: The Hobbit movie is not based on The Hobbit book,it is based on The Hobbit book + scripts at the end of Lotr book what has some things what were happening at the time at The Hobbit book,but these things are not in The Hobbit book.Tolkien wanted to re-write The Hobbit after Lotr,to fit it in nicely,but he died. Legolas lives at the time of The Hobbit book,cause he is Thranduil's son,and elves can't die by natural death.So, how would You explain if Legolas is not in the movie? Where is he then? It would be actually to weird if he is not in the movie. The same thing with Dol-Guldur,it is all explained I believe in ROTK book what was happening there,there is also some thing about Dol-Guldur explained in The Hobbit book,that The White council fights the Necromancer in Dol Guldur,but in Rotk it explains whi Necromancer actually is. Of course,some things are different than in the book,like Azog is still alive,but that's only a big PLUS for me. Some people think that they are a ''Huge fans'' and they think they are smart,and they only knows to spit on PJ cause he ''wants only a money'',but they actually don't know that some of these things what are not in The Hobbit book are actually explained in Rotk Book, and some things are from the sillmarillion or unfinished tales. Also,why are there going to be 3 movies,but not 1 or 2. Exactly because of that,everything that is impossible to fit in 2 or 3 movies. It is impossible to compare cartoon with movies,just impossible. And people just can't understand that there can be even only 200 pages in one book,but there can be even 5 movies based on that book if there are to many things to happen.

"jacksonjhays","7","3","9","13 January 2014"," Good as the lord of the rings
","The first one The Unexpected Journey was good but not memorable or as good as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. But this one is finally as good as the lord of the rings. The story starts off very strong with the continuation of Thorin's company Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins. There is still a lot of CGI like the first one but it didn't bother me as much as the first hobbit. The CGI is really good mostly on the dragon. The characters are developed so much better in this one now I really care for all of the dwarfs even though I don't know all of them but now I literally care for the characters. I was worried about putting Orlando Bloom as Legolas and the chick from lost in the movie because I thought they would feel forced but both did a fantastic job and it doesn't feel forced. There is a lot of memorable moments in the movie like the lord of the rings. The villain Smaug is amazing he is the best villains of all middle earth history even better than Sauron he is the big bad guy of the movie but Smaug feels so much bigger. Benedict Cumberpatch has the best deep scary voice and he works so perfectly. Smaug is even very scary the size, the sounds he makes, and his voice. I only once I jumped when Smaug was playing around Bilbo. Overall I loves this movie best film of the year and finally it is as good as Lord of the Rings. A(SOLID)+"

","Peter Jackson's second installment in his highly controversial Hobbit trilogy sees the addition of some new and exciting characters, as well as some stunning never before seen locations. A multitude of elements combine to make this film a marked improvement on the much maligned first part.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is the second leg of Bilbo, Gandalf and the company of 13 dwarfs' quest to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor and slay the dragon Smaug. They encounter many complications in the form of Azog's vengeance seeking band of orcs, the distrustful elves of the woodland realm and the formidably cunning and terrifying dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>What makes The Desolation of Smaug significantly better than its predecessor are its gorgeously ambitious and executed action set-pieces. Highlights include a typically Jacksonian river barrel chase and a beautifully choreographed fight scene which takes place in the center of the scenic Laketown. These types of set-pieces ensure that the pacing problems of the at times lethargic first film aren't repeated, as the film furiously jumps from one action scene to another, ticking many of the boxes of what an epic blockbuster should be.<br/><br/>The new characters blend in seamlessly with the world and the already established characters, mainly due to the skill of the actors playing them. Evangeline Lilly's Tauriel adds some much needed oestrogen into such a testosterone fueled world, making love rivals out of the handsome dwarf Kili and returning fan favourite Legolas. Lee Pace is very convincing as the extremely inward looking leader Thranduil, who Richard Armitage's Thorin has every right to distrust. Benedict Cumberbatch really nails the sinisterness and underlying intelligence in Smaug's personality, more than playing his part in the creation of one of the greatest CGI creations in cinematic history. However, it's newcomer Luke Evans who steals the show as family man and people's champion Bard the Bowman, giving him the steely resolve that Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn was imbued with.<br/><br/>From the established characters, Martin Freeman's Bilbo is still undergoing his fascinating character transformation that will span the full trilogy and will ultimately see him become a true hero. Freeman is a bit short changed in terms of his screen time but still manages to show off his talent, in particular his impeccable physical comedy. Ian McKellen once again lends his experience and gravitas to the role of Gandalf the Grey, while Richard Armitage does well in conveying the dark turn in lead dwarf Thorin's personality. The same few dwarfs that distinguished themselves in the first film play an important role, particularly Ken Stott's Balin who is quietly becoming the heart of this trilogy, constantly reminding everyone about the significance of the quest at hand.<br/><br/>Thematically The Desolation of Smaug feels very similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as it deals with how wealth and power corrupt, as is evident in the cases of Bilbo and Thorin. The interesting thing about this film is that many of its themes derive form the source material and the inter-war period in which Tolkien wrote the book. The inward looking elves are clearly meant to represent the isolationist America that existed in this inter-war period and refused to join The League of Nations. Furthermore, the totalitarian society created by Stephen Fry's dictatorial master of Laketown, is almost certainly meant to represent the totalitarian societies being created by dictators Hitler and Mussolini in this inter-war period, with the suppression of elections and public participation being alluded to in the film.<br/><br/>The new locations Laketown and Mirkwood are like rich tapestries, as is befitting of Jackson's Middle Earth legacy. Their beauty is complimented and magnified by the typically excellent score from Howard Shore, which gives the whole production an epic feel.<br/><br/>The only problems in this cinematic milestone, stem from the source material and Jackson's wild ambition and limitless love for the franchise. Devoting enough screen time to all of the characters was never going to be possible given the nature of the source material, with only half of the dwarfs being established characters two thirds of the way into the franchise and the increasing feeling that Bilbo may no longer be the lead protagonist of the franchise. Jackson's ambition causes the final climatic action sequence to feel needlessly long and his love for the characters. means that the returning Legolas is given a ridiculously large amount of screen time.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Jackson has put his ambitious Hobbit trilogy back on track, with a far more confident and exciting middle film. While the heights of the Lord of the Rings trilogy can never be reached, this film comes as close to reaching them as is possible."

","What an amazing movie! In my opinion The Hobbit series is on par with The Lord of the Rings series- they are just quite different, and people need to realize that. I will not say it was an improvement over An Unexpected Journey because I loved the hell out of that movie, but this one's just as good. First of all, the acting was brilliant. Martin Freeman again creates a mesmerizing Bilbo- a very believable character (he isn't a master swordsman as soon as he picks up a sword, and he relies on his wits more than his brawn), and his wit and humour really add some heart to the movie. His subtle, slightly humorous reactions to Smaug waking up are great! His funny little mannerisms and facial expressions and hand gestures really give his character a sense of uniqueness among the other hobbits we've seen. Also, his relationship with Thorin is very well handled, although the best of it will be seen in There and Back Again. Speaking of Thorin, Richard Armitage gives a truly magnificent performance. The right balance of determination, arrogance, and charisma. Thorin is a much darker, more complex character than Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings, and you can really see his arrogance and greed taking over his being once he reaches Erebor, and just the slightest hint of madness (the scene where he holds Bilbo at sword point), which will come into play more in the third movie. In regards to Gandalf, we really didn't see much of him, but he was as amazing as ever, and his duel with Sauron was incredible! As for the dwarfs, it is Ken Stott and Aidan Turner who shine this time, and much to my displeasure James Nesbitt's Bofur falls to the background a bit (but he still has his moments- ""Bless my beard, is that the time!""). Stott creates a very memorable Balin, bringing depth, kindness, and heart to his role. Aidan Turner was great as the young, dashing Kili, and his hero moment at the river scene was very well done. Some of the other dwarfs fall into the background a bit, but Dwalin, Bofur, Fili, and Gloin all are given some time to shine. As for the new characters in this movie, they were all excellent and well integrated into the story. Mikael Persbrandt had a short but memorable role as the Skin-changer Beorn, and his performance was very powerful (and he had a really epic Swedish accent). His speech about not liking dwarfs was one of my favourite quotes in the movie. Lee Pace was excellent as Thranduil, who is a very interesting character. Pace provides regal arrogance and a slight unsettlingness to the character, and his scene with Thorin was very powerful. Orlando Bloom is back as Legolas, and this time he provides more three-dimensional acting, as his personality and personal life are fleshed out more here, and we get to see a meaner side to him as well as a softer side. And his fight with Bolg at the end was bad-ass! Tauriel, as played by Evangeline Lilly, was a very good addition to the story. Her character was even more interesting and in depth than I thought before the movie came out, and she was acted very well by Lilly. The romantic subplot with Kili was very well handled and not over done. She is a very interesting character- curious about dwarfs, determined, and sticking up for what is right (which means going against her king). In Lake-town we are introduced to Bard and his family, and Luke Evans did a great job as the ""Robin Hood of Middle-earth."" His family was a nice touch and makes the audience care more for him and adds depth to his character. We also meet the Master of Lake-town and his conniving servant, Alfrid, played by Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage respectively. Both were very good characters. Stephen Fry was hamming it up as the sleazy master, and he was a joy to watch. And now on to Smaug. What can I say besides that he was the best dragon, cgi character, and villain ever to hit the screens! Perfect vocal and motion capture performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, seamless visual effects by WETA, and some great dialogue. The scene with him and Bilbo was one of the best scenes I've seen in a very long time! Freeman and Cumberbatch were great together. His epic fight with the dwarfs was great too. The writing in this movie was very good. I thought each character was developed enough, and the side subplots, like Gandalf's investigation of Dol Guldor and the Kili/Tauriel subplot, were woven into the story smoothly. Also, the decision to split up the company was one of PJ's best deviations from the book. The visual effects, costumes, makeup, and art direction were flawless as usual- no point going into details there. But they were truly top notch. The score was also amazing (I particularly like Tauriel's, Smaug's, Thranduil's, and Lake-town's themes). Howard Shore is a genius. Special mention should be made to the Barrel scene. It was awesome- the best action scene of 2013 for sure! Legolas and Tauriel were bad-ass, and Bombur's orc-annihilating barrel run was hilarious and epic at the same time! The movie was action-packed and fast paced. It was dramatic, intense, and fun. It was perfect!"

","With all due respect to those who are criticizing the movie and calling it a lame effort by peter jackson by missing this and that....they all should consider one big fact that reading a good book again and again, feeling and imagining every single line of it in your warm bed or sofa is something else and making a movie way beyond the imagination with running and talking and fighting characters in mountains, rivers or lakes is surely a very different and hard thing to do.<br/><br/>I love to read books and books have got a vital role in building our philosophical and intellectual as well as imaginative ability. But if someone takes this challenge to make a very good movie based on a book then he is surely doing nothing but an impossible thing and peter jackson has done something very close to this impossible thing. Millions of people who didn't even know about respected J R R Tolkien and his written work now know about him and there will be many who will find themselves fascinated to read his books. <br/><br/>I personally have found DOS a lot better and improved than first one and if there is any single area where we can take that one score away from 10 is the background music, it has not been as good as lord of the ring and can be rated as good but not very good. I surely can wait for the 3rd and final part as i got one more good movie to watch again and again till next December. good luck to peter jackson and i hope we gonna watch some as amazing as DOS"
"Morgansmith987","5","3","9","24 December 2013"," Near perfect.
","I shall start by stating that I am a huge Tolkien fan and that I have read every work Tolkien has written on the subject of middle earth and anything lord of the rings related. <br/><br/>The film perfectly captures the spirit of the hobbit as a book- which is much more light- hearted than The Lord of the Rings, as The hobbit was written as a children's book. While I believe that some scenes from the book were slightly rushed- such as that of Beorn- I didn't particularly mind as these scenes would not have worked so well on film. The whole love triangle thing with Legolas and Tauriel does not work- however, it did not detract from the film much in my opinion. I believe that the inclusion of Tauriel as a character was a great idea from Peter Jackson. I do feel that some of the characters were summed down and simplified such as that of the master of lake town and Smaug.<br/><br/>Now for the good bits: the action is amazing. Truly brilliant. Perhaps there is slightly too much of it but I still think it to be excellent. The scenes in Dol Guldur are brilliant and at last we see Gandalf using some proper magic. <br/><br/>All of the acting is brilliant. Especially that of Martin freeman- more Bilbo would be good.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the film could have been another hour longer. I feel that if the film had been lengthened then the fan favourites such as the scene with Beorn could have been fully realised.<br/><br/>All in all, I still think the film is excellent but to fully enjoy it you must think of it as Peter Jackson and Tolkien as the same entity. This is not just a work of Tolkien- Jackson has added a ridiculous amount to the film.<br/><br/>It's a must see, whatever poor ratings you read are undoubtedly by some sad Tolkien fan talking about how it doesn't stay true to the book; this is true but the film perfectly captures the light hearted feel of the hobbit book."
"cj_darbz","9","3","9","16 December 2013"," Smaug like stupendous entertainment
","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug as a whole is a great film with a lot of great fighting and emotional sequences through out the film. Peter Jackson may have slipped away from the original story Tolkien had written but he has done so with great effect. I absolutely loved An Unexpected Journey so am still indecisive which of the two films is best. Spoilers AHEAD My favourite scenes would obviously have to be Bilbos encounter with smaug as every time smaug spoke or appeared on screen a genuine fear was driven into me and the voice of benedict cumberbatch is outstanding. Another great scene is the barrel scene, although in the book it is just the company of dwarfs and bilbo slowly flowing down stream, Jacksons telling of it is fast paced, filled with elves and orcs each trying to capture the company. The one character i was disappointed in was Azog, as he does not feature that much as in An Unexpected Journey in which he was a major and exciting character, Instead we see his son 'Bolg' who is not as threatening or entertaining as his father. Also there is a unwanting love triangle in the midst of all the action which is not mentioned in the book or really that interesting during the film. It is between Kili, Taruiel and Legolas in which i felt was unneeded. <br/><br/>Overall The movie lived up to expectation and would recommend all to go now and see it, even if youv already seen it as iv already seen it twice and plan on seeing it again tonight. 9/10"
"kunalkhandwala","8","3","9","17 December 2013"," A disloyal epic that yet entertains as it should
","Somewhere along this Unexpected journey to Erebor, The Hobbit found his courage that transformed him from being the Baggins of Bag-End to a burglar who repeatedly saved the lives of the dwarf company through many an adventure. Tolkien's beloved tale takes an evil turn as Peter Jackson stretches the storyline for 3 films, meandering about with new characters and old. Be it studio pressure to cater to larger audiences rather than just its fan base or Jackson's self- consuming digression in support of more action and violence, 'The Desolation of Smaug' loses the charm of a coherent story with enjoyable characters and turns into a tale of evil in Middle- Earth with a Hobbit.<br/><br/>Right out of a frying pan and into the fire, the company of Thorin Oakenshield is rescued by the eagles (summoned by Gandalf) who carry them all to the eastern edge of the misty mountains. There lies before them a treacherous path through the Mirkwood forest that will bring them to Long Lake and Esgaroth before they head north towards the lonely mountain and Erebor wherein rests the cunning dragon Smaug. But before that, they find refuge and rejuvenation in the house of Beorn the skin-changer. Their journey through Mirkwood thereafter resumes without Gandalf, who leaves them in lieu of urgent business. After struggling through the bewildering forest and battling spiders, the company gets captured by the wood-elves who incarcerate them in the halls of King Thranduil. Legolas (Orlando Bloom) re-emerges for Jackson as the King's son who, along with the beautiful lady Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) fights spiders and orcs with adept shots of arrows and swords. Using his ring, Bilbo plots an escape with the dwarfs during a feast. They roll down the river in barrels, chased by orcs and elves alike. This sequence is thoroughly enjoyable and even with all special effects, makes it the film's action highlight. The company reaches the shores of Long Lake and after spending an infinite time there, the company journeys into the the desolation of the dragon where the hidden door is opened at the right celestial time and the hobbit is asked to perform his burglar duties in the dragon's lair. Meanwhile, Gandalf ventures into the abandoned fortress of Dol Goldur where the Necromancer reveals himself as the enemy of past and future. The epic climax leaves you on a cliffhanger that will guarantee a big opening for next year's 'There and back again'. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman's Bilbo is even more convincing with a bit of courage now and Armitage is excellent as the transforming leader. Evangeline Lilly forms a beautiful elf who can seriously cut through some orc flesh while Orlando Bloom is a much more violent and fun to watch Legolas. Ken Stott's Balin brings wisdom and much needed emotional balance to the company and Luke Evans rises above his controversial character of Bard. Sir Ian McKellan's commanding voice and diction yet again prove to be a compelling force among the performances.<br/><br/>The film charges along faster than the previous one on account of having gone through the introductions already. The journey of the dwarfs moves along rapidly and yet, it clocks in at 2hr41min. It seems that the well intended Peter Jackson went too far with his digressive story- telling to the extent that he began to sub-plot his sub-plots. The appendices were useful to propel the story into a thrilling 3rd installment as long as Jackson stuck to the plan of Gandalf's business in Dol Goldur, introduction of the fan-favorite Legolas and imposing the threat of orcs who will eventually come in bigger numbers. However, his liberty brings a curse upon the Tolkien folk who shake their heads in dismay as these events unfold before their 3D spectacled eyes: > Intoducing Tauriel as an Elf warrior is quite welcome as she is the only female character but to put her through a mundane love triangle was completely unnecessary. > Dwarfs depart from Lake town after celebrations but they leave some of their company behind due to injury? Only to lead an orc attack with Legolas and Tauriel to defend them? Jackson is in a parallel universe at this point. > Bard, the respectable bowman is now a bargeman who smuggles dwarfs into town for coin? He will need a convincing character change when he has to raise the giant bow onto a fiery Smaug and lead his men to Dale. > Smaug's terrific creation justifies a bit more screen presence but certainly not at a complete twist in story that engages him with the dwarfs! The subsequent chase sequences involving fires and forging of gold that pass through as rivers turns into a blasphemous preview of next year's Godzilla. Oh! Peter Jackson what have the fans done to deserve your betrayal in such manner? There is enough material in Tolkien's Hobbit itself to warrant 3 movies if you must but the compulsion to make them in such lengths at the cost of digressions and self-consuming reinventions will disappoint a legion of fans.... but they will still flock to the theaters next December for the midnight screening.<br/><br/>For the regular audience, Jackson's Smaug is intense fun with a sense of urgency in the journey of the dwarfs as they get ever closer to their quest's completion. As a grander vision, the impact of the imminent danger pertains not only to the dwarfs but to the world and therefore the added focus on the wood-elves, men of lake town and orcs. The essence of the story is of course that Smaug wasn't the cause but merely a symptom of greed that led many to battle and doom. Through his adaptation of Tolkien's appendices, Jackson adroitly renders this aspect and is sure to showcase that in full glory in the final installment of the Hobbit's tale. Just hope that his deliberate inventions find their purpose as the quest comes to its fateful end.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.68 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

","Bilbo Baggins and the company of dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield must continue on their quest towards Erebor, the mountain home of Smaug. Their mission is to retake the Kingdom Under the Mountain, the true home of the dwarfs, from Smaug. This terrifying dragon has made the mountain his home since he defeated the dwarfs many years before. Along the way they are forced to contend with a band of elves unwilling to aid them. Bilbo is able to prove his worth as they continue towards the mountain and their goal.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 4The continuation of the story started with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an enjoyable film. Once again director Peter Jackson (The Lovely Bones) proves his ability to stay true to the subject material. Jackson wrote the wonderful screenplay for this movie alongside Fran Walsh (King Kong), Philippa Boyens (The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King), and Guillermo del Toro (Cronos). The cast is also great, bringing back all of the familiar faces from the first film in the trilogy. This includes Ian McKellan (Gods and Monsters), Martin Freeman (The World's End), Richard Armitage (Captain America: The First Avenger), Orlando Bloom (Black Hawk Down), Evangeline Lilly (The Hurt Locker), Cate Blanchett (Babel), and Benedict Cumberbatch (War Horse).<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 1This is a visual splendor, much like the first film. The movie does a wonderful job of remaining true to the vision of Middle Earth created in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The visuals are impressive, not only from the landscapes and settings, but also the characters created for the film. Smaug is perhaps the most impressive dragon I've ever seen in a film. The many creatures and other characters also created are wonderful as well. Adding in great set designs and camera work, this is an awesome technical display. Overall, this will not disappoint anyone hoping for an impressive beautiful movie.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 2The acting in this film is equally impressive. Taking into account the difficulties involved with the green screens and all of the other technical challenges, the actors did an awesome job. Ian McKellan is as wonderful as always, making Gandalf a complicated and compassionate person. Martin Freeman is equally impressive in a role that is required to evolve throughout the story. The rest of the cast does an impressive job in their roles, bring together a myriad of characters that bring Middle Earth to life.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 3The story for this part of the series must have been incredibly challenging. How do you decide where to end a film when you have another movie in the works to complete the story. I'm glad that it wasn't a decision I was forced to make. Thankfully, Jackson and the team of writers made an excellent choice on how to script this one. Unlike the second Pirates of the Caribbean film, this is not just a placeholder in need of an end. Unfortunately there are a number of loose ends throughout the movie. This was bound to happen due to the multiple story lines and the number of new characters introduced at this point in the film. This doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable, but it will leave you wanting a little more.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug 8This is a wonderful movie that takes The Hobbit and brings it to life much like I imagined it as a kid. If you're a fan of the books of Tolkien, or The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is one for you. I would definitely suggest seeing the first film before diving into this one. I would also recommend this for fans of action-adventure films. I give this one 4.7 out of 5 stars."

","Desolation of Smaug is a masterpiece and well explains the build up throughout An Unexpected Journey. The acting is top notch and the action is nearly flawless. The visuals were more polished than in An Unexpected Journey; wherefore, it was grittier, darker and at times breathtakingly majestic, and such made the world believable. There were moments when I was gripping the edge of my seat or clapping along with the audience. I reckon the slower moments in the first movie made us care much more for the characters in the second. Without the long dialogue and merrymaking of the An Unexpected Journey we would less understand the Dwarfs of Desolation of Smaug. 9/10."
"deemac1776","Null","3","9","15 December 2013"," A great cinematic experience, but nothing like the book!
","As a Tolkien fanatic and avid reader of the Hobbit and LOTR, I was very excited when the Hobbit was announced as being made into a film. I found the first one to be too long and lacked continuity. The second one I found to be even worse! The writers have taken their poetic license too far and have written a story that is so far from the book, it would as well be a completely different story. It is cinematically very good, with great CGI and a feast to the eyes, but the sub plots and infill stories are too subjective and the story itself is nowhere near as good as the book. I realise that this movie needed to be a bit more grown up than the book, however this could have been done quite easily whilst sticking more rigidly to the original tale! Very Disappointing!"
"arsenoid","7","3","9","14 December 2013"," Too gloomy but makes more sense as a part of the story of the Ring
","Just watched the second ‪#‎hobbit‬. It was not great, I could even say that it was mediocre, but my view of it might differ from yours.<br/><br/>The real reason for its mediocrity is the fact that the whole tone of the movie has been changed greatly from the book. The original work by J.R.R. Tolkien was set as an advanced fairy tale with its ups and downs, but without extreme gloom. Every part of it had a sense of a separate story with beginning, struggle and happy end, each chapter could be easily delivered to a child before sleep.<br/><br/>The movie is set very differently. Firstly there is a persistent chase, second is the fact that we now have a constant and singular main enemy augmented by various other perils. There are no happy moments, only slight comic and romance reliefs. Elves are gloomy, the Lake-town is set as hungry and oppressed medieval society, even the Beorn is set more as a loner werewolf , rather than a magical and 100% in-control human with very strict morals and interesting personality.<br/><br/>This change in tone is what I don't like in the movie. But once I separate these aspects the movie starts making much more sense as a part of the story of the Ring. Firstly Hobbit completely omits the move from physical to supernatural world when the Ring is used. Secondly the LOTR movies dropped a whole lot of detail to be able to accommodate the huge plot and added teenage romance. Much of the dialogue involving the events leading to LOTR is missing from the movie. Now it has found its way into the Hobbit. I bet that if a person watches all 6 Hobbit/LOTR movies in the future prior to reading the book, they will find it logical in the sense of a single coherent story. Take, for example, Legolas, he is a 100% addition in the Hobbit, but when you combine the information with LOTR you realize that Bilbo and the dwarfs were imprisoned in his home as he is a wood's elf.<br/><br/>The whole story of rebirth of Sauron and the evil is mentioned in the LOTR and supposedly happens between the Hobbit and LOTR, but here the script fills in these blanks.<br/><br/>So all in all, I like the Hobbit/LOTR, but just don't like the added gloom of the first half."

","This film is recommended<br/><br/>More is more in Peter Jackson's second installment to his latest fantasy trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The director has better success this time around. Jackson still know how to move his camera and stage his action masterfully and he has again assembled a gifted crew of artists that create wonders with their respective talents; the production values, especially in the areas of art direction, make-up and CGI, are top notch. The many action sequences are indeed well choreographed and worth viewing (just not in 3-D). Still, the story rambles on endlessly as the director sets up his plots and myth-like exposition. Some judicious editing could have eliminated the ennui and helped to make the film even more effective. (And speaking of endless, the film leaves the moviegoers ultimately dissatisfied with its abrupt cliffhanging conclusion.)<br/><br/>Yes, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an epic fantasy adventure film that has more to offer. There are now more engaging characters in place (excluding most of the dwarfs who still have no distinct personalities and are mere storytelling fixtures). There are also more liberties taken with Tolkien's original story, adding an unnecessary love interest between the handsome but height-challenged Kili (Aidan Turner) and a new character not found in the sacred novel, a female warrior elf named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). There are more energized set pieces that build suspense well, although some of the film's overabundance of sub-plots undercut the continuity of the action, especially in the climatic showdown between Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and Smaug. <br/><br/>The screenplay-by committee script by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Guillermo del Toro and Jackson is serviceable enough, but it lacks clever dialog and complex character development to make the film compelling and memorable. The story is a continuation of the first film with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) leading his gang of adventurers on on a perilous journey to reclaim their homeland from a fire-breathing menace named Smaug and make Thorin (Richard Armitage) its rightful king. All of the actors deliver their lines with a yeoman-like precision and, while they never garner genuine emotion, they do make their characters believable. <br/><br/>Unlike Jackson's first disappointing chapter in this series which bored me completely, this sequel has a more serious tone and a darker edge to it. The silly slapstick antics of the merry dwarfs are thankfully gone and the film stays more focused on the journey and its dangers, although it takes forever to get to the main villain in the subtitle. In fact, we don't even see the evil dragon until close to the 90 minute mark, but Jackson has created an entertaining saga with fine production values and strong visual effects along the way. <br/><br/>Nowhere is it more apparent than in three pivotal scenes: a creepy episode involving a giant spider attack that will easily bring nightmares to any child and adult in the audience; a harrowing escape by barrels down rapid waters while being sieged by those nasty Orcs, in which the fluidity of the camera-work and editing heighten the tension and show off the the cinematic skills of this talented director; and the film's highlight, a battle of wits between one little insignificant man, played ever so delightfully by Mr. Freeman, and one terrifying Goliath reptile, marvelously voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. (Smaug's scaly details and slithering movement are absolutely sensational.)<br/><br/>While the action keeps coming, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a marvelously thrilling ride. It's the down time in-between that's a bit of a slough. GRADE: B<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

After viewing The Desolation of Smaug, I saw that the Hobbit franchise would have worked better as a TV mini-series if not for the profits.<br/><br/>As someone who hasn't read The Hobbit, I can't say whether this film stays true to Tolkien, although based on the reviews of others, I'd assume so. However, upon viewing the second Hobbit, I've decided that I don't take a liking to the fact that one book was divided into three films. What entails is that each but the third does not consist of a firm ending. The first left us with an immense hanging cliff; the second, The Desolation of Smaug, begins somewhat abruptly and ends extremely abruptly, without as much as a pretense of an ending. <br/><br/>This may not be a problem for those who have read the book, or who can easily look past it, being a fan. But for the viewer that hopes to indulge in the conventional format of a self-contained movie when she enters a theatre, it was enough of a problem to rate an enjoyable 8/10 instead of quality 9/10."
"moviexclusive","Null","3","9","13 December 2013"," More briskly paced than its predecessor, this second chapter gallops from one impressively staged action sequence to another
","For those who felt that the first verse of Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit' trilogy was a meandering slog, the good news is that his second proceeds at a gallop right from the get-go. Save for a brief prologue that flashes back to the snug bar of the Prancing Pony where our old pal Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield first hatched their plan to reclaim the lost dwarf kingdom of Erebor, this episode moves from one adventure to another with newfound energy, so rest assured that it is certainly a more engaging adventure than the first movie.<br/><br/>Whether it manages to capture the magic of the 'Lord of the Rings' films is yet another matter, and we're sad to disappoint fans that, in our opinion, it falls short on several counts. Indeed, even though it does offer the same sort of sweeping fantasy action of the 'Rings', it doesn't quite match its poignancy, owing to a thin plot that goes all over the place and a distinct lack of character development. Yes, at its best, it is a collection of impressively executed action set-pieces strung together by the quest of one particular hobbit named Bilbo Baggins and 13 dwarfs in search of lost treasure.<br/><br/>The highlight is no doubt a thrilling sequence in which a dozen dwarfs flee their elven captors by riding inside wooden barrels down a rapidly rushing river, only to encounter an even more dreaded enemy - the hideous looking Orcs - that force a temporary alliance between the Elves and the dwarfs. That sequence alone is testament to Jackson's ability to mount elaborate action with considerable flair and imagination - and worthy of mention is not just how he manages to find moments of levity in between a brisk edge-of-your-seat segment, but also how he juggles important character details amidst the flying arrows and numerous beheadings.<br/><br/>Nothing quite comes close to the level of fun and excitement of this centrepiece barrel chase, not even for that matter Bilbo's eventual encounter with the fire-bellied Smaug. But not to get ahead of ourselves, our protagonists also pass through a couple of obstacles en route to their assault on the dragon up in Lonely Mountain - a trek through the enchanted forest of Mirkwood brings them face to face with giant CGI spiders, and following their imprisonment and escape from the stronghold of the woodland elves, they find themselves among not so friendly human company in the village of Laketown. Like we said at the start, there is an urgency to the proceedings which was absent in the first movie, and aside from their time spent in Laketown, unfolds like a supercharged Saturday morning picture.<br/><br/>There is a tradeoff though. First and foremost is the fact that there doesn't seem to be much meat to the tale. Despite the efforts of the original 'Rings' screen writing team of Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens as well as the series' original intended director of Guillermo del Toro, there is no shaking off the feeling that there simply isn't enough in what was a book of less than 300 pages to fill roughly nine hours of film - not even with the interpolation of sections of ""The Quest of Erebor"", one of J.R.R. Tolkien's so-called ""Unfinished Tales"".<br/><br/>Neither for that matter is there much of the characters to speak of. Bilbo feels sidelined in his own tale, spending much of the time in the movie resisting the temptation of the ring he riddled out of Gollum in 'An Unexpected Journey'. Thorin is left to the end to do a little soul- searching whether he has allowed his obsession with regaining the throne to cloud his better judgment. Gandalf, on the other hand, goes off on his own to Dol Guldur to investigate the appearance of the Necromancer and a purported gathering army of darkness. The rest of the characters in the book are largely there to fill the backdrop.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most fully realised character here is Smaug himself, whom voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, is a mesmerising presence to behold. It is only after the two-hour mark that Bilbo confronts the serpent, and the faceoff between hobbit and dragon over dwarf land and gold is a sparkling exchange largely scripted with wit and purpose. Beginning with a glimpse of its open eye amidst mountains of golden coins, Jackson's rendition of Smaug is an awesome sight to behold, both in majesty and authority. Over and under the walls of the imposing castle under the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and Smaug trade barbs and quips trying to outsmart and outguess each other's next moves, before Thorin and the rest of the dwarfs arrive to lend the newly brave hobbit some much- needed assistance. In all though, the confrontation is too drawn out for its own good, losing much of its own momentum during the concluding frames right before the cliffhanger ending that is supposed to whet your appetite for the third and concluding chapter.<br/><br/>And therein lies our central gripe with 'The Desolation of Smaug' and it seems with 'The Hobbit' series – borne out of essentially a kid's tale, it never quite reaches the epic heights of the 'Rings', lacking in compelling plot and character despite Jackson and his writers' efforts to augment Tolkien's tale. Sure it picks up considerably from the amiable pace of its predecessor, but it relies too much on spectacle to distract its audience from an absence of almost everything else. The familiarity with the 'Rings' trilogy is unmistakable – from composer Howard Shore's lush strains to production designer's Dan Hennah's elaborate sets to Weta's top-notch visual effects to Andrew Lesnie's lensing of the breathtaking New Zealand locations – but this middle instalment still fails to recapture the magic, the wonder and most importantly the heart of the 'Rings'."
"rhystgiles","10","5","19","18 December 2013"," Movie Critics have no taste for an expected journey!
","Firstly being a massive Hobbit and Lord of the Rings fan before the films were made I was very sceptical and reluctant of any theatrical releases. After seeing how much care and attention to detail Peter Jackson took with the Lord of the Rings trilogy I was immediately impressed and any scepticism went out the window in a flash. A truly great piece of film work and eagerly awaited the Hobbit. After the first part of the Hobbit; an unexpected journey which was also fantastic I couldn't wait too see what Jackson would have in-store for next instalment. I can safely say Desolation of Smaug lived up to my expectations. Smaug himself is fantastically done and Benedict Cumberbatch does a great voice over. The story is true to the book with adding extra bits that have crucial consequences in the following film/books. The critics have to idea. Those who say the film is ""long winded"" or ""slow and unfaithful to the book"" have clearly not read the LOTR and their appendixes. Jackson has backtracked setting the stage for LOTR and adding all the bits that you don't read about in the Hobbit but are discussed later on in LOTR. This adds an extra dimension to the Hobbit as a story and in Jacksons style as he did the the LOTR trilogy. So what if Jackson has added a few little bits that are not in the book it is still entertaining and faithful to Tolkiens work so what's the problem! I think the people who have been reviewing this movie thus far would much rather see an hour of Downton Abby and give that 5* (which I would rather stick pins in my eyes than be subjected to) and dislike fantasy movies who want something ""in the real world"" and under 2 and a half hours. If so why would you go see this film. In a nutshell if you like the books, like the films so far GO SEE THIS MOVIE its not to be missed on the big screen you will love it!!!!"
"GusF","Null","2","5","17 January 2015"," Very disappointing
","It has some excellent moments and looks amazing but it's rather underwhelming overall and suffers from more structuring problems than the previous four films combined. It's very badly paced, I'm afraid. As with those four films, I watched the extended version but I wish that I hadn't as it feels incredibly bloated. It's very difficult to justify its three hour running time. My attention began to wane after about 1 hour and 45 minutes, something which never happened at all during the four hour version of ""The Return of the King"". While watching that film, I had to drag myself away from the screen to go to the bathroom. While watching this one (after the two hour mark), I often thought, ""Is it not over yet?"" Much of it feels like a ""greatest hits"" film. ""Desolation"" was a good word to put in the title but, sadly, not for the reason that they intended.<br/><br/>Even Smaug's first proper appearance is underwhelming and things don't get better from there. I wish that they had picked a good actor with the better voice instead of the irritating man of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch. In fairness to him though, he isn't anywhere near as hilariously awful as he was in another disappointing (though far, far worse) 2013 film, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"". Christopher Lee wanted to play Smaug and I wish that he had. Speaking of Lee, the film could have benefited from his appearance as well as from significantly more screen time for Ian McKellen and Sylvester McCoy."
"alindsay-al","9","2","5","29 August 2014"," An improvement on the first film and a fantastic film in the LoTR franchise
","I know the first Hobbit film has its criticisms but I did really enjoy it and think it was great but this film improves on that film and is even better. This film picks up where the last one with Thoran, Bilbo and the rest of the dwarfs getting closer to Erebor and the dragon Smaug's lair while Gandalf has to go on his own quest to deal with a new threat involving the Necromancer. First of all the main characters, Martin Freeman as Bilbo is a superb choice and his performance in this one is better than the last as you can see how events in the last movie have affected him and changed the character for this film. The rest of the characters are great too Thoran Oakenshield feels much more driven in this film and more of an awesome leader then he was in the first film. Once again Ian Mckellen is superb as Gandalf the grey even though I have some problems with what they do with him but he was great. The additions of Evangeline Lilly's character and Legolas were great and the action they introduced was a great change to just the dwarfs and added a new dimension to the film. But the show stealer 100 percent is the dragon Smaug. The use of CGI and the look of him is superb and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice to it is eary, evil and superb. If you don't like anything in this film you will love Smaug. Now a problem I have with this film is it's story, for the majority of this film the story is mostly the same as the first film. Also there is the second plot with Gandalf that is pretty interesting but it gets less screen time then it deserves and we do not see Gandalf's journey enough to be interested. But the pay off to the journey is massive and throughout there is some decent storytelling. The script is really good with all the delivery of lines great and the way the interactions happen are very interesting. The style is obviously superb with the middle earth history being superb especially with the addition of Smaug. This is not as good as any of the original trilogy but It is fantastic and definitely worth seeing."
"edgereviews","6","2","5","8 January 2014"," The Desolation Of Smaug Review
","Being someone who didn't like 'An Unexpected Journey', I wasn't looking forward to The Desolation Of Smaug at all. In fact, I didn't just not like 'An Unexpected Journey', I hated it. I think it's an awful movie and easily the most disappointing movie of 2012. The decision to split The Hobbit story into three movies is completely stupid and doesn't work at all. After seeing Desolation, I still think that decision is stupid, as the movie feels more like an action-fantasy epic that's inspired by The Hobbit rather than a straight up adaptation of the book itself.<br/><br/>Desolation is a much better movie than it's 'An Unexpected Journey', but that's not saying much. I enjoyed Desolation for the most part, but I still don't think it's a particularly great movie, albeit far better than it's terrible predecessor. I was always a bigger fan of The Hobbit book than The Lord Of The Rings ones, and it's disappointing that it's not getting the adaptation it deserves.<br/><br/>One element of the book that was done justice in this adaptation is Smaug. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his scenes and they were probably the most entertaining in the movie. However, I didn't think the CGI in this movie was particularly good. It seemed to be a large step down from the Middle-Earth movies that came before it. Also, I want to comment on a particular shot during the barrel scene (which, by the way, was completely unnecessary and could have been left out) where the perspective switched to first person, and this shot is so awful it looks as though it were filmed with a GoPro camera. It was very ugly, off-putting and completely took me out of the experience.<br/><br/>The main problem Desolation suffers from is the same biggest problem that it's predecessor had: it's too damn long. There could easily have been at least half an hour cut out, but it's not. Peter Jackson includes countless scenes that serve no use so he gets his movie as close to three hours as possible, because after all; Jackson is SUCH a master at fantasy storytelling that anything short of 150 minutes is criminal, no? Whereas a long running time was well suited to The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, it's not a good fit to The Hobbit movies at all. However, I still have hope for the next installment, 'There And Back Again'. It should be more like the LOTR movies what with the (hopefully) epic Battle Of The Five Armies. And maybe Peter Jackson will fill the inevitable 160-180 minute run time with things that are actually essential to the plot for once."
"razvan-ovidiu","6","2","5","3 January 2014"," I liked it, but....
","I watched ""The Desolation of Smaug"", but i feel like something is missing, or something was too much...Im not exactly sure what was, but it's not that kind of movie you will remember for a long time, or you will want to see again because it was great. Even for a fantasy/adventure type of movie, rafting can't be so easy :))) If you like this kind of movies, you will like it, but if you expect more than arrows, axes, orcs or dwarfs, you can forget about it. It's just a movie with orcs and dwarfs, plus some pointy ears and stupid lines. I did't read the book, but i can't believe Tolkien wrote such a superficial story. When a writer is out of inspiration, he can't write, but when a director it's out of inspiration...,well...he can still make money. Again, if you like this kind of movies, go see the movie. But don't forget to pay for it, because that's what it's all about -the money!"
"TheSquiss","2","2","5","2 January 2014"," Oh dear!
","Oh dear.<br/><br/>My initial concerns about casting and the unreasonable padding of a fantastic short novel that I voiced in my review for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey still stand. The Hobbit trilogy is already far too long, far too protracted and all about the money. But whereas part one of the unnecessary trilogy was a visual feast that I mostly enjoyed, part two, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, is a few bright scenes away from dull thud.<br/><br/>You don't need a synopsis so we'll skip that part and simply say that Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and the clutch of dwarfs venture forth through forests and mountains to the lair of the dragon, Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). There is gold, there are elves, there are ugly creatures that will maim and kill aplenty, there are a couple of wizards (one of which still doesn't belong in this tale), there is often more CGI on screen than reality and there's even a certain gold ring slotted into this arduous one hundred and sixty one (!) minutes.<br/><br/>Let's deal with the front and back ends of The Desolation of Smaug. I knew we were in trouble when the first face we saw was Peter Jackson chomping animatedly on a carrot. Again! As for the end, when the screen cut to black, there was a spontaneous, audible groan from the audience as we realized that, yet again, we had been cheated out of any kind of conclusion. Forget a cliffhanger, what Jackson left us with was the video equivalent of half a sentence. *** MINOR PLOT SPOILER ALERT *** Ignore the title; the 'desolation' it implies has either happened eons ago or will happen in the third installment. When Smaug is on screen it's more a case of The Slight Disturbance of the Piles of Gold of Smaug.<br/><br/>And then there's the dialogue, which includes such greasy smudges as:<br/><br/>""Why don't you search me? I could be hiding something in my trousers.""<br/><br/>""Or nothing!""<br/><br/>Yet again characters fill the screen that don't belong: Radaghast (Sylvester McCoy), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) With a book so filled with characters, why on Middle Earth does Jackson insist on mixing up timelines and throwing in trespassers? Is he afraid there isn't a market for his films unless he sexes them up with popular characters? <br/><br/>As my companion once again, Bag, complained, Jackson no longer makes films; he makes platform games with each scene taking us up to another level. Oh, to return to the Jackson of Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners. In a fit of worry, I slipped my Lord of the Rings extended editions into the DVD player to see if I had lost my love of Middle Earth. I haven't. Those films still rock as five-star triumphs, even with the artistic licence taken to fit them into the running time. <br/><br/>There was an awful lot of fidgeting in the seats beneath and around us that just didn't occur in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and I know at least two members of the audience were fighting very hard to stay awake in the final third. And that just shouldn't be the case.<br/><br/>It's far from being awful; the performances are largely as expected and there are moments of action and adventure to warm the heart and take one back to Tolkien's triumph. For the most part it looks absolutely beautiful. The sets, both physical and digital, are spectacular and the scenery is as breathtaking as ever. But, overlooking the copious CGI, Peter Jackson didn't make New Zealand.<br/><br/>We departed the Directors' Lounge with shoulders slumped, dragging feet, heavy hearts and a new title: The Hobbit: The Disappointment of Bag.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a Freeman/Cumberbatch double act that works, step away from the cinema queue, turn around and visit the BBC for series three (and one and two!) of Sherlock; evidence that you don't need bucket loads of cash to make great entertainment and it really is possible to fit an enthralling story into 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

"annasuwinski","6","2","5","1 January 2014"," Bilbo Lost His Way
","Okay, I know that there are 2 sides to every movie based on a book; the die hard fans of the book who never approves of the movie and the people who are just fans of the movie. I for once, is very much a fan of both the books and the movies. I think for this movie it's best to just remove the book out of the equation. Instead of comparing it to the book, I'll compare it to the previous movie, The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey which I think was brilliant.<br/><br/>When I went to the cinema, I didn't have much expectations except the fact that I was prepared to enjoy a movie I was waiting to see for awhile. I came out of the cinema feeling a little disappointed that it was just an OK film. I couldn't say I enjoy it as much and I couldn't say that I didn't like it. It is one of those movies that just seems to float somewhere in between. As a movie in itself it was probably not that bad, but comparing it to the first movie, it did fall a little short. Looking back at the story line, it felt a little draggy and there were some unnecessary plot lines such as the love triangle between the elves and the dwarf. Noted, that the reason that was put in is that so there would be a strong female role. Thinking in that line, even though to me it tip on the ridiculous side at times, it was probably necessary for the general masses to not only create some lightness to the movie but also to give more weight to the plot. Without it, the second movie would just be about a hobbit and a horde of dwarfs walking.<br/><br/>There were times however when things felt a little too forced, such as the dialogue, the jokes and even the graphics. In this case, Peter Jackson wanted to show off some cool graphic stunts. So instead of using the CGI as a tool to help translate the movie, there were scenes that was created in order to show off or written to fit the CGI. There were times that the graphics looked too animated to my taste. It didn't look real anymore and I felt like i was watching a 3D animated film. The specific scene I'm talking about is the barrels in the river. It's suppose to add some action into the movie but the whole point is to make it look believable and not animated. <br/><br/>I mean, we all know Peter Jackson is a very passionate man and only serves to bring the books to justice, but he can do better than this. The first one was great, the second one was a hiccup and we can only hope that the third one will close the series with a bang."
"Pretty-Wycked-Designs","6","2","5","31 December 2013"," Majorly Disappointed
","First and foremost, I was very entertained watching this film, but it does not stay true to the books at all. There is a lot in this movie that just didn't happen in the books. The female elves didn't fight the way they're portrayed to in the movie, and an disproportionate amount of time was spent on the chase scenes and not spent in more of the major elements of the film. There could have been less comic relief and more character development in my opinion. <br/><br/>While the film was fun and entertaining I didn't enjoy it as much as the original nor the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>I recommend it for those who have never read the books or for those who just want to go and be entertained. I think that it was well acted, as always, and I was very pleased to see some of my favorite characters from the Lord of the Rings in this movie."
"matrixus-1","9","2","5","21 December 2013"," Peter Jackson hikes up the pace
","Tolkien fans are in an odd situation when trying to rate Peter Jackson's work after Lord of the Rings. Personally, I have established two different rating systems to compare his work to. One rating is in comparison to all other movies on the market, the other rating is relative to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This might be unfair as explained later. He did however inadvertently raise the bar for epic fantasy movies by creating a masterpiece like Lord of the Rings, so it seems necessary to separate his own work from the remainder.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the first Hobbit installment fell short of the high expectations people came to have from Peter Jackson, with regards to the Tolkien universe, but people, and myself included, probably expected another Lord of the Rings movie, not a movie based on an entirely different book, originally written for children with obviously a very different pacing. Comparing it however to other fantasy/adventure movies, it's still an amazing film, despite it's slower pace and less epic dialog.<br/><br/>The second, much shorter, Hobbit installment was much more action-oriented and therefore had a faster pace, hence why people and myself included rate this movie to be, perhaps unfairly, better than the first one. We also saw previously unseen areas of Middle Earth like Mirkwood and Gandalf's behaviour at the very beginning of ""Lord of the Ring - The Fellowship of the Ring"" is explained in more detail, when Bilbo left and Frodo tells Gandalf him to take the ring, after which Gandalf tells him with great fear in his eyes, that this ring has even too much power for him to wield. The epic battle between powerhouse Gandalf and Sauron instilled so much fear and respect into Gandalf ""The Grey"", that this memory stayed with him all the way into the ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>In true Jackson fashion, ""Desolation of Smaug"" ended with a cliffhanger and left fans yearning for more. Once the entire Hobbit trilogy has been released, I believe fans will judge the first part more favourably and history will smile upon him kindly. The third and final movie will set the overall tone and explain certain dynamics like pacing, which were not understood yet by the time the first movie was released. I trust Jackson to pull it off.<br/><br/>9/10 compared to other movies 8/10 compared to Lord of the Rings."

","Having seen the LOTR trilogy on a number of occasions, I never cease to fall in love with the fascinating characters and intense plots.<br/><br/>Having then watched The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey for the first time, last Christmas, I initially felt that this movie could not have been improved and possibly better than any of the LOTR pieces. I then watched it for a second time and retract my comments. Despite being a very good film, I felt that it relied too much on graphics and less on the 'action' as we saw with LOTR, I therefore feel that the first Hobbit movie deserved an 8/10.<br/><br/>Now onto the important bit, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. I went into the Movie Theatre with mixed expectations, I was not expecting the movie to be as good as I expected the first, but I was also excited to see what Jackson made of it. In all honesty, I was blown away by this movie. The fast-paced scenes left you wanting more and more by the end of the film. I agree with other reviews too that the new characters in the movie are instantly likable and left their own individual mark on the film that I cannot wait to see progress in the final film.<br/><br/>I returned to watch the movie again to see if I would fall into the trap I have laid myself for the first film. I can safely say, my views on the film have nothing if not improved. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I found the end of this movie to be the best of any of Jackson's interpretations so far and I seriously look forward to December 2014.<br/><br/>I feel this movie rates at a 9.5, falling more on the side of 9.0, hence the rating of 9/10."

","A much darker aspect of the movie than was An Unexpected Journey, but still enjoyable, nonetheless. AUJ was jolly and bright in environmental appearance. It built up the story through comedy and action that would unify one adventurous Bilbo w/Thorin and Gang. This time, the scene is more sinister as TDoS has the crew trek their way through dangerous grounds. The tones of gloom and doom are most apparent and even Bilbo's further descent into greed and violence is clearly depicted in the spider scene in Mirkwood Forest. <br/><br/>There were many scenes that were extremely enjoyable such as the barrel scene, Legolas and his superb fighting skills during the barrel scene, Sauron's appearance, Bard's interactions w/the dwarfs, and last, but not least, the absolute beauty and greatly detailed Smaug.

"rahmannoodles22","9","2","5","19 December 2013"," Back to Middle-Earth! The Hobbit 2 - Noodles Review
","While it's still not the perfection I hoped for, it's still a treat. The second installation in The Hobbit trilogy (serving as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy) brings us back to Middle Earth with style and houses a grand feeling of adventure which is the main element I wanted out of this series. The Lord of the Rings is collectively my personal favorite movie of all time. I can say that it's pleasant to have read the book yet not completely know how all the events in the film will unfold. Though some die-hard fans will say that it's too starkly different from the book, I say that's what we should come to accept now. The outside story arcs that aren't in the book (such as Gandalf's personal quest to see if darkness has returned), all make sense and, for the most part, don't feel out-of-place at all. Desolation of Smaug has the right tone throughout the movie; the tone I was looking for in the first movie. In the first one, it held more of a familial tone, and while this film is still a fun-for-family movie, I feel like it grew up and became more like a Lord of the Rings movie (and that's exactly what we want!).<br/><br/>The casting is so well done that the actors/actresses fit their roles so well. They look like essentially exactly what I would imagine them to look like while reading the books or thinking about the characters. Just as well, the acting is pretty much stellar. Martin Freeman proved to me in An Unexpected Journey that he is the definitive Bilbo. He kills it in this role and he nails every expression, mannerism, hobbit-ism, and line in the exactly the way that he should. Also, you can see that his character has grown. I like to see character growth, especially when it's not overtly- clichéd. We saw in the first movie that he was still a homesick peaceful guy, even on the adventure. But he grew since then, and we can see here that he's grown quite courageous, as well as cunning. He even is responsible a lot of the time for getting the gang out of trouble in a bunch of situations. The company of dwarfs is still well acted done and the leader, Thorin Oakenshield, feels even more heroic and leader-like in this film. As well as Gandalf, but we all already know that he's an inherent bad-ass. And then we have the elves. Legolas, who was my favorite character in The Lord of the Rings trilogy for most of my life, is still awesome in this movie. His actions scenes make this movie so much cooler and appealing. However, it's noticeable that he's like a different character in this movie. He's arrogant and comes off as a jerk. I realized that this comes to play in his overall character arc over the span of the entire series, and imagine he'll grow into a more humble warrior in the next movie. The other elf is Tauriel. However she's not in any of the books whatsoever; she was completely made up for this movie. However, she definitely feels like she belongs there and she's acted well. The one thing is just that there's a bit of a small romance and it feels a little bit forced and childish, so I don't think that really fit. A lot of things in this movie, you can tell were shoehorned in by Peter Jackson, especially the involvement of Legolas and Tauriel, but it's executed in such a way that it feels like it belongs there. But the character who really belongs here is Smaug. Smaug is the dragon who lives in the Lonely Mountain, which is where the Company of Dwarfs is journeying to in order to reclaim it as their kingdom. Smaug, is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch; and they could not have picked anyone better. He lends just the right tone of voice and speaks so articulately; it's amazing. Smaug gives off the perfect vibe of arrogance; you can tell he condescends upon everyone. He was a memorable character and he was so menacing that I don't think I'll ever forget him as a movie antagonist. <br/><br/>The special effects are also breathtaking. The dragon is designed so flawlessly. The CGI in other scenes was mostly on point; however it did slack a little bit at some moments, so there's a minor gripe there. The goblins are done better in this movie though. One of my major gripes with the first movie is that firstly, the baddies were done with CGI, and secondly, I could easily tell they were. Thankfully in this movie, a lot of them are done with makeup and prosthetics so there's a more realistic and gritty feel to them. The feel of the entire movie is much more exciting. One of my main problems with first movie was that it had pacing issues and lot of it felt slow or uninteresting. But Desolation is turned on for pretty much all of it 161-minute runtime; it's exciting and something's happening, almost all the time. It slows down a bit, but that could just be in relativity because the rest of the movie there's so much stuff happening. <br/><br/>All in all, Desolation of Smaug is a greatly welcomed installment to the series, and it's a great improvement over the first movie. It's more-so like An Unexpected Journey was actually just building up to the events of this film. This movie capitalizes on a lot of what it's got; the characters and action are spectacular, while the overall scope and tone are going in the right direction. Hopefully, the final film in the trilogy will veer towards even greater excellency, as there is still room to improve. However, The Desolation of Smaug as a movie is the opposite of a desolation."

","I am a big fan of Peter Jackson films and Tolkien books. Of course that ""The Desolation of Smaug"" it has too many scenes created by Peter Jackson that aren't in the book. However The story line of the movie is awesome. I really like the incorporation of Tauriel and Legolas in the movie and their roles.<br/><br/>What i didn't like from the movie is that the music in the scenes is gone, there is no music!. Where is the music of Howard Shore that was carrying/play the scenes of the movie, the fights, the humor. It does not have the main songs of the first movie of the hobbit. Many scenes where its actually boring."
"TravisLikesSmoothJazz","8","2","5","14 December 2013"," Big improvement. SPOILERS FORM THE FIRST 30 MINUTES!
","I was a big fan of The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey, however it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. This one on the other was much better. It has likable characters, great effects, stellar action, good acting, great directing and camera work, and Smaug (won't go into further details on why this dragon is so freaking awesome). <br/><br/>My only problem with the movie is that the first 30 minutes are a bit rushed. The entire segment with Beorn and Mirkwood should've been dragged out more. Martin Freeman i fantastic as Bilbo, Ian McKellen is terrific as Gandalf, and all of the dwarfs are well acted. A common complaint about the movie is that there are too many characters, i would've been lying if i didn't notice this as well. The do take liberties with the source material. I didn't mind with most of them, even though there are changes I didn't like. <br/><br/>Overall: this movie improves greatly on an already great film."
"nino-jovcov","10","4","14","17 December 2013"," It took a deep breath and then blew me away
","The Beorn scene: I see it as taking a deep breath. Insecure one, for sure, but deep enough to blow me away after wards. In that scene I kind of had a felling that Jackson intention was to ""correct the mistake"" from the previous one, on which critics had pointed out. He rushed into really serious tone, being ""afraid"" that he will be criticized for silly humor again. I think, that the Beorn scene, in the book, belongs to that silly and childish part of the story, and then, slowly, gets serious. Maybe then Tolkien realized he could write a story for everyone. But, thanks to that deep breath, nevertheless Beorns segment was left out of the competition, the movie accomplishes to rise in speed of light to a level of a real spectacle. Using the ""further reading"" and his imagination, Jackson finally succeeds to place this trilogy very close to his old one, on the scale of epic adaptations of Tolkiens Middle-earth. Luke Evans in the role of Bard proved to be an excellent compensation of Beorns ""shortcomings"", and Orlando Bloom finally passed the exam. Evangeline Lilly took his title from LOTR trilogy, being the weakest link in the cast. This sequel cleverly and seriously maintains tension and brings new breathtaking scenes, it also leaves plenty of space for third to catch the momentum. I wouldn't recommend it to the youngest, unlike its predecessor, because it has completely lost children's atmosphere, as the book itself was developing in that manner, so that's commendable. Scenes with Smaug represent homework for any film maker out there. Highest level of cinematography. Brilliant!<br/><br/>9.7 out of 10."

"Al_The_Strange","10","4","14","15 December 2013"," ""It never ceases to amaze me, the courage of hobbits...""
","The journey of the 13 dwarfs of Erebor and one hobbit from the Shire continues. An Unexpected Journey proved to be a disappointment for many, and chances are that The Desolation of Smaug will continue to disappoint, given that this is still a heavily-padded and overblown account of a short novel that was once a short cartoon. They've really tacked on a whole bunch of embellishments, including new characters and subplots, that simply aren't in Tolkein's The Hobbit. If it wasn't clear before, it should be clear now that the Hobbit films are more like a massive compilation of bonus adventures for film fans who adored the Lord of the Rings films.<br/><br/>As one of those viewers, I personally welcome the expanded narrative and universe, no matter how absurdly thin the plot is spread out. At the time of this writing, The Desolation of Smaug has got to be the most epic and action-packed film of all the Middle-Earth films to date (second only to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). The film wastes little time in getting the ball (or barrels) rolling; it picks right up with everybody being chased by orcs, giant spiders, and wood elves. I always thought that the barrel scene was clever in the book, but the film takes it to a whole new level. The wood elves (among which, one familiar face appears, and Turiel might be a new favorite heroine) pull off some insane fight moves, the likes of which I can only describe as some kind of crazy elfin kung-fu (elf-fu?). The film maintains tension throughout the Laketown and Erebor scenes, before finally bringing the heroes face-to-face with Smaug. This massive dragon is easily one of the most menacing villains of all time, and the last act of the film is a long and exhausting sequence in which all the characters slide down mounds of treasure, bash through walls, and careen through underground mines, while being pursued by this fire-breathing monstrosity. And that's not all either: while all this is happening, Gandalf comes face-to-face with another evil opponent, and his scenes are impressively epic as well.<br/><br/>Then...THEN...the film ends. Of all the excesses this film goes through, it's the sudden stop at the end that I find most bothersome; it's every bit as disappointing as cutting off a piece of music before its crescendo. On the inevitable home video release, this won't be much of a problem, since you'll probably just be able to pop in There and Back Again and continue the action. In the cinema, I sensed a collective disappointment in the knowledge that we'll have to wait one more year before seeing the actual battle of Laketown, in addition to wrapping up every other conflict that's left hanging (and a LOT is left hanging). The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was able to stand on its own, with a full climax at the Battle of Helm's Deep; if that battle's conclusion was cut off and left for The Return of the King, then you can imagine how it is with The Desolation of Smaug.<br/><br/>There are other issues that might throw viewers off: there are quite a few scenes where deus ex machina are in full swing, with characters appearing as convenient. The film still plows through a bunch of subplots that might not really seem necessary (although, the whole Necromancer thing seems more tightly developed now).<br/><br/>Regardless, the film still adheres to the fundamental plot structure of The Hobbit novel. It's very much a one-thing-leads-to-another structure. What matters the most are the characters; Bilbo seems to be in the spotlight more, with more maturity and strength being explored. The dwarf characters show even more nuances of their own. Various other characters have their moments, and it is especially intriguing to see a lot more to the Bard and the Laketown drama. There are numerous connections drawn among all the different characters and tangents, and the larger structure of all six Middle-Earth films is much more apparent. At its core, the film still explores key themes involving the adventure of life, the corruption of greed, and the classic struggle of good-vs-evil.<br/><br/>As before, this film is made with exceptional skill. Photography and editing continue to be superb. Acting and writing are still top-notch; Martin Freeman proves to be quite impeccable as Bilbo, Richard Armitage still plays it tough as Thorin, Benedict Cumberbatch is truly menacing as the dragon's voice, Evangeline Lilly is both lovely and badass, and Luke Evans is alright. You also can't go wrong with Ian McKellen; the man really IS Gandalf the Grey. Writing is as good as ever. This production uses great-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is still good too.<br/><br/>This is still quite a bloated saga, but I personally don't mind one bit. The spectacle is huge, the storytelling is still very tight and engaging, and the film is still very well-made. It's only a shame that the film ends the way it does. Regardless, if The Hobbit series follows in the same path as the Star Wars prequels, I have no doubt that There and Back Again will be the best of the lot, and one hell of a spectacle. This is still just the middle part of the saga; there's still more to take care of in the Middle Earth.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"

The Desolation of Smaug is 100% Middle-Earth just like the Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>I know, Pete didn't follow the book word by word, he introduced characters that don't appear in the books, but always stays in the sense of Tolkiens books. The Hobbit is a child's book, without any additions it would have been a pretty boring movie. All (or most) additions are based on text from Tolkien himself (annotations of Lotr, ...). So I don't understand why so many are upset about that. Be glad to see more of Middle-Earth which wouldn't have made it to an own movie. Pete shows Middle-Earth as he sees it, it's an opinion not every one has to agree to, but nevertheless these are f***ing great movies. I can't think of any other movie with more love for detail and more passion of the filmmakers. And I'm sure Pete didn't split it into 3 films just to make more money, he wants to give the real fans as much of Middle-Earth as he can and I'm so glad he does! For me, he could have split it into 6 :D I enjoy every second of it, actually I'm even more excited about the scenes that are not based on the Hobbit book: the white council, Dol Guldur, Radagast, ...<br/><br/>Last but not least: to see Smaug and Bilbo together on the big screen is worth every cent I've paid and I'm sure I'll go and see it again in cinema.

The pacing is fast and exciting with some huge action set pieces. There is this Barrel sequence that is just plain awesome. <br/><br/>The characters are more fleshed out in this movie though some are still not developed properly. New additions to the trilogy are Legolas and Tauriel. Both were Bad-Ass. Though I know they were shoe Horned into the movie but they made some of the action scenes awesome. There is a love triangle in the movie. That could bother some people.<br/><br/>The Best part in this film is Smaug the Dragon voiced and motion- captured by Benedict Cumberbatch. Smaug was menacing. The CGI of Smaug was Amazing. The performances are still good especially Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Orlando Bloom, Evangeline Lily, Lee Pace, Luke Evans and Sir Ian McKellen..<br/><br/>There are a few problems. The movie has a lot of differences from the book but it does expand the universe. There are a few CGI shots that could have been polished. <br/><br/>The soundtrack by Howard Shore is good but no the best.

"Jschmeck416","9","3","10","10 January 2014"," Excellent and surprising addition to the Hobbit Trilogy
","I am not going to delve into a full review of this movie, but let me tell you it is excellent. I am an avid Tolkein fan, and yes it is true there there are changes abroad to his works in this film, but it is so well done that I do not mind. What people need to do is stop comparing The Hobbit movies to the LOTR movies. The books have a different tone from each other so why shouldn't the movies. Jackson does make strides on the DoS to make the movie match the Epic feel of the LOTR but there is no possible way to match that and I think Jackson knows this. The problem is that many of the fans do not. Plain and simple, DoS is brilliant, action packed, and introduces one of the best villains in any of the movies...Smaug."
"Aizkalnietis","6","3","10","16 December 2013"," Why split the book it in three movies??
","Now. When I watched the first movies of Hobbit (An Unexpected Journey), I felt that it was justified to dedicate just a bit less than half of the book to it. It was very much like the book, with few added scenes, like of ""Radagast the brown"" that is barely mentioned in the book and actually gave a better understanding of the story. A perfect adaptation of the Book! <br/><br/>After watching the second part (Desolation of Smaug), I see only one reason of why the remaining +/- 60% of the story were split in two parts, which is, putting it plainly - Why not kill the chicken that lays golden eggs one year later and squeeze as many eggs as you can? Makes sense, right? (Money rules the world!) The difference from the first movie, however, is noticeable - to maintain, more or less the same length of the movie and leave enough material for the third part at the same time, more scenes had to be invented. Elf-dwarf romance felt unnecessary, just as the ""catch me if you can"" game that dwarfs played with Smaug in the halls of the Lonely Mountain (visually impressive, bravo to that!) also left me wondering of it's actual necessity. The movie ends where the chapter ""Fire and Water"" of the book starts - leaving not that much to tell, about 20% of written story. Unless the makers of the third part of the movie have some aces hidden in their sleeves, I am afraid that the third part will need to be filled with even more, even less necessary scenes. <br/><br/>Concluding. If you are of fan of fantasy and of Tolkien's world as such, of course, you will not doubt to go and see this movie. Just as you will wait for the third part to come out and, as a faithful fan that you are, you will go and see that too. Still, to me, it left a bit of a feeling of deception and I can give it only 6 stars VS 9.5 that I would give to the first part."

","Haters gonna hate! I am big LOTR fan having red most of the books and still sometimes checking wiki- related pages to refresh the knowledge I have about the Tolkien's fantasy world, I am still amazed by Peter Jackson's interpretation in these books. He clearly demonstrates that he undestands the dynamics of the book and adapts the story to cinema in a better way to enhance audience's experience. I totally advocate Peter Jackson's way of adapting the books to the cinema world. Although Tolkien's world is amazing, movies (even adaptations) are not supposed to follow the books precisely. You should leave some of the content to the director's interpretation and imagination. I loved all the characters and acting in the second movie and it has already become one of my favorite movies of all time. It was great to see Gandalf casting spells, Legolas bouncing around as a great warrior, dwarfs fighting in harmony, and the magnificence of the dragon Smaug. I was thrilled to my bones while watching hoping that it will never finish. I just hope that the third movie will be even more epic and thrilling and I hope it will not be the end for Tolkien adaptations to Hollywood."

","Just went to seem the movie with high expectation and let me just say how disappointed i was. Peter Jackson who i dearly admire and love, took a 15 minute bit out of the book and made it into a two hour film which you could sleep through and awaken from time to time just to see the special effects. The movie in this part continues by the book as we join our merry companions on there way to the lonely mountain, but from there about 90% is just made up and has no connection to the book what so ever,what are all the extra characters for? why do we need more plot lines that amount to nothing at the end? let me add that the ""HOBBIT"" as you know is a children book and has many parables about: Friendship,camaraderie, being brave, being possessive, good and bad and so on, but it pains me to see how all of this impotent parables are quickly cast aside just to make time for more special effects, whats the point of the story if not for that. I was very disappointed and i think that its a shame because the first one was so lovely and this one really ruined it for me"
"spencer_kimbrough","7","3","10","13 December 2013"," Worth a watch, but doesn't live up to its potential.
","Let me start off by saying that I have been a Tolkien fan my entire life. I grew up reading the books and watching the movies. That is part of the reason I was disappointed. This movie had the potential to be one of the best movies of the year, but fell flat. While I am not sure if it was the studio or Peter Jackson who made the decision to split The Hobbit into three 3-hour long movies, whoever it was made the wrong decision. While I appreciate the additional characters and subplots introduced, the entire movie just felt like it was being dragged out. I think had they decided to either split The hobbit into two 3-hour movies or three movies of a normal length, this movie would have been excellent. Instead,I spent most of the movie wishing the plot would speed up and something interesting would happen. In addition to the movie dragging on way longer than it should, at several points in the movie the acting seems stale and forced. The highlights for me were Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug and Luke Evans as Bard. The movie is by no means bad, and is relatively enjoyable, but it does not live up the Lord of the Rings. Its slow plot progression and forced acting definitely take away from the final product."
"Remy_Azhary","10","4","16","12 December 2013"," Great epic rendition to a standalone children's fantasy...and then some!
","Peter Jackson did a brilliant job in taking liberal creative license in bringing out the epic feel of this continuation from a rather innocent book meant for children. This installment is very much different from the first film not just of its epic scale but particularly Jackson's input to incorporate darker themes with more adult-oriented storyline which includes romantic plots.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning I felt that there was some sort of a disconnection or that certain lacking of association from the first film even though this one is a continuation from of the first.<br/><br/>For those who have actually read the book you would have known that one significant addition to this film was the inclusive of the female elf, Tauriel, and her lingering romance with Legolas of whom the latter was not even written in the book.<br/><br/>To make things even more complicated or rather to have that somewhat tasteful twist to it, Jackson even had Tauriel to be emotionally attached to one of the dwarfs, Kili, that in my opinion was the hottest one of all and did not look anything like a dwarf.<br/><br/>But I appreciate Jackson's approach to bring Tolkien's beloved children's book in another direction.<br/><br/>If THE HOBBIT book could be regarded as a standalone fiction on itself then I'm I'm glad that Jackson and his co-writers, Phillipa Boyens and and Fran Walsh, actually took the painstaking effort to link THE HOBBIT films to THE LORD OF THE RINGS especially with familiar characters of Sauron, Galadriel, Saruman and Elrond.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, the film obviously reveals to us the dragon Smaug in all of his glory. And all I can say is that the fire-drake's appearance was simply breathtaking. That was how a dragon is suppose to look like. Somehow, I can't help but to make a comparison between this dragon Smaug to that of the one in Dennis Quaid's DRAGONHEART especially with the authoritative vocalizations provided Benedict Cumberbatch that sounded eerily similar to Sean Connery's vocal portrayal. Nevertheless, I'm impressed by Smaug's presence.<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>However, I do have to say that ending was not what I'd expected at all even though I am fully aware that there would be a concluding episode to the whole HOBBIT franchise coming out next year. And that is the film's super abrupt cliffhanger. As you could imagine from Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy the ending of the first two films had their share of cliffhangers of their own. Yet in THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the ending was so abrupt that it practically choked many of the audience in the theater. It was that abrupt as if Jackson himself had no idea of how to end the film subtly like THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING or THE TWO TOWERS or other films for that matter.<br/><br/>But needless to say, I am pretty pleased by the outcome of THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG."

Where can you watch the film with Oscar winner and do it without pomp and ceremony? Danis you are just a great person, as well as director.<br/><br/>As far as film goes it is another Lord of the Rings film.

"paavanpshukla","7","4","16","13 December 2013"," As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat.
","The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the ""whitewater rafting"" scene which also seems like a water park ride! That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non- King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film. One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, when complete, will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. (The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced, even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR.) Incidentally, Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished, Jackson's six Middle-earth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology. Gandalf didn't have much screen presence this time. Its the Elves leaded by Legolas that bring smartness to the film and Tauriel is a scene stealer. In the end the Dwarfs, Gandalf, Elves, Orcs, Smaug were thrown to different places so they have to get together for ""There and Back Again"". 'Arkenstone' and 'Black arrow' will have much to play in the grand finale. Jackson has also given us a smoldering elfin heroine, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), whose skill with a bow and arrow matches that of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien may like sitting through a 169 minute film,but I didn't! this easily could have been trimmed by at least 50 minutes. Yes,Its long, VERY LONG. <br/><br/>Coming to the end part,I thought that the dragon will be killed. At least I hoped so but no! The last a few sequences are fun. As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat. I would give this one 6.75 on 10.

Smash looks incredible and is voiced excellently. Not a lot of Gandolf or the orcs in this movie, because this chapter is based more on the task at hand rather than Orc attacks.

My friends, this is a very long cinematographic work, it is ingenious and phenomenal. I saw it in Ultra AVX (increased frame rate) 3D and it was vivid, crystal clear and deep. The team of pure talent and intelligence that created this epic visual portrayal literally succeeded in bringing life to myth and making legend real... Production on The Silmarillion will undoubtedly begin. This is a vast improvement from the last Hobbit film. See for yourself, just go to the theatre well rested, it's worth it. It would not be possible to make a better film. They made the best film humanly possible."

","The Hobbit's journey is getting more interesting with more characters thrown in with a lot of action. All the actors have done their part well. But the climax could have been crispier. Good movie, Lots of Grey canvas, so we enjoyed it more than our son. The actors cannot be envisaged as the stars any more as they sink into their respective characters and we can empathize with each one's loss and see them for what they are. The barrel scene was great to watch. The wood elf king was impressive in a short role too. But we did miss the green glory of Bilbo's Shire and the fascinating Elf Kingdom. The Elf clan's arrival at every turn at the last minute to help out the dwarfs is quite repetitive and we could predict their appearance beforehand in some places. But our hobbit and his company is lovable still in spite of all their flaws.It's a good movie, go for it!"
"jjr22222","9","3","11","12 December 2013"," Much more LotR-esque!
","MILD SPOILERS! For me there were three issues with An Unexpected Journey, first, the uneven pacing, second, the silly tone, and third, bloodless swords and weapons (which for whatever reason just irritates me in many a fantasy movies, but hey, Lord of the Rings had bloody weapons). As far as I'm concerned, all was fixed in The Desolation of Smaug, except maybe the latter even though the violence is really ramped up here. After seeing it last night I've come up with two things that I really disliked, though one is minor; first, there are some terrible GoPro POV style shots in the water with the barrels, and second, Azog and now Bolg, are simply pitiful villains. But really, this was so much better than the first and more akin to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which I adore.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes were all the stuff with Gandalf in Dul Guldur, just badass, and also Smaug and Bilbo, very tense actually, I thought. Oh also, the scene where a baby spider gets close to the ring and Bilbo goes crazy on it, good stuff. Beorn was pretty cool too, and I wish we spent a bit more time with him. A lot more character development with the dwarfs (and others) happens here too, I still wish Bofur would speak in Dwarvish though! Another plus, multiple stories/perspectives! I think that's something that was also probably sorely missing in An Unexpected Journey. So yes, the dwarfs get split up, there's Tauriel and Legolas, Bard, Gandalf, and Bilbo separated with Smaug for a time. It made things all the more grand. Last bit, this is much darker too. More violence, darker themes, and even a literal darker colour palette, which I really prefer, as stated.<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring: 9.0 The Two Towers: 8.9 The Return of the King: 9.5 An Unexpected Journey: 8.3 The Desolation of Smaug: 9.2<br/><br/>A very solid second entry, I and many others are eagerly awaiting There and Back Again! Hopefully it is as great!"
"RohanSolo","2","2","6","19 January 2015"," Peter Jackson has milked it too much
","I was told that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was terrible. I didn't want to believe it because I very much liked the first one. It wasn't too dark,it mainly followed the book and didn't get boring. However, the Desolation of Smaug was as terrible as I had been informed. I think the main reason for this is that it tried too hard. It was trying to be as big as The Lord of The Rings, but it didn't work because of the setting, there was nowhere for a huge battle to take place. So instead (spoiler alert), they got loads of orcs to chase the escaping dwarfs down the river in a pretty stupid, gravity defying scene. I'm sorry but there is no way that the fat dwarf could have survived that. Another factor is about the name of the film. ""The Hobbit'. I forgot Bilbo was in it halfway through, its not really about him. You see most of the dwarfs more than him. My final point is my problem with Bard, he is a discount Aragorn (hence my username). They wanted a hero in it and because Aragorn was popular, they picked up the first guy who looked like him. He is the poundland version of Aragorn, cheap and nasty. So, I rate this film 2/10 because of the main story, It doesn't excite you and could do with being shorter. I had no problem with the acting. But, it isn't not the worst film ever made, I have rated this 2/10 because there is only one film that I consider to be 1/10 because the film (which I will not name) ruined my life. If Peter Jackson wants to continue making good films, he has to stop milking the cow that is Middle Earth."
"among-the-wildflowers","8","2","6","7 January 2014"," My boyfriend makes me watch these movies.
","My boyfriend has made me watch all of the Lord of The Rings movies, the past Hobbit and tonight we saw this one. All of them are confused in my mind and I can't recall what happened when and what was supposed to be before or after, it's all out of order, but most of the time it's just people walking far distances and overcoming obstacles so it's almost irrelevant anyway. The filming, editing, characters, music and effects about these movies are amazing it's just that the story line for me is not the most captivating which I know is an unpopular opinion so I won't bother factoring that into my rating. One thing that confuses me is why Orlando Bloom's eyes keep changing colour. I actually thought he was supposed to be an evil cousin from his other character who had brown eyes because Gandolf said something about beware of the elves who are less intelligent than their relatives and then Orlando Bloom was living in this other town suddenly and seemed to be jealous and less like the beautiful magical being I had remembered him as. My boyfriend was confused as to what evil cousin I was talking about after the movie so I guess I had that all wrong the entire time. The creators of this movie are amazingly good at creating these lands, villages and kingdoms that I wish really existed so I could go and live there forever. This film introduced some good characters such as the barge guy who helped them and Stephen Fry's cute little assistant guy. I can never remember their names. The dragon was also likable for being an unlikeable character. Love when that happens. However, I was sad that the best character of all didn't make a single appearance in this movie: Gollum. I love him, he's adorable and he makes it all worthwhile. But that's okay, I still paid attention the whole time. I give it an 8 out of 10 because the creators of it are crazy good at creating worlds, characters and excellent movies that many people love. I take away 1 point for the eye confusion and another for the lack of Gollum. It's not my favourite type of film but it takes a lot of time, talent and creative genius to put things like this together. Great work."
"dfle3","8","2","6","7 January 2014"," Return of the form...
","Have to say that I went into the cinema with a feeling of trepidation for this sequel, seeing as how weak and dull I found the first installment. It wouldn't have surprised me if it was as bad as the first one, which would have put in mind George Lucas' Star Wars prequels (where the final chapter was the only decent one of the lot) or The Matrix sequels, which diminished the legacy of the first one.<br/><br/>In any case, I'm happy to report that the trilogy is on track now, which is a good thing...I can't imagine being motivated to continue watching the trilogy if the first two were plain rubbish.<br/><br/>Even though I haven't refreshed my memory of the first one (why would you?), I sort of bluffed my way into the sequel, despite wondering on occasion whether this was the sequel to the great ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy or the prequel. So, for those of you playing at home, it might help to watch the movies in quick succession so you don't forget the narrative. The sequel doesn't make things easy for the absent viewer by jumping straight into the middle of things without a preamble along the ""Previously on The Hobbit..."" line.<br/><br/>The movie was pretty action packed but not in a bad way. It was all entertaining stuff in other words. Can't say that I was engrossed/entranced by the story, but I liked how it was on track as far as the major threads of the story go (the dwarfs quest to reclaim their kingdom and vanquish the dragon living there now). Speaking of the dragon, into this movie I was wondering what a ""Smaug"" was...one of the cons of only seeing these movies during their cinema runs. 'Interestingly', I 'learned' in the first movie that dragons ""covet"" gold. In this movie I learned that dragons can speak. I initially thought that this was an effect of the ring worn by Bilbo Baggins, but turns out not to be the case. It kind of made more sense if you attributed that power speech to the ring (...!).<br/><br/>One thing I liked about the movie included star of ""Lost"" Evangeline Lilly's turn as an Elf...she was quite nice as an Elf.<br/><br/>Managed to recognise some actors in this movie...picked Stephen Fry right away, despite all his makeup, as well as Sylvester McCoy, but that may have been due to having recently watched ""Doctor Who: The ultimate guide""...because I'm pretty sure McCoy must have played the same character in the first movie. I also thought that perhaps Fry did the voice for Smaug in this movie, but I was mistaken on that front.<br/><br/>In my review of the first movie of this trilogy, I go into the things that bothered me about it. For this movie, I suppose the best that I can come up with is to question whether barrels really do have the floatative properties that they have in the movie. Hmm...actually, I forgot to mention how the Elves in this movie seem to knock the Orcs down like ninepins. Hell, one Elf would seem capable of taking out an entire Orc army!<br/><br/>Just a minor observation...I could have sworn I saw the infamous name ""Alan Smithee"" in the credits...around the bottom, right hand side of the credits...but now that I think about it, maybe it was in that section...I do remember reading somewhere that the director makes an appearance in this movie...so, perhaps he didn't use his real name? If this movie had turned out as bad as the first then it would have been fair enough for good ol' Smithee to take the credit for the directing in this movie too!<br/><br/>Hopefully the final chapter of this trilogy will really make up for the poor start...something which really captures the imagination more and engrosses you. Whilst this movie was entertaining, it felt more like it was joining the dots as far as action and narrative check points were concerned. I'd like to be absorbed by the next movie and not just entertained.<br/><br/>One last thing...I mentioned the Easter egg of the director's appearance in this movie...I also remember reading somewhere, I think, that Peter Jackson included a character from LOTR who doesn't feature in The Hobbit. Perhaps it was Legolas. Maybe that's a bit of a plot hole? As in, is it coherent that Legolas would be in that part of the world at that particular point in time? Since its been a while since I saw the LOTR trilogy and the first Hobbit movie, I have to say that at times I wondered ""Is that Legolas? Or is it the other blonde guy?"". They kind of looked similar."
"GrandThanksReviews","7","2","6","5 January 2014"," Although stretched on occasion, this proved a far more action packed adventure than it's predecessor.
","WARNING: Potential plot spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Date Watched: 01/01/14 <br/><br/>Like most dedicated cinema goers I got caught up in the storm that was the three Lord of the Ring movies. I enjoyed each film as they were all a unique part of one of cinema's greatest masterpieces. That is undeniable. Yet, as I only came to Tolkien's books in the months leading up to the Fellowship of the Ring, I judged them purely as film's rather than on the literature that they came from. As a film fan I was whisked away into the wonderful journey of Frodo and co, yet found the three hours of each film tiresome on occasion.<br/><br/>However, three films for three separate books is a natural fit. This is why the cynic inside me struggled to see two Hobbit movies for only one book (a considerably shorter book than each of the three Lord of the ring books) as anything more that Hollywood greed. Some of the book's greatest fans will argue that many plot threads were sacrificed in the first trilogy (namely Tom Bombadil), but their argument was completely lost on me when I learnt that it was in fact three movies needed to tell Bilbo's story. I felt no different when I went to the cinema to watch the first instalment on New Year 's Day 2013. Whilst exciting scenes were present, the majority of an unexpected journey was stretched and left me with little desire to pay and sit through numbers two and three.<br/><br/>Yet, destiny led me to Smaug through losing a game of rock, paper, scissors on New Year's Day 2014. When paper defeated my rock, I realised I would have to sit through a film I had no intention to see over The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. For the most part, despite my cynicism and the fact I haven't actually read the hobbit, I was pleasantly surprised. The back story had already been told, and this was of great benefit. The first face we see is a carrot munching cameo by Peter Jackson. Thereafter, the film takes flight with great haste.<br/><br/>Bilbo, Gandalf and their band of dwarfs are still on the run from the pursuing Orcs. The action is fast paced and unrelenting in the opening scenes. Along with Orcs, a skin changing bear, and vicious spiders we see the character of Bilbo maturing, as he becomes a true asset for the dwarfs he travels with. Martin Freeman, also develops as an actor, moving away from a purely grumpy every-man performance, and providing a range of emotions and depth worthy of the reluctant hero. He pushes his character to darker places as the ring begins to take hold. Similarly, Thorin shows signs of an inner battle, which Richard Armitage handles skilfully. They are both complemented by the great ensemble cast that remain from the original film, along with strong additions in the form of Evangeline Lily, Luke Evans and the return of Orlando Bloom as Legolas. The main character, as always with Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien, was of course New Zealand. It's awe-inspiring landscapes transporting you to the very heart of middle earth.<br/><br/>However, it was during the quieter scenes the film threatened to drag. The introduction of the elves did provide the audience with comedy dialogue that complemented slapstick laughs, but establishing a love triangle (between Legolas, Tauriel and Kili) stalled the fast pace ever so slightly. Similarly, the initial scenes at the lake town were only lifted by a witty offering from Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>These lulls were brief and sandwiched by further action with an exciting white water rapid escape from the Orcs, Gandalf losing an Orc battle, and the wonderful scene when Bilbo comes head to head with the deadly Smaug (fantastically voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). This latter scene simmers until Smaug's great fire erupts into fight against the resourceful dwarfs. In spite of myself I was left wanting more, as the beastly dragon flies off towards the lake town with mayhem on his mind. I now eagerly await continuing this New Year tradition in 2015.<br/><br/>Neil M (Grand Thanks Reviews)"
"pete-murphy97","8","2","6","31 December 2013"," A fruitful re-imagination that hits the spot
","As I scroll through the reviews of this film, I can't help but get the impression that a vast majority of people exert a sense of misconstrued discombobulation, many whom expect something that resembles perfection and complete accuracy - That's where many fall short; frankly, Tolkien never intended for the Hobbit to follow an exact path but more so to serve a churlish prelude, a foreword for what would become a successive Lord of the Rings trilogy. To put it simply, this re-imagination is synchronised with the nature that Tolkien essentially intended. And I think that people are seldom taking the film with a pinch of salt (If you know what I mean)<br/><br/>Onto the film itself. The Desolation of Smaug gives a refreshing perspective onto the envisioning of Middle-Earth, initially provided by the esteemed Tolkien. It may seem stretched for material at times, (I'm referring to Legolas and Tauriel here) however it never held the viewer astray from the fundamental attributes that really formed what is conceived so effectively in this title, that being the almost fairytale natured approach that I believe is necessary. - Think of it like a typical quest for gold from a Dragon; myth and maverick is all that is being portrayed here in the shadow of the Lord of the Rings. This film serves well for what it is, we need to remember that this is a prelude aimed at younger audiences and for forming the story behind the ring and the rise of Sauron. NOT something to be taken with overt 'high-fantasy' seriousness. It's light hearted fantasy at most, and I think delivers in regard to Tolkien's intention for the Hobbit.<br/><br/>Now in regard to criticism, and I'm being reasonable. I didn't approve of how fighting was constantly used between scenes as an interval, I think it needed to be split into pieces for visual digestion and not just thrown at the viewer as a filler. Also while the CGI was beautiful it became repetitive and I felt that not enough of the characters were shown as a result, it was more a distraction from the story than an enhancement most of the time. <br/><br/>And because of that, I can't rate it any lower or higher than 8, it was thoroughly enjoyable and I eagerly anticipate the sequel coming next year."
"b-meyers","9","2","6","29 December 2013"," People ask too much of this series
","I knew this would happen.<br/><br/>In 'An Unexpected Journey', Jackson and co. copped a pasting from fans, many who have submitted reviews for this movie as well, stating that the movie dragged on.<br/><br/>So, he goes out and provides an action-packed movie this time around, and is smacked again, this time for not staying true to the book? Can the guy ever win? What 'The Desolation of Smaug' provides is a fantastic action-adventure story. Bilbo continues to build into a stronger, more courageous character, Thorin's obsession begins to come to the fore, and Gandalf has a side-story of his own that starts to blend the overall story-arc with that of Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>I read a complaint that this movie feels as though it is directed at a younger audience. Of course, the person making the complaint fails to acknowledge that the overall tone of the book he holds so dear is also directed at a younger demographic. I was 12 when I read it. Others I know were around the same age - THAT is who the book is directed at, so why not the movie? The adaption of Smaug to the big screen was brilliant and I loved his scenes with Bilbo, and I LIKED the involvement of the elves to the level they were used. Their action sequences were breathtaking, and it was great to see a little more depth added to the character of Thranduil.<br/><br/>I guess you can't please all of the people, all of the time, but I've long thought that many reviewers look for things to have a whine about, and reading the user-reviews for this movie confirm that.<br/><br/>Take care."

","I really enjoyed the first Hobbit, but definitely agreed that the first hour or so could be cut (save it for the boring extended cut). This film doesn't suffer from that as much. It's a fast paced adventure film. Did it take a few liberties, yes. What book to movie adaptation doesn't though? As for the love triangle, who cares? I could do without it, but it wasn't a detriment to the story and hardly took up any screen time anyways. It's a trade-off...you deal with a love triangle, but you get Legolas and more elves into the mix...I'm cool with that. It brings some excitement to the story. There were some problems I had with the movie however. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: - Great pace and action level.<br/><br/><ul><li>Great special effects. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Amazing set design and costuming (on par with the original LotR series).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Though not part of the Tolkien canon, I liked the female elf as well as the addition of Legolas.

I LOVED the river scene, but it looked more like a video game than a film.

Trim the fat from the first two films and you could easily add enough material to nix the third one and make TWO very good Hobbit films which tell the full story.<br/><br/>I think this will end up being the best of the Hobbit films. Mark my words. <br/><br/>P.S. Note to Peter Jackson: You don't NEED to create scenarios to tie the Hobbit in with the LotR...It already takes care of that with Bilbo finding the ring and all...leave it there. You try too hard to ""Lord of the Ringize,"" (sp?) every little thing in the Hobbit. Give it its own distinct style."

"Olivia_Lopez4","8","2","6","28 December 2013"," Tolkien and Jackson; The distinction
","Having seen and read The Lord Of The Rings series, I was excited to hear that Peter Jackson would continue his saga with The Hobbit. Now I understand the main purpose for investing in The Hobbit and making it a three part series was to suck all the money they can out of this franchise, however that doesn't make me less excited for it. When I learned that Jackson was dividing it into three parts, I was annoyed and disappointed. How could he make one book into three movies. Hearing this news as a Tolkien fan, I knew it was going to be a flop, but I went to the movies anyways. I thought the first one was excellently made. I knew a lot was changed about the story but not too much. It had enough light humor and amazing acting, that one could enjoy the movie anyways. After seeing the second film, (TDOS) I was extremely frustrated. I loved the film and the acting and everything about Peter Jackson's style as a director, but I was so annoyed with how much the plot differed from the book. After seeing it again and revising the novel, I did come to understand the importance of the distinction of Tolkien's story, and Jackson's story. Having come to that conclusion, I now appreciate and love TDOS so much more. <br/><br/>I understand Jackson included many parts to the story that were not in the original one. He needed to make the film longer. Also, it is pretty evident that he aimed to show how the story of Bilbo with the dwarfs leads right into Frodo's with the ring. In Tolkien's book, we never learn of Tauriel, Legolas, or Gandalf's separate adventures. The new introduction of characters was a bit annoying, but the acting was done so well it was hard to not love them. Legolas is everyone's favorite in LOTR its easy to see why Jackson brought him back. Another thing that was very different from the novel, was the action that was played up. I usually get annoyed when there is too much action in a film. Its always obvious that the director is just trying to pump as much testosterone as he can into this film. However instead of dismissing it, I looked more into Jackson's job and what his conflict was with this film and the original story. When first written, The Hobbit was a children's story and Tolkien had no idea the three part series that would come after. Having seen the resulting picture, Jackson simply darkened the story and thickened the plot. When looking at his audience, Jackson couldn't create a kids story because after the epic adventure of Frodo, his audience is not children, but adults or teenagers expecting battle scenes and viscous monsters. One scene in particular sticks out in my mind. In the Mirkwood Forest, The dwarfs and Bilbo are attacked by giant spiders. There is this epic battle scene with the dwarfs and even Bilbo partakes as he fights a spider to the death repeatedly stabbing him until he knows he's dead. He becomes frantic at almost losing the ring and when he finally finds it, he looks at the creature he just kills and referring to this ring he says, ""Mine."" This scene although short is so powerful because it turns into this dark scene that foreshadows the power of this ring. I loved this scene a lot because although it is completely opposite to what plays out in the book, it provides as one of many examples of why Jackson is telling a different story. In the novel, when they encounter the giant spiders, Bilbo simply insults them and taunts them until they run away. Not exactly an epic battle nor does it foreshadow any future events simply because Tolkien didn't know of them yet.<br/><br/>The only legitimate complaint I have, is the love story between Tauriel and Kili. Throughout the LOTR trilogy, the love story between Aragorn and Arwen was played up drastically and captured the attention of many girls who would normally not have interest in a film. So naturally Jackson had to introduce some love interest and not only is it politically wrong for a dwarf and an elf to be together, but he also included a love triangle with Legolas involved. To me, its tasteless and doesn't add anything to the film. Tauriel would be just as fierce and beautiful without a strange flirtatious relationship with a dwarf. <br/><br/>All in all, I really had to revisit the original story and view TDOS several times before I came to the conclusion that both are amazing stories and when looking at them as separate entities, one can truly appreciate the greatness of Jackson's work."
"excavator","8","2","6","27 December 2013"," A well made movie
","I thought The Desolation of Smaug was a very well made movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't a literal adaption of the book, which I think is only normal. After all you can't compare reading a book to watching a movie. Reading a book 'only' requires to let your imagination run free to create the story, the characters, the scenery, ... in your mind. If you missed something or didn't get something right away, ... you just read back. A movie has the challenge of showing you the story and doing so in a convincing way.<br/><br/>In my opinion The Desolation of Smaug is a rather intelligent retelling of the story, with amazing quality of visuals (nature, sets, ...).<br/><br/>Sure the pace of the movie isn't all that high, and it makes one wonder if it was really necessary to make three parts. However, allowing the time to get to know the (many many) characters (especially if you didn't read the book), to let the magnitude of the scenery sink in, and to properly tell the story, I thought the slow pace was a plus and reason enough to forgive the sometimes lengthy passages."
"eng_mah050","8","2","6","26 December 2013"," Excellent
","This is a perfect movie, I loved Lord of the rings and watching this movie because of it. The story is very awesome and I found the first Hobbit movie tolerable but this one stinks.<br/><br/>There was also some really weird editing here too. The movie is already way too long and they still include absolutely pointless scenes. For example, when Gandalf is climbing the stairs by the mountain and the ledge gives up, the movie suddenly cuts to a sweeping shot of the mountain side. Why not just stay with Gandalf, it would provide more intensity. There's many examples like this. In Mirkwood when Bilbo is snapping at the spider web they shouldn't zoom deep into the web with the camera. Stuff like this tells nothing and adds nothing to the film. This also takes time away from the character development. When one of the dwarfs oversleeps and misses the boat to Erebor, I couldn't even remember who he was and why I should care that he was stranded in Laketown. Also, the most puzzling and distracting choice in the movie was using that weird POV camera footage in the barrel scenes, it looked so utterly different that it took me out of the movie completely."
"joey_lewis","6","2","6","21 December 2013"," Why?

To change it from one movie to the next is just plan stupid,like the rings movies people will want to watch these movies over and over and even if they didn't notice the first time through they will the next time.To those that think I'm blasting how Smaug looks,I'm not he looked amazing,I'm simply upset they didn't keep him a Dragon."
"c-kelsall","8","2","6","19 December 2013"," A rollocking roller-coaster of a ride full of sizzling gypsies
","Okay, I made up the bit about sizzling gypsies; pardon my obsession with Blackadder. Peter Jackson's second Hobbit film sets a more adult tone than its predecessor. Gone are the songs, and the comedy moments are rarer. The biggest laughs by far were provided by Bombur (watch out for his barrel moment!). In were multiple beheadings and fatal piercings, and a host of plot developments which deviated from the content of the book substantially. I wouldn't cite this as a flaw; as another reviewer pointed out, the nature of story-telling in cinema is often very different from literary sources, and the director's plot additions are mostly justified in setting the scene for events that are to transpire 60 years hence in Middle-Earth. While some story threads appear frivolous, they are generally done with enough charm that I didn't mind. There is one thing I couldn't quite accept; yes, there was some slightly ropey CGI along the way, but the story carried me along. That wasn't what bothered me. I realise it's a fantasy film, but the laws of physics were apparently laid aside in an extended dragon encounter - flesh would've been crisped, people would probably have been crushed etc. I was reminded of the bombastic and unedifying dinosaur chase scene in King Kong; I'd hoped that Peter Jackson wouldn't make any more errors like that. Putting ridiculous moments on screen is fine for comedic effect (see the aforementioned barrel chase), but when it's meant to be serious, it insults the viewer's intelligence. Now I've got that off my chest, I'll round off with all the things I loved about this film. Up to the dwarfs entering the Lonely Mountain, I would probably have given this film a 10. The dragon is FANTASTIC. The famous moments (barrel escape, spiders) were excellently done, I liked the pacing (I was given the impression it would be relentless, but thankfully there are some quieter moments that give a chance to breathe), I appreciated the Dol Goldur encounters and all related plot- strands that tie the story into the LOTR canon. So, if you didn't like the songs in Hobbit 1, and if you are desperate for more action, and don't mind the plot deviations, you'll probably love this film. If you're a Hobbit purist, you might want to take a pinch of salt in with you."

","To begin with, the greatest credit for this amazing film goes to Late J. R. R. Tolkien and his genius storytelling.<br/><br/>I am posting this review having just watched The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in a Cinemax situated in my neighborhood and was not disappointed one bit. I found the acting very genuine, relatable and believable unlike the last one; especially Martin Freeman was outstanding once again as Bilbo and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice effect as Smaug and the Necromancer was, partly, both scary and funny (I don't know why did I felt funny; maybe because of Sherlock). The Dwarfs fared much better than they did last time, especially, I felt as a viewer and a big movie enthusiast, Richard Armitage as Thorin and Aidan Turner as Kili were notably more mature in their acting and were more relatable on an emotional level (but still, I think, there is lots of room for improvement). The rest of them didn't get much dialogue and impact scenes, so it is hard for me to tell how they were. Other than them, I was so glad to see Legolas back again. Orlando did justice to the role and was very good in his scenes, the same way he was in LOTR. Evangeline Lilly was a breath of fresh air and looked stunningly beautiful as Tauriel. Another important character was the character of Bard played by Luke Evans; I am personally rooting for him. As so far, he is the only character with some substance, representing men in this series.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen was awesome as Gandalf, the Grey wizard, as always! (Do I really need to mention that?!) :)<br/><br/>When it comes to directing, I believe Peter Jackson (finally!) was just at his best here. The pace of the movie was just right this time and the scenes felt neither too fast nor too slow. The locations were just breathtaking and I was glued to its beauty, drooling with awe. The technology used in making the movie has to be one of the best because, it felt THE BEST, by far. This is the first time, I have seen such wizardry with 3D technology. While watching the movie back then, for a second, I almost forgot the Dragon cannot possibly harm me when I jittered in my seat, spilling all the popcorn I was having unto me, which fortunately no one seemed to notice. LOL. Phew!<br/><br/>Lastly, I will conclude by saying that, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug will surely be a big success (if it isn't already). I am giving it a 9/10 this time only for the sole reason that I am saving the perfect score for the third of this series. Hopefully, I won't be disappointed. Finger's Crossed till next Winter."
"Itoc","9","2","6","16 December 2013"," There And Triumph Again
","The Desolation of Smaug is THE Hobbit film I have been waiting for. The film is a love song to the fans of Tolkien's book, and The Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>Pretty much everything has been improved from An Unexpected Journey: pacing, characters, settings, humor, the soundtrack etc. P. J. has implemented and tweaked some of the middle section of Tolkien's book, but was worthwhile for the sake of pacing and variations, and gives the fans of Tolkien's universe some interesting new perspectives.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is a wonderful bridge-film to the last installment of the Hobbit trilogy, and some of the best sequels of any blockbuster franchises in a long time. Not everybody will be equally satisfied with the new tweaks and twists in terms of the source material, but I think it was for the greater good of the film.<br/><br/>For any fan- boys and girls, this film gave me that ""LOTR chills"" when I went out of the cinema."
"MrSee4","9","2","6","16 December 2013"," Great action packed adventure!
","Went to see the second installment of Jackson's trilogy and I must say that i was very pleased. The slow story of the first film is gone and from minute one there is action all the way through. Despite changes in the story compared to the book, I thought the changes really work well. <br/><br/>I would have liked the visit to Beorn's house to be prolonged, and I hope this is elaborated in the longer version, and the scenes at Lake Town seems to go by very fast. But in whole, the movie works better than the first one, much more is explained about the story and we get to know the characters better and doesn't feel hasted or rushed.<br/><br/>The best scenes, by far, is with the dragon and I really like the way they made him look and sound (great job by Mr. Cumberbatch)! The scenes of the dwarfs going down the river in the barrels are great as well and very action filled. This really looked good in 3D and 48 fps. I also think that the new acquaintance of Tauriel is handled with care and her role fits somehow in the context (say what you will about love between dwarfs and elves). Hope to see more of her and Beorn in the third movie.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to see what Jackson can conjure in the last film and how the story is gonna be handled. But this film is a really great work and i recommend everyone, with the smallest interest in Middle Earth or The Lord of the Rings , to go and see it! You wont be disappointed! <br/><br/>Even though the first movie is a bit slower than this one, I recommend seeing it first to understand the story and to know the characters.<br/><br/>See it!"
"setharoo14","8","2","6","15 December 2013"," The Desolation of Smaug (Was it Better?)
","While the movie was excellently made with graphics and CGI, it had its ups and downs. Smaug the Stupendous was amazing. They did better than any dragon made in ANY movie in history. Outstanding! And what better actor as the voice of him! Excellent! And the music to go with it was a great companion to the action and suspense. And, unlike many have said, the movie was not a drag of 2.5 hours of nothing. It was amazing. The spiders were new and original (not some copy from another movie). The fight scenes in Mirkwood were action-packed and exciting. I'm glad that they got Azog out of the picture for most of the movie and transitioned it to Bolg to give us something different. I got deadly tired of Azog in the first movie and just wanted someone new ---- Bolg! <br/><br/>With Dol Guldur, it was odd. When was Gandalf ever imprisoned by Sauron himself and a band of orcs? Seems like just a copy of the time when he was imprisoned by Saruman in Orthanc!!! Watch him escape by eagles again for the third time (get's old, doesn't it?). It does make sense that Sauron could overpower him, but why would Gandalf not get that it was Sauron who ruled in Dol Guldur. He knew that this Necromancer brought back the 9 Ringwraiths and if this Necromancer did, then only one could do it (as Gandalf said), so this makes it CLEAR that it is Sauron. And if it is CLEAR that it was Sauron, then Gandalf would have no reason to enter Dol Guldur alone. If only Radagast had gone with him (they might have survived). The idea that the orcs are chasing the dwarfs from the far West lands of Middle Earth all the way to Esgaroth (that is, Laketown) is odd. Why would they do that? They most certainly did not in the book. In the book, there was not such a hatred between Azog and Thorin. It wasn't so fierce as the movie portrays it. <br/><br/>I love how they added Legolas, but why is he CGI???? He had some amazing fight scenes in Mirkwood, but #1 he did not need to leave Mirkwood and #2 he did not need to be CGI. Tauriel, despite popular demand, was a disgust. I was fine at first with her being added, but this newfound love with Kili is disgusting. A dwarf and an elf would never fall in love -- no, not ever! Indeed their peoples do hate one another and Tolkien made it that way. They would kill each other with ease! And Legolas would never abandon his father. He is just like his father and he doesn't change until he joins the Fellowship. Gimli, in all honesty, changes his character. I agree that, at the time, Legolas would have been in the lands of Mirkwood when the dwarfs were coming by, but Tolkien had not thought of this character yet. He had Thranduil in mind, but not his son. But Legolas was a good addition (to a point). I enjoy how they did Lake-Town. Little is known about Lake-Town, but they made it well and designed it well. <br/><br/>What few may have noticed is that they added something new in Lake-Town (not something bad, but something new). Never in LOTR movie history has there been a person of color. Not that it is bad to have them, but it hasn't been done before. In Lake-Town, there were several of them. It was unique and interesting. A nice twist. The orcs, on the other hand, were outstanding. In the original trilogy, there were some odd orcs. Every orc was different, but these ones in the Hobbit looked more realistic. They actually looked scary and they did some good damage when they attacked the Elves and Dwarfs by the Woodland Realm. <br/><br/>The ending was great --- unexpected. I was thinking that Smaug would die in this movie, but clearly not. Out of all of Jackson's movies, this was the shortest by almost twenty minutes. You thought there were still thirty minutes left to see the end of Smaug, but then BOOM it ends. Really makes you want to come back, doesn't it? The first movie had a plain ending. They didn't even need to show the dragon's eye, but it was cool. But it was more of an expected ending, it wasn't an ""UNEXPECTED"" journey's end. But, as others have said, the name of the movie doesn't speak for itself. You never really saw the ""DEVASTATION"" of Smaug. You saw him shout and fly and breath a little fire, but you never got to see him in his true nature (when he attacks Lake-Town). But, overall, it was an amazing movie in comparison to the first. They dragged the first movie out too long. They could have made the first movie only an hour and a half (maybe) and then extend the second one to over three and a half hours. <br/><br/>They left too much open-ended things in the second movie. Gandalf is trapped, Radagast is off to see Galadriel, Smaug is off to destroy Lake-Town, Bard is trapped in a cell, Legolas is chasing Bolg, the orcs of Dol Guldur are marching to battle, the dwarfs are tired and have failed to kill Smaug, and that's a lot!!! Then the movie slams shut. The next movie is going to bring a lot of closure to the events of the second movie for sure. It better!!!"
"Larry41OnEbay-2","9","2","6","14 December 2013"," Wonderfully entertaining & cinematic, state of the art storytelling for the ages.
","I've watched over 8,000 movies and actually work at a film archive. I remember seeing some early Peter Jackson movies decades ago and thinking this guy is some kind of a genius. But then he faded away until the Lord Of The Rings gave him a platform that matched his larger than Hollywood abilities. But he has not stopped there, after tackling King Kong he's gone back to The Hobbit and poured not only his skills, and craft abilities but tons of money and talent into utilizing HFR (High Frame Rate)!<br/><br/>Now I have to be honest, I've never read the books and I'm glad fans of the books are mostly approving what he's done. But, speaking as a film history buff – I like the way he uses all the tools in his box to really entertain and amaze us and it works especially in HFR.<br/><br/>It takes plenty of bravado to ratchet up the frame rate to 48 frames per second and double the focus and depth of 3-D. Most folks don't begin to realize that the make-up, costumes, sets, cinematography, lighting also have to double in clarity or the details will smack of cheap phoniness and ruin the effect.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see where Peter Jackson and his army of film loving story tellers will take us next.<br/><br/>After watching this second chapter of The Hobbit the day after it premiered at an 11am showing with a packed audience I had to write this review. And mention I loved listening to the crowd laugh, cheer, gasp and finally groan when it all ended too soon. The scene with the fat dwarf bouncing in a barrel down along the riverside, bouncing and killing the enemy as he rolled along was hilarious!<br/><br/>Thanks again to Sir Peter Jackson & his New Zealand team!"
"achyutaghosh","9","2","6","14 December 2013"," Fan fiction done right
","""I am fire. I am death. I am king under the mountain!""<br/><br/>Says a gloriously resplendent Smaug in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Cunning, vain, greedy, vicious, and almost invincible, Smaug is brought to life wonderfully by Benedict Cumberbatch, giving personality to a CGI creation, and actually ending up upstaging an excellent movie in itself. Smaug was teased in the first movie, and is the boss in this feature. The face is bestial but so very expressive, the movements graceful yet powerful, and that magical voice- alternating between thundering and coy results in a masterful sequence to savor for the ages, and one that rivals Gollum's ""riddles in the dark"" scenes from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug picks up right where the first movie ended. The intrepid group of 13 dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield continue on their path to the lonely mountain to reclaim their lost kingdom. On the way stands the evil forest of Mirkwood, chasing them are bands of orcs and giant arachnids, and all the other species that they meet- humans, shape-shifters and elves, seem to have reservations about them. So in short, they keeping falling into the frying pan, or the fire. It has been established that Bilbo Baggins is a reluctant hero, but is a hero nonetheless. Time and again he uses Sting, and the ""one ring"" to save his friends. From a typically creative face off with giant spiders, to furious barrel chase escape on the river, to a water based city, to finally the fateful encounter with Smaug deep in a labyrinth, there is plenty of action right from the word go. The elves seem to make orc hunting a sport, and the dwarfs prove to be doughty customers themselves.<br/><br/>All the actors do a credible job, - Martin Freeman as the peace loving Bilbo grows in confidence and so does the effect of the ring on him, as he begins to secretly enjoy killing. Richard Armitage's Thorin carries himself with the pride that is afforded by royalty, Ian McKellan's Gandalf is as reliable as ever, and Evangeline Lilly's feisty Tauriel brings the much needed female presence in a story full of hairy men. There is plenty of humor inter-spaced throughout, the it is generally a happy movie as the orcs keep missing, and the dwarfs and elves keep hitting. <br/><br/>The master of cinematic detail, Peter Jackson, once again engulfs the audience in his version of Middle Earth- a rich vista of swathing natural beauty, and bewitching creatures, successfully making an epic out of a friendly family adventure. Even then, there is this much you can do if you want to make a trilogy from source material which is 300 pages, and like the first movie, some sections do feel bogged down. Hence Jackson takes creative liberties by bringing back one of the most charming characters in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy- Orlando Bloom's Legolas, and introducing a new character, the elf maiden Tauriel. Together they form quite a team, making mincemeat of orc hordes in eye popping style. In the book, Gandalf disappears for no reasons, but here again Jackson tries to link back to the LOTR movies by creating a back story of Gandalf's battle with the Necromancer/Sauron. But nothing quite prepares you for the moment when Smaug opens his eye.<br/><br/>""Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of your enormity, O Smaug, the stupendous""<br/><br/>It is an enthralling experience that ends on a cliffhanger as Bilbo's sincere attempts to charm Smaug fall flat. The fiery dragon now covered in gold flies off to lay waste whatever he sets his eyes on, pity though it is a one year wait to follow up on this amazing adventure. Recommended for all ages- 9/10"
"jeevan_97","8","2","6","14 December 2013"," Great Movie, not so Great visuals
","This film was almost 3 hours long and should have been longer... also should have been shorter, because we get to see some of the best Fighting scenes i have ever seen, and for me it was satisfying to watch because the last film gave this film permission to do so and i wanted to see more so the film should have been longer. i say this because the first film gave The desolation of smaug a perfect set up as the first Hobbit was at least 90% walking which means that in this film i was expecting more action, and i got what i wanted. The reason i think it was a bad thing to be expecting more from the film was because there was so much dialogue, and obviously i knew this would have happened but it took a way some of the impact and made the film longer than it should have been. <br/><br/>The acting in this film was superb because they all told a story on what their characters believe in, it was just fantastic and they all immersed me into the film. There are too many actors and actresses to congratulate. <br/><br/>I was not so lucky enough to see this film in 3D which for me and for many others was a terrible decision to make, because this kind of film is not made for 3D it is made for perfectly good 2D. what 3D did to the film was just make it blurry when the fight scenes came on, the film was also blurry in many other scenes. i recommend that anyone and everyone should watch this film but watch it in the perfect 2D screen (IMAX).<br/><br/>overall this film was great and satisfying, the film makes you want to watch the third and final one right after you have watched this film. i believe Peter Jackson has done himself well for making a very good movie."

I thought the movie was very entertaining, exciting and was once again filled with amazing settings. The adventure continues and once again it is one that should not be missed.

","I love the book. and I am not real convince of the opportunity of its adaptation. this film confirms that for me. because ""The Hobbit"" is admirable for special effects, for the effort of actors, for specular images but it remains expression of the ambition of director to give another ~Lord of Ring"", ignoring, in too many occasions, the difference between the serie and the book. sure, all is great, seductive and fascinating. but Smaug of Tolkien is more alive than the perfect monster of Peter Jackson. and, after the end of film, admiration and respect of viewer has as object the hard work more than artistic virtues."
"filipemanuelneto","5","1","2","20 December 2016"," Better than the first movie but far from ""Lord of the Rings"" level
","This film continues ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, which is a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"". However, after the hard failure of the first film, with obvious CGI exaggerations, miserably basic cinematography and several flaws concerning actors, it was hard to do worse with a millionaire budget. Thus, ""Desolation of Smaug"" is a general improvement without doing miracles. In this film, the company of Thorin Oakenshield finally reaches the lonely mountain, after some difficulties with the elves and a forced visit to Lake Town. However, increasingly powerful forces maneuver in the shadows and covet the gold of the dwarfs without them knowing.<br/><br/>I can not comment on how Peter Jackson and his team adapt the original material of J.R.R. Tolkien because I never read it. The actors were well. Ian McKellen plays Gandalf without much news to add. Martin Freeman continues to look like a solid Bilbo and plays his part without major flaws, as can be said of Richard Armitage (Thorin). This actor does an excellent performance, showing the gradual change of his character, more and more selfish and insensitive. Orlando Bloom returns to the role of Legolas, heir to the Elven throne, but it seems much more impersonal, mechanical and hard than it was in LOTR. Evangeline Lilly looks excellent as the sensitive Tauriel, just like Lee Pace, flawless in the role of King Thranduil, whom the misfortune of the dwarfs never moves. Smaug, the dragon, is not represented by any actor, its an artificial creation, but its an well thought-out character with a cruel personality, selfish and true hatred of the dwarfs. The action scenes are plentiful but continues to suffer with incompetent cinematography and a lamentable abuse of special effects that make everything artificial, pointless and devoid of emotions. The soundtrack, created by Howard Shore, is powerful, impactful and meets the expectations of the public.<br/><br/>""Smaug's Desolation"" is not necessarily bad, it's even better than the first film of the trilogy. But it still looks like a show-movie, full of background noise, impersonal, artificial and unable to reach the audience. The sense of danger, the emotion, all that made ""Lord of the Rings"" a successful trilogy, has disappeared and only comes at very precise scenes."

","Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the wizard and the band of dwarfs continue their quest to find a secret door to the Lonely Mountain and reclaim their gold. But Smaug the Dragon has no intention of giving up his glittering cache <br/><br/>The second movie in the Hobbit trilogy has the classic The Empire Strikes Back flaw - it doesn't have a beginning or an ending - but despite this, it is fantastic entertainment and arguably even better than its predecessor. It shares some of the first movie's problems, primarily that it's too long, but it is less excessive and feels much closer to the novel, both in narrative and atmosphere. Where it adds new characters, such as the elf warrior Tauriel and the returning Legolas (Bloom reprising his star turn from the Lord Of The Rings movies), for the most part they feel natural and add a richness to Bilbo's quest, although there is an unnecessary subplot to link this story back to the earlier film trilogy. As ever though, the realisation of these environments is simply irresistible, with gorgeous sets, paintings, props, design and music always a feast for the eyes and ears. The creepy, soul-sucking, spider-infested Mirkwood and the tired, ramshackle, built-on-stilts Laketown are highlights in a film filled with visual delights. The whole escape-in-the-barrels sequence - one of the best bits from the book - is brilliantly realised, with an eye-popping ten-minute action sequence as our heroes hurl down the rapids, confronted by perils on all sides; one of the best chase scenes I've seen for years. If I have one minor complaint though, it's in the characterisation of Smaug himself; visually he is wonderful, terrifying and humorous in equal measure, but his scenes drag on too long. In the book he is horror personified - the monster who can smell an invisible burglar a mile away - but in the movie he talks far too much and skitters dangerously close to becoming a buffoon, as for all his powers he constantly misses, fumbles and goes the wrong way. Like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, my personal view is that this film could be much more fun, action-packed and scarier with a little judicious pruning. This doesn't however detract from what is simply a fabulous adventure movie from beginning to end. Brilliantly photographed throughout by Andrew Lesnie, who sadly passed away recently, and along with fellow Australian Dean Semler created many of the most memorable images of Antipodean cinema. Followed in 2014 by the concluding part of the trilogy, The Battle Of The Five Armies."
"SimonFrederick","7","1","2","8 April 2015"," A true 7
","Once again met with a good not great film. I enjoyed it, it looked nice, it had good action and nice enough characters. But it doesn't come close to the epic adventure of LOTR, which might just be a testament to the books rather than the films. I liken these to the Pirates of the Caribbean series; a family friendly adventure with lots of scenes of just playing around with the characters in light hearted action (I immediately thought of the giant wheel rolling scene in the second pirates film when all the dwarfs were going down the river in the barrels). I enjoyed having more lines and involvement from the individual dwarfs, though I do still think there should be more. Each dwarf has his own personality which I don't think gets enough attention for me. I understand there is only so much they can do as there is a hell of a lot of characters, but maybe take out the Legolas pining over Kate from Lost element and add in some dwarf time. I also felt Bilbo took a backseat through the first 2 3rds of the film, which is obviously because it's a continuing story through 1 book, but it doesn't come across well in film I found."

","The journey continues with Bilbo (Freeman), Gandalf (McKellen) and the dwarf company reaching the Lonely Mountain to take back what is rightfully theirs from the dragon Smaug (Cumberbatch). Legolas (Bloom) is delightfully written into the story, but doesn't really help move it forward; while Bard (Evans) and his home of Esgaroth bring a freshness to Middle-Earth, but the over-development of the subplot steers things way too far off course. Too pretentious and dark—it's as if Peter Jackson took all the fine things in the book and injected it with steroids, draining any sort of hype for the last minute third installment. A cameo of Peter Jackson's two pugs (one fawn, one black) is probably the best thing about this film.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

","Another really excellent instalment from the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit franchise. They've got the formula right and they just keep on churning out movies that I love.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug has a number of sequences that really stand out. The capture of the dwarfs by the wood elves and their subsequent escape in barrels down the river is glorious - a relatively minor event in the book but here a long sequence packed full of quirky action scenes and fast-paced special effect fun.<br/><br/>The other excellent sequence is the scenes in Smaug's lair. The dragon is brought to life brilliantly and the cave full of treasure is absolutely immense. It all makes for great viewing.<br/><br/>The performances from the likes of Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen and Richard Armitage were spot on. I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Desolation of Smaug."

IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND WANT TO, STOP READING NOW.<br/><br/>*******************************************************************<br/><br/>The Good: Clint Eastwood. No, that's not it. What was it? Oh yes, another feast for the senses, everything visually spot on. Elvish mixed hand-to-hand and ranged combat was delightful if slightly belief-straining, and Orlando's snowboarding skills were actually tolerable, perhaps even... dare I say it? *cool* this time around.<br/><br/>Bard has been transformed from a mysterious, strong, silent type hero into an intensely likable, quietly desperate Robin Hood-type smuggler who hides the secret to killing the dragon. Luke Evans is a pleasant surprise in a sure breakout role. Lorewise, Bard becomes King of Dale. Which could indicate he inspired Aragorn's back story when Tolkien wrote him into LoTR at Bree and had no idea who he was.<br/><br/>The Bad: Lee Van Cleef? No... Angel Eyes? No, not him either... Something about an eye... Oh yes, the eye of Sauron, nay, *Sauron himself* shows up to hand Gandalf his arse and clap him in irons! Of course, Sauron's been behind the rise of Orc activity all along, how could he not? Uh... No.<br/><br/>Sigh... What to say about this version of Beorn. Meeting Beorn was supposed to be another of Gandalf's master classes in diplomacy; once the niceties of introductions are over and decorum satisfied, his house becomes a haven where Bilbo actually feels safe. Beorn, like most bears, can be grumpy if not approached with care, but is cheery enough once he warms to you. In the morning when you rise, he speaks with tears of joy in his eyes of the goblins he hunted last night. Instead we get a couple of minutes of a freaky ex-slave who's supposed to be the last of his kind and only grudgingly helps the dwarfs because he hates their common enemy.<br/><br/>So what content replaces that, which is nowhere in the book? The amazingly extended interview with the titular dragon and the ensuing climactic chase under the mountain. More rumblings of a coming war, Kili's romance with a freshly-invented Elf who brings him back from death's door with Athelas. Amazing how she did it -- complete with magical Elf glow -- when, glow as she might, Arwen failed with Frodo; it took Elrond to save him. Maybe Morgul shafts aren't as lethal as Morgul blades. Oh, I know! It's because Kili is Mitchell the vampire from Being Human, eerily even younger-looking now than in that show. Well, if this brush with death plucked at heartstrings, what happens at the end of movie three will just be brutal. Or not, if they blow off the book for that part, too.<br/><br/>More hostile encounters between Dwarfs and Elves. The book contrasts Elrond, who sees the big picture of events taking place in Middle-Earth and gives the Dwarfs a festive welcome, with insular Thranduil, who is suspicious of all intruders and imprisons the Dwarfs indefinitely for not being open with him. These movies show both Elf Lords holding Dwarfs beneath contempt and only softens that with an apocryphal love story.<br/><br/>The Ugly: It's okay Tuco, you can go; this'll take a while. Orcs everywhere. Azog reporting directly to Sauron, summoned by Bolg, who seems here to be another lieutenant instead of Azog's son. Again, Azog is supposed to have died years before Bilbo meets Thorin and Co. Sauron must be behind him still being around, too! And, as Azog boasts, they are legion; so... Orcs in Dol Guldur, Orcs swarming the Wood Elves, Orcs in Esgaroth -- hey, Elves in Esgaroth too! Pew! Pew! Watch out Bolg, Legolas is tunnelling you like a boss. And Stephen Ure, amazing actor, but I can pick him out from among hordes of Orcs now.<br/><br/>And now... Smaug, or as he appears in this movie, *Deathwing the Destroyer 2.0.* Because, since World of Warcraft liberally plagiarized Howard Shore's Fellowship of the Ring Score, Smaug can use Deathwing's signature glowing molten belly, right? Speaking of bellies, wasn't Smaug's belly supposed to be encrusted with gems and jewelry from having plunked it down on his hoard for so many years? Yes, actually. That was what made him arrow-proof to begin with. And at first blush, his belly did appear to be somewhat glittery-golden... but that was just a trick of the light. His belly is bare and pasty but smolders and glows just like Deathwing's when he takes... wait for it... *Deep Breaths.* Those of us familiar with the story might wonder, ""What, in the absence of a gem corset, is the chink in Smaug's scaly armour?"" In the movie, it's the space left by a scale knocked off by a ""Black Arrow"". And what's that? Well, it's a giant, stubby, straightened iron fishhook, fired from a Dwarf-engineered, tower-mounted ballista. Uh huh. And to think the book has him dropped, felled, yea, *slain* with a single ordinary arrow. OKAY, SO IT WAS, ACTUALLY, BLACK. But still, a regular arrow shot from a hand-held bow at ground level. Town level. Water platform thingy. Whatever.<br/><br/>Finally, on a darker note (uh... well, not darker than a Black Arrow actually), that scene at the beginning looked suspiciously like _The Quest of Erebor._ Which could open up a whole 'nother can of worms."
"Movieman4950","6","1","2","31 January 2014"," A Bit Overboard....
","Alright, I'll admit it: this movie wasn't the best. I'd just went to the movies to see 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug', after liking 'The Lord Of The Rings', and 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'. But this one wasn't so impressive. <br/><br/>The first fatal flaw was the camera. In the 'Barrels' scene, the camera which is showing what Bilbo is seeing, looks like it was filmed a video camera, just like the one I have in my cupboard right now. <br/><br/>The second flaw was the cast. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is top billed, yet was only in the movie for 20 minutes. Then, there was Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Bilbo needed more lines, seeing as the story was about him, not some stupid dwarf called Thorin.<br/><br/>Yet, the movie got a few stars higher in my book because of Smaug. The voice was fantastic for a massive dragon. It would have been hard to suit the personality.<br/><br/>So if you like OK sequels to movies like 'Jaws 2' (1978), and 'Jaws: The Revenge' (1987), then I recommend this movie to YOU!!!"
"queeq","7","1","2","5 January 2014"," Repetition - repetition
","Although I enjoyed Desolation a lot more than An Unexpected Journey (which was long winded, boring at times, stretched like butter scraped over too much bread) due to its better pacing, speed and a bit more relevant action, I was also disappointed. And especially because of The Hobbit kinda ruining LOTR by repeating stuff from LOTR (this making the LOTR scenes chronologically the repetitions).<br/><br/>It seems to me Jackson, Walsh and Boyens seem to suffer from the same affliction George Lucas suffered from while making the Star Wars prequels. He too repeated a lot of elements and scenes from the OT . Lucas called this ""poetry"" but in my mind poetry is a bit more than just repeating identical moments. Plus the problem is that by repeating scenes or elements in the PREQUELS you turn the original SEQUELS into copycats when watching them in chronological order. Also, by trying to top the existing sequels, Lucas kinda destroyed OT characters and events. He turned the OT Darth Vader into a whiny psycho with prosthetics (while he was once the greatest movie villain of all time), he made Leia's memory of her mother totally nonsensical and he made the Stormtroopers look like a bunch of whimps compared to the Clone Troopers.<br/><br/>I see the same happening in Desolation, the same need to repeat from the sequel and the same lack of ideas (?) in trying to top LOTR. <br/><br/>One element is Legolas. Now, the idea of a short cameo by Legolas as Thranduil's son would have been enough by far. But in this movie he is shown as a super athletic jumping surfing orc slaying Elf in a way we never saw him in LOTR. A) we've already seen him like that. so why add him? B) By adding these scenes, what new things do we learn about Legolas in LOTR nothing except for the fact that we never see him do such incredible and rather ridiculous stunts as he does in Desolation. It seems the LOTR Legolas is the lesser to the Desolation Legolas. Why diminish such a well loved character from LOTR?<br/><br/>Another is Tauriel. I applaud Jackson's, Walsh's and Boyens' desire to add a major female character. But why do we get a near copy of LOTR's Arwen???? She does just about the same things: she saves a non-Elf from an attack with a dark weapon (Arwen saves Frodo after being cut down by a Morgul blade, Tauriel saves a dwarf hit by an orc arrow, both containing the same kind of poison obviously). Tauriel also sends out someone to get King's Foil, just like Arwen did in LOTR. And Tauriel falls in love with a non-Elf, just like Arwen did with Aragorn Now, why such a lame copy of Arwen? Have they run out of ideas? And the consequence is the same: Arwen's story becomes the copy of Tauriel's. Both stories were made up by the script trio but it seems like they can imagine only one female storyline. Kinda sad. <br/><br/>A third, perhaps more disturbing story element that kinda ruins a major element from LOTR are Azog, his son and all these huge orcs that seems endless in number. They are much bigger than the average hordes of orcs we saw in LOTR. PLUS the move about in daylight. Didn't Saruman genetically engineer super orcs, called Uruk Hai, so they would be more powerful and could travel in daylight? But now I wonder: why??? These orcs already exist. Saruman is doing something absolutely obsolete.<br/><br/>Personally I also don't like the whole Sauron storyline. There's a lot of talk in both movies about 'a darkness' that moves in the shadows But why do we need that? And so extensively. If the story is about a Hobbit, let it be more ABOUT the Hobbit. But very often it seems to be about the rise of Sauron. That weird appearance scene in Dol Guldur where we see Sauron's silhouette appearing a number of times in the flames, also does away with the mystery of the Eye in LOTR There's no surprise here, again, it kinda ruins the LOTR Sauron a bit.<br/><br/>By trying to top or equal LOTR with female characters and more (even more ridiculous) action scenes, this trilogy is well on its way to become the Star Wars PT. I did like the excellent scenes with Gollem and Smaug, they kinda save these movies. But a bit more character (like in the Beorns scene which seems absolutely obsolete to me) would certainly have made these movies better. ""Less is more"" would have been great for these films, as well as respect for the sequel the filmmakers made themselves. Respect by not endlessly referring to your own sequel, respect by not undoing great things from your own sequels, and respect by coming up with new ideas instead of repeating yourself.<br/><br/>Poetry is good, foreshadowing is good, but neither of them is attained by mere repetition."
"gedhurst","7","1","2","3 January 2014"," Hideous goblins fight nice, handsome elves
","Throughout what seemed like an endless sequence of attacks by giant spiders, chases by hideous goblins riding monstrous wolves, Jason-Bourne-type choreographed fights between nice, handsome elves and hideous goblins, and hideous goblins being dispatched in a variety of imaginative ways by nice, handsome elves, I was wondering, how will Jackson handle the Thrush at the secret entrance to the Lonely Mountain? In the end we saw about 5 seconds of the Thrush (maybe real animals are more difficult to render than imaginary monsters) and the chance to offer the audience something enchanted, understated and mysterious was missed.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too demanding - if you want magic, read the book, just don't expect it from modern films.<br/><br/>In truth, the film isn't bad and heaven knows we're lucky to have in Mr Jackson a writer/director/producer who is thoroughly acquainted with the source material. The magical kingdoms are breathtakingly imagined; Smaug is magnificently malevolent; Lake-town is grittily realistic. The Necromancer is suitably thrilling and adds welcome detail to events only vaguely alluded to in the book.<br/><br/>Despite some liberties with the plot to introduce unnecessary romantic interludes and to ensure consistency with the earlier filmed versions of Lord of the Rings, the actors are largely sympathetic and the film more exciting and better-paced than the first instalment.<br/><br/>Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a children's fairy tale, so I think he would be surprised to see his gentle story transformed into a sequence of CGI battles. Somehow though, I don't think that he'll be spinning in his grave. He probably will, however, be wearing a rueful smile..."
"darth-tobe","5","1","2","30 December 2013"," Good but could have been so much more
","I will start with the positive. The visuals are stunning. If you can do catch it in 3D - it is really worth the money. There will not be things coming at you out of the screen but scenes have a depth and clarity that I haven't seen in other films. This is probably also due to the high frame rate. Costumes and sets are beautiful. It is easy to spot John Howe's and Alan Lee's creative hand in the design and Weta Workshop reliably delivered. Smaug is literally a ""magnificent"" digital character and Benedict Cumberbatch's voice performance gave me goosebumps. In general I think the cast was once again very appropriately chosen. Lee Pace as Thranduil was another highlight for me. These are the reasons why the movie still gets a 7 rating.<br/><br/>However, I find that this is the second time that Peter Jackson has delivered a really memorable first episode to a trilogy but then didn't follow through. This movie could still be so much better than 7. The screenwriters didn't add as much as it may seem. A lot of the stuff Gandalf is shown doing does occur in Tolkien's writing - just not in The Hobbit. Furthermore, the segment of the story Jackson has chosen for Desolation of Smaug ends right before the first climax of the book, so they had to add some sort of epic ending to this episode. Maybe that choice of partitioning the story was the first mistake. There was a lot to cover but they didn't want to make the audience go without a dragon for another episode. At the same time there had to be enough story left for part 3. That makes a few things a bit awkward. I found that the first hour or so felt very rushed: Beorn - check, forest - check, spiders - check, elves - check. Then the movie dwells on an impossible love story that is, worse still, just a recycled plot and scenes from Lord of the Rings. Laketown and Bard, I felt, were then overly complicated. Bard now leads a revolution of one against a government of two, just to add some more conflict. In general I felt that the movie introduced way too much conflict into the plot. Even epic fantasy does not need to be packed full of hack-and-slash action at every possible minute. Finally comes a huge, all-new (see above), slightly bloated and quite implausible climax before the actual climax in part 3. Could a dozen dwarfs, assisted by a hobbit, take on a dragon when a whole army of their forefathers failed? They try and fail, of course, but survive only because of some of the most impossibly lucky circumstances ever. Like the dragon flying right over them and not seeing them!<br/><br/>You could say these are all details (I've even omitted the minor ones) and there's nothing wrong with the plot as a whole. Still, these details add up. They left a slightly bitter taste after leaving the cinema. I don't see a need for every new episode to be a superlative over the previous one. Jackson has shown he can tell a story well. I wish he had focused on that more. There are too many what-were-they-thinking moments. So far Desolation is the weakest of his Tolkien adaptations."
"MoviesAreLife93","6","1","2","30 December 2013"," Too many flaws to ignore
","This installation is an obvious step down from the previous films. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, but considering that Peter Jackson is capable of creating three incredible masterpieces such as The Lord of the Rings, this film is disappointing on multiple levels. <br/><br/>First and foremost, this film does not display the masterful storytelling, directing, character development, and visuals as was abundant in LotR.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are far too silly to be exciting. Believable battle scenes were sacrificed for the sake of CGI characters performing ridiculous acrobatics and stunts: Elves and Orcs climbing, swinging, and jumping from trees while shooting arrows at absurd speeds and angles; Dwarfs rolling downhill in a barrel, effortlessly killing dozens of Orcs at once; Dwarfs surviving an extremely turbulent river while being ruthlessly attacked by countless enemies. These scenes feature unnecessary effects and are immature.<br/><br/>The length is not necessarily a problem, however, this movie could have easily been 20 minutes shorter. The film doesn't display the essence of the quest, which was superbly done in The Lord of the Rings. Instead, it wastes far too much time pathetically forcing a romance between one of the dwarfs and an elf, who are both very underdeveloped characters, giving the audience very little reason to care for their part of the story. The first 30 minutes of the film were done well, and the final hour was decent, but the middle was forced, and its contribution to the main story line was mediocre. <br/><br/>That being said, the scenes with Smaug were satisfying, but Peter Jackson should have used more of his time building up the audience's anticipation for Bilbo and the Dwarfs to reach the Lonely Mountain rather than adding unnecessary scenes. This movie is enjoyable, but Peter Jackson is capable of so much better - this movie did not have the power I was hoping for - the power that made Lord of the Rings so beautiful."
"mac-hawk","7","1","2","29 December 2013"," Two films in one
","A filmed to be looked upon in two ways, either a disaster or a worthwhile attempt.<br/><br/>As a second installment of 'The Hobbit' it's an unmitigated disaster. Even more so than Pt 1 'An unexpected journey' it deviates, omits, twists, changes and even adds to the narrative of the book so much as to make it barely recognisable from the original text.<br/><br/>I'm not going into detail here as this could run to a 3,000 word draft but if you're expecting a version of the children's book full of its quirky characters, sections of humour, general sense of danger that's not too dark or threatening.....well forget it. You won't see that here.<br/><br/>However, as the second prequel to the Lord of The Rings film trilogy it works fine. Full of dark brooding danger, lots of loud music, incessant Orc killing (some of which is veering on pantomime though), loads of scenes referencing to events which will be revealed in the LOTR films, and if you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll probably enjoy it.<br/><br/>Either way, the final section with Bilbo & Smaug just about works, but the film condenses their conversations to a single visit. In the context of the film this is a bit overlong, but it additionally preludes another far too long, and unnecessary section where the dwarfs (without wishing to add a spoiler) run about a lot and the special effects team go bonkers.<br/><br/>Viewed the film at the cinema in a party of six (5 had read the book). 4 thought it was really good - the one who hadn't read the book can't wait for The Hobbit 3 to be released - 1 thought the dragon sequence far too long (like myself) and I, well the review above."

","The movie was fun for me, who never read ""The Hobbit"" by Tolkien. I liked it more, than the first hobbit-movie.<br/><br/>Even if I enjoyed the movie, still many of the critics are true:<br/><br/>1. It's a constant action ride, probably focusing on future computer game franchises.<br/><br/>2. There is no real character or story development. Characters have almost nothing to do or say in the movie. I like Dean O'Gorman since ""The almighty Johnsons"", and I always wondered, when he will do or say something, but except a few lines his role was not more, than an extra's, when he finally appeared.<br/><br/>3. There are many illogical turns and actions in the story. Maybe caused by deleted scenes...<br/><br/>4. The motivation of the characters are sometimes hard to recognize.<br/><br/>5. Like Spielberg, also Jackson can't decide where to end a movie. The last scene is obviously too long, confusing and hard to follow.<br/><br/>In 3D I always had the feeling, that I am watching a MMORPG game. I am now very motivated to log in to the Free To Play ""LOTR Online"" MMORPG by Turbine."
"jgrents","8","1","2","23 December 2013"," Desolation of Smaug - Mixed feelings for mixed fans.
","First, lets start off by saying that I view this movie as an improvement of the last one. And even though they were quite different, some things were similar to the first one, especially Smaug heightening the movie to a new level, much of what Gollum did in the first one. Desolation of the Smaug is an action packed movie, which offers much for those who seek impressive CGI packed with extensive combat scenes, and the movie continues to extend the tradition of keeping people alive in unrealistic occurrences. <br/><br/>In comparison with 2D, 3D and 3D HFR, this movie is made to be watched in 3D HFR and certainly feels that way – 2D lacks that certain something and simple 3D makes certain scenes... clunky... and certainly weaker than they actually are to be seen in 3D HFR. HFR is the future, if not now then in years time it will start to take ground. Hobbit was the one to give it a go and get some slack for it, but first comers always do. I am sure that HFR's time is to come and I enjoyed the movie best in 3D HFR in comparison to 2D and 3D. <br/><br/>There are flaws with this movie, especially for hard-core Tolkien fans, who would like to see the book repeated and heightened by the new storyline and characters rather than somewhat abolished by ridiculously high amount of combat scenes. Jackson has indeed gone too far with the plot deviations from Tolkien's original piece(s) but we all know that the purpose of this is to provide 3 movies and you can't really make 3 movies out of ""the Hobbit"" without adding stuff to it. And Jackson and team decided to provide some more middle-Earth and its modified history to the viewers and compiled together a storyline that's not entirely Tolkienish.<br/><br/>Desolation of the Smaug provides however and excellent roller-coaster ride in comparison with the first film. The first film was a bit of a disappointment, hence at first impressions it was easier to improve with this one. And improve they did. What made it more of a better deal was perhaps the fact the new sub-stories were to be told and could entwined into an entity which elevated the tensions higher than they actually were. <br/><br/>Truth be told: Smaug was pretty much the only reason I went to see the movie and I was not disappointed, not one bit. Scenes with Smaug are truly excellent with spot on acting from both Freeman and the CGI that's voiced by Sherlock. Smaug definitely highs-up the ranking of the movie, and perhaps even more than Gollum did in the first one. The movie ended on a cliffhanger and Smaug's last sentence was a perfect one to describe the movie as a whole: I am Fire! I am........ DEATHH.""<br/><br/>PS! Since I can't give 7 and a half, I round my rating up to 8."
"ynotvt","4","1","2","23 December 2013"," Preview for a Video Game?
","It's hard to criticize a classic that fans are ready to love when it comes to the screen. So, I approached reviewing this film with caution until I actually saw it; I am not reviewing a film that is faithful to the book.<br/><br/>Beautiful scenery and effects abound from start to finish. Acting had outstanding moments. McKellen and Freeman were credible and incredible in monologue, dialogue, or among a crowd. Ken Stott stole scenes and Lilly played well in contrast to any elf-in-charge. Nevertheless, it was hard to overlay the book onto many film scenes. Gone were poignant moments of literary worth, such as irony, copious comic relief, or lines meant to have readers think and reflect before moving on. Dwarfs became humorous ""barrelriders,"" but only as ""fish-in-a-barrel"" to a trained army that could not hit ""the broad side of a barn"" (how I love to mix metaphors!).<br/><br/>Instead, this viewer found that much of the story line could have been produced by a child on a video game instead of an accomplished author. Violence was gratuitous and it was predictable who was going to survive battles and who would be slaughtered. Without being a spoiler, only one major character is wounded and merely to set up a moment of miraculous healing by another character and scene that I cannot remember came from the novel directly.<br/><br/>This site denotes that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is PG-13. From what I saw with my preteen not present, I would suggest changing that rating to ""M"" to be consistent with video-game ratings. After all, I spent a considerable portion of the 161 minutes wondering whether the movie was created with or for the xBox One or PS4. Otherwise, I can envision the film preparing the world for a Hobbit line of video games to come in time for Christmas 2014."
"vicarious_tool","9","1","2","19 December 2013"," Well made movie.
","Unlike its predecessor the focus here wasn't slow emotional storytelling but rather a string of roller coaster action sequences. The right dialogues were adopted from the book, some nice quips were left out but they made up for that with the amazing and creative action sequences. <br/><br/>There's elves killing goblins more gracefully than you could imagine, hobbits in barrels and even Gandalf battling pure darkness head on. There is so much more that can be done in a movie based on imagination as rich as Tolkien's and they used the scenarios at hand to seam in some awesome moments. Of course as a trade off the emotional parts seemed a bit rushed sometimes. <br/><br/>IN terms of performances, Martin freeman was the perfect Bilbo in this one and Cumberbatch's voice as Smaug was a great choice. The soundtrack was very similar to the earlier ones and the effects were better than ever. I was very impressed and satisfied and I saw it on a regular screen so I suggest you go for a full on IMAX 3D version at the best theater in town."

I was at the midnight premiere in Stockholm and had huge expectations since that i trust in Peter Jacksons vision av Tolkiens texts. However i have to add i don't always agree with him as in this movie i think its absolutely brilliant. Im not going to point out everything but actors as Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield) and Martin Freeman(Bilbo) are just the way i imagined characters in the book which is much appreciated. There is lots of humor, not to obvious like in most American movies and i do love it when its discrete. Im not going to point out everything that's brilliant because it's going to take forever, however there was something i didn't quite agree with PJ on. I don't like the way Tauriel is put forward like a lead character. The reason is of course., that she's not in the books not in LOTR, not in The Silmarillion. And Legolas having feelings for her is bothering me as well. Especially if it ends up with their love story taking over the third film."
"tinovalkki","5","3","12","14 December 2013"," Wet daydream to Tolkien/ Jackson fans but...
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug looks beautiful and sounds brilliant, but somehow at the same time it feels so empty. Movie starts to repeat itself. There is nothing new to tell. Same old orc slaughtering and digital effect rumble that we have seen from the beginning of Lord of the Rings. How long that really can satisfy you really? Dividing a short novel to three almost three hour movies starts to feel capitalizing the audience. You also may wanted to see a movie which is more loyal to a book. Now there are characters that won't even be in original story and many crucial parts of the book are diluted. Smaug has achieved very impressive way, but the chase in dwarf's dungeons is way too long to watch. I am sure that many fans of the series will be insulted to me, when I say that this movie is nothing more than mediocre fantasy adventure. 3D feels frustrating because of using so much of studio sets. HFR makes the picture looks very sharp but at the same time set design start to look too unrealistic. Details are well done on sets, nut that doesn't help that it looks just a studio framing. It might be a good thing if Guillermo Del Toro has directed this as it was originally planned. Maybe this movie is a wet daydream to many Tolkien/ Jackson fans, but I am starting to get be bored. Sorry to say that."

Although, there are a few things I would have changed, such as the Kili/Tauriel story. At first I didn't really like it, but after a while I just accepted it. I would also have left out the chase scene at the end. And Legolas. He should have been less of a main character, and just appearing whenever the Elven King appears.

"VictoriaTeh","10","2","7","7 January 2014"," Smaug is HOT
","Benedict Cumberbatch and the WETA team did a truly AMAZING job on Smaug, the titular ""sexy porn star"" dragon. <br/><br/>This beautiful mythical creature is brought to life, with seamless motions and voice. Smaug is an aesthetically pleasing spectacle of burgeoning heat and primal, organic movement. The voice that has been touted as a ""jaguar in a cello"" has been unleashed with bite and fire. <br/><br/>It is definitely worth seeing this in IMAX 3D HFR. When Smaug raised his head, I reflexively reached out to pat him, it felt so real!<br/><br/>It is fascinating to see so much of the actor imbued into the creature. The long fingers in the talons, the biceps and sharp angle of the elbow in the wings, even the cheek bones and bushy eyebrows in the face! It was a brilliant idea to use the motion capture as well as the voice. The directors vision of the fire building in the belly of the beast was also brilliant, adding just the right finishing torch...ahem...touch. ;)<br/><br/>It is no wonder that Peter Jackson carefully saves this for the grand finale of this film. Which is not to say, the rest of the film doesn't have it's charm and merit. <br/><br/>The beginning leaps right into where the last one ended, picking up the storyline immediately and quickly bringing the audience up to speed, be it to refresh the memory or to invite new viewers. You know upfront, that Gandalf (Ian Mckellen), is rounding up the dwarfs and the hobbit, to go claim back the dwarven homeland. <br/><br/>The Hobbit, Bilbo (Martin Freeman), is as endearing and funny as ever. Tickling the audience with his antics and mannerisms, with flawless comedic timing through out the film. It is especially impressively flawless timing when he does finally encounter Smaug, because during the making of the film, they were never in the same room. However, you never get a sense of the flow of conversation between them breaking. In fact quite the contrary, you feel the a natural rhythm and chemistry between them as if Smaug is looming over Bilbo, and Bilbo is shivering in his foot fur at Smaug's feet!<br/><br/>Although purists may frown on the inclusion of the elven folk Tauriel (Evengeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), (as they are not present in this book) I found their involvement in the plot to be interesting and supportive of the overall story arc. <br/><br/>It has been said Tauriel was written in, ""to balance out the wang"" in the film. It is pretty clear that there would have been a lack of female presence without her. I think, including her was a very good choice, and naturally provided the ensuing romantic storyline, that was quite beautifully unfurled. I also like that her story just hinted about the morals of the strong protecting the weak, but didn't get preachy at all.<br/><br/>The action sequences do go a bit over the top and get a bit ridiculous with the somersaults and spinning weapons, but it does invite you to laugh about it and get lost in the fantasy of it, after-all it is a fantasy movie. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm planning on seeing it in the cinema for a third time. (I usually do not see a movie more than once in the cinemas, but this one is so epically large, in so many ways, it is worth experiencing it on the big screen.) <br/><br/>As I mentioned at the beginning, I highly recommend seeing it on the IMAX big screen and in 3D, as this is conducive to the immersion of this rich fantasy world. However, the second time I watched it in 2D and it was still very entertaining, particularly when the BIG FIERY DRAGON BLAZES ONTO THE SCREEN. *FOOOOM!!!*<br/><br/>I really feel this is one of those movies that ""if have to see only one this season"" this is that movie. I hope you will see it, and enjoy it as much as I do."

","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013), directed by Peter Jackson, is the middle film of the three part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's novel ""The Hobbit"", first published in 1937. Surprisingly, it manages to avoid most problems associated with a second film of three, such as a sense of redundancy, maintaining interest throughout and actually surpassing ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (2012), the first part in the series. The prolonged introductions and establishment of the major plot line of the first film, while embraced by some, where criticised by others. Here, with the clarity of a straightforward aim for the multiple characters, there is a new sense of direction and lucidity in Jackson's storytelling. Jackson's aided by the script written by himself, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>While the acting throughout is never less than fine, and Martin Freeman continues to impress as Bilbo, the true star is Middle Earth, a world that Jackson has managed to transform into a living, breathing environment that thanks to the wonders of modern special effects, never looks less than real. From the dark Mirkwood forest to the seemingly 15th century Northern European inspired architecture of Lake-town, this is an incredibly rich and diverse setting for any tale that like all the great fantasy films, transports you into another world, another time, helped in part by the high frame rate 3D. The production design, by Dan Hennah, and the costume design, by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey and Richard Taylor, is extraordinary in realising and texturing Jackson's world (which is filmed on location in New Zealand).<br/><br/>The screenplay however, isn't quite as perfect as one would wish, superior though it is to the first film, continuing the introduction of elements not present in the novel. A divisive move that does tend to reinforce more conventional action elements along with an underplayed romantic triangle concerning Orlando Bloom (reprising his role as Legolas from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy [2001 – 2003]), Evangeline Lily (as the Wood Elf Tauriel) and Aidan Turner (as Kili the dwarf). This perhaps reveals a lack of confidence in the source material stretching across three films.<br/><br/>These doubts don't dispel Jackson's major directorial achievement on display here and it is his grasp of Middle Earth, taking it from J.R.R. Tolkein's imagination to the silver screen that leaves this one of the best films of 2013."

","This film is marginally an improvement over the first because now we're building to something, the dragon is a bit further down the path across the lake, the necromancer. It's still padded but we make that contact, have the encounter so we don't feel like we completely wasted our time and money.<br/><br/>The same deep-seated flaws persist on this path. We don't actually inhabit a world, only the semblance of one. The resemblance to a world or history only there because the external mythology and heroic posturing has been amplified in place of narrative depth. But it has no consequence.<br/><br/>When the dwarf leader near the end gives a rousing speech in Laketown about how they're going to take back the old kingdom under the mountain and how riches will flow and a crowd cheers him on as liberator; I can choose to ignore the emptiness of its epic sentiment, its lack of world, at the consequence of numbing that part of me that expects to grapple with a fuller sense of things. It's what we all do when we 'turn our brain off' with a film like this.. We numb.<br/><br/>We're left with one rousing spectacle after another and here's where the lack of world appears in a different light, more interesting because it's tied directly to the cinematic eye which is the most fundamental question in film.<br/><br/>There's a cinematic evolution afoot bringing us a step closer to immersion. It's currently spearheaded by Malick's philosophy of the eye, and 3D and computer landscaping in the nuts and bolts. Twenty years down the road I expect the first full integration of the two in films other than demo reels of destruction, serious films that take their place in the space leading up to the eye.<br/><br/>Cuaron, Del Toro, Lee, even Snyder try to be a part of this advance. Nolan is tweaking with mechanics of narrative, a different sort of advance. Jackson, like Tarantino and Burton, isn't bothered to be a part of it. He was a toymaker when he started out, still is, but now, like Cameron, the toymaker's sensibility has shifted from contraptions to the overall world. <br/><br/>You'll see all over this that he favors a video-game camera which takes up usually arbitrary movements in space, vertical or lateral. It feels unnatural and clunky because it is not tied to or derived from the movement of any of the elements in motion, it is digitally imposed after the fact as navigation. It is an artificial, non-human eye. <br/><br/>We do have some mildly attracting sculpting in the river escape from the elftown, but even this is ruined by other decisions like surfing Legolas. Overall it feels stale and tiresome, a huge tinkertoy mechanism."

","I was satisfied with the first entry in the trilogy. Still for the past year and a half, i think the idea of making one book into a 3 part movie is stupid, but when i watch the movies, i forget about it. The movie's story is a continuation of The Hobbit story line. The Characters are still the same with addition of some new characters. But for some reason, there's not as much comedic relief from the characters. Which is weird to me, but i think it was a good idea because of the darker tones of the movie. The setting is perfect, the creepy fog, the woods the lakes. All perfect for this chapter in the series. The acting is still really good, the interaction between characters was still really good. The action was really good. And Smaug Was awesome. I'm not going into the character of Smaug, because I don't want to ruin anything. Everything for a nearly perfect sequel is there, can't wait for part 3."

"Hellmant","9","2","7","14 December 2013"," The weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations!
","'THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The second film in director Peter Jackson's trilogy, based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel 'The Hobbit'. The three films also serve as prequels to Jackson's 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' film trilogy (which were also based on books by Tolkien). This film picks up where 2012's 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' left off and once again finds the hobbit Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman once again) and the wizard Gandalf (once again played by Ian McKellen) assisting a team of 13 dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (played again by Richard Armitage). They're on a journey to the Kingdom of Erebor in order to reclaim it from a vicious dragon named Smaug (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). This chapter also stars Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Ken Stott and James Nesbitt. It was written for the screen by Jackson and his usual writing partners (and co-producers on the film) Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh (Jackson's wife) as well as Guillermo del Toro (who was originally set to direct the 'HOBBIT' films). Despite all the rave reviews (from critics and fans alike) I found the movie to be the weakest of Jackson's Tolkien film adaptations.<br/><br/>The film begins shortly after the end of the last one (after a brief flashback of Gandalf meeting Thorin) with Bilbo (Freeman), Gandalf (McKellen) and the dwarfs still being pursued by Azog (Manu Bennett) and his army of Orcs. The team receives aid from a skin-changer, named Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), in the form of horses and a house to rest in. Gandalf then separates from the group and promises to meet up with them before they enter Smaug's lair. Bilbo and the dwarfs must continue to elude the Orc army while also dealing with giant spiders, Wood-elves and the people of Lake-town before taking on the dragon (Cumberbatch). In the mean time Gandalf investigates the whereabouts of the Necromancer (also played by Cumberbatch). <br/><br/>The movie is of course visually spectacular and it does have a lot of awesome and gory action scenes (in Jackson's usual style) but there's too much pointless fighting and not enough drama and character development. It's the shortest of all the films in the series (at 2 hours and 41 minutes) but it seems like the longest (to me). Despite the movie being extremely action packed it feels incredibly slow paced (due to the story going nowhere) and really drags on. I felt the same way after seeing 'THE TWO TOWERS' for the first time (which is my least favorite film of that series) so maybe it's just the curse of being the middle movie but I think stretching this book into three (nearly three hour) films was a bad idea. Of course not from a money point of view, the first movie made a billion dollars and I'm sure this one will as well (or at least close to it) but based on artistic film merit this one fails (pretty much). It is a good action flick and a visual feast but that's about it. I'm not one to complain about filmmakers taking creative liberties, when adapting their source material into film, but this movie detours so much from it's story that it weakens the overall viewing experience, even when not comparing it to the book. 'AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY' is slower paced but I still think it's a better (and more enjoyable) film; it also at least stays true to the essence of the book. This chapter is made just to please action junkies (which it should), it does have a minor love story (involving a dwarf and two elves) but that's about all the character drama we really get here. I still enjoyed the movie (and will probably like it more upon repeat viewing, when I know what to expect) but it is disappointing and not as good as the other four films. It's funny how similar these 'LORD OF THE RINGS' prequels are to the 'STAR WARS' ones; Peter Jackson and George Lucas are very similar filmmakers!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/jrx8UNvoGB0"
"micskogabor","6","2","7","15 December 2013"," A review for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug
","The latest installment of the fantasy extravaganza The Hobbit, titled as Desolation of Smaug, has just released this week on the big screens. It is a direct sequel to An Unexpected Journey, and the second entry in The Hobbit film trilogy.<br/><br/>Peter Jacksons' revival (An Unexpected Journey) of the perennial tale, The Hobbit, written by J.R.R. Tolkien, garnered respectable reception and recognition both from fans and critics. As for me, I've had moderate expectations with the film, as I didn't find the first part to be 'that' amazing as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>Regardless of the upbeat tone of the book, the light-hearted take on the subject took the dread and the feeling of the true menace out of the film, making it essentially a 'prelude' with the characters to the real deal. On another note, Desolation of Smaug, with it's more matured theme, reclaims this perk, and improves greatly on the storytelling.<br/><br/>The film opens with a flashback in the human town of Bree, where Gandalf persuades Thorin to reclaim the Arkenstone in order to become the king of Erebor. To do this, he must recruit a group of twelve dwarfs, and a burglar hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, to steal the stone guarded by a dragon.<br/><br/>Just after we learn the details of this quest, the films cuts back where the An Unexpected Journey ends. Bilbo and his company seek refuge in a house nearby from an impending orc attack, led by the ominous leader, Azog. After having spent some time in the haven, they encounter a shapeshifter, Beorn, who aids the company with horses to outrun the orcs. The bunch continues their journey through a misty forest, Mirkwood, unbeknownst of the dangers that this quest has in store for them.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with an incredible content, as the story never drags on for over two and a half hours. Every frame has a little nuance, a thing to it: either some incredible acting, a great dialogue with good writing, a rich and colourful scenery, or simply a showcase of a breathtaking landscape, and this way the film is gifted with incredible variety and diversity.<br/><br/>Speaking of variety, this film is beautifully shot as per usual. There are valleys, villages, caves, mountains, streams, abandoned ruins, grandiose elven towns, all visualized in great detail. However, this visual package is often marred by some stiff animations and low-resolution CGI (the lava), but the overall picture second to none.<br/><br/>Every single member of the cast deliver sublime performances. New characters has been introduced in addition to the old ones. Orlando Bloom made a great return as the cunning elf, Legolas. We also have Evangeline Lilly (known from Lost) playing Tauriel, a beautiful elf, who only makes an appearance in the film(s). Lee Pace pulls off a convincing portrayal of the elven king, Thranduil. Luke Evans is portraying a likable human, Bard, who assist the dwarfs along their adventure. Benedict Cumberbatch deserves recognition for lending his low-pitched voice to play Smaug, the dragon guarding the Arkenstone.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, and the old crew are still in the highlight though: Martin Freeman plays the crafty Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit with great effort. Then we have the dwarven company, and their leader, Thorin Oakenshild, played by the great Richard Armitage. Ian McKellen returns as the lovable mage, Gandalf, the brain behind the operation. Sauron also makes a brief and ominous appearance.<br/><br/>Few film can give me goosebumps in the first ten seconds, but Desolution of Smaug has achieved that, with the soundtrack: Howard Shores' iconic ""The Shire"" theme starts to play as the title fades instantly creating the feeling of adventurousness. Just when the menace appears, the musical momentum continues: more and more instruments are starting to appear. This momentum switches to a more low-key, and mysterious sounding that accompanies the journey through Mirkwood. The piano part transits to a grand and pompous sonority as the elven kingdom appears.<br/><br/>The soundtrack dynamically keeps getting better and better right until the end. I See Fire performed by Ed Sheeran concludes the film as the credit rolls. Although at first it may seem a little off considering the genre of the movie, it's still a powerful song, and a great way to end the film.<br/><br/>The only negativity I could find, apart from the minor visual inconveniences, is that the plot often relies on the ""deus ex machina"" device. That means, when the main characters are confronted by the evil, they are often saved right before they meet their fate. For example, when Legolas avoids getting hit by an arrow, denied by another arrow shot by Tauriel, or when the elves somehow make their way to Lake-Town and save a dwarf that was hit by a poisonous arrow earlier. I realize the film must stay true to the book, but these scenes could have been pulled off better.<br/><br/>All things considered though, Desolation of Smaug is faithful to the original trilogy in every way, and a major improvement over An Unexpected Journey. It's a must for fans, and heavily recommended for everyone else if you are in for an incredible journey."
"tmp_mufc","9","2","7","17 December 2013"," As Usual, A fantastic addition to middle earth!
","The early parts of the film stutter and you wonder how far the involvement of Mirkwood and the elves will go, upon escape there is a slowness to the adventure of the dwarfs but an insight to gandalfs 'dissappearance' and his side quest, ultimately the film brings you to follow numerous paths much like the LOTR where eventually you come to follow Thorin, bilbo, the lake town lot, gandalf and even the two elves. Each individual quest is infatuating and we become concerned for lake town, for legolas, for gandalf and for the company of dwarfs. Smaug by the way is brilliant, much has been said about the idea of a talking dragon, especially since the comparison to the LOTR where no creatures spoke, apart from the human like, his character gives a real menacing personality to what is a seemingly unbeatable foe. The villains are truly great altogether Smaug, the necromancer, bolg and azog all create an essence of darkness and inevitable defeat for the good people of middle earth. I found the ending frustrating as I could not stand to wait another year to see the next installment, however is have to say it was one hell of a second film. I'd say 9.2 myself but il have to round down"

","Although the movie was entertaining.... It is lacking in several aspects?? In my opinion, Part-1 was far superior in special effects & story...

Without spoiling anything... The early battle in which we are introduced to the main elf characters of this film was very cheesy & cartoonish! To make it worse... You can plainly see that it was all CGI. I think I would rather watch a stunt-double or stand-in, with an outlandish wig running around! I expect much better quality work from Peter Jackson!<br/><br/>This isn't a George Lucas film!

"saytosandeep","8","2","7","18 December 2013"," MY REVIEW: The Charm of Smaug!!
","Peter Jackson never fails to impress. He amazed us with immortal LOTR trilogy and my personal favorite the grand remake of Kingkong. With Hobbit 1, he set the stage for a thrilling adventure and with Hobbit 2 he has raised the bar again by his lucid imagination and magical touches. Like Hobbit 1, Hobbit 2 is also a long tiring journey often testing your patience but your patience is awarded big time when the terrifying fire breathing gigantic dragon Smaug appears on screen and you are glued to the 3D screen like a kid. His interactions with charming Bilbo are delicious. Out of the dwarfs Bombur makes you laugh without a single dialog. Other actors also fit to their relevant roles. But the movie belongs to the Peter Jackson and his technical team for setting up the terrific set pieces like grand water chase, flawless 3D experience and taking you to the world of magic and courage. Purposefully, at least four sequences are being kept open at the end so that you start counting the days for Hobbit finale to appear on big screen. Can't wait to be there and back again!!"
"bb_man94","8","2","7","15 December 2013"," 'Smaug' improves upon its predecessor with more action; less fluff
","Ten years ago this week, Return of the King hit theaters and concluded Peter Jackson's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Fans rejoiced with the conclusion and many consider it to be one of the best film franchises of all time. After nearly a decade, Jackson took us sprawling back into the realm of Middle-Earth; ​surprising us with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Some were floored at the change of direction; splitting a three-hundred page novel into three lengthly installments. Others were joyed to spend extra time with Bilbo and the Dwarfs. But in order to explain all of his newly added story elements at a satisfying pace, Peter Jackson decided to turn the Hobbit into a nine hour, epic trilogy. An Unexpected Journey set the stage for the rest of the films, however the Desolation of Smaug certainly picks up on what the first chapter could not find; it's lack of courage.<br/><br/>One of the best things Jackson did with this series was intertwine classic story elements with his new material. 'Smaug' begins in the village of Bree with some back story on Thorin. Unlike the novel, Thorin is more than just a dwarf with a name; He is Thorin Oakenshield, the true king under the mountain and a character whom we can truly root for and sympathize with. Yes, the Hobbit is centered mostly on Bilbo Baggins and his adventure, but Peter brings more to the table; introducing us to new characters like the sexy She-elf Tauriel and giving a new life to Legolas by showing us his incredible archery abilities and delving into how he abandons the woodland realm. Sauron has returned and we get to find out why Gandalf abandoned the dwarfs at the forest. My favorite moments are the ones Jackson brings to life right out of the pages of the novel; Mirkwood is eerie, the spiders are haunting, and Smaug is stupendous. The barrel chase scene was particularly astonishing in Imax High Frame Rate; I recommend you see it if you can in the Imax HFR format, because it is worth every penny by the time Smaug shows up to steal the show. The moments with him and Bilbo are particularly hair-raising; His roar shakes the entire theater and Benedict Cumbermatch gives life to the sixty foot dragon in ways I couldn't even imagine. <br/><br/>All around I truly believe 'Smaug' out stood An Unexpected Journey in almost every category. The action sequences were far more intense and characters truly came alive on the screen this time around. While Jackson's 'Hobbit' trilogy may not stand on the same level of his precious 'Rings' films, I think we have plenty to look forward to in Jackson's next installment coming next year."
"Boschbros","4","2","7","15 December 2013"," Peter Jackson's Hobbit movie sequel not Tolkien's Book
","You could go either way on this movie. Either accepting the changes or make a desolation out of Peter Jackson for making a movie inspired not based on J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece. This movie was more childish then the children's book. Either way this is not J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' you read..<br/><br/>This movie takes place between Chapters 7-13. In between those chapters you get the Director, Peter Jackson's new take on the story. More likely to take up more time so he could stretch out this short story into three films. I liked Peter Jackson's story, but I didn't like how they rushed Tolkien's version of the story and actually altering all of it. They Changed key parts of the book. I didn't like that, he could have easily left it alone the way it was and it would have been better that way, story wise and for the fans. I did like the chase down the river and the girl elf but they over played Legolas and even Kili. I did not like that Bilbo took off his ring in places he wasn't supposed too. The dwarfs being in the mountain with Bilbo was unnecessary. I disliked that Bard's kid said that the missing shell in Smaug's armor was because of his grandfather. In the book, Bilbo was sent in the cave twice because he was the burglar in the book so go burglar something. On his second trip he discovered the missing shell while Smaug was showing off. Making Bilbo ultimately responsible for Smaug's Demise or desolation because he discovered the dragon's weakness. In the movie he just confirmed it. Anybody can shoot an arrow in these movies but Bilbo outsmarted the dragon while being invisible and discovered how to kill him in the book. In my opinion they changed too much of the book that made the book great and you just don't do that! I didn't mind Peter Jackson's side story but I am disgusted by the lack of respect for Tolkien's original story.. I thought the first one was okay but this one flat out killed it for me."
"wwer06-742-758393","9","2","7","15 December 2013"," The Hobbit 2 Blows Expectations Out Of The Water
","I'm a HUGE fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and of course, Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, but I was a little dissatisfied with the first Hobbit. I understand that Tolkien wrote the Hobbit for children, but I felt like the first Hobbit had too much of an animated atmosphere in which I couldn't take much seriously. Still, the first Hobbit was very entertaining and I gave it an 8/10. Going from that, watching the trailers for Hobbit: DOS, I thought it would end up the same way... being too overwhelmed with CGI, but I was incredibly wrong. The actual movie looks totally different from trailers, everything looks so realistic and mind-blowing. Smaug looks a lot more realistic in the movie than he does in trailers, it was a beautiful movie! I couldn't count how many times I said ""wow!"" or moved closer to the screen to really focus on the details. I have to say, whoever worked on the setting and the creatures did a wonderful job! The effects, makeup, and costume crews deserve an Oscar without a doubt. I cannot wait for the 3rd Hobbit now, but I still hope Jackson uncovers some other Tolkien masterpiece and adapts it to an epic film just as he has done so well with the other Middle-Earth movies. Even if you're not into this type of movie, you'll love it anyway. The people I went with were in such a variety of tastes and interests and most of them were not into fantasy at all, but they were eating their words as they watched in awe. Check it out! Hobbit: DOS is a definite masterpiece!"
"jsninnes2010","10","2","7","14 December 2013"," Interesting at times, but nonetheless, still a very good film
","I went to see this film with very high hopes, and don't get me wrong, it was a very good film, but there were just some things which I wasn't quite expecting. There were also some parts which I knew had been altered for screenplay, but once I'd considered why these changes had been made, I was able to conclude that it WAS an excellent film. <br/><br/>Firstly, I recommend viewers (book-readers especially) to see this film as as much of a link between The Hobbit and LOTR as an adaptation of the novel. A lot of this film is based on writings by Tolkien from outside The Hobbit book. It's these parts that help turn the story of The Hobbit into the link with LOTR; I was really glad that these were incorporated into the story, as audiences can now be aware of more stories written by Tolkien in addition to what we see in The Hobbit and LOTR. However, even some of these external Tolkien writings have been altered or exaggerated. For example, some of the events shown didn't happen during the time in which The Hobbit was set; however, it is reasonable that these changes have been made in order to fit them into the story and, again I say it, form the link with LOTR. Also, some of these external Tolkien events have been exaggerated. E.g. The Orcs attacking Mirkwood and especially Lake Town. The events in Mirkwood (I believe) have been exaggerated. However, it is reasonable that this was added in order for the film to be adapted to its older audience. I do agree, however, that some may find the events with the Orcs in Lake Town a bit too far. There were only three parts of the film which I didn't understand why they were there. 1) A certain enemy of Thorin uniting with a darker power in Dol Guldur. 2) The Dwarf-Elf romance forming. 3) The Dwarfs taking on Smaug. Personally, I thought that these could have been left out of the story or the story left without these changes. <br/><br/>In conclusion, when I finished watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, I couldn't help feeling slightly uneasy about how different it was in places from the book. However, upon reflection and much thinking about the film, I have concluded that the majority of changes were necessary to fit the film into what it has become. People need to bare in mind that Tolkien wrote this book for his children in 1937. Times have changed since then. Also, LOTR became the much greater, darker and well-known between it and The Hobbit (especially since the release of the films), so audiences of The Hobbit today are much older than the 5-9 year olds that Tolkien first intended the book to be for. For that reason, the film had to be adapted for older age groups, and if that means adding a few more fight scenes, then I can understand that! This film is very much about 'setting the table' and building up to LOTR, and the changes made in the film, I believe, are necessary for that. Now that I know what to expect, I very much look forward to going back to see it again!"

","SPOILER ALERT! It stinks. END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>Given that it's the same crap, part 2, this shouldn't come as any great shock.<br/><br/>Jackson seems absolutely single-minded in his determination to prove just how much of a hare-brained mess he and his nincompoop, amateur writing staff can make of a movie in the last years of his career. Apparently following his lead, the worshipful geeks in the special effects shop have set the bar as low as it will go so as not to outshine the awful script. Music is again on a repeat loop from the first trilogy. This is canned movie hacking taken to the least of the least common denominators, and it's hard to imagine how it can be topped in part 3.<br/><br/>But surely Jackson will find a way."

","The thing everyone talks about is how Hobbit trilogy is unfaithful to the book. Well, I would rather see a great and exciting movie, than a boring one.The book could hardly be a great movie without adaptation, they spent ""a page and a half"" with lord Elrond, and to be honest my favorite scenes were in Rivendell, with Galadriel and him. Tauriel and Legolas are a great addition to the movie, and the fact that Azog is chasing them instead of being dead, really improves the dynamics of the movie. So stop criticizing for a moment and imagine a movie without these added things. Walking and Bilbo's inner monologues, with Thorin being a sleazy servant, instead of a impudent dwarf as he should be (as he is in the movies), and as he turns out to be later on."

","I had thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, and went to the cinemas to watch the second movie in 3-D! I had high hopes for this movie, and I was not disappointed. I'm posting this review as a movie fan, and because I've seen a lot of negative reviews going around for this movie, and there shouldn't be. Unlike Lord of the Rings (which I loved), The Hobbit trilogy caters a little more for people who hadn't seen the film, and while the built sets of lord of the rings were impressive, The hobbit has much more scale and the action scenes are much more impressive and enjoyable. Smaug is easily best dragon seen in movie history, and Benedict Cumberbatch nailed the voice. Martin Freeman and the surrounding cast are great in their roles, And the humor stops the film from being too serious. I still have Ed Sheeran's song from the credits stuck in my head, and the rest of the music is beautiful and amazing. The visual effects wizardry is absolutely amazing, but the important thing is not to compare it too much to the book, other wise you won't enjoy it as much as you should."

","No other Tolkien shall ever dwell in this world who will posses an imagination like Sir J.R.R. Tolkien. No other Peter Jackson shall ever dwell in this world who'll possess the exquisite skills of visualization and improvisation like Peter Jackson. I'm stunned by the magnificent screening of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. It has everything one can look for; DRAMA, FANTASY, MUSIC, ADVENTURE, VISUAL EFFECTS (you'll not believe me unless you watch it yourself) and a climax you have hardly seen. Ian Mckellon didn't get a major part of this movie but I'll still praise him for his continued brilliance. <br/><br/>Martin Freeman has delivered all the characteristics you look for from the Bilbo Baggins of the novels. There just aren't enough words to fully describe this masterpiece. I'm eagerly waiting for the final part to come and entertain us even more. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing-Smaug is a beauty, Benedict Cumberbatch added the right and balanced voice, or rather power to the beast. Wow! Wow! Wow! Who can even dream of such a dragon? Those gazes, that blaze, that ferocious roar; BREATHTAKING!<br/><br/>I'll happily rate it a 10/10 for it has everything the fans will look for. I mean come on guys, why do we want every movie to strictly follow the novel? Variations for the screening are always essential and Jackson molded the elements to attract all audiences, this must be appreciated.<br/><br/>Now I predict the following nominations and wins for this Legend:<br/><br/>1. Best Achievement in Directing 2. Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published 3. Best Achievement in Editing 4. Best Achievement in Costume Design 5. Best Achievement in Production Design 6. Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score 7. Best Achievement in Visual Effects 8. Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling<br/><br/>I hope the awards and reviews truly justify this wonderful movie."
"ant-karvelas","10","2","8","23 December 2013"," I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I found it great...
","This is the greatest movie I've seen in months. Great story, great graphics and, generally, I got what I paid for(more Middle-Earth and Dragon scenes). There are random film snobs that will tell you that the movie ""sucks"" while the book is ""great"". The truth is that it's the other way round. Peter Jackson accomplished making a really dark and interesting movie from a children's book. The story in the movie is much greater and more epic than in the book. And it's not the first time P.J. does that: remember the amazing fight between Gollum and Frodo ending with the destruction of the ring? You know what happened in the book? Gollum took the ring and amazed by it, it stumbled and FELL!!! I know that many grannies would prefer a movie with them sitting on a couch and reading the book for hours, but changes in the book do happen, much or little, and for a good reason. Accept that the story is better and move on with your life. Also, there are some sons of orks that will tell you that there is not ""character development""... What? Are you serious? We learn SO MUCH for characters that in the book we only know their name. Evil orcs, kind or fallen elves, people with families, corrupted people, dark-side of Thorin and so on, but I tried to omit the names to avoid spoilers... So, go see the movie, it's great, and don't listen to what others tell, trust only yourselves. You'll enjoy it!"
"josiahcoulter","10","2","8","14 December 2013"," An outstanding piece of fantasy fun
","***CAUTION: MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Anyone who felt An Unexpected Journey was too long and bloated will be happy to know that The Desolation of Smaug is the complete opposite. Unfolding on screen at a breakneck speed is an adventure filled to the brim with vile Orcs, nasty spiders, hostile Elves, and one very large, angry dragon. It's darker and moodier than its predecessor and carries a very different tone. Rather than focusing on the titular Hobbit and his wild adventures away from the Shire, the film keeps its focus on Thorin and the Dwarfs and their epic quest to take back Erebor from Smaug the Dragon.<br/><br/>Just like the four previous entries in the Middle Earth Saga, Smaug is a visual treat. The special effects are incredibly detailed and the set designs are exquisite. The film also brings us to several places never before seen on screen before. Mirkwood is a spooky, thorny, head-trip of a forest with several very dangerous threats held within, including, but not limited to, monsters of the arachnid variety and a very sassy Elvish king. It's very classic fantasy that recalls similar forests seen in the animated masterpieces Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Alice in Wonderland. On the flip side, Lake-Town is a very different sort of Middle Earth location. While the kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor recall the medieval European cities of old, Lake-Town resembles a colonial London on the water with a heaping pile of bonnets, petticoats, brandy, and British politics. We also get to see more in- depth looks at the vast, mighty halls of Erebor, and the dangerous, murky Dol Guldur.<br/><br/>The trilogy staples continue to give amazing acting performances. Ian McKellen is always incredible as Gandalf, but its Martin Freeman as Bilbo and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield that really start to bring their characters to life and take them both down darker paths. Several new characters also pop up in this installment. Although his appearance is brief, the half-man/half bear Beorn (played by Mikael Persbrandt) is a fun element, while Stephen Fry's interpretation of the Master of Lake-town is both disgusting and hilarious. Thranduil, King of the Wood Elves (played by Lee Pace) is delightfully vain, while new creation Tauriel (played by Evangeline Lilly) brings a much-needed sense of exuberance and powerful femininity to the film. Bard (played by Luke Evans) is a dynamic character with a lot of emotional depth and personality. I really appreciated his appearance and Evans' faithful adaptation of the character. Familiar faces also pop up throughout the film; Sylvester McCoy as the whimsical Radagast, Manu Bennett as the fearsome Azog, and Orlando Bloom as the beloved Legolas.<br/><br/>But the true star of this film is the electrifying Benedict Cumberbatch as both Smaug and the Necromancer. Though brief, the Necromancer's reveal as Sauron is incredibly intense and terrifying. Benedict's deep voice dipped in the black speech of Mordor is effectively creepy. However, nothing is more fearsome and awe-inspiring than the dragon himself: Smaug the terrible. An incredible special effects achievement, Smaug's enormous size and scalding fire breathing is a sight to behold; he is truly the most menacing and cunning villain ever seen in the Middle Earth films. Benedict's gravelly bass brings Smaug's conniving and highly intelligent character to life. I am convinced no one else could have brought such an incredible Smaug to life on screen as Peter Jackson, Benedict Cumberbatch, and the WETA Workshop have. He is truly the greatest cinematic dragon of all time.<br/><br/>As far as storyline goes, this film, much like The Two Towers is choppier and less linear than its predecessor. Instead of focusing on a single quest, the film splits up into two, then later three very distinct story lines. This is actually better for the story as it quickens the pace and ups the stakes. Some could complain that film suffers from being a ""middle chapter"" film; many things are going on at once and the film does end in a jaw-dropping cliffhanger. However, I've never been one to view the Middle Earth films as single films and prefer to watch them as one epic journey, and the ending just makes me all the more excited for There and Back Again in 2014.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is one of the best films of the year and another incredible installment in Peter Jackson's legendary Middle Earth franchise."

","I went to see the movie last night and felt compelled to register and write a review @ 03:00 because I very nearly didn't see this movie. I was put off going to the cinema as there were so many 'negative' reviews due to IMDb's ridiculous policy of plotting all ratings below the average (mean) rating (8.2 stars at time of writing this review) as 'hated it'. <br/><br/>I'm so glad I ignored the grumbles of the many reviewers who have complained that PJ's interpretation of the book fell so far short of their expectations because this film was a fantastic action film and was brilliant when watched in 3D HFR.<br/><br/>In my opinion, PJ did not make this movie for those people who want to see a faithful representation of the book. He wanted to make a film out of a much-loved classic children's book that would appeal to many and, of course, make a lot of money! What's so wrong with that? If you are hoping for a faithful adaptation of the book, and will be disappointed by anything less, don't go to see this movie at the theatre, wait until it comes out on DVD or don'i watch it at all. <br/><br/>However, if you want to see an enormously entertaining action-packed fantasy movie with exceptional quality CGI, go and see this film. I can pretty much guarantee you will enjoy it and will feel you got value-for-money. I can't understand how anyone would describe this movie as boring; it was action all the way and I couldn't believe how quickly the time went. <br/><br/>I've given this 10 stars on principle to ensure this will be a 'Loved It' review but actually rate it a 9 because there wasn't quite enough character development for me."
"bluesman-20","10","2","9","30 December 2013"," Fantasy Lives !
","The Hobbit: The desolation of Smaug. Is pure entertainment from beginning to end. There are fans of the Lords of the Rings and Tolkien's works who are disappointed. When I heard they were taking the Hobbit and making it three films instead of Two. I was disappointed. They're padding it I thought. To stretch it out to make more money. The original story wasn't that long. It could've been covered in two films. I read the Hobbit over a month long period at a breakneck pace. And Loved it. When I saw the First Part of THE HOBBIT. I wasn't disappointed. And again with this part I'm not disappointed. It has all of the ingridents for a fantasy film that Neds to be there. Martin Freeman is strong as Bilbo Baggins. Who we see grow from a meek Hobbit to a strong leader. Bilo proves himself to be more then a master Burgler. He proves to be a heroic warrior. And IAn Mckellion. He is Gandalf. Reprising his role from the Lord of the Rings. Just watching this made me feel like a kid again. I used to read the books under a blanket with a flashlight and read until I fell asleep the book still opened and mad at myself for falling asleep instead of finishing the chapter. There is magic here. True magic. MAgic of the imagination and yes they padded the story but it's a good thing they did. It adds fullness to the story. And it makes it more adventuresome. And Providees Action and More importantly it adds to the story. I loved each and every second of the movie and eagerly await the third part."
"puremoneymaking","10","2","9","24 December 2013"," Hobbit meets LOTR
","Don't know why so many viewers are disappointed. LOTR isn't made all the time. But I must say, this part has bought the Hobbit trilogy closer to LOTR.<br/><br/>The areas where the 1st part lacked - lengthiness, lack of action, etc. are no more to be found in this part.<br/><br/>This installment won't let you get your eyes off it, from start to finish. Sometimes it happens that, after a huge success (in this case the LOTR trilogy), producers, and directors tend to follow the same storyline in the next releases. But that's where Peter Jackson and Co. succeeds. The Hobbit trilogy takes you in to a completely different adventure, a fresh new feeling for the viewers and fans.<br/><br/>The only area where this installment lacks a little I would say, is when Bilbo meets Smaug. Smaug does look like a un-intelligent creature at times here.<br/><br/>But I'm sure that Peter Jackson and Co. will look into it, and will fix it in the last part, making Smaug look like a severely dangerous dragon to face.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the 3D effects are great. I've heard that they have used an all new 3D technology here, which makes this even more enjoyable. There are a lot of scenes here - one to mention, where a big insect sits on Bilbo's eyes, it never ever felt that much real even in earlier great 3D movies like ""Avatar"", or ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to the last installment, where (going ahead a little farther I would say) Hobbit meets LOTR, from all aspects.<br/><br/>So my recommendation, a must watch - in 3D, for all ages."

But this movie was the movie that made me realize how amazing the world of Middle-Earth is.<br/><br/>We see how the ring affects Bilbo, how the greed overpowers Thorin and how the general darkness arises. We see more to the other dwarfs, and they now don't feel like ""fillers"", we finally get some personal contact, which I like.<br/><br/>There is one scene with the barrels that really surprised me, and the last scene with Smaug was none other that amazing, so much bad-ass!<br/><br/>Talking about bad-ass, we see Legolas, as always so graceful and utterly cool.<br/><br/>If you like Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit, this is a movie you need to go see.

"Dr-Amer-1998","10","2","9","18 December 2013"," NOT Jackson We had Known !
","Note : Ignore My Rating.<br/><br/>To be Honest, this is not Petter Jackson we had known in The Lord of The Rings trilogy. I really miss the old Jackson, the Jackson who focus on details, who doesn't totally change everything about a movie adapted from a book. I'm sure everyone misses that Jackson.<br/><br/>That Peter Jackson who made Legolas walk on snow while other members of the fellowship was walking through the snow. Yes, it's true because we get to know that elves are light. Also when Aragon was with the hobbits in the forest you can see behind in the background three giant stone trolls. YES ! that is Peter Jackson, even though some may not realize this but these small things makes the difference between a great director and a normal director.<br/><br/>Second thing, if you think that An Unexpected Journey is some how far from the book, what about The Desolation of Smaug.

"andreakiely2000","10","2","9","16 December 2013"," Another Triumph in Middle Earth
","Sitting to watch The Desolation of Smaug, I couldn't help but worry as I thought back on the previous movie. While the first may have been a fun movie, it didn't feel like we were being taken to Middle Earth. The other complaints that I felt needed to be made were that the last movie had no break time, with too much happening at once. The second movie is filled with eye popping action, but you also get the feel of caution and a much slower pace. To avoid spoilers, all I can tell you is that; once again, the performance of Martin Freeman as the protagonist was excellent, and we see a different side too many others, which allows for greater depth and character growth. But the crown jewel of it all is the dragon himself. The voice casting was brilliant, and Benedict Cumberbatch made me BELIEVE I was seeing the real thing in Tolkien's mind."
"treleone","10","2","9","14 December 2013"," This is the most beautiful journey ever.
","I have waited for a year (since the first Hobbit) for this movie to come out in cinemas. There was obviously huge hype and I have been anticipating it for a long time cause I knew it would have been better than the first. I was right! It was a fantastic return to Middle Earth for me (a LOTR fan) and many other Tolkien fans all over. Hopefully others who are not yet fans will enjoy this spectacular fantasy. Everything from Mirkwood to Lake Town and the Lonely Mountain is amazing. The in depth of the story and added scenes is great and gives this movie a genuine feel that compares to it's Lord of the Rings counterparts!!!! The dragon Smaug is one of the reasons that this movie was so exciting because It was always teased in the previous film. Nothing could have compared to the excellent work of Weta to bring this beast to life and the genius of Benedict Cumberbatch who lends his voice and physical movement to Smaug. It is probably one of the best CGI dragons ever made. Just when it spreads it's wings for the first time it makes us remain breathless. This movie ""undoubtably"" gets a 10 on 10!! Great Stuff!!! Full of Epicness."
"jimbo-53-186511","3","1","3","19 February 2018"," All setup and no payoff
","There doesn't seem much point in writing a plot summary for this film - if you've seen the first film then this film plot wise seems to re-tread very similar ground to An Unexpected Journey...<br/><br/>So yes familiarity and laziness is part of the problem with this film, but the larger issue lies with how goddamn boring it is. Like An Unexpected Journey we have another story drawn out painfully thin (although in DOS it feels longer and even more drawn out than AUJ). There are few, if any, genuinely exciting or intense moments - even the showdown at the end with Smaug was disappointing . Any camaraderie that existed between the characters in the first film seems to have all put disappeared; I seem to recall there being some amusing moments in the first film, but these moments come few and far between here.<br/><br/>Gandalf disappears for most of the film on his own quest which was barely explained and in some ways affected the flow of the film... well what little flow it actually had.<br/><br/>The only real plus points with this film lay with the cinematography and some of the special effects - although some of the special effects looked more ridiculous than breath-taking. <br/><br/>What I took from this film is that it was basically a very long dull trailer which only seemed to exist to set up the third film in the franchise. Whilst AUJ was disappointing but watchable DOS is just plain bad. I'm really hoping that the third film will somehow turn the franchise around, but after what I've witnessed so far I'm not going to hold my breath"

"bilbobrick","9","1","3","6 December 2016"," The Best Hobbit Film
","After the very entertaining first installment, An Unexpected Journey, the Hobbit trilogy is back with an even better second chapter. Unlike the Lord of the Rings films, where I felt the middle chapter (The Two Towers) was the weakest, I feel it is the best in this series. <br/><br/>The movie opens with a bit of exposition, but after that, the excitement doesn't let up much, except for a somewhat lengthy stay at Lake-Town. Characters such as the Master of Lake-Town, that are barely even mentioned in the book, are fleshed out quite well and given stories of their own. Howard Shore's score is better than in the first movie, mostly because he branches out into new territory more, just like the film itself does. There is also some great acting in this movie, particularly from Martin Freeman, who expresses just as much in non-dialogue scenes as he does in scenes with dialogue. Smaug the dragon is absolutely incredible, and they spend just the right amount of time with him to satisfy audience expectation without the story becoming dull. The ending, although it differs from the book, is quite exciting, and leaves audiences with bated breath in anticipation of the next chapter.<br/><br/>There are a few negatives, however. Some of the CGI, particularly during the Barrel Chase scene, is not that great, especially compared to the masterful job done on Smaug. There are also a few characters that feel unnecessary (including Legolas) and a romantic subplot that is both cheesy and creepy. This movie definitely takes more liberties (both canon and non-canon) from the book than the previous film, some of which work, and some of which don't. <br/><br/>All in all, The Desolation of Smaug is a superior second installment that I would highly recommend to fans of Tolkien, and fantasy lovers in general. Readers of the book will have to be ready for changes, but that's the case with just about any book-to-film adaptation. I would also advise you to check out the extended edition, which adds in some more scenes from the book, a side-story or two, and even a bit more action."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","8","1","3","25 October 2016"," Definitely more substantial than the other two Hobbit films.
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is easily the most potent film in the now infamous trilogy of films based on JRR Tolkien's classic children's book, that would result in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy of novels. The second film in The Hobbit Trilogy is, I believe to be, the strongest out of the hastily extended three-part series; unfortunately, try as it may, it does fall short of the wonder The Lord of the Rings films gave audiences worldwide.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug does have some notable set pieces in it, like the barrel sequence and of course Samug's scenes in The Lonely Mountain make for some very captivating scenes that qualify the story's controversial morphing into a three-part film. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a great motion-captured performance that shows one of the best looking dragons in film history, and The Desolation of Smaug was probably key to transforming The Hobbit into a trilogy, from the studio executive perspective at least. This film essentially becomes a villain showcase for one of the best dragons realized for the big screen.<br/><br/>I personally think that The Desolation of Smaug is the chapter that makes this (reluctant) trilogy show its worth: there are so many payoffs that the preceding film couldn't muster, thanks to there being more substance to this film than An Unexpected Journey.<br/><br/>This is the film out of The Hobbit movies that will (hopefully) convince naysayers to not ignoring the series completely."
"akash_sebastian","7","1","3","20 April 2015"," Smaug's majestic presence is reason enough to watch this.
","In an otherwise mediocre (or just good enough) trilogy, this one gets an extra star only because of the majestic presence of Smaug; from its digital detailing to its voice by Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug is magnificent in every scene it's present in. Never before on screen has a dragon been presented with so much character and intelligence. Bilbo's conversation with Smaug is quite fascinating to watch; it's reminiscent of the one Bilbo shares with Gollum in first part, but this one is filled wit more wit and humour.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman truly embodies the character of Bilbo; from his walk to his mannerisms, he's truly a hobbit. He is the only character worth caring about.<br/><br/>The barrel ride across the stream is really well-shot; it's rider point-of-view camera angles really makes us part of the adventure."
"jake-law123","8","1","3","1 January 2015"," Improvement over the first one
","I did not hate the first, I enjoyed it for the most part, but it had its issues. This movie resolved most of those issues. It's much more polished, focused, and a stronger structured film all together.<br/><br/>Taking where the first one left off, Bilbo and his dwarf team continue toward Lonely Mountain to reclaim it against the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>Right away it starts the film by building in the tension of Smaug, which immediately puts us in build up mode, as the journey becomes more and more epic. There's much more going on in this one. The action is common, but it's very well executed, with some great choreography, and graphically impressive brutality. The characters are more involved and more likable in this one. You feel the desperation of Oakenshield to reclaim his specie's glory as they get closer and closer to the mountain, and you get scared for Bilbo when he comes face to face with Smaug. The introduction to other characters such as Legalis, Thranduil, and a reference to Gimley is also done well. It makes you feel more related to the original films, and it's very enjoyable.<br/><br/>One thing that bothered me is Bilbo. He didn't feel as much like a protagonist in this one. In the first one, it's his retelling of his experience throughout the story, getting the ring, adapting to the group and what not. In this one, he feels like a side character supporting the cause of Oakenshield or Tauriel and Kili's chemistry. He has his moments, don't get me wrong, but most of the time he just goes with whatever he's told to. He has no passion or journey of his own to complete, it's mostly about Oakenshield's vengeance.<br/><br/>With that said...Smaug. Good gracious, when that dragon appeared in the film I about pooped. Not only is the CGI really sharp, but the voice of Smaug by Benedict Cumberpatch is phenomenal. Plus it's not too often a dragon in a film gets development.<br/><br/>The film really ends out of nowhere. Like obviously it's to set itself up for the next film, but the last one had an official ending. This one just kind of stopped. I didn't dislike it, but it was kind of strange, it didn't seem to fit with the epic tones of the films before it that officially concluded each chapter, then this one just stops in plain sight. Either way, the film is an improvement over the first one. Like I said I enjoyed the first a good amount, but this one just had more of what I was looking for in the series. And with what i'm hearing about the 3rd film, that's gonna surpass this one, so i'm super excited!"
"SebastianT-L","9","1","3","18 December 2014"," Amazing!
","The first Hobbit film was very good, but it was a little bit slow paced. This film was the opposite. It was well paced, awesome CGI and fantastic entertainment action scenes. Im not a book purist so the characters and scenes that were changed from the book were still good. <br/><br/>For example it was more entertaining to put the action and incorporate it into the barrel riders scene. The thing I liked most about the film was adding the wizard, Gandalf's sub plot. I liked it because in the book you never find out where Gandalf went while he was gone, so Peter Jackson added a fantastic sub plot. Gandalf suspects that Sauron has returned, so he ventures to Dol Guldur. The writers have incorporated the resurrection of Sauron, having a fantastic back story for Lord of the Rings. <br/><br/>Overall a fantastic film. Peter Jackson has done it again:)"

"Tyson14","10","1","3","11 December 2014"," Tremendous fun, and a great expansion of the world of Middle-earth
","I have read absolutely everything that JRR Tolkien has ever written, and consider myself a Tolkien fanatic. This is my perspective on The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. Please stick with me to the end, and I'll try not to lose you. Let's begin. So...if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was Peter Jackson giving the purists their dues with a relatively straightforward and book-faithful film, then THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is Peter Jackson saying: ""You've had your fun. Now stand back and watch what I can do.""<br/><br/>And the ride he takes us on is absolutely exhilarating. SMAUG is darker, moodier, and more mature than any Middle Earth film we've seen thus far. Evil hangs over our heroes like a black pall (literally). Beset on all sides by revenge-seeking orcs, wargs, terrifying spiders, pale creepy- crawlies, double-crossing elves, treacherous humans, a growing Evil in a ruined Elvish citadel, and a huge, vain, fire-breathing dragon...both the heroes and the audience are plunged into a terrifyingly new world. And there's a lot of new stuff to feast your eyes on along the way.<br/><br/>Castwise, Tauriel is a welcome female addition to the gang, played with charisma and spunk by Evangeline Lilly. Lee Pace's regal and scheming elf- king Thranduil is absolutely astounding, delivering a tour-de-force in a few minutes of screen time. Luke Evans could not be better as Bard, simultaneously grim and noble. But of course, the real draw here is Benedict Cumberbatch, wearing two very villainous hats. The first is as the Necromancer, who, in addition to manifesting himself as an inkblot, is really quite scary. And the second...is the reason that you came here in the first place: Smaug. The Terrible. Smaug just so happens to be the greatest dragon ever! He is everything I wanted him to be and more: vain, seductive, manipulative, terrifying, and of course, absolutely huge. I'd just like to congratulate Cumberbatch and the conceptual crew on his tremendous design.<br/><br/>Our returning cast is also fantastic. Richard Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield is electrifying, with gravitas and stage presence enough for a character twice his stature. His grave eyes and deep voice tell of a lifetime of war and sorrow, and every line he speaks could be delivered by a king. Martin Freeman continues to be perfect as Bilbo, and Ian McKellen's Gandalf is just as crusty and warm as you remember him. Oh, and Legolas? Legolas is awesome. Like, web-swinging, spider-slaying, arrow- shooting, orc-killing awesome!<br/><br/>Speaking of orc-killing, The Desolation of Smaug has, in THIS Tolkienian's perspective, the best action scene of the year: the barrels. The breathless, crazy, confusing, insane three-way-battle sequence (don't tease me for it) had me LITERALLY crying with sheer unadulterated glee! The rest of the action, including a hard-hitting spider attack, and a sprawling, rather one-sided battle between 10 dwarfs, a hobbit, and a dragon shows that Jackson has absolutely outdone himself!<br/><br/>Well, now for the cons. If Desolation of Smaug has a con, it's that it really, really wants to keep moving to newer, darker territories, so whenever it slows down it feels, well...like an intermission between set- pieces. And the ending will divide the audience: you'll either love the breathless cliffhanger, or hate that you have to wait another year to find out what happens! And as a Tolkien purist, I have to address the fact of accuracy. SMAUG really isn't that accurate to the books. But you know what - I actually like that! I enjoy having absolutely NO IDEA what Peter Jackson has cooked up next. God knows what he's got cooked up for Part Three!<br/><br/>So in conclusion, The Desolation of Smaug is a terrific ride. Filled with amazing action, excellent performances, and the requisite gorgeous New Zealand landscape shots and Howard Shore score, SMAUG is everything I hoped for and more"

","ï»¿A similar method to An Unexpected Journey was used to introduce this movie before dived right back into the action. This time the flash back didn't last as long and it answered a question I had about Gandalf & Thorin. The second installment is better, action packed, a real sequel to a movie franchise, they've upped the scale and made it more impressive. The running theme of this story is that History has a way of repeating itself and peace only last as long as it takes to prepare for war. I can easily illustrate what I'm saying, it seems defeated foes have their way of coming back, it seems Bilbo also got caught in a spider's web, and there was also an interracial love interest blooming. This one is more subtle but it leads up to a weird love triangle, in which this time there's some unrequited love thrown in the mix (you know what I'm talking about it you've seen the movie).<br/><br/>The Dwarfs are impressive, I mean, I did not realize the scale of their might until I saw Smaug in the mountain. I know there were a lot of them living in their back in the day but boy there were filthy rich. And what about the size of that place? It told me one thing, they were suffering from some serious megalomania and Napoleon syndrome. They really are greedy little beasts. I understand the Dwarfs a little bit better, hell if I had that much gold and jewels and it was taken from me, of course I would want to get it all back.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is showing us he can carry a franchise, in The Hobbit:An Unexpected Journey he showed that he was Bilbo Baggins, the only Bilbo that made sense. In The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug he gave Bilbo more depth, an edge where the darkness crept to the surface, a daring quality that Frodo never had. I guess Frodo was the sensitive soul of the family. Bilbo revealed himself to be sneakier and more brave in this one.<br/><br/>Thorin (Richard Armitage) is still, if not more, annoying, the other dwarfs are showing more personality, I can now tell apart four of them. Lee Pace, was regal, a real king, firm and mysterious. Gandalf is proving to be more resourceful and powerful in the second installment, I guess he really was older and ""wiser"" in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which translated as ""I'm a wizard but I won't be using my powers much don't have.""<br/><br/>Tauriel is a very good addition to the mix, it was only when she came in that I realize that the movie is a bit of sausage fest, yes Cate Blanchett was in it but i think she served the same purpose. Evangeline Lily's character might have been added to add a female to the cast but she is not way a weird stand in that has no business doing there, she is bad-ass, incredible and elevates the movie. The same goes for Legolas (Orlando Bloom) but she clearly out-shined him. Smaug was incredible in this movie, one of the most memorable moment of this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job voicing Smaug. This Dragon looked awesome, he was menacing, dominating, enormous and mighty. The dialogues between Bilbo and Smaug were just really good.<br/><br/>In the end The Desolation of Smaug was good, better than the first. I was thrilled and impressed and now wish that I had seen in the cinemas.<br/><br/>if you want to discuss the movies you can tweet me @wornoutspines"
"williampsamuel","7","1","3","7 December 2014"," Great fun, if not exactly the same as the book
","Last year Peter Jackson released the first part of his long anticipated Hobbit trilogy to large audiences and generally good reviews. It didn't match the sheer awesomeness of his Lord of the Rings films and was a bit slow in places, but it worked thanks to a talented cast, good action, and the director's love of- if not absolute faithfulness to- the source material. Starting where the last movie left off, Desolation of Smaug follows the formula and tone of its predecessor, but marks a general improvement in the direction of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Anyone who saw the first movie will already have a pretty good idea what to expect from part two; everything that was in the book, plus a whole lot that wasn't. Not that this is entirely a bad thing. It may not be as faithful an adaptation as his Lord of the Rings films and the tone often varies greatly from the children's book it's based on, but the additional material is quite entertaining in its own right and blends well into the rest of the story. Which it should, considering that it's based on later supplementary writings by Tolkien which flesh out events that are hinted at in the book. And even if the additional scenes do take the film away from the tone of the children's' novel, they do bring it closer to the feel of Jackson's Ring trilogy.<br/><br/>As with those films, there's a lot of epic combat here. Possibly more than was needed, but not so much that it becomes repetitive or impedes the story. The barrel riding sequence is one of the more unorthodox battles I've seen, and rather humorous at that. The encounter with the spiders of Mirkwood is fittingly creepy and makes a fine display of WETA's creature making skills, rather like the spider cave scene from Jackson's King Kong, but without the stomach churning gruesomeness. Most impressive are the fight scenes involving Legalos. Orlando Bloom doesn't look like he's aged a day since Return of the King and his moves are every bit as gorgeous as they were then.<br/><br/>It's a bit odd that a character who wasn't even in the book should steal so many of the scenes, but there's no denying that he can fight and he looks awesome doing it, whether in a running archery duel or in an extremely physical slugfest with orc chieftain. Another section that was very good despite being nowhere in the book is the battle between Gandalf and the forces of the Necromancer. It is highly impressive from a special effects standpoint, and nicely fleshes out important events which the novel only hinted at.<br/><br/>Of course Legalos is not the only one to chew the scenery. In the later sections, a certain dragon makes a very BIG impression. Vain, arrogant, and very well spoken, Smaug is the kind of callous predator who likes to play with his food before roasting it alive. His every word brims with anger and condescension, and his physique more than backs up the menace in his voice. He is absolutely massive, towering over the dwarfs and their grandest creations. It's clear that Thorin and his companions have no chance of defeating him, but their attempts are certainly entertaining.<br/><br/>I will admit that the ending was a disappointment. It's not that they changed it from the book, but rather that it came at an earlier point in book than one would expect. When it became apparent that the movie was over, there were incredulous groans in the theater, but I suppose that this movie's less is the next one's gain. If anything, Desolation of Smaug has reinforced my opinion that The Hobbit would have worked better as two movies, and could easily have been fit into one, but admittedly it is grand adventure and good fun. It's still not equal Jackson's earlier trilogy, but it's a very good movie."
"kevin-benny90","8","1","3","16 November 2014"," A great sequel! OK visuals, but awesome acting...
","This film is one of the hardest for me to review... There are so many points that make me love it, but others that make me wish it was something different... #1: The Visual Effects The CGI in An Unexpected Journey was some of the best I've ever seen. The creatures were spectacular, the scenes were dazzling and it made me feel like I was in middle earth with the company. This film however disappointed me in some ways. In the teaser trailer, the barrel scene, lake-town, and the halls of Erebor looked very well done and realistic. But when I saw the film, I was surprised by how much it was changed. The whole film looked like a grey instagram filter was placed over the camera lens. Now mind you this doesn't change my overall opinion of the film, but it does make me think. I am confused about how the greatest CGI animators money can buy, are making melted gold look like a video game and pointless CGI horses. My final thought on the visuals is just that they need to step up their game for The Battle of the Five Armies!!! I still have hopes... #2: The Characters The only problem I have with the characters is the completely forced love story between Tauriel and Kili. It just seemed that the whole thing was just hollywoodified to please who knows who. But it was a minor price to pay, because the rest of the actors play their parts very well. Overall, this movie didn't thrill me as much as the first one, but did have me on the edge of my seat wanting more. I still lay awake at night hearing ""what have we done"" :)"
"brchthethird","8","1","3","14 November 2014"," An excellent sequel despite a slightly bloated narrative
","I do have some misgivings about The Hobbit being split into three parts, as I'm sure many others do too. If it needed to be split at all, two parts would have done just fine, as the book is also divided into two parts. Still, I can't complain with most of what I've seen. Visually and in terms of spectacle, Peter Jackson continues to outdo himself with every successive film. Still, that doesn't change the fact that these movies have been padded with extra material in an effort to tie them more strongly to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, what Peter Jackson has given us is just fine and quite enjoyable. Riveting even.<br/><br/>This film begins a year before Bilbo and the company start off on their journey at a meeting between Thorin Oakenshield and Gandalf. While this might have been more at home in the previous installment, it does add character depth and clarifies the motivation behind wanting to take back the mountain. The film then proceeds to continue where the last one left off. On their way to the mountain, they encounter all manner of creatures, from giant spiders and orcs, to elves and humans. At times it feels a little episodic, with the company going from one setpiece to another, but the overall narrative thrust and ultimate goal keep the story going along at a nice pace.<br/><br/>If there's one major complaint I have, and not just with this installment, it's that Peter Jackson has grown very reliant on CGI to augment, and in other cases completely replace practical effects. In no case is this more apparent as in the orcs, which are largely CGI. They worked very well in the Lord of the Rings as actual people with makeup, and I don't understand why they couldn't have continued that way in this Hobbit trilogy. Still, I digress slightly. There were also moments where it was clear that they were on sets. It took a little bit out of the magic of it all, but I was still wowed by the depth, breadth and level of detail in the landscapes. Also, for a movie with a lot of walking and talking, the action, when it came, served its purpose well. I kind of wish I had seen this in theaters for the sheer spectacle of it all. Two sequences that stand out in particular were a barrel escape from the elves, while being attacked by orcs, and the moment when the company finally meets Smaug. These two sequences stand out as being among the best in the trilogy so far, full of action and tension.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, everyone gives a great performance, although I still can't really distinguish between most of the dwarfs. I'll also give major props to Benedict Cumberbatch for some outstanding voice work as Smaug. However, there were also a couple of small roles, one in particular (which I won't spoil) which kind of took me out of the movie. One final positive I'll mention is the incredible (as usual) score by Howard Shore. It really helps to set and maintain the epic tone of the film. Overall, while not perfect, THE HOBBIT: THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a stellar production of a classic story (or at least part of one) and sets up the finale quite nicely. Any serious film fan should want to see this, and I highly recommend watching it."

","From the day that I read this news on IMDb which mentioned ""The Hobbit"" as a trilogy, I had this question in my mind that whether it's a right job to do or not. Its unbelievable but, what which was just a question for me, used by critics as a tool to start arguing with producers of this flick. They all had this opinion that decision made by producers regarding to breaking ""Hobbit"" into three parts was just and only because of the predictable financial profit which had been expected.<br/><br/>In my opinion, making such movies, needs a great talent and also requires an experienced team behind the camera. You need to get accustomed with all the characters who have been mentioned in context of the book and you need to be much more talented in finding appropriate ones, to convince everyone they are exactly those whom all the audiences expected to be! Choosing Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins can be mentioned as a success. Great job done by cinematographer and fantastic jobs which have been made by sound editors and mixers of the movie all at the same time can be used to evaluate the actual value of this movie. Like most of the trilogies, ""The Desolation of Smaug"",the second episode of the series, is the best of it, better than ""An Unexpected journey"" because of more action scenes it has and better than ""Battle of the five armies"", because of the unity its screenplay has and surely, higher technical level in both visual effects and sound mixing which made this movie, a good sequel for its main title, ""The Lord of The Rings"".<br/><br/>As a conclusion, despite of all the problems that you may mention, each as a deficiency for this title, based on what which has been mentioned above, I do believe in this fact that second episode of this challenging trilogy has that special something and proves how talented Jackson is in collecting the required data from available sources of Tolkien masterpieces. I myself enjoyed watching this movie and do recommend you to watch it."
"MajorBaleegh","9","1","3","30 May 2014"," Excellent Movie
","Tonight I watched the movie ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"", along with my kids and it was fun and adventure. The movie started with the pretext in mind of the first sequel of the movie ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" and the story unfolds rather slowly. The action scenes were pretty long and undue details were added making the movie length to 161 minutes. Apart from all this the archery skills of Mr. Orlando Bloom was worth watch he was shown too good with the use of the bow as well as his counterpart Ms. Evangeline Lilly. The scene of the Smaug the Dragon was quite long and unnecessary details and talk was boring then adventurous. The mounds of gold shown was too mouth watering but it was good. The fighting with Orc's was good but again lengthy. The running around of dwarf's was enjoyed by the kids and it was funny and laughable. This was a good time pass and it consumed almost many hours of the weekend night. This kind of movies is worth watching for both adults and kids and this movie really played its part. All the cast played their part in the befitting manner and overall it was a fantastic effort. The back ground music and the scenery was stunning and as it was filmed in New Zealand; it means the country is worth watching due to its natural scenery. I gave this movie 9 out of 10 as it was an excellent effort by all."
"reinout-godaert","9","1","3","26 March 2014"," Desolation of Smaug
","I have seen all the 'Lord Of The Rings' movies en both 'The Hobbit' movies, but I have to say 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug' was one of the best or even the best of the 5 movies. It's all about the journey Bilbo Ballings and the dwarfs and Gandalf to The Lonely Mountain. The journey already starts in the first 'Hobbit' movie. A long time ago, the dragon Smaug stole the Lonely Mountain from the dwarfs and he stole their gold. The dwarfs of The Lonely Mounatin had become very rich. They were ruled by king Thror. Now the dwarfs want their gold back and Gandalf the wizard will help them with their quest. They want the Arkenstone so Thorin, grandson of Thror, can become the new king of The Lonely Mountain. But Smaug sleeps in the mountain on all of their gold with somewhere between the gold the Arkenstone. That's why Gandalf asks Bilbo to help the dwarfs with their quest. Bilbo is a hobbit and hobbits are much more fast and silent than dwarfs are. And Smaug doesn't know the smell of a hobbit. Bilbo is asks to steal the Arkenstone and that's why he is called 'The Burglar'. On their road the dwarfs, Gandalf and Bilbo find many obstacles but I am not going to tell you the whole story, I don't want to spoil the movie for you. 'The Hobbit' movies were made after the 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy but in the story 'The Hobbit' books and movies come before the 'Lord Of The Rings'. I thought it would be hard to get the story, but actually it was very easy. 'The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug' is a very good movie. I think he is way better than the first 'Hobbit' movie: 'An Unexpected Journey'. There is much more action in 'The Desolation Of Smaug', for example in the forest where the dwarfs and Bilbo meet the giant spiders. What I also liked in the movie is that you can see how Bilbo tries to steal the Arkenstone from Smaug en how the dwarfs try to help him, it was the best part of the movie in my opinion. I have seen the movie in 3D, and I really recommend you to watch the movie also in 3D, it really improved the movie. If you have seen the 'Lord Of The Rings' movies, you must see 'The Desolation of Smaug'!"
"Samhuinn","7","1","3","24 March 2014"," A confident stride after shaking first steps
","Peter Jackson's The Hobbit films have been met with criticism. His proposed trilogy has been seen as a cash grab, or at the least as a little excessive. Despite the intrinsically drawn-out nature of adapting a book of a little over 300 pages into a trilogy of films, The desolation of Smaug's main downfall is its overtly large and undistinctive cast of characters. The fellowship of thirteen dwarfs, a wizard and a Halfling suffers from the general jolliness of the dwarfs. Their lack of individual motivation sets them apart from the fellowship in the original Lord of the rings trilogy, as it is difficult to care for (or even tell apart) characters who seemingly differ only in name and beard.<br/><br/>The emotional focal points of the film thus are Bilbo and Gandalf, both of whom are explored in greater detail. Bilbo (Martin Freeman) is required to use all of his cunning and wits when he is called upon his contractual obligation to steal an artifact of the dwarfs from the titular dragon. Played masterfully by the brilliant Freeman, Bilbo's gradual descent into madness after having acquired the Ring from Gollum in the previous film is excellently juxtaposed with his intelligence and initiative, proving again that Bilbo is a far more engaging and interesting protagonist than The lord of the rings's Frodo, whose reliance upon his fellowship made him seem like an item more than a character.<br/><br/>The desolation of Smaug marks the first time we see Gandalf (Ian McKellen) shy away from his role as a leader and moral guide, in favor of a more active stance. His encounter with the Necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch), a spiritual form of 'big bad' Sauron, showcases the wizard's formidable magic powers in an almost Dumbledoresque manner. These scenes are riveting, and a much anticipated payoff.<br/><br/>The same can be said for the dwarfs. Although their individual characters remain underdeveloped, as a unit they are far better utilized than in the previous instalment of the trilogy. The action sequences have lost the childish and rather absurd nature of the first film (no musical acrobatics with china and cutlery!), opting instead for fast-paced and well-choreographed action that creates both a sense of real danger and a feeling of deep-rooted familiarity between the dwarfs.<br/><br/>Fans of the original series will be much more pleased with The desolation of Smaug than with An unexpected journey. The plot of the film is more focused, resulting in enthralling action sequences and a greater sense of purpose. The nods to the original trilogy, such as the appearance of Legolas (Orlando Bloom), have risen above the level of gimmicks to contributing to the story, which is enjoyable as well as useful.<br/><br/>All in all, this film does not justify the choice for a trilogy, yet increases the anticipation for the final closing chapter.<br/><br/>(AREA 555 on Wordpress)"
"face-819-933726","9","1","3","19 March 2014"," Give me an ending, and I'll give you the ten that this should be
","As a member of the changed for life club it is great to see the new skinny (still bearded) Peter Jackson right at the start of the movie, like a welcoming sign of the almost perfect movie to come. Within the first five minutes you are ankle deep in action, and so many incredible special effects that most movies would already have blown their budgets, and just be winging it, but that is just the beginning, and they do not stop, or get cheap at any point. In fact in this world of washed out franchises this is one story that has been so over played in the past decade that it should really not be worth anyone's time, but instead I personally think that this is the one that all of the other movies were made just so that this could be made. This is the part of the original The Hobbitï»¿ that most people will remember from having it read to them in a class, or reading it themselves, or even the animated movie from the 70's From the Spiders at the Elven gate to the Poison arrow, and even the initial confrontation to start the movie these are the iconic moments of the story that have been so well buried within us all that with little tugs, and amazing flowing action, and effects we are treated to such a near perfect production. I Enjoyed every minute of this movie until it ended, and I was reminded yet again that this is still at least a year from being completed. So of course anyone would recommend this movie to you if you are older than say 9 or 10, and not prone to the night time scares then you will be seeing this one now or later, you will. I do think that the final piece of this story will be a great let down no matter how much work goes into it. This member of the sequel is better than the original club inductee is just going to be really tough to beat. I wish you luck on that one Peter."

","Coming to cinema two months later in Mainland China, the second chapter of THE HOBBIT TRILOGY is poised to prevail the box office in a rather lethargic period after the red-hot Chinese Spring Fe festival. <br/><br/>THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY (2012, 6/10) is a relentless roller-coaster ride with a slew of visual stunts to propel a succinct plot, which doesn't live up to the expectation of THE LORD OF THE RINGS' Middle Earth triumphant standing, also Peter Jackson's innovative shooting technology has received with some resistance and negative feedbacks. The second round, a 3D version is all we have in China, the palette is light-toned, the textual sharpness hasn't been refined from the first one, a tad dim and the same landscape doesn't register the same rapt effect anymore. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the film is an ameliorated update from AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, not simply because of Smaug's imposing grandeur and droll garrulousness (voiced by a malignantly intoning Cumberbatch). The plain narration bifurcates from the early start, when Gandalf (McKellen) detaches from the rest of the expedition on a solitary quest, as it often pans out, the journey without the omnipotent grey wizard galvanizes more excitement and comic relief. The action set pieces are imbued with sufficient antics in the barrel cruise, the comeback of Legolas (Bloom) and a freshly coined female elf Tauriel (Lilly) reinforces audience's modern aesthetic as a welcoming love triangle among the two and a handsome (and slightly taller-than-average) dwarf Kili (Turner) is a clever deployment to gratify a touch of romanticism and conforms with the topical love equity enthusiasm. The pulchritude of slaughtering orcs with dexterous archery can never stultify the viewers. <br/><br/>When Bilbo (Freeman) lurches into Smaug's turf to exert his burglar role, it prompts the zenith with the disparate duel between the dwarf pack and the indomitable fire-generator, it is also worth mentioning the dissonant atmosphere between Bilbo and Thorin (Armitage), is the hobbit only an expedient pawn for Thorin's stout-hearted vengeance to reclaim his kingdom, or the boundary of species can be breached through Bilbo's valorous altruism? Let's wait and see what will happen in the final venture. <br/><br/>This time, one might be able to distinguish the 13 dwarfs more easily besides Thorin, Balin (Stott), Kili and Fili (O'Gorman), Freeman is consistently indulged in his invisible vantage with the ring, while McKellen's Gandalf has some perilous path to overcome. The film is properly enlightened by several new characters, apart from Tauriel's apropos feminine touch, Bard (Evans) is the key character introduced here, and for certain his import in the finale is well hinted although we haven't seen too much potential in him yet. And it is always a delight to watch Stephen Fry, sketchily appears as the Master of Laketown, quips with his insidious underling Alfrid (Gage). <br/><br/>As a middle section of a trilogy, this film actually skirts the conundrum of being left in the epic and enmeshed background without a certain closure to end the film itself, it is both satisfied to see to a not out-and-out victory and intrigued to imagine what will happen when the dragon is released to a more spacious scale, all magnetizes its core audience to return for a third time."
"bkbirge","7","1","3","15 February 2014"," Fun, entertaining but far from a classic, wildly deviates from the source material
","Saw the high frame rate 3D version. Very entertaining. But also surprising to me because of how far it deviates from the book. Peter Jackson seemed more faithful to the source with the Lord of the Rings movies than this, this is really more like an ""inspired by"" instead of ""based on"". <br/><br/>Still fun though. I thought I'd hate the Tauriel thing but as far as subplots go it was enjoyable. Legolas looks a lot older which is a little jarring. The orc subplot was handled a lot better than in the first movie too, didn't seem quite as shoehorned. <br/><br/>I think Peter Jackson really wants to direct movies like Spartacus or The 10 Commandments, big war movies with thousands of people wearing sandals. In all this spectacle, admittedly entertaining, he seems to have lost the heart of the book."
"ccmiller1492","7","1","3","8 January 2014"," Dragons should be seen and not heard....
","Like its predecessor, this second Hobbitt film is visually stunning,tells a good tale, but is so protracted that the enchantment inevitably becomes tedium. The original LOTR trilogy was handled much better, in that the theatrical releases were mercifully edited of at least half an hour each of running time, with the protracted lengthier versions released as extended cut for those who just can't get enough and have to beat a good thing to death. Both of these films would be improved by that method, being shorn of at least a half hour each of unnecessary footage. And it could well begin with cutting much of the dragon dialog...there isn't much point in threatening to burn all the little buggers into oblivion if you're going to talk them to death first! What nonsense! All we should hear from the dragon is the pounding of his heavy footfalls and the beating of his leathery wings or scorching breath. I rather liked the character of Tauriel and the budding attraction to the dwarf she healed. Also Richard Armitage became more important, who was so wasted in Hobbit 1."
"brent_or","7","1","3","6 January 2014"," Restraint? Who Needs That?
","First of all, The Desolation of Smaug is far more watchable than An Unexpected Journey. Why? Because there is enough content (plot developments, action) to actually fill up the lengthy running time. And that is no surprise, as this installment represents the most substantive part of the source material.<br/><br/>As many others have mentioned, this is still best accurately described as ""a film inspired by the Hobbit"" than a straight adaption of the book itself. And there are still some issues that I have with it. But at least I did not feel like I had wasted my money in going to see this one.<br/><br/>The Good - The cast is almost uniformly wonderful, both old and new. Martin Freeman is perfect as Bilbo, although unfortunately he gets a bit lost in the myriad of other story lines here. Of the newcomers, Evangeline Lilly (Tauriel) and Luke Wilson (Bard) stand out to me. And Mikael Persbrandt does an excellent job with his very brief screen time as Beorn (his scene easily being one of my favorite parts of this film). The outdoor cinematography is lovely, as we've come to expect. And of course Smaug himself is, if you'll pardon my choice of words, freaking fantastic, both in appearance and voice. That is key, because this story is really all about the dragon. Or at least it should be.<br/><br/>The Not So Good - The action sequences are exercises in numbing excess. Physically unrealistic, overly long, and looking like video games due to unnecessary overuse of CGI. A bit of restraint could have made these scenes much more genuinely dramatic and realistic. The orcs, wargs and so forth are mostly CGI themselves, which just makes them look fake. There are some changes to the story that could have been done without. And I have never watched any films with more heavy-handed musical scoring than these first two Hobbit films. Occasionally, there is a moment of silence, and it is profoundly affecting because it helps build genuine suspense. They really should lay off on the grand/epic orchestral cues. Often, they come across feeling much more forced than natural.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other things that I would mention, one good and one bad. To get the bad out of the way first, the character of Azog the Defiler adds very little if any value to these films and his quest to kill Thorin just takes away from the more important other story lines going on at the same time. Add to that the fact that he is an obviously CGI creation...I would edit Azog out of this film in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>The other good thing is Evangeline Lilly's character, Tauriel. As much as I bemoan most of the changes to and additions to what is actually in the book, I love this new character. She's beautiful, brave, energetic, genuinely engaging and provides a nice counterpoint to all of the boys. Even though she is an elf, she brings a great deal of humanity to this film, as someone far more relatable than many of the other characters. Do some aspects of Tauriel strain the canon-credibility of this film? Maybe, but even as a bit of a Tolkien purist myself, I don't care. I love her.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is decent. It has lots of action, a fairly brisk pace, some humor and even romance, and a spectacular realization of the most essential single thing about this story, Smaug. This is essentially supposed to be a story about a bunch of dwarfs trying to take back a mountain from a dragon. The films have added a bunch of other plot lines, which do distract a bit, but in the case of this film in particular, it all works out fairly well. I do not think that it will stand up to repeated viewings in the same way as the best films do, but it's a great ride in the theater. (Maybe a bit frightening for younger children, at some parts.)"

Now with 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug', things are looking up for Peter Jackson and company once again. They have crafted yet another masterpiece with this second installment of 'The Hobbit.' Some would say that the introduction to a new character that doesn't appear in the books (I'll let you see for yourself) would be an unnecessary addition to the story. But in spite of all the changes the filmmakers have made, they actually serve the story well and don't seem to be as intrusive as one might think. The highlights of this film are the breathtaking production design, and the flawless special effects. The character development continues with each cast member in more depth, along with the new characters not seen in the first film.

This is the beauty of directors like Peter Jackson or James Cameron â€“ you will get immersed in their world. The desolation of Smaug is nothing less than a visual spectacle. Right from the beginning to a breath-taking end, every scene is amazingly shot. The cinematography, performance of various characters, story telling in this movie is too good.<br/><br/>The story starts from where it was left in the first part and gains pace in a short time. Gandalf again separates from the group of dwarfs, and this time he has a far more specific motive. He is the witness of the great evil which rises in front of his eyes, which later becomes the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The dwarfs, on the other hand, are foolish but heroic, always getting trapped or losing hope on many occasions, to be only saved by our tiny hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo can be called the hero of the movie in true sense, capable of making intelligent decisions like saving the dwarfs from elves by using barrels or by showing extraordinary courage, as in facing the stupendous dragon, Smaug, all alone. He saves the dwarfs from giant spiders but also gets obsessed by the ring, whose influence grows on Bilbo every time he wears it. The heroism of Legolas (Orlando Bloom) is also beautifully depicted along with Tranduil (Evangeline Lilly).<br/><br/>The movie wins heart with its visual effects. The cinematography and action sequences coupled with a good story telling bind you to the screen so that you forget the flaws of the movie and get captivated in watching it. The barrel scene through water, the city of Lake town, the birth of the dark lord Sauron and the final attempt to destroy the dragon was shown magnificently. The voice of Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug was terrific. Despite lack of story or heroism as in Lord of the Rings trilogy, the story holds you to the end. The main downside of the movie is it neither has a beginning nor has an end. It is just the middle of the hobbit and doesn't feel like an end. It leaves us wanting more, the desire to see the final chapter of the hobbit, the desire to see the end, the desire to go to There and Back Again."
"midget_man44","7","1","3","31 December 2013"," Worth seeing but only once
","This movie is just alright. It is most definitely a step up in action from the first hobbit movie but at the cost of character development. I think Jackson has added to many new concepts and therefore spending minimal time on the scenes that drove the hype for this series in the first place. This movie comes no where near the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy but is a decent addition to the ""children's movie"" hobbit series. I would recommend all Hobbit fans to at least see this movie once. But unlike the Lord of the Rings movies which I have seen countless times I will only watch this movie at most twice. I really hope Jackson can pull it together and make the third film and epic crossover to the Lord of the Rings series."
"bravesfanc","8","1","3","29 December 2013"," Got what I expected
","When I heard that ""The Hobbit"" would be split into 3 movies, my first reaction was ""how???"" Obviously, they have strayed away from the book but I honestly don't mind that at all. I enjoyed ""An Unexpected Journey"" and I enjoyed ""The Desolation of Smaug"". They are what they are, an action/fantasy movie with fight sequences, CGI, and a few parts that make you laugh. I can see why people would be disappointed, after ""The Lord of the Rings"" did so good and followed the books for almost all of it, they probably expected the same here. I don't blame those people either, ""The Hobbit"" is a great book and the perception that it's being ruined is a valid point.<br/><br/>Speaking of those action scenes, I enjoyed them thoroughly. However, on three separate occasions (yes three) elves show up to save the day. It was too repetitive for my taste.<br/><br/>I also felt that for the movie being based on the dwarfs and Bilbo Baggins, they didn't have as much screen time as I thought they would. It's not until the last 25 minutes or so that they become the main story again. Leading up is Gandalf's journey elsewhere and a love story between an elf and a dwarf.<br/><br/>But back to the last 25 or so minutes, that's when the most interesting story is on screen. The conversation between Bilbo and Smaug is great and pretty funny to say the least. The rest of the film is the dwarfs and Bilbo trying to outsmart Smaug and essentially kill him.<br/><br/>The movie also ends sort of abruptly which might turn some fans off but what do you expect when it's a 3 part movie? It will probably disappoint the hardcore fans of the book but for a movie fan like myself, I had a good time and am looking forward to the third and final installment."
"billsoccer","8","1","3","28 December 2013"," Not Tolkien, but not bad either
","Very entertaining, but be aware that this is a new Hobbit adventure - not the of the book by that name. That aside, it is a very entertaining movie. Richly animated, you can't tell - most of the time - where the real actors stop and the animation begins. It's the story that will grab you - most of the characters are from the Tolkien stories and the new ones are a welcome addition. I feel Tolkien would approve and even recommend it to those sticklers for adherence to the original. There's Bilbo - the original Hobbbit of course, Gandalf and Smaug - the original dragon, elves, dwarfs, and Orcs galore. One only wonders how the director - Peter Jackson - will end this story, which leads me to my one disappointment - the abrupt and inconclusive ending. We've been set up for a 2 (or more?) part movie, so you'll need to steel ourselves for waiting another year and parting with more $ in order to find out!"
"galzaga","7","1","3","27 December 2013"," a Big disrespect
","The movie es very good and well done. Some parts of it seems to be a copy of the game the elder scrolls V (Skyrim) and I liked that very much but, a big big BUT, I consider a huge disrespect to the audience the way the movie ended. Most of the effects are well done although some others, look like primitive blue screen ones, but this ones are the few.The storyline is interesting and keep you hooked to the film. Some few bad effects, the horrible end... Thats why I gave the movie a 7 instead of 9 or 10. To the director: remember the next time you make a movie that this is CINEMA, not a TV miniseries. The end was CRAP, disrespecting, disappointing. I ended with a feeling of hanger instead of satisfaction."
"JohnnyKong","Null","1","3","23 December 2013"," Becoming invisible and big flying eagles
","Maybe some of you out there who have read the books can explain this to me.<br/><br/>In the first Hobbit movie, there's a scene where the company is cornered at the edge of a cliff, so Gandalf finds this butterfly and it flies away and next thing you know, a bunch of eagles come save the day. Not only that, they fly them even closer to their destination so they don't have to walk their helpless selves over dangerous terrain.<br/><br/>All I could think of from thereon is: why not just take the eagle express to Erebor?? If there is some explanation in the book that might explain why the safest (or safer) and quicker option isn't taken, I'd like to hear it.<br/><br/>Other thing is when Bilbo is up in the dragon's lair trying to get the white stone, why not just use the awesome invisible ring to walk away with it when he sees it? I mean, it's gotten his ass out of dire situations a whole bunch of times, and when he's now faced with a fire-breathing gigantic dragon, he first wakes the dragon, then uses the ring just to hide away, and then takes it off the rest of the time. Am I missing something or do some things just neglect logic in this story??"
"raojahanzaibsaeed","9","1","3","22 December 2013"," Invites the comparison with LOTR installment
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, despite what the critics say, is a must watch for all the Tolkien and Fantasy lovers out there. This second installment in Hobbit trilogy is a great come back from its previous installment and ensures that the viewers are entertained to their maximum. Inclusion of the character of Tauriel (played by Evangeline Lily) is a tremendous effort to twist the plot which is not included in the book itself. It is a movie if you are looking to be extremely amused and satisfied and that may become one of your great cinema experiences, at least for me. The way Peter Jackson portrayed the adventures of The Hobbit are just matchless and exactly or even more that what'd you imagine while reading the book."
"themissingpatient","7","1","3","22 December 2013"," Better, Darker & Longer
","After finding shelter with a shape-shifter named Beorn, Thorin and company must pass through the much feared Mirkwood Forest without Gandalf. Meanwhile, Bilbo begins to use The Ring to protect himself and help his new found friends.<br/><br/>This second installment of The Hobbit starts off much stronger than the first. It's darker, the special effects are better and the story is actually interesting. The bright, cartoon-look is gone, for the most part, and the action sequences are perfectly composed.<br/><br/>The first film, An Unexpected Journey, was stretched out 80 minutes too long and it's bright, 48fps high-definition made it obvious these great actors were on a sound-stage, surrounded by green-screen filled in with CGI. What it did was it delivered a great ending, promising a non-stop action thrill-ride of a sequel. However Peter Jackson and company went too far and too long, again. Too much attention is spent focusing in on side plots of possible romance and characters we are never given much reason to care for. The darker visuals help to keep the dramatic moments from becoming as cheesy as a made-for-TV sci-fi/fantasy movie but this time, the acting from the new supporting cast doesn't.<br/><br/>The Desolation Of Smaug will be as good as we're going to get out of this Hobbit trilogy. It proves 2 films would have been more than enough for the film adaptation of the book. As for the ending, it's enough to make you want to throw things at the screen and boycott the third film."
"mgruebel","6","1","3","21 December 2013"," Jackson is warming up in part II
","In my review of part I, I noted that ""there is a great film within this film."" This is still true for part II, but the great film is closer to the surface here. Less cutting is needed.<br/><br/>If one accepts the film on its own terms (and viewers generally do, no matter how great the book it is based on), there are many pluses: the story moves further in less screen time; more attention is paid to some of the characters; it presents a grander view of the events surrounding Sauron's re-emergence than Tolkien's marvelous book.<br/><br/>In that regard, there are many worthwhile additions, such as Gandalf's investigation of Dol Guldur, or bringing out elves as characters (they are entirely nondescript in the book until the very end). In a wise scripting decision, Bilbo understands the language of the Mirkwood spiders only when he puts on the Ring. All this makes the film a better fit with the LOTR trilogy.<br/><br/>There are also many bad decisions: 1) Diminishing Bilbo's character by not having him perform the heroic rescues as in the book. The whole idea of The Hobbit (and LotR) is that the common soldier, who does not even show up as a footprint in history, IS in reality the history. 2) The silly romance between elf Tauriel and dwarf Kili culminates in an incredibly sappy healing scene, where Evangeline Lilly is forced to stare vacantly while glowing, a real cringe-moment. This worked with Arwen and Aragorn, but Tauriel, you are no Arwen, and Kili, you are no Aragorn. Fortunately, it could be fixed by cutting 5 minutes from the ""Director's special shortened edition"" while enhancing the Tauriel character, who together with Legolas and Thranduil puts some meat on the elves. 3) The whole liquid gold thing should have been cut when Jackson saw what the CGI looked like. 4) As in the previous installment, some action is so unnecessary, and so implausible physically, that it ruins the moment; like someone dashing across a river on the heads of randomly floating people; or someone floating in a metal bucket on molten metal without getting baked to a crisp. And so forth. 5) Most annoyingly, the screenwriters again weaken Tolkien's brilliant characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension. LOTR was guilty many times over, for instance when King Theoden is a wimp who hides in a burg waiting for disaster, instead of the decisive leader who recognizes quickly that Gondor must be helped; or the indecisiveness of the Ents to give Merry something to do, even though in the book they are slow, but not indecisive. And let's not even start with Frodo. Here Bard is turned into a smuggler for hire; Thranduil tries to cut a bargain with Thorin; elves SNORE (sacrilege!); the wizard wavers, instead of following his plans 100s of years in the making. And I already mentioned Bilbo as point number 1)..<br/><br/>Yet the scenery is brilliantly imagined as always, the acting ranges from solid to very good, the story moves along nicely, so the nearly 3 hours pass quickly, and from a bird's eye perspective, no major deviations from the book are made, not worse than in the LOTR movies at any rate. The worst is a should-be-dead Azog bossing his should-be-son Bolg around. And of course that awful liquid gold.<br/><br/>One gets the feeling that Jackson is at his most brilliant when he has little budget and time (Heavenly Creatures, Dead Alive), or is not yet recognized by Hollywood (LOTR), but overdoes it when given too much money (King Kong or here). Still, Jackson overdoing it is better than most fantasy film making. But alas, what could have been!"
"s-linder","Null","1","3","20 December 2013"," The Hobbit
","The movie added a lot to the book. In the book we don't know what Gandalf was doing while he left the dwarfs, but in the movie we see that he met Sauron, the necromancer. In the book are quiet no women, but in the movie is a love story between a dwarf and an elf woman. What we can't see in the movie is, that Bilbo went several times in the hall to steal something from the dragon Smaug and how Bilbo tricked the spiders with his song to free the dwarfs.<br/><br/>I really liked in the movie the little love story and the escape with the barrels and how they fought against the goblins in their barrels. The first meeting from Smaug and Bilbo was also better in the movie than in the book. But I was really pleased that I had read the book before I watched the movie, because in the book the important plot is better shown and there aren't so many switches from Gandalf to the dwarfs and back.<br/><br/>I found it still a good adaption to the book, because it is always funny to how the creatures look like and how their characters really are. Bard for example was for me in the book a very nice and likable human being, but in the movie I didn't like him so much, because he wasn't so friendly to the dwarfs. The movie filled a bit the gaps, which I had in the book.<br/><br/>I would (or already had) recommend the movie to my friends and family members, because the movie is well done and it was interesting and funny to watch the Hobbit. But I would also say, that reading the book first would be better. Julia F."
"manojjiban2000","10","2","10","18 December 2013"," A treat for the FANS
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues to impress the fans of JRR Tolkien's favorite books. The way Peter Jackson depicts these into amazing reality with excellent CGI and Casts are amazing.. He has given us a great Trilogy with the LORD OF THE RINGS and still continues to amaze us with the Prequel trilogy hobbit. The craziness of the dwarfs, the wrath of the orcs, the combat of the elves, the magic of the wizard Gandalf and the adventures of the hobbit Bilbo baggins never ceases in this film. To add more the depiction of the dark lord Sauron is pretty well portrayed in this film and shows us that the ring has awoken his masters arrival. The last one hour was really entertaining and stunning with the best CGI creation of the dragon SMAUG his pride and strength really gets us on the edge. Overall another great film for the fans.. I'll give it an 9.5/10"
"gunnerdd","10","2","10","14 December 2013"," Absolute Stunning
","I have never rated a movie online before, but my son (age 9) and I felt we HAD to share our feelings. The movie is non-stop action and has many layers to it (not just the quest) and the actors do a good job of making it seem real! I will be seeing it again, next time in 3D! My son says ""it has a lot of action and can be scary (thrilling) in some spots"". <br/><br/>We spent the whole ride home (30+ minutes) just going crazy about the scenes, the realness of the dragon and the heart pounding, non-stop fun!<br/><br/>It also opens up a look at the past and tells a bit about the story of how this all came about."
"Ed_D17","9","2","11","18 December 2013"," Exciting, Fast-Paced, Hilarious and Genius. Oh, and a dragon.
","It's now apparent that, back in ""An Unexpected Journey"", when Bilbo proclaimed that he was ""going on an adventure"", he was referring to the second instalment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" because that's what the film is. An adventure. A genius, fast- paced, hilarious and breath-taking adventure. <br/><br/>""Haters gonna hate"", as they say, which is what a lot of people were indeed doing upon the realisation that ""Desolation"" would be straying further from the source text. But those haters simply have to accept that Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"" is not blockbuster material, not by a long shot. If another trilogy, or even a single other film, was to be made based upon Middle Earth, it had to include lots of other material, both Tolkien and 'Jackson'. A film could hardly be made on the Appendices, after all, so this was a chance to cram as much Tolkien (and other) goodness into the trilogy. If you want the next instalment in Tolkien's quaint bedtime story, then don't bother. If, however, you're looking for a thrilling, fantasy adventure movie that uses Tolkien's wonderful world and creatures then you're certainly in for a treat.<br/><br/>The pace is much improved on ""An Unexpected Journey"", with the audience being thrown almost immediately into the action. Said action is frequent and the gaps in between are filled with enough stunning vistas and excellently scripted dialogue to keep the film ticking over at a good pace. The fighting scenes are brilliantly choreographed, with fantastic displays of elven dexterity and brutality that will amaze you, then, when you think you've seen the peak, amaze you again. It's tons of fun, exciting and hilarious in parts. The two most anticipated scenes of the film, the barrel sequence and Smaug himself, are not in the slightest disappointing, with the former being one of the funniest, exciting and unique scenes you'll have seen for a long time and the second boasting some spectacular effects and cinematography. Smaug is, quite simply, absolutely brilliant to behold and the events that take place within Erebor itself are the thrilling highlight to an already thrilling film. <br/><br/>The acting, once again, is more than up to scratch. Marin Freeman is once again brilliant as the quirky but brave Bilbo Baggins and the new additions to the cast putting in excellent performances, with special mentions to Orlando Bloom as Legolas, who embodies everything we loved about Legolas in the original ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy; Luke Evans as Bard who, despite some concerns about his age, appearance and 'Bloom- ness' makes us fall in love with his character very quickly and, finally, Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug. Smaug not only impresses visually but exudes character and personality, something very few monsters in films have, which makes him all the more entertaining. Once again, all the other people who played a part in making this film, as with the other 'Middle Earth' films have done a brilliant job. The authenticity and effect of several scenes and locations is greatly aided by the design and the props, whilst Howard Shore has once again provided a brilliant soundtrack and Ed Sheeran's ""I See Fire"", which plays first during the credits, adds another level of emotion to your already overloaded brain as you walk out of the cinema.<br/><br/>""The Desolation of Smaug"" only really falls down on a few points, most of which can be attributed to 'middle-film syndrome'. Many elements of the story feel like they are incomplete and not dealt with enough, that they are lacking in a certain something, be it detail, depth or resolution. To give examples would be to give spoilers, but there are some obvious instances. Finally, the love triangle, included by order of the studio in pick-up shooting (so not a fault of Jackson's, it is worth pointing out), really does not add anything to the film. It's unnecessary, awkward and, if anything, just gives the devout Tolkien fans more ammunition. Here's hoping it too is a victim of 'middle-film syndrome' and will become more valuable in the third instalment.<br/><br/>And, before I wrap up, it's worth mentioning the possibility of seeing this film in 3D, and the fact that you should most definitely do so. Too often do films use 3D to increase their box office takings but it's nice to see a film, such as this one, which uses 3D to augment its already impressive visual effects and action scenes. The vistas look that much more impressive and the variety of objects that fly off the screen towards you - from arrows to rubble to severed orc heads - is just fantastic. <br/><br/>In conclusion, while ""The Desolation of Smaug"" has some noticeable faults, and lacks the sheer impact of the original ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy you must consider that one watches film as a means of entertainment and there are very few films that entertain as much as this one, with its fast-paced action, humour, charm and aesthetics. I'm not the first to use this pun (and won't be the last), but it is quite simply barrels of fun. Whilst it's not a masterpiece, and hence my brain is telling me to mark it down a star or two accordingly, I have to go with my heart and give this thrilling ride the full ten stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>Ed</li></ul>"
"jackasstrange","8","2","11","14 December 2013"," Great story, great visuals, great music... A masterpiece.
","This is just one of the most beautiful and greatest films ever made. No room for discussion here. If you really like films you'll love The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug. And it's not a matter of taste. When a film is that good, it does no matter if you are fan of horror, comedy, action or drama, even because The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug have it all. So you'll automatically like it. An insanely entertaining film for anyone.<br/><br/>And unlike the 'tongue in the cheek' first installment of the Hobbit's trilogy, Desolation of Smaug is a much better and serious film. It don't have anymore the unfunny and idiots pointless jokes. It's a serious film, just like it should be. And that time it has a much more thrilling atmosphere and also insane action scenes!<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent as usual, and the action scenes are just unbelievably mesmerizing and entertaining. Insane! And the music in the ending credits was aces! A perfect soft and delicate score to contrast with the great and abrupt climax. The plot obviously is top-notch! The main story works extremely well as an allegory to the World War II(Dwarfs are the Jews and Orcs are the Nazis; think about that). Tolkien was a master, no wonder his book 'Hobbit' is the best fantasy work ever written.<br/><br/>I only had a minor complaint. It's about the CGI used in the orcs, that is a bit outdated. The rest, top notch. Guaranteed, the ending will left you with a feeling of 'wanna more'!<br/><br/>The definition of an Epic Film. Go watch it. Can't wait for the last epic chapter of that magnificent trilogy. 9.6/10"
"FairlyAnonymous","7","2","11","13 December 2013"," Starting to learn some things here...
","I will not lie, the fanboy in me is probably what is keeping this review at the height that it is. Did I enjoy the movie? Yes. Did I like the last 10 minutes? No. They were hell. That is probably the biggest problem I have with this movie is the ending or ""super cliff hanger"".<br/><br/>Maybe I should take a step back and start at the beginning. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was disappointing for me because I had such high expectations. I really wanted to like it, but the overabundance of CGI really made me mad (especially since not all of it looked good). So when I walked into The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, I kind of knew what I was getting into. NOT Lord of the Rings which used a lot of practical special effects that are timeless, not a gripping character focused story, and not as serious or subtle. With my new standards I was able to enjoy The Desolation of Smaug much more than the first movie, but that doesn't mean there still aren't things to complain about.<br/><br/>I just want to mention that most of this movie is really good. The action is good with the spiders, Smaug is incredibly intimidating, the elves are still cool, and much of the pacing is a lot better. All in all, this movie is set up much better than the first... to a certain extent. I was never bored during this movie (until the last 10 minutes) which means that it is good for entertainment and considerably better than the first. The voice-acting from Benedict was good and he is definitely fit for Smaug, Martin Freeman does an excellent job again, and all of the dwarfs are still enjoyable. The humour is toned down a little bit in this movie, but it still has few over the top comedic scenarios. However, it does suffer from a few of the same problems as the first movie.<br/><br/>1. CGI Orcs: This was not needed in the first movie and it was not needed in this movie. I know that CGI orcs are definitely needed for complicated shots, but they aren't needed for the majority of shots. Thankfully, this movie has less CGI orcs than the last movie. There are a lot more actors playing orcs and overall this movie has a lot more standard special effects instead of CGI. So it is an improvement over the first, but still it seemed unnecessary. <br/><br/>2. CGI Gold: This is what this movie will be infamous for. The final action sequence was beyond (I hate to say this) lame. It made absolutely no sense and it involves a lot of liquid gold. Now I understand they were trying to make a realistic liquid gold by giving it a different viscosity, but it was still very distracting and it didn't make sense that the characters were able to float on it without being burned up alive (gold has an incredibly high melting point). <br/><br/>3. Cliff-Hanger: This movie has a dreadful cliff-hanger. Worse than Dead Man's Chest. Be warned.<br/><br/>4. Credit Sequence: This is a nitpick, but The Lord of the Rings was a respectful series because it had universally good music. The music was classical and classical music is timeless. However, this movie had some pretty generic guitar/credit music which immediately killed the mood for me (which was also killed by the last action sequence and cliff-hanger). The music is so off that it doesn't make the credits really watchable. The Lord of the Rings was one of the only movie series where I watched all of the credits because I was so engrossed in the soundtrack. Not here.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hobbit series seems to be a learning experience for me and many others. A movie can have a lot of good elements, but it can be torn apart by nitpicks and preferences. Everybody wants the same style as Lord of the Rings, but this style is greatly different. The movie attempts to be too flashy and showy to match its changing mood. One minute it feels like Lord of the Rings and then the next minute it feels like I'm watch Looney Tunes. The movie is never consistent with itself which is annoying because it is largely good, but these small things form a ""specter"" that hovers over the film the entire time. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the majority of the film, but the ending was really bad. The Hobbit series will probably be incredibly enjoyable when watched in one sitting, but as an individual movie they don't work. There isn't enough plot in this movie and a lot of it is stretched out to make its running time. I'm sure it will be great when all come out on extended editions, but for now they are awkward on their own.<br/><br/>Anywhere from a 6.5-8"
"audunystgaard","10","1","4","29 July 2018"," 9/10 for filmmaking and performance, but not when it comes to adaption.
","I agree that this film didn't follow the Tolkien recipe, and many Tolkien-fans will be incredibly upset that what they read as a child didn't come to life in the cinema, but if people would throw away the fact that this is an adaption from The Hobbit, they would see that Peter Jackson still knows how to create movies. It was an overall exciting movie to watch.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I had with the movie was the sheer amount of CGI. They knew that CGI would be way harder to make realistic with 48fps on the camera, but they still crammed a bunch of it into the film anyways. The Lord of the Rings managed to create absolutely astonishing shots of orcs by simply using makeup and practical effects. They just didn't at all look scary to me in this film. Still, I have to say that the dragon is some of the best CGI work I've seen in my entire life."

"ericrnolan","8","1","4","29 July 2015"," A beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie.
","I felt the same way about ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013) as I did about its predecessor — it's a beautifully rendered, immersive fantasy that still falls short of being a truly great movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>The special effects are downright beautiful. We've got a fantastic dragon to behold. The acting is roundly terrific too. I can only imagine it must be harder for a professional actor to portray a hobbit, dwarf, elf, or wizard, with their stylized language and fantastical quirks. Yet every member of the cast was either good or great. The obvious standouts are Sir Ian McKlellan as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Ken Stott as Balin was also quite good.<br/><br/>Yet the monsters and action were sometimes so cartoonish that they really challenged an adult viewer's willing suspension of disbelief. The battle sequence involving the barrels, for example, seemed like something out of a Warner Brothers cartoon.<br/><br/>I also noticed a couple of other things. This is my fifth of Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies that I've watched, and I am beginning to understand the viewer contention that these film's story structures consist of a lot of ""walking and fighting.""<br/><br/>The most interesting story element, for me, was Bilbo's use of The Ring as his secret weapon — all the while concealing its magic from his comrades and first gaining the psychic attention of Sauron. We also see hints that he may develop his own slavish devotion to The Ring, spookily suggested when he brutally attacks the giant spider assailants who might jeopardize his possession of it. The Ring's subplot (and the way it sets up ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) engaged me more than anything else. Throughout all the films, it's a fantastic story device, and well suited for a fantasy context. The Ring could be a metaphor for greed, love of power, possessive love, or even drug addiction. It adds so much depth to the Lord of the Rings universe, and goes far beyond a story of little good guys fighting big bad guys. To me, The Ring and Bilbo were far more entertaining than traveling dwarfs greeting or fighting characters throughout Middle Earth.<br/><br/>There may have been pacing problems; this felt slow. I got the sense that too much time was spent establishing Lake-town and its (fairly boring) residents, although it was great seeing the immeasurably talented Stephen Fry's surprise turn as its ""Master."" Too much dialogue is devoted to things like arguing with elves, negotiating boat rides, and penetrating a magic door. (And I'm still not sure how the ""last light of  day"" translates into an Autumn moon.)<br/><br/>This was a good movie, even for someone who isn't a fan of the source material. Given its length and its slower pacing, however, I may not feel the need to see the third film right away."

","The Hobbit trilogy is a great movie trilogy the second one; The Desolation of Smaug is the best. An Unexpected Journey has an OK story the first 30 mins is uninteresting as the dwarfs come into Bilbo's house and eat all of his food. The Desolation of Smaug has many battle scenes. Smaug the dragon guards the hall that is full of gold and jewels, the dwarfs and Bilbo venture to the lonely mountain which is the dwarf's home, which Smaug took by force many years ago. In the final scene of the movie, the dwarfs let Smaug escape, he flies over to Lake Town which is the city that helped them reach the mountain. He states ""My teeth are swords. My claws are spears. My wings are a HURRICANE! I am fire, I am death."" And you see Smaug head for Lake Town prepared to burn it. Bilbo dramatically closes the movie with ""What have we done."" The end of the movie should have been when Bard (Luke Evans from Fast and Furious 6) shoots down the beast with a black arrow, but they keep that for the next movie."

"donhuang59","8","1","4","12 April 2014"," great movie even with the changes made to the story
","This movie is pretty awesome! Aside from some of the casting, and the rushed beginning of the movie, Peter Jackson delivers an action packed movie, filled with orcs, dragons, elves and spiders. Now, I usually like for a movie to keep pretty in line with the source material but most of the changes that Peter Jackson made to the story are more than acceptable to me. He has changed parts of the story to fit in with the previously made LOTR movies' storyline. However, being a huge Tolkien fan myself, I have read the books many times and there are a couple of things that I wish he had done a little better(mainly Beorn). Legolas is a welcomed return and we are introduced to the Woodland realm, home of the Silvan elves. We are also introduced to the the Woodland King, Thranduil, who is also Legolas' father and imo one of the baddest characters in the Tolkien universe. <br/><br/>With the changes to the story that he made, I thought that the overall casting for this movie was done very well. Benedict Cumberbash's voice is amazing for Smaug, and Luke Evans was cast well to play Jackson's version of Bard the Bowman. However, the one casting choice I didn't like was his casting for Beorn. Beorn, played by Mikael Persbrandt, for those who don't know, is a near giant man who can change into a giant bear. Now I get that with changes to a story, there will be changes to characters but this character's role is largely unchanged in Jackson's version of the story. Beorn's appearance is totally different from his description in the story only keeping the fact that he is tall and has a beard. Instead of a large man with great arms and black hair and as described in the book, he's a tall and lanky man with brown hair and with a face that resembles a comically bad lion. Orlando Bloom returns as Legolas, who many remember from the original LOTR movies and there's a new female elf, Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson does an amazing job with the visuals. Middle Earth is stunningly beautiful. From the Misty Mountains, to the Lonely Mountain, the environments that take place in this movie are amazing. Each different area shown in the movie has a different feel to them giving them depth. The fortress of Dol Guldur is spooky and ominous, surrounded by dead trees and littered with broken stones, whereas the great forest of Mirkwood captures the stuffiness and claustrophobic atmosphere described in the book. The CG is done well, with the many of the orcs being completely CG. But the best part of the visuals is the dragon, Smaug. Smaug is in my opinion perfectly done. His cruelty and malevolence is perfectly captured in his appearance on the screen. His eyes, his teeth and his great stature is expertly done. There is really only word to describe Smaug in this movie; ""badass"".<br/><br/>Now aside from the casting and visual portrayal of Beorn, my only other real complaint about this movie is that the first 20 minutes of this film is rushed. Bilbo and company gets hurried along into Mirkwood glazing over the introduction and story development of Beorn's character. In fact, the movie only feels like it begins after the 20 minute mark when they enter the forest. Everything after this however, is more or less done very well. Once the company enters Mirkwood, the pacing slows down a bit and the movie really begins. You meet the fellow elves of Legolas and development of the story and character begin. The pacing goes from slow to action keeping the movie exciting. <br/><br/>Overall the story is done pretty well. Peter Jackson does a good job keeping to his movies' continuity making sure his version of the story fits with his previous movies. At the same time, he makes sure to keep the most important aspects from the books in his movies, packing it full of action and events to keep even the best Tolkien fans happy and excited."

","After seeing the first Hobbit I had no real interest in seeing anymore. But after a boring night and an offer of a £1.50 rent I thought I'd give the sequel a go, and to be honest I was pleasantly surprised. It's still a way of the depth and quality that the lord of rings offers but it's definitely a step in the right direction for the hobbit trilogy. There were aspects of the film I didn't quite get, for example the love interest between two of the characters seemed a bit out of place and irrelevant. There were also some more really long scenes of the dwarfs on roller coasters but I guess that was expected after the first film. What I did enjoy was the sub-plot of Gandalf and do Gilda. This was an area of the story I felt should've been given more screen time as it's a story that's not really covered by any of Tolkiens work so its left open for some embellishment and creativity. I felt it provided more depth and brought about a slightly darker feel from we had previously seen in the hobbit. All in all I did enjoy the film, but I am still disappointed that Peter Jackson and co went down the route of children's fantasy for the hobbit trilogy, leaving the more mature feel behind in lord of the rings; as I feel if the entirety of the two films were filmed to the standard of the Gollum or Mag scenes, we would've all been blown away. The characters are there, the story is there, the middle earth lore is there, but the execution isn't quite. Less CGI, more character development, less over the top far fetched deaths of orcs, more feasibility and maturity and this film would've been great. 7/10"

","In my opinion this one of the best movies of 2013. The film is a bit long, but that is not a problem because the film has a very nice storyline. I recommend everybody to watch it at the movie theater. And if not, it is certainly worth to buy the DVD, because it is such a fantastic movie. It is such a great movie because the environment where the story takes place is so detailed that it is like u are also in the film. What's also good about the movie is that the costumes are also realistic and they really fit in the film. But sometimes, it is like the film is a game and the graphics aren't that good and detailed. But apart from this is a really good movie. There are also some great close ups and some well filmed followings. The film goes about 14 dwarfs who get the help from a hobbit and wizard named Bilbo and Gandalf. They go on a quest, in which they need to reclaim their homeland by finding the Arkenstone. On their quest they meet some elves named Legolas and Tauriel, who will help them fight the orks. As a matter of fact they needed their help to get to the lonely mountain where the dragon (Smaug) guards 'his' treasure. The gold and other valuable things, which the grand-father of Thorin, the king under the mountain, has gathered in his greed. They also meet Gandalf, who gives them directions but he doesn't go with them to the lonely mountain. Gandalf searches for the necromancer, who is hiding in Dol Guldur to regain his strength. When they reached the lonely mountain, there was a moment when they thought their quest was all for nothing. Though Bilbo finds the solution and they found the entrance to the mountain, because he was patient. Finally got into the mountain it was now time for Bilbo to do what was asked of him, finding the Arkenstone. In spite of all his effort, he wasn't able to get the Arkenstone because Smaug, the great dragon, woke up and tried to kill them. And if you want to know the rest of the movie, you will have to see the movie. The leading actors are Legolas played by Orlando Bloom, Tauriel played by Evangeline Lilly, Thorin by Richard Armitage and Bilbo by Martin Freeman. The movie is directed by Peter Jackson."

","I didn't like the ending because it didn't have one, and I have mixed feelings about the fact that Peter Jackson took so many liberties adding stuff to the script. I'll write the rest of this paragraph as a hard core fan. Skip to the next one if you don't care about this. The true Tolkien-written extra features that only we know about, like the Dol Guldur story, were awesome. However, the made up, Hollywood-PG13- pleasing, radical changes to the plot; like the stupid, impossible love triangle, the added characters like Tauriel and the new not-so-scary- nor-relevant-to-the-plot bad guy, the decision to leave half of the Dwarfs in Esgaroth and the whole Dwarfs vs. Smaug scene; all made me do a double face palm so many times I grew tired of it. And let's not talk about the ""too much"" action sequences. <br/><br/>OK, back to normal mode. Other than that, the movie was very entertaining. Suspense is very well handled (I jumped from my seat twice). The Dragon is scarier than I ever imagined. Bilbo's transformation is crystal clear, especially when he faces Smaug. That was the best scene for me. Everything else was a preamble for this great moment. It surely didn't disappoint and was true to the book. The special effects are great. It doesn't feel like eternity at all. Too bad about the cliffhanger ending, but it leaves us on the edge of our seats until the conclusion of the story, There And Back Again, comes out; promising to be epic."
"JamesHitchcock","8","1","4","15 January 2014"," Loosely based upon characters created by J. R. R. Tolkien
","Another year, another Tolkien-inspired Peter Jackson film. <br/><br/>""The Desolation of Smaug"" is, ostensibly, the second instalment of Jackson's three-part adaptation of ""The Hobbit"", although it contains so much material not found in the original, especially the romance between the dwarf Kili and the elf-maiden Tauriel, that it might be better described as an original epic fantasy adventure film loosely based upon characters created by J. R. R. Tolkien. I leave to others the task of enumerating the ways in which the plot of the film differs from that of the novel. The main story describes how the hobbit Bilbo Baggins continues his quest with the thirteen Dwarfs to reclaim the Dwarfs' lost kingdom of Eribor and its treasure which have been stolen by the dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>I set out my arguments against turning ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy when I reviewed the first part, ""An Unexpected Journey"", and need not repeat them all here. Suffice it to say that, as ""The Hobbit"" is a very different type of book to ""The Lord of the Rings"", much shorter and lighter in tone, it seemed inappropriate for Jackson to give it the same epic treatment as he had lavished on his first trilogy. <br/><br/>That said, I actually enjoyed ""The Desolation of Smaug"" more than its predecessor, and there is a lot to enjoy. The Kili/Tauriel subplot is a bit of an unnecessary distraction, but Jackson is able to generate a lot of excitement from his main story with some cracking action scenes. The best come at the end when Bilbo finally comes face to face with Smaug, perhaps the most impressive cinematic dragon of recent years. (Much better than anything in, say, ""Eragon""). I was also impressed by Jackson's elaborate realisation of Lake-Town, a sort of carved wooden Northern European version of Venice. <br/><br/>On the acting side I am warming to Martin Freeman's Bilbo and Richard Armitage's increasingly autocratic Thorin Oakenshield. Ian McKellen is as reliable as ever as Gandalf, and there is a good came from Stephen Fry as the Master of Lake-Town, played as a pompous, self-satisfied aristocrat. Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug gives the dragon a personality of his own, making him more than just an impressive piece of CGI.<br/><br/>""The Desolation of Smaug"" might not be authentic Tolkien, and it does not approach the standard Jackson set with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It is, however, an entertaining piece of fantasy film-making, and did enough to make me want to come back and see the third instalment, ""There and Back Again"" when it comes out at the end of this year. 8/10"
"adeneris","5","1","4","4 January 2014"," What happened??????
","I absolutely LOVE the Lord of the Rings movies and up until now I thought Peter Jackson was a very good director. At least he was in the Lord of the Rings. In this movie, I don't know what happened to Peter Jackson's directing skills. This movie should be inspired by Tolkien's book instead of based on it. The movie follows the book's timeline pretty well, until they get captured by the elves, then it all kind of starts to fall apart. I love Legolas and I was really excited when I heard he was going to be in The Hobbit, but I thought he was just going to make an appearance in Mirkwood and then be done. I did not know they were going to add the stupid female elf and make her fall in love with Kili which is totally not in keeping with Tolkien's world. They spent way too much time with Laketown's made up political problems and such. They made Bard more like an untrustworthy criminal and then when they leave Laketown they leave Kili, Fili and two others behind! Then, when they reach the mountain, the moonlight is the last light of Durin's Day instead of the sunlight. I will say well done on the dragon. He was pretty awesome. The dragon sequence was good until the rest of the dwarfs came in and started playing ""Ha ha! You can't catch me!"" games with the dragon. I was so confused during the entire time they were fighting the dragon. For one thing, the dwarfs aren't even supposed to be in there, and then they're building all this stuff to try and trap him in gold??? I will close with saying that the part where Tauriel heals Kili was kind of where I lost hope with the film. It was just so not in keeping with the book. However, I loved it when Legolas was on screen because he's gorgeous, though I still wish he would have just made an appearance. All in all, I'll say good movie unless you've read the book."
"A_Voice","7","1","4","4 January 2014"," Better as a standalone film.
","Many have rightly criticized the new Hobbit series as not staying true to the book. Where The Lord of the Rings trilogy excelled in its powerful and 'close to the source' narration, rather a visualization of the book with minute changes for the greater good, this Hobbit series is reduced to a plagiarized version of the children's novel. But critics and fans in general tend to ignore the fact that this is Jakson's Hobbit and not Tolkien's Hobbit. Thus one it is better to watch this film free from expectations and clearing yourself off the book.<br/><br/>The story continues with Bilbo's actual role defined and the companies descend to Mirkwood. After escaping there they manage to reach the mountain and face the Dragon.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier and many critics before me, there are many deviations from the book. Like the introduction of Legolas and Tauriel, The company facing off the Dragon and continuation of Azog. Where introduction of an intelligent Orc, Azog was hard to except it was nice to see Legolas and Tauriel, as it provides further character development to a previously highly developed character of Legolas, whereas Tauriel seemed unnecessary but acceptable, as one might interpret Tauriel's acceptance of a Dwarf was a consideration factor for further Legolas's acceptation of Gimili. Gandalf facing Sauron isn't actually an addition by Jackson, it did happen but behind the scenes, it was good to see it incorporated in the movie. Also I feel for some one new to middle earth, if they start watching the franchise in its actual chronological order, he will actually enjoy the LotR more.<br/><br/>However, the sequence of the company facing the Dragon is simply destruction of continuity, done only for the purpose of showing the enthralling visual effects and the best ever movie dragon. Battling the dragon, totally destroys the purpose of appointment of Bilbo to the company, and the journey as a whole. Even if this movie wasn't based on a book that scene seems totally illogical and forced.<br/><br/>The film provides a spectacular visual journey and probably the best made for movies dragon, which certainly will be remembered for long. The film has some good action scenes, well choreographed and flawless. Whereas, the film seems elongated all of the same. It could have been cut about 20 minutes easily. Simultaneously few scenes seemed rushed. What was missing was the character development, which was almost negligible. But fast paced adventure and action sequences make up for it. Excellent cinematography and sound design. Set decoration and production design are top notch as always. Makeup artists however seemed a little lackluster. Good costumes.<br/><br/>Direction: Good. Strong enough to keep the viewer thrilled and and hungry.<br/><br/>Screenplay/Story: If you compare it to the book, it's a let down, as a standalone venture it is just above average, as it is more of action driven than character driven.<br/><br/>Acting: Martin Freeman is good, but there ain't much of him. Rest of the cast is average.<br/><br/>Music: Average. Not as good as the previous ventures.<br/><br/>Overall, if you rate it according to the book, I'd give a 6/10. But, as a standalone venture its a generous 9/10."
"katherinecmcmanus-881-430673","7","1","4","27 December 2013"," 'Desolation of Smaug' promises a thrill ride that will not disappoint fans worldwide... mostly.
","Long gone is the comfortable hobbit hole at Bagend, and long gone is the Bilbo Baggins that initially passed out cold when reading ""incineration"" as a cause of death on a ""burglar"" contract given to him by a company of rowdy dwarfs. Desolation of Smaug picks up where its slow predecessor left off - right after Bilbo discovers the Ring, and right before Thorin and company reach Erebor, the land of their forefathers.The Desolation of Smaug has been long anticipated by many this year and, in many regards, it did not disappoint fans worldwide. Yet, despite its domination in the box office, thrilling premise and great reviews, The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug brought to light several aspects of The Hobbit franchise that remain lacking - and rather disappointing for die-hard Lord of the Rings fans, such as myself.<br/><br/>Once again, Peter Jackson masters the creation of Middle Earth - he and his team masterfully crafted every aspect of the Middle Earth that Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fans love most. The music was absolutely perfect, and the cinematography was captivating, as always - those sweeping wide shots and intimate close-ups with our favorite characters are what make the franchise what it is. As the story picks up, it grows steadily darker - much like The Lord of the Rings franchise (from The Fellowship of the Ring all the way to Return of the King) - and this is carefully and perfectly approached by Jackson, so that we're not completely overwhelmed by it, but can appreciate its implementation in the grander scheme of things. Overall, it was a fantastic and incredibly entertaining film.<br/><br/>As for acting... these actors are perfect matches for the roles that they take on. Aiden Turner finally got his chance to shine with the refined focus on Kili in Desolation of Smaug, and Richard Armitage's approach to the steadily desperate and mad Thorin Oakenshield was very fascinating. Ian McKellen (Gandalf), as always, is just a joy to watch. Namely, however, Martin Freeman's performance as the clueless and yet surprisingly courageous Bilbo Baggins is, once again, absolutely astounding - he practically carried the film in this regard. If one hadn't seen him in any of his previous work - ranging from the UK's The Office to BBC's smash hit, Sherlock - they would assume that he was born for this role. No one else would have been able to play the surprisingly layered Bilbo with such sincerity. He was not only hilarious (he somehow made the scene with Smaug as laughable as it was terrifying), but captivating - every time he was on the screen, I simply could not tear my eyes away from him! And his moments with the Ring sent uncomfortable shivers up my spine (""MINE"").<br/><br/>The film's crowning glory, however, was undoubtedly the scene all Lord of the Rings fans have been waiting for - the unveiling of Smaug the Terrible, self proclaimed ""King Under the Mountain."" Whoever designed, animated and rendered Smaug should be given a cookie every day for existing, and I'd like to thank Peter and company for keeping the design a secret before the premiere - seeing Smaug for the first time was simply breathtaking. That, combined with the sultry and devilishly articulate voice of one Benedict Cumberbatch, created an adversary that was as ""cool"" as it was simply terrifying. The chilling game of words played between Smaug and Bilbo had me on the edge of my seat for the entire ride.<br/><br/>The problem with The Hobbit franchise, therefore, isn't the story or the filmmaking or the acting; it's the way that the story is being approached. Lord of the Rings fans will recall the incredible, epic sagas that each of the original three films would bring - near four hours of nonstop excitement, twists and character development, all leading up to the pivotal scene at Mordor. Yet, The Hobbit isn't an epic saga, nor should it be approached as one - it's the story of one unassuming hobbit who joins a company of dwarfs to reclaim their homeland and slay a dragon. A to B; point blank and simple - no ring to destroy and Middle Earth to save. Somehow, Peter Jackson tried to take on the entire alphabet, while moseying past more than a few key letters and relying more on action and CGI (where did the REAL men dressed up like the baddies go?) than the base story.<br/><br/>Most upsetting was how the characters were approached. The characters are what's key to the plot of The Hobbit - or any Tolkien work, for that matter - and they're crucial to the telling of any half-decent story. However, while I could name off any Lord of the Rings character and give you my opinion on them, I hardly know any of the dwarfs by name, and I never really get to see anyone's personal journey as the story progresses - in any detail, anyway. Bilbo and the dwarfs are sometimes passed up in favor of thrilling (and completely unrealistic) action sequences though, while exciting, really didn't do anything for me at the end of the day.<br/><br/>I stand by my opinion that three films is far too much movie to be had for Bilbo and his dwarfish companions. One long, four-hour film (or maybe two films, as was the original plan) would have been perfectly suited to tackle this story in a proper way.<br/><br/>That being said, creative differences with Jackson and his team didn't stop me from seeing The Hobbit twice in a weekend, and do not take away from the film being one of the best adventures of the year. The Hobbit: the Desolation of Smaug definitely trumped its predecessor. The pace picked up, Bilbo finally got his moment to shine as ""burglar,"" and the scene with Smaug was near flawless. It's a ""must see"" for any movie lover, and especially any fan of Middle Earth!"

"harsh-kabeer1","7","1","4","16 December 2013"," The journey continues.
","The Hobbit trilogy was never meant to substitute the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It is more of a nostalgic journey to the Middle Earth meant to relive again with newer and older characters. And I, being a huge fan of Middle Earth, never had any qualms about Peter Jackson making three long movies out of a single book that does not run beyond mere four hundred pages. As long as Peter Jackson does what he does best, nobody in the right mind can deny the privilege of going on another journey. The first Hobbit had issues. Mostly because it was preceded by the stupendous Lord Of The Rings trilogy and slightly because it had its issues! Anyway, cheers for the fans because Desolation of Smaug is definitely an improvement over the first. The movie really feels like an adventure, unlike the first one. From what I have read that Peter Jackson had taken liberties and added new story elements that were not in the book, I would say that he did all right. Peter Jackson once again pulls of a beautiful Middle Earth that is as breathtakingly colorful and lively as it is dark and dangerous. And in this world, he orchestrates some of the biggest set pieces adventure that is filled with wit, humor, resourcefulness and courage. There is so much to learn for Michael Bay from Peter Jackson's Middle Earth movies. The set pieces are not just meant to crumble and explode, but they are meant to serve a purpose as a prop to accentuate the action. Something that Peter Jackson does so deftly. And add to that, Peter Jackson's elegant dance in the chaos, you get some breathtaking and totally enjoyable moments in the movie. There is some sort of cartoonish feel to these action sequences, but they in no way undermine the adventure that The Hobbit: Desolation Of Smaug is. This time the story is better, though it is still paper thin. And there are newer characters. Legolas is there. Sauron too makes an entry. And then there is Tauriel. *sigh* Is there anything more sexy and more beautiful than a lady kicking a**es? No, my dear friend, there isn't. Then there is that 'gregarious' ostentatious evil dragon, Smaug. The character developments are restricted to fewer characters, notably Thorin. The rest of the characters seem to be walking the tight rope of wooden characterizations. Bilbo is brave and stuff, but the character development is too linear. But, all in all, the story is much better, swiftly paced with fewer patches of stagnancy. The Hobbit: Desolation Of Smaug is definitely an improvement over its predecessor as the word adventure find its literal meaning into the story. Go, soak yourselves in the adventure 'barrel style, because it is worth it."

R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings movies, they are Peter Jackson's. So, these movies are Peter Jackson's. He has the right to rewrite whatever he wants. And he and his staff have done their homework, and taken liberally from others of Tolkien's writings, and extrapolated well on things Tolkien hinted at and never really portrayed.<br/><br/>This second movie of the three has moments of magic and beauty. There were moments where I gasped and moments where I laughed in delight.<br/><br/>There were more moments where I drummed my fingers in frustration and tedium. The tedium was in the frequent (of course) and interminable fight scenes. The tedium was in all the special effects, all the CG. Technologically wonderful, though no more wonderful than many other movies that have come out lately.<br/><br/>Only one or two of the magic came from CG.<br/><br/>The best moments of the movie came when Peter Jackson lets the whiz-bang out step back from center stage and let his fine actors do what they do- -act.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly is wonderful as Tauriel. Tauriel is a non-royal sylvan elf who has caught the eye of King Thranduil's royal son Legolas (remember him?). She doesn't have the otherworldly beauty of Liv Tyler's Arwen from the previous series. She looks more this-worldly. But she is no less beautiful. In one extreme closeup, her famous freckles show, and she is stunning!<br/><br/>Tauriel is as good a warrior as any male. She is also a strong minded woman who cares deeply. So deeply, in fact, that she is willing to break rules and orders. And Ms. Lilly plays her to perfection. Watch her face when she converses, watch her reactions. Wonderful!<br/><br/>Worst of all is the near-total waste of the magically-talented Martin Freeman. Well have some more experienced and famed actors fumed with jealousy that Mr. Freeman can stand, wordless, and express three or four emotions silently with his common-as-mud Everyman's face. As I drove away from the theater, I whimsically said, ""It's a shame Martin Freeman had only four lines."" My daughter said, ""He had more than four lines!"" I said, ""Okay, six. Eight, tops.""<br/><br/>He has more lines than that, and, brilliant movie actor that he is, lines actually can get in the way of his acting. But so can a heavy- handed director who loves computer generated effects than he does actors.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the public enjoys spectacle and movie magic. But what we really want is good story-telling. Peter Jackson more or less tells one-third of the story of the novel The Hobbit. But he doesn't really do it all that well. Acceptably, but no more than acceptably."
"sable-braveheart","9","1","5","25 August 2014"," A great movie, not-so-great adaptation
","Before I start this review, I'm going to put this out there: I am a Tolkien fangirl. I've read the LotR trilogy twice, The Hobbit four times, The Silm twice, and CoH once. So don't try and accuse me of ""never reading the book"" because guess what? I have. And you know what? I absolutely loved this movie.<br/><br/>I will freely admit that this movie deviates quite a bit from the source material. I will admit that I don't understand some of those changes. However, some of the other changes have really enhanced this trilogy for me. By that, I'm mostly talking about the subplot involving the Necromancer and Dol Guldur. That was a storyline I was always curious about in the book, and there is a disappointing lack of information on what exactly happened. I'm excited to possibly see the White Council drive the Necromancer out of his fortress in the next movie. The reveal that the Necromancer is Sauron was done very well in my opinion, though I have to question why Gandalf is now swinging in a cage...<br/><br/>Smaug was, hands down, the best part of the movie for me. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fantastic job providing the voice (and the motion capture, haha) for the dragon. The visual effects for Smaug were amazing, and if I didn't know better I'd wonder where they managed to find a dragon.<br/><br/>I was also very happy to see some character development for Bard. In the book we know next to nothing about him; he just pops up out of nowhere, because he was sort of a last-minute character. The foreshadowing that Bard would kill Smaug was well-done and interesting, though the whole deal with only a Black Arrow fired from a Dwarvish Windlance being able to kill a dragon was a little...odd.<br/><br/>Now, onto why I didn't give this 10 out of 10 stars: The unnecessary things that were added in. Mainly I'm talking about the fight with Smaug at the end, though there were other things that bothered me as well. Because, yes, there really was an overly-long scene that involved dwarfs running around the Mountain being chased by a dragon, which didn't even do anything other than stretch out the movie longer than it needed to. And Smaug's line at the end was very narm-y. The inclusion of Tauriel (though adding a female character was necessary) bothered me, and she doesn't fit into Tolkien's world very well. An elf/dwarf relationship completely contradicts what Tolkien stated, and somewhat trivializes Legolas and Gimli's friendship in LotR. Bolg being introduced was unnecessary since Azog already existed (though he wasn't supposed to). And the less that's said about the ""Bombur Barrel"" and the healing scene the better.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved the second installment in The Hobbit trilogy, despite the changes from the book."

","When we last left our compatriots, they were on their way to reclaim the Lonely Mountains from an evil fierce dragon – Smaug. Peter Jackson, the man who brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy, gave us another thrill seeking adventure that led us down to the lair of a dragon so fierce that hot molten metal could not contain it.<br/><br/>But a greater evil arises – darkness has begun across Middle Earth and the quest for the ONE RING has begun. And the ultimate destroyer has yet to be seen as we hear in that famous quote: ""One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."" Big props has to go to the duo villain of the story, Smaug & the Necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch), again you have proved your worth as the villain of the story. I saw this movie in IMAX and it was incredible.<br/><br/>I can't wait 'til the last installment in 2014."
"ikrani","7","1","5","29 May 2014"," I Doubt Five Armies Can Top This Film
","Yes, I read the Hobbit. Yes, I read the Lord of the Rings. No, I don't like how Legolas was shoehorned into this movie. Anyway...<br/><br/>What I mean in the title is that this film is probably the most memorable out of all the Hobbit movies thus far. We have Azhog the White Orc being badass as usual, Ian McKellan turns in a great performance like he always does, and they even sneak Steven Fry into a bit role that has his fingerprints all over the writing. But by far the most memorable moment is the Triumph of the Whirling Barrel Dervish. Those of you who see the film know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Never have I seen something so cartoonishly over-the-top in a Tolkein film before. It made everyone in the audience laugh at how utterly ridiculous it was, and it really helped set this movie above from its predecessor as well as the original Lord of the Rings films. Yes, those films were great, but I don't find them especially memorable the way I do this movie.<br/><br/>I feel the elements introduced into the film that weren't in the book work to the film's advantage. The love interest between Tauriel and the dwarf whose name I can't remember helped set him apart from the rest of the dwarfs, though, again, I REALLY wish they'd left Legolas out of the film. All this does is set up either a tragic death or all of us rolling our eyes because Legolas or the dwarf is going to get stiffed. No one likes seeing their ship sunk, Peter Jackson.<br/><br/>So, yeah, love this film to death, because this is where I really feel that the fantasy adventure starts to simultaneously take itself more seriously but also less seriously. It remembers that fantasy doesn't need to be based in reality and occasionally throws in a bit of bombastic silliness to make sure we remember that too. It's not perfect, but there was never a moment I didn't enjoy. I instead look to Five Armies to fulfill that obligation."
"WheelzFourReelz","9","1","5","2 March 2014"," This was the movie that I was hoping to get!
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is some of my favorite movies of all time. In fact, I would say that Return of the King is my favorite movie in general. When the first Hobbit movie came out, I enjoyed it, but it was nothing like the first journey to Middle Earth. Now the second Hobbit movie is out, and let me tell you, expectations were high. And let me tell you, I enjoyed this movie almost as much as the original trilogy. This movie continues the story of the Hobbit where everybody has to get to the mountain. On the way there, they meet people, have battles, and ride in barrels. I know, that synopsis was terrible. Just trust me that it's a fantastic story. Is it as epic as the original trilogy? No, but it's still well written and has an interesting premise. That's always good. What also helps escalate this movie are the characters and actors. The characters feel more relatable in this one than in the last and they're capped off by solid acting. Martin Freemen makes a fantastic Bilbo, Ian McKellan is still awesome as Gandalf, Orlando Bloom does a great job, everyone does a very well done performance. There are a few characters that feel shoe horned into the movie, like Legolas and that one chick elf I forgot the name of, but they are awesome. Not only do they have great fighting scenes, but they're just awesome as well. What I also like about this movie is that the dwarfs seem more relevant. In the first movie, the dwarfs didn't have a whole lot of material to work with and seemed forgotten in the mix. In this movie, however, they've got more dialogue, more action scenes, and more screen time. It made me pay attention more to the dwarfs, which I was glad happened. Now we move onto the fights. Holy crap. They were exciting, they were intense, they were fun, they were chaotic, they were awesome. One of my favorite action scenes in the movie was the water barrel scene. Everyone is hiding in barrels out of an Elvin prison and there's fighting and arrows and death and pure awesomeness. I hope they turn it into an amusement park ride. I would definitely attend that. And now, we get to the part that everyone's waiting for. Smaug. This guy is my favorite movie character of the year. And it's a dragon! He was big, menacing, had amazing voice work done by Cumberbatch, and he just looked so cool. During the scenes with him, I was frightened. I was literally frightened by this dragon. That is how awesome Smaug is. He is easily my favorite part of the movie. Overall, Desolation of Smaug was a breath of fresh air for the Hobbit trilogy. It had a great story, solid acting, awesome action, a freaking dragon that stole the show, and the ending. THAT ENDING! This is one of the most ""holy crap, cliff hanger"" endings to a movie I've ever seen. I will not spoil anything; that will need to be something you should see. This is one of my favorite movies of the year and I cannot wait to see it again."
"sasikanth20","8","1","5","20 January 2014"," Better than The Unexpected Journey!
","Now that you've started with the series watching the first one, you can't miss out on the middle pages of the book can you? But honestly, after watching the trailers, I thought the movie would be a huge disappointment, and I was not really excited about it. However, I ended up liking it better than The Unexpected Journey, for the second installment of the trilogy has more meat and substance, where the plot unravels slowly yet steadily, and everything seems to start to make sense finally. Peter Jackson does a commendable job with the direction, and an interesting screenplay gets you engrossed in the film.<br/><br/>On the acting front, kudos to Ian McKellin for putting up such a consistent performance in the series. He's brilliant. I was starting to wonder what all and how much Gandalf had to survive through the books. Uff! The rest of the cast, but for the only female character were good. Though she looked beautiful, I though Evangeline Lilly looked odd and did not exactly fit into the role.<br/><br/>On technical front, the editing is much better than its predecessor. Cinematography is brilliant, and the 3D effects are alright. The graphics looked a little artificial at times though, and the music too seemed too melodramatic and not as great as the LOR score.<br/><br/>Acting: 8.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 8.5/10 Technical Aspects: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Verdict: 8.5/10<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit sasikanth.me :)"
"Spondonman","8","1","5","18 January 2014"," A barrel of laughs for Smaugheads
","Because so many people have said this Hobbit instalment was mainly from the mind of Jackson and not Tolkien I was perversely looking forward to it. I used to wish I'd read all the books when I was younger, now I'm glad I never got round to it, the films are more than enough of an experience.<br/><br/>The band of bland dwarfs and hobbit continue their trekking across much real and cartoon scenery, facing many cartoon dangers but the whole story satisfyingly wrapped up in a gorgeously glorious and awesome triumphant conclusion of mythic proportions. Well, maybe not the last bit: the screen goes black which probably correctly matched the feelings of the audience with ten minutes of credits ahead of them. To cut to the chase: the almost endless barrel chase down the rapid river with elves and orcs battling it out over the dwarfs' heads - I haven't laughed AT a movie so much since Jackson's King Kong Brontosaurus stampede! But unintentionally laughing at a quality film is not meant to be a recommendation though. As it's mainly aimed at the gamer generations is there any characterisation at all, any interaction you can cherish, any character you root for, any race you feel master, in fact anybody you can relate to in here? In two and a half hours there are plenty of scenes to admire though: Galdalf's pointless but impressive separate quest before he realised he'd left the dwarfs in danger; Smaug's memorable erudite conversation with Baggins amidst the mountains of gold which has been raked in by the franchise, even though the caterpillar and Alice came to mind; the elvish and selfish city. As usual the cgi cartoonery veers between impressive and ridiculous – oh to be ten years old again! Overall and as a film I'll probably never watch again it was far more entertaining and cinematic than part 1; I made the most of it because I know the actual story will be flatly resumed in part 3."

"bhaveshbhatia","8","1","5","12 January 2014"," The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - A Visual Treat for Fantasy Lovers
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is an epic fantasy adventure film directed by Peter Jackson. It is the second installment of a three-part film adaptation based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien and released on December 11 2013. It was preceded by An Unexpected Journey (2012). It is an ensemble cast led by Ian McKellen, Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage and Benedict Cumberbatch. It is delightful for any full time writer to write a review on this film. Fantasy films are always hard to deliver. They are a dicey game and successful fantasy films are rare. Twelve months have passed from where the last film left. The orcs are chasing Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin and Dwarven down from the Carrock where they encounter a huge bear who is Beorn, their host. Loaning a horse from him, they outrun the orcs. On the other hand, the dwarfs are captured by Legolas and Tauriel. Gandalf investigates the tomb of Nazgul which is empty. The company meets Bard who possesses the last arrow to defeat Smaug. Here Gandalf is engaged in a dual with Necromancer who reveals itself as the Dark lord Sauron. Thorin and his company reach the Lonely Mountain, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance and is sent to retrieve the Arkenstone, only to awaken Smaug. Bard tries to bring the arrow to the town's launcher but is arrested, leaving the arrow with his son. Attempts are taken to destroy Smaug by drowning him in molten gold. However, he escapes and is determined to destroy Lake-town and its people.<br/><br/>Jackson and his team have worked hard to bring these three-dimensional worlds to the audience. There are different moods, personalities and energies. There are quite a few breathtaking scenes where the line between reality and fantasy has blurred to trick the audience into thinking that they are really standing in a fantasy land. For some, the film or the scenes may be a tad too long but each and every second of every scene is justified. Be it the barrel scene where the barrel rolls slow and for eternity or the confrontation scene with Smaug. Each scene has its pace and creative reasons.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a visual masterpiece where the imagination and contemplation of the team has shown itself. The strongest points are the performances of every character and the establishment of circumstances. whether it is the visual effects, or the linguistic, physic, cultural aspects and fight scenes of the characters, you will not be disappointed. The film has the potential make viewers feel positively content with it and lives up to its reputation. I only wish they hadn't unnecessarily dragged out this short book into such long series - the editing could have been much better."

"ferreira0665","9","1","5","9 January 2014"," yes it deviates from the book but so what
","I am a fan of Tolkien. And thus far in this trilogy I have not been disappointed. People are complaining about Beorn's section being shortened. Umm, it wasn't very important in the book. It was a stopping point for the dwarfs to rest and then they move on. <br/><br/>Just before they enter Mirkwood Gandalf leaves as was done in the book. The Spiders of Mirkwood was actually shortened and done better for cinema. Also how the dwarfs came upon the elves was done better. If they would have done it as done in the book it wouldn't have been as good. There are some things that work better on paper than visually. Things had to change. <br/><br/>The love triangle Evangeline Lilly apparently didn't want but was done in reshoots. The Kili and Tauriel thing was there from the beginning. But the Legolas wanting her was added in later. I don't find a problem with it. Jackson said that there will not be a romantic angle between Tauriel and Legolas. Legolas may want her but I think Tauriel seems him as more of a brother than anyone she would want to be romantically involved with. I also think that Tauriel may die in the next movie as to explain why she isn't in LOTR. She is being used I think to actually have Legolas's tolerance of dwarfs be increased and explains the drastic change between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings of how he acts. <br/><br/>I also think it is better to have the orcs in constant pursuit of the dwarfs than to have them just show up at the Battle of the Five Armies. I think it makes more sense. And I also want to see The Battle of the Five Armies. That was the one part of the book The Hobbit that disappointed me. When you mention The Battle of the Five Armies. Don't just mention it and say its over and then tell me who lived and died. Have me experience the battle. This was probably going to be rewritten as the orcs pursuing the dwarfs. Since Tolkien was rewriting the Hobbit when he died it would be nice to know what he would have possibly changed. I do think the Dol Goldur and Necromancer stuff would have been added instead of the footnote in the final chapter of the book. <br/><br/>All in all while yes the movie deviates from the book but I think it had to. There was a plot, the plot was actually in the action. So the people saying there was no plot need to rewatch the movie. Peter Jackson has followed the book closer than people realize. Yes there is more action but so what. That really is the only thing that deviates from the book. Tauriel and Legolas were not in the book but they very well could have been in the rewrite. The Orcs in constant pursuit of the dwarfs wasn't in the book but it should have. The dwarfs trying to kill Smaug wasn't in the book but maybe it should have. And its not an insult to Smaug to make him not very intelligent. There is no evidence in any works that Smaug was particularly intelligent. He was greedy and he was lazy."
"leanor-dom","9","1","5","9 January 2014"," Amazing adaptation regardless of the plot and story changes
","(Attention! Contains minor spoilers)<br/><br/>When I saw the first Hobbit film I was sort of disappointed because of all the changes that were made, and all the Lord of the Rings references which do not exist in the book, nor they are supposed to exist since it is not supposed to be a dark story, it has a more child-like feeling to it. <br/><br/>Yet, I also understood that Jackson's Hobbit is not Tolkien's and couldn't be. For several reasons, movies aren't just made for those that read the books, not everything that's written in the books works on screen, and The Lord of the Rings came first. People in general needed to see a connection to LotR, and honestly the way it's been done it's quite clever and I believe it works. <br/><br/>Now, about this film specifically. This time I went to see it without any expectations or ideas of what the story should be, and I was blown away. As usual, the scenery, soundtrack and dialogue are incredible as they've always been, but there are also some new additions to the plot and cast. <br/><br/>Legolas is back, and it's rather refreshing to see a new side of him, he is younger and has almost this ""evil"" look, undoubtedly different from the elf we know from LotR, we will yet know why I suppose. Tauriel, though not an original characters fits rather nicely in the story and I see why it would be important to have a strong female character since there is none in the book and a film must reach to all audiences. Another unexpected thing would be the sort of romance that develops between Tauriel and Kili, the dwarf. It is filler, yes, and apparently unimportant, but it gives you a bit of feeling in the middle of so much action and dark things going on, almost giving you hope that good things are always meant to appear as well. The company of dwarfs is still as funny as it always has been. I would end this review mentioning the dragon, Smaug. The scene with Smaug is unbelievable, and much longer than I expected which was great because it is a privilege to see such good work on screen. <br/><br/>Essentially, keep in mind that the movie you're about to watch is an adaptation of the original, and embrace the good and bad of what may come but keep an open mind. I assure you, you won't be disappointed."
"ratchet567","9","1","5","30 December 2013"," You may not like it, but i did.
","I loved this movie, plain and simple. The casting was great, the acting was great, the CGI was great, the whole movie was just all around great. I have to say, I had nothing against the first one. Sure it barely stuck to the book at all, and I'm going to guess that this one didn't either, however I only read half of the book so I don't really know. I've been a LOTR fan since I was like 7, and I'm liking the hobbit just as much. The combat scenes with Legolas were great even with a little throwback to his shield-boarding skills from The Two Towers (this time on an Orc). Tauriel was great and Benedict Cumberbatch was just about as dragon-y as he could get. One thing that I really have to admit is that the ending sucked, I mean come on ""I am fire, I am... Death"" then it cuts to three distraught faces and Bilbo saying ""What have we done?"" that ending was so horribly abrupt that I wasn't even sure that the movie was over or if it was just and extra long cut out. Also, the scenes with Gandalf in Dol Guldrur were incredibly drawn out despite the fact that they were never even shown in the books up to where I read. I have nothing against the awesome combat scenes that everyone else reviewing this movie seems to loath for no legitimate reason. Furthermore the extreme prejudice that book lovers seem to be walking into this movie with is sadly misplaced. you should know that the movie is never exactly like the book, and most of the time, its miles away. The story is serious, humorous, sad, happy, and intense all at the same time. Smaug is now my second favorite character (right behind Legolas) in the entire saga including the originals. I definitely think that that anyone, even those who want it to be just like the book, should see this as long as they remember, THIS IS NOT TOLKIEN'S MASTERPIECE ANYMORE! It is now Peter Jackson's recreation of the beloved story."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","5","28 December 2013"," A joyful and absorbing adventure.
","As you would expect, this middle Hobbit chapter is much of the same as the first entry, and subsequently, the LOTR films. Which is either good or bad depending on your taste for cinematic Tolkien. Not being a rabid fan like millions around the world, I have nevertheless always delighted in these motion pictures for the enormous scale adventure and grand fantasy worlds they present. The Desolation of Smaug delivers on these fronts, particularly when it comes to the three major set pieces: a tango with spiders, an escape by barrels and the Smaug-centric finale. These action scenes are epic in size, funny in parts and gloriously crafted with a combination of practical effects and computer wizardry. Smaug himself, amazingly voiced and motion captured by Benedict Cumberbatch, is arguably the finest creation within Middle Earth - and that includes the often revered Gollum - however the shining moment within this movie is an awe-inspiring one-take sequence that sees Legolas (Orlando Bloom) coolly despatch a swathe of Orcs whilst travelling down a river. The more verbose sections can feel meandering - a chinwag between Kili (Aidan Turner) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) is yawn-inducing - and a couple of flaws in An Unexpected Journey are still present; most notably Gandalf's (Ian McKellan) annoyingly choosy magical powers and the lack of real danger to the band of Dwarfs (led by Richard Armitage's Thorin) accompanying Bilbo (Martin Freeman) on his quest. Minor quibbles aside, this second instalment is a joyful, absorbing and frequently comical two and a half hour saga that should be seen on the biggest screen possible."
"aditya_vashisht","8","1","5","26 December 2013"," Dragonses Precious!!
","What a ride!! Literally, the latest installment in extrapolated Hobbits tale was no less than a ride in an amusement park. Thrilling, entertaining and everything we loved from the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br/><br/>Resuming their journey, Bilbo Baggins along with the dwarfs find new challenges on the path forward to the lonely mountain. Only BIlbo is a new leaf now. He is more courageous and more involved in helping his fellow trekkers in their mission. And it is one thing he acquired during his journey that helps him prove his worth as a rightful choice as a burglar.<br/><br/>'Desolation of Smaug' is an improvement in every way over the first Hobbits movie. The narration is better, and the story has more substance to offer - the conflicts, doubts, bursts of courage, approaching evil etc. The things I liked about the Lord of the Rings trilogy are found in this movie. There is an air of suspense before plots or new characters are revealed. A creepiness is there to haunt. And it just doesn't end there. The awesome action sequence where our friends make an escape through the river riding in empty barrels was spectacular. <br/><br/>And when we start to imagine if a movie can offer more thrills, we have - 'The' dragon. Smaug is the best dragon or gigantic creature in movie history. Benedict Cumberbatch's voice as the goldophillic dragon is the treat of the movie. Its scary, daunting and intimidating. The voice circling in surround sound raises goose bumps. To quote Jeremy Jahns from youtube - ""That's one big Batch of Cumber"". <br/><br/>It's just unbelievable, we'll have to wait another year to complete the story. Its amazing how the ending to this movie creates a craving towards the continuation of the story. It was almost 3 hours long, still the heart wants more. Only thing we can do now is to wait for a 20 minute extended edition on blu-ray. Smacking delicious precious!!<br/><br/>http://cinejourn.tumblr.com/post/71215553353/dragonses-precious"
"tiagorrv","9","1","5","26 December 2013"," Follow the Epic Journey...
","If I had to choose the perfect movie...I wouldn't choose one, I would pick the entire trilogy of Lord Of The Rings (LOTR). What made me such a fan was the great story, the amazing acting skills displayed, the epic battles and the epic journey and its conclusion.<br/><br/>So...as a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, I wasn't disappointed with the first hobbit movie, and I enjoyed even more this second one. I know some people say LOTR was better because it felt much more epic. Well, people need to understand that ""The Hobbit"" trilogy is happening before the LOTR movies, the movie cant be as epic since the first movie or it would have lose its spark.<br/><br/>The first hobbit film was the start of a journey, this one, ""the desolation of smaug"" continues that journey adding more action scenes, a more obscure landscape and the sense of danger in all middle-earth. Peter Jackson is trying, and sucessfuly I might add, to link the events of ""The Hobbit"" with LOTR, and the more time we see the movie, the more we feel that something huge will happen. We feel that the quest for Erebor will be a much bigger thing that what already is.<br/><br/>The sense of a large group of dwarfs doesn't overwhelm me anymore, and I can say now that I really like the way they fight in group. Along with Thorin, the leader, we have much more focus on Kili (is nephew) and a unexpected bond between him and a new elf character (Tamriel)<br/><br/>The actions scenes are simply amazing. The spiders are so well made, the barrels scene will put you in the edge of your seat and many moments will be remembered.<br/><br/>We can see more of the Elf King in this movie, a very deep character that shows some dark side from the elfs, a race showed as only good creatures until now.<br/><br/>Legolas makes the return, and god... his fight scenes are masterpieces of choreography. We can also see a more deep Legolas in this movie. In Lotr, Orlando Bloom was one of the ""muscle"" of the fellowship, here we see an entirely different role.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman continues to give us a great performance as Bilbo, showing us that the ring is already affecting him.<br/><br/>We don't see much of Gandalf (Ian Mackellen) in this movie, but the scenes where he appears in this one will be remembered by the fans, I wont spoil it for you, but you will see an epic confrotation again!<br/><br/>We are introduced to a new array of characters in this movie and I am sure they will be more explored in the next one, but I was very pleased with them for now.<br/><br/>I wont speak much about Smaug, I will just say that I was astonished of how good he looks and behaves. The best dragon of the movie history for me without a doubt. See and prepare for being astonished as well.<br/><br/>One thing I think it didn't quite satisfied me was the soundtrack. I think since this one is more action driven, it makes sense. However, some of the best soundtracks of middle-earth were in the battles, and I don't think they are as good now. <br/><br/>If you didn't saw it yet, don't waste any time and continue to follow <br/><br/>this epic journey."

","With the first part of the prequel a tad bit too long,personally i thought this one would be a a shorter one. Yet they made it long, I must say that I was left wanting for more even in the end. The return of Legolas to the saga,the screenplay and the dwarfs..the dragon wasn't given more screen time but certainly they have set the perfect platform for the final part of this prequel trilogy to be like the final part of the original LOTR trilogy.. The opening sequence was weak yet the cast and crew kept it intriguing till the very end. Martin Freeman is becoming more and more matured as an actor. Sir Ian McKellan is always a pleasure to watch. Though the best part was played by the supporting crew and the CGI which was much better than the previous installment of the series.This might become the Star Wars of middle earth!"

","To paraphrase Matt Atchity, Editor in Chief of Rotten Tomatoes, this is the second part of the cynical cash grab adaptation of ""The Hobbit"", from director Peter Jackson, which continues where ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" left off, with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs walking around. But having actual action and adventure in your action/adventure movie, goes a long way. Right off the bat, this installment is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor on the sole basis that this action/adventure doesn't take nearly two hours to get going.<br/><br/>More improvements: There are tons more intimidating and grotesque looking villains that keep this story moving forward (the giant spiders stand as one of the scariest things I've seen on the big screen, all year) even though the plot consists of a highly repetitive formula, wherein they guys walk around, run into a group of hostile enemies (who all seem to be anit-dwarfist) get captured, have to hear a slathering of anti-dwarf propaganda, believe all is lost, miraculously escape, walk around some more, run into different hostile enemies, get recaptured and start the process all over again. But it was the actual battle sequences which really made me lean forward in my seat. From the extremely well choreographed river sequence, laced with superb comedic timing and the best camera-work since The Two Towers, to the 40 minute battle with a fire breathing dragon named Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) a dragon more impressive looking than anything in that new ""Godzilla"" trailer, it's good that Jackson finally realized the likelihood of people actually enjoying this series, is predicated on its entertainment value. Back to basics.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints about my ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" movie going experience, was the 48 frames per second aspect. This was an argument against the film that many critics outright and irresponsibly disregarded; as if how the film looked has nothing to do with ones movie going experience. Anyway, according to a recent article in The Guardian, Peter Jackson admits to ""softening the high definition of this newest installment"" so as to make it more cinematic. And though ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is not quite 24fps, it is obviously a much better visual experience all around, thus enabling our eyes to simply focus on the masterful direction that Jackson brings to the table, instead of being distracted by a filming technique that repeatedly takes the viewer out of the cinematic world.<br/><br/>Final Thought: The content is still really stretched out, the film is still a bit too long (maybe 30 minutes or so) and there is some exposition that I didn't quite understand, but didn't seem relevant to this installment. BUT, with a film where (going in) I knew it would be nearly three hours long, wouldn't have a ""real"" ending since there is still one more film to come and was the sequel to a film that nearly made my list of the ten worst movies of 2012, the fact that ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" was mostly a non-stop thrill ride and had more of a comedic edge than any of the last four Jackson hobbit driven productions, really doesn't leave me much to complain about."

","When Bilbo Baggins suddenly loses his ring The Ring during a scene where hungry spiders have captured his dwarf friends, there's the kind of desperate edge needed for a last minute rescue and some truly exciting swordplay (later on, a few more small but important things are lost in the same suspenseful fashion)<br/><br/>Eventually, two characters not in J.R.R.

"hkauteur","8","1","5","15 December 2013"," HK Auteur Review - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
","To start off, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan. I haven't read any of Tolkien's works and only have seen the Peter Jackson's film trilogy once. A friend invited me to a free screening of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug two days before its premiere, so I quickly caught up with the previous installment and read up on the film's production online to prepare for its sequel. So this is going to be a review of the first film too. Let's crack on <br/><br/>My biggest problem with An Unexpected Journey is it launched its story retrospectively from Lord of the Rings, starting with an older Bilbo Baggins telling the story to Frodo Baggins just before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring. The Hobbit is not a prequel, it was written first before Lord of the Rings. It's the true ""part one"" and yet it's being framed as if it was a prequel to a great trilogy. This effectively echoes throughout the two Hobbit films as I am constantly being reminded about what's to come. It's distracting and by association makes The Hobbit seem less important.<br/><br/>Whether it's Peter Jackson's completist approach to expand the story or a corporate decision from the financiers to cash in on the success of the LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit is too long. Often the story takes big steps backwards before being able to move forwards. It took forty minutes in the first film to start the journey and for someone who is not coming in sheer excited fandom, the slow pace is a lot of work on the audience's part.<br/><br/>This is the typical pattern of one story movement in The Hobbit series thus far: 1) An imminent crisis or problem faces our heroes 2) Backstory is given in context to our heroes to the crisis. 3) The group tries to persevere and just as they fail or are about to give up, Bilbo does something that solves the problem 4) The group rejoice about the pure spirit of Hobbits and how impressive it is, cue flute music 5) A new problem comes along. Repeat.<br/><br/>Throughout both films, I had an internal monologue that kept screaming, ""Let's go! Hurry up!"", as if I was watching someone play a video game at snail's pace. Die-hard LOTR fans will say that I am wrong about this but it's why those DVD extended editions exist. Even though we'll never know, Guillermo Del Toro's original idea of directing the The Hobbit as two films sounds better. But this is just something I'll have to accept. That's the extent of my issues because when The Desolation of Smaug is good, it is very good.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo Baggins. The role requires exactly what Freeman plays best: acting quizzical from being one mental step ahead of everybody but always feels socially awkward about pointing out the obvious. Freeman's reactions are entertaining and overall I find Bilbo a much more engaging protagonist than Frodo; he gets things done.<br/><br/>Smaug the dragon is frightening. Benedict Cumberbatch injects an immense sense of threat and power into Smaug's voice, combined with its gigantic size, creates a memorable movie villain for the ages. It was bone-chilling watching the dragon slither around in the dark, with the imminent feeling he can squash Bilbo at any moment. Hands down, the Smaug scene is the best scene in all five films so far.<br/><br/>The beautiful Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel is a welcome addition to the series. Despite of being Jackson's creation, she is a well-rounded strong female character that adds a love story. Orlando Bloom returning as Legolas is neither her or there for me. He isn't an interesting character and seems to exist for his fighting abilities. Both elf characters are unnecessary filler material, but make entertaining filler no less. The dwarfs are more fleshed out in this installment, which is an improvement because there was nothing to distinct them apart from each other in the first film.<br/><br/>nother minor quibble I had was the decision of using CGI in the action scenes. The orcs are computer-generated and the action sequences look digitally layered and video game-like. They're well designed and are well-paced action scenes. But the LOTR trilogy previously established a real world look with its use of New Zealand landscapes and creature make-up, and I wonder why Peter Jackson decided to go with more CGI as it doesn't match with the previous films.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's deep love for the material is felt throughout both films and this perhaps is the film's most winning quality. After all, Jackson's completist approach isn't self-indulgent or obnoxious, but out of a genuine love, awe and wonder for Middle Earth and its mythology. It's infectious and is probably the primary reason I was able to sit through the long running time.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed The Desolation of Smaug more than An Unexpected Journey. There is less setup to be done, hence the story moves along much faster. And for that reason alone, I think I will enjoy There and Back Again even more when things begin to wrap up."
"kaliveach","8","1","5","19 December 2013"," A Solid Addition to the Legacy of Tolkien's Middle Earth.
","Peter Jackson's second installment in his Hobbit trilogy is a solid fantasy/adventure film. Overall the film is visually appealing, contains plenty of exiting action scenes, and reinforces the overarching theme of good versus evil. We're introduced to some new type of elves in this chapter, and gain some insight into the history of Legolas. A new elf character named Tauriel who adds some depth and compassion to the the image of elves is introduced. There are some very cool battle scenes with the elves and dwarfs, even with the 160 minute run-time all the action keeps it entertaining the entire way through. <br/><br/>There are a few critiques I have, mostly concerning the dragon Smaug. I don't think they got the voice quite right, and he came off as being more of an over sized cocky lizard than a sinister dragon. Also, the amount of blatant foreshadowing done with the ""black arrow"" was just way too much. It was done in a way that was so obvious the end of the movie could not have been a surprise. That whole aspect of the film should have been done in a much more subtle manner. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is satisfying and extremely fun. Anyone will be entertained, adults, families, children (definitely with parents) and well worth paying the ticket price to see. A great performance from all of the actors, particularly Ian Mckellen as Gandalf and Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Bringing the Tolkien's world of Middle Earth to life is no easy task; Peter Jackson, cast, and crew do this with overall success. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is great, and I would definitely recommend going to see it."
"sreethered","8","1","5","19 December 2013"," Marvelous, but........
","Lord of the rings trilogy was an epic. There is no doubt about it. It had the material to extend it into a 4-5 movie series, which would have been great. Instead, Peter Jackson accomplished a remarkable venture in movie history, by making a trilogy which spans at an average of above 3 hours. When it came to Hobbit, the odds turned against to it. After watching the second part of Hobbit series, the major thing bothered me was it's uneventful presentation. Desolation of Smaug is in no means a bad movie. It has it's moments and assets. It is way superior than the predecessor and entertains as any other movie in the middle-earth saga. Also, it features the best ever hobbit in the movie adaptations of Tolkien's middle-earth. Martin Freeman, as Bilbo Baggins, forwards a superior performance, which is way better than Frodo and Sam. The visual effects are stunning and 3-D effects are also refreshing. But what went wrong with the whole series was, the plot is so simple and it deserved a fast treatment. All these dwarf-quest can be explained in two movies, and it is unnecessarily extended into a trilogy. I am not pretty sure that why I should go back to see the third part, because everything from here is clear as crystal. A dragon who wants to destroy the fisherman village, a man who waits for the dragon with a black arrow, an elf-dwarf love story, an elf who chases an orc who may be will find a pale one too, a forwarding army of orcs, and a wizard in cage. Along with a group of dwarfs and a hobbit. Lets hope There And Back Again will surprise me....."

","The Hobbit was released on the 12th of December 2013 and I saw it on the 15th of December at Albany event cinema in New Zealand, Auckland. The film starts off in the past with Gandalf and Thorin drinking in a bar. It then continues on from where it had ended in the last film and in the first 15 minutes of the film there is already action where the dwarfs, gandalf and Bilbo run into a small home and rest their for the night. They then continue their quest into a forest then gandalf gets a message in his head to go meet something in the mountains leaving the dwarfs to go into the forest without gandalf. They fight spiders in the forest and they're captured by elves and then get away and make it to the mountain where smaug leaves the mountain and goes out to destroy everything. Leaving it at a huge cliff hanger for part 3. In conclusion I loved the film with it's action, humor and fantasy that peter Jackson created. Thanks for a great film peter Jackson.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my review and I will be posting more reviews soon. From yours truly your friendly neighbor hood friend: Henry Agnew"
"dfranzen70","7","1","5","15 December 2013"," A mixed bag
","The second Hobbit movie is sort of the Back to the Future II of its series: at times thrilling, at times confusing, and ultimately a little unsatisfying. It boasts terrific effects and choreography but perhaps a little too much plot, too many new characters, and a lengthy running time.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug picks up more or less where the first film left off; the dwarfs, Bilbo Baggins, and Gandalf have left the Misty Mountains and continue their quest to the Lonely Mountain, former dominion of the Dwarf race, aiming to recapture it and the treasure below it from the demonic dragon Smaug. (Interestingly, Smaug himself doesn't even make an appearance on screen until the final half hour of the film.) The outfit is led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), descendant of the last King beneath the Mountain, before Smaug took over; the other dwarfs are more-or-less interchangeable, much like those who accompanied Snow White in her adventures. Their names are, I think, Palin, Marty Balin, Gerald McBoingBoing, Doink, Coin, and Gilligan. I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Now, the movie's title implies that Smaug (voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) is desolate - he sort of is, living beneath the Lonely Mountain and all - but since this is more about the journey than the destination, we are treated to concurrent plots and unexpected encounters. The troupe loses Gandalf when the latter rushes off to deliver one of his legendary Important Messages, so he's absent for much of the film, and within some time the gang finds itself within the forests of Mirkwood, which is inhabited by Elves who aren't really like the stern-but-nice ones at Rivendell. (You know, from the last film.) <br/><br/>And these Elves are a heck of a lot more suspicious of, well, everything. They're led by Thranduil (Lee Pace), who wishes to keep his realm closed off from the problems of the outside world, much like Elrond would for Rivendell in the later LOTR films. Thranduil's son is Legolas (Orlando Bloom), whom we're well acquainted with; he's smitten with the chief of the wood-elf guards, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) - but, like Shakespeare's star-cross'd lovers, Papa would never let the sylvan elf be with his offspring. You know how it is.<br/><br/>But lest you think this is all about the Elves and Dwarfs and how they dislike/despise each other, there's another fun thread to follow: it looks like a certain Evil is gathering strength, both in body and in numbers, although remaining hidden from view. Thus the Orcs are both tracking Thorin and his merry men and helping their Master - you know who I mean - to become more corporeal. And then, to riff on an old 1970s TV show, there's Smaug. So there's truly no shortage of Bad Guys, and nor is there a shortage of ominous foreshadowing.<br/><br/>The movie never drags, and it makes good (judicious) use of 3D, but it suffers from a real lack of personality. Bilbo and Gandalf, who have the most charisma and charm of the bunch, are given less to do here than in the first film; the Dwarvish leader Thorin, by contrast, isn't a sufficiently interesting character to hold extended attention. In addition, you have all of these Dwarfs whose names aren't entirely memorable, so when one is left behind all one can do is shrug and wonder who else is left. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the the truly positive aspects of the movie. The fight and action scenes are supremely entertaining to watch, with Elf versus Orc, Elf versus Dwarf, Dwarf versus Orc, Dwarf versus Human, Wizard versus Orc, Wizard versus Something Evil, and Dragon versus Hobbit and Dwarfs. The intensity of each of these scenes is almost poetic, with Lilly and Bloom miles beyond everyone else in their seemingly effortless Orc-slaying abilities. Lilly in particular is remarkable, both beautiful, humanistic, and cunning beyond her years; her Tauriel (oddly enough, not really a Tolkien character) is savvy, level headed, and soft hearted. <br/><br/>The final scene, more than two and a half hours into the film, is a bit of a letdown, a mere gateway to the final part of the trilogy. It's true that the first Hobbit film took the same tack, but this time out the denouement feels abrupt; we left not just wanting more but simply hanging."
"RPDimitrov","8","1","5","15 December 2013"," Strangely, not as enjoyable as the first one
","First of all, I have to say that I am a LOTR fan (both movies and book). So I was pretty excited when I heard that Peter Jackson is going to make The Hobbit into a movie. Of course, as most fans, I was a little worried when he decided to make it a trilogy, given the shortness of the book. Nonetheless I would have to say that I really enjoyed ""An Unexpected Journey"", which I though was a homage to all LOTR fans. About the ""Desolation of Smaug"" thought I have some mixed feeling. As general I liked the movie, but there were moments I could easily lived without. The first movie was mainly criticized for not being fast enough and that the action was not enough. And I have the feeling that Peter Jackson has made anything possible to make the second one more thrilling and Hollywoodish. Not that I am having any problems with action, but in many cases I had the feeling that the story was left on the side, only to accommodate the viewers who want more action. A needless love story, too much CGI at moments, a little too much Legolas than I would have liked and not enough time spend on the important characters. On the other hand I want to say that I really like where Peter Jackson has gone with filling the gaps left by the book, when it comes to the Necromancer. Also Smaug was great! As a whole I am a fan, so maybe I am a bit too fussy about the details. So if you do not have problems with long movies, I am sure you would enjoy ""The Desolation of Smaug""."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","5","14 December 2013"," A wobbly second-leg of a three chapter trilogy with a cool looking dragon at its center.
","It is hard to be too critical of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"", the second leg of Peter Jackson's three-legged trilogy. Without the final piece in place, it's hard to know where you stand with this movie. Like any other ""Part 2 of 3"", it suffers from middle child syndrome. Last year's underrated opening chapter ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" was a bright and cheery red-blooded adventure so entertaining that it made my 10 best list. This second chapter is not as interesting. It meanders and stumbles. It has some wonderful action pieces, but you get the feeling that Tolkien's world is lost in a morass of long fight scenes and special effects.<br/><br/>The major difference between the first chapter and the second one is that the focus has shifted. In the earlier film Jackson maintained a nicely modulated subtext in which Bilbo learns a lesson in personal responsibility. Given a mission by Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellan) Bilbo rides along with a company of Dwarfs on an all-important mission. This film moves the focus of the story to the Dwarfs themselves. The pint-sized baker's dozen are on a mission to reclaim their old homeland of Erebor which is seated in an area called The Lonely Mountain. Long ago, the dwarfs were driven out and the place is now inhabited by a fearsome dragon.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds of the movie involve the journey getting to the Lonely Mountain and picking up allies and enemies along the way. One thing that Jackson is able to accomplish with this second chapter is the sense that things are growing darker. Bilbo's earlier journey was cheery and sunny where this one is dark and overcast. The world seems to be converging on Bilbo and his traveling companions. Mighty Orcs are asserting their dominance and the dark forces of the world seem to be gathering. To defend against these forces, the party is joined by a boatman named Bard (Luke Evans); trusty old Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and an elf guard named Turiel (Evangeline Lily) – a creation of Jackson, not Tolkien – whose presence is welcome because it doesn't impede on the story's forward momentum. She's there to give this male dominated story some much needed Girl Power, and she doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Where the movie comes alive is in its third act, when Bilbo's true purpose for being on this mission is put into action. He is recruited to walk into The Lonely Mountain and retrieve The Arkenstone, a mystical jewel that is the stone of power for the Dwarfs. The interiors of Erebor are a marvel of art direction. Darkened, once glorious, cavernous walls of the castle chambers are packed almost to the ceiling with mountains of gold over which Scrooge McDuck might have wept. Here Bilbo's mettle is tested, as he must outwit a particularly ill-tempered dragon named Smaug - voiced with slithery charm by Benedict Cumberbatch. The sight of Smaug is astonishing. The special effects team has done a wonderful job of creating a realistic three-dimensional dragon that actually looks flesh and blood. Even better, he has a personality. Smaug understands clearly the weight of his own power and influence and he gloats happily. His movements are reptilian but also somewhat balletic. Credit must also go to Cumberbatch whose distinctive voice gives the character its snake-like demeanor.<br/><br/>You could only wish that the rest of the movie were that magical. It isn't a bad movie, just a very busy and unfocused one. Jackson is a very busy bee getting the knots untied from the last movie so he can get busy tying new knots for the next one. The result an extraordinarily busy movie with so much plot that the grandeur and wonderment of Tolkien's world is only glimpsed in fleeting glances. When it is all over, you're left with the feeling that the movie will possibly play better when viewed as a whole with the other two parts. Standing alone, it's kind of a mess.<br/><br/>*** (of four)"

"SmedlyMc","10","1","6","26 July 2014"," An Unexpected Improvement.....
","When you consider how brilliant the Lord Of The Rings films were, the first Hobbit movie was a bit of a let down. I was half expecting its sequel, The Desolation of Smaug to have the same flaws, as well as those classic 'middle chapter' issues. I was however, wrong. Although it did have some of the flaws seen in An Unexpected Journey, it was a huge improvement. Starting where the last film left of, we see Thorin Oakenshield's company running away from evil Azog's Orc pack. Unlike AUJ, Desolation Of Smaug gets going straight away. Within the first twenty minutes the Company are sprinting over fields and hills, desperately trying to get away from Beorn, a shape changer, who turns out to be neither friend or foe. As usual, the settings in this film are incredible, as are the costumes, makeup and prosthetics. Mirkwood was a particular favourite of mine. It was a perfect adaptation of how Tolkien described it in the book. Speaking of books, there was a few changes in DOS that weren't exactly popular. I understand translating a 300 page book and numerous appendices into a 9 hour trilogy must be hard, but even so, there was no need (in my opinion) to add Tauriel. Although I enjoyed her actions scenes, there really isn't any point of her being there. All she does is create an unnecessary 'love interest' for Kili and mess up the original story even more. The apparent love triangle between her, Kili and Legolas (who also shouldn't of been there) put a tiny bit of dampener on the whole thing. Negativity aside, Ian McKellen's faithful performance as Gandalf was as good as ever. Luke Evan's also did a fantastic job playing Bard, capturing the character exactly how I had imagined him. Stephen Fry also put in an admirable performance as the Master of Laketown. However the thing I love most of all was Smaug. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect for the role and really deserves all the praise he gets. Not only was he terrifying, he was convincing. Overall it was a HUGE improvement on the first chapter, with plenty of action and near misses to keep you amused during the almost 3 hour run time (Goodness knows how long the Extended Editions are going to be). With this in mind, I have high hopes for the defining chapter, The Battle Of The Five Armies (Unless Jackson has changed it again....)which is being released this December."
"submarine1977","8","1","6","4 May 2014"," The Journey Continues
","Thirteen years ago Peter Jackson began the adventure, which has erased the belief that J. R. R. Tolkien's universe is impossible to be filmed, the notion reinforced by ambitious, but infamous ""The Lord of the Rings"" directed by Ralph Bakshi about fifteen years before. The vision served by Jackson and his crew has proved that an appropriate vision may not only give fruitful results, but also be groundbreaking in both of development of visual aspects and the genre, considered to be extinct long time ago. Few years after completing the successful trilogy ""Lord of the Rings"", Peter Jackson announced that not only would ""The Hobbit"", a book that precedes the action from the trilogy, be conveyed into film reel, but also it would be divided on three installments. This statement was accepted by fans with both of enthusiasm and anxiety. The first part of the new trilogy, which had it's premiere one year ago, proved that Jackson may achieve success by such division. Is such feeling present in the new one?<br/><br/>The story is being continued right in the place, where the previous movie was finished. The group of Dwarfs proceeds their journey to the kingdom, which once belonged to them. The path to their destination if full of obstacles, which may be overcome by their wit and, especially, mutual cooperation. In the mean time, Gandalf, sensing upcoming war decides to split with his comrades and learns that Sauron is being reborn. <br/><br/>Jackson once again proves that he has a good sense in selecting actors team. Sir Ian McKellen born for playing such Characters like Gandalf. Richard Armitage successfully conveys charismatic personality of Thorin the Oaken Shield. Martin Freeman is great in showing Bilbo's transition from a gentle hobbit to trusted companion of the journey. <br/><br/>It is not a surprise that the movie astonishes from technical point of view. New Zealand's landscapes are authentically breathtaking. If Peter Jackson decides to film other books from Tolkien's universe, New Zealand is a perfect place to do it. The story is absorbing, even though it proves the division on three movies to be more artificial. There are threads which have lack of satisfying conclusion. I was completely indifferent to the love plot between Tauriel and Legolas. The duo has not enough time to make their plot touching. I hope the director's cut will include more scenes between them in order to make their story more important and touching. <br/><br/>Overall, these downsides are not overwhelming enough to mitigate the entertainment derived from the movie. Peter Jackson successfully proves that he has heart for making movies based on Tolkien's works. I hope the third movie will maintain this notion."

","I don't want to say "" The best"" but it was near to say that. The action and the people at the movie almost good. I thought as a second part of this movie to be more attracting and more powerful. Really when I watched this movie with my wife was was not able to go to bathroom or leave our sofa. Attraction only...... like a magneto but.... we expected more of this type of movies... Why I say that??? Lets begin at the forest where all spiders hunting the hobbits. It was slow action and any small kid can watch without attraction. I thought this to be more fear and frighten especially as the forest is too much maze!!! Anther thing I loved the way the spider become to net the body. Other note I have for the people named as JIN. As we know the JIN is too much powerful creature than humans,, why they already shown as weak?? And how the master of them was not able to detect the invisible person??? The best action of this movie was at two place only (in my opinion) 1- the river action when the fat hobbit was jumping from one point to the other and still fighting at the same. 2- the flying of the golden dragon. The movie was not concentrating about the dark power (the devil eye).. I hope the next part do that... at the end I say it was nice movie and I give these point to it: Music 22/25 --- Visual Effects 25/25 --- Story 20/25 (as it a continue to lord of the rings) -- entertaining 25/25 --- so the total is 92/100"

","While I enjoyed the first Hobbit film, it did feel like it left a bit to be desired. This was no surprise, as everything that I loved about the book was in the second half. I knew that I would be waiting for all the good stuff with the second and third films. And sure enough, the second film delivers where the first film didn't quite excite as much as I had wanted. While it isn't perfect and does unnecessarily deviate a bit, this is easily better than the first film, giving us a bigger, bolder adventure and a more interesting Bilbo Baggins this time around.<br/><br/>Before I get to the good stuff, let me get my complaints out of the way. My biggest complaint are the unnecessary plot threads. There seems to be a big need for this series of films to tie into LotR, and I really don't understand why. A great deal of time is taken in this film to introduce us to things we already know the outcome of. We're, at points, taken away from the dwarfs and Bilbo to follow Gandalf as he goes off on his own adventure to uncover the growing evil of Sauron and his armies. Like the first film, it's completely unnecessary, but unlike that film, it's jarring. We're ripped from a fantastic adventure to a story that we don't really need to know and has no real relation to the dwarfs and their adventure. In fact, any time we're taken out of the company of the dwarfs, it almost feels cheap. The almost romance between Evangeline Lily's elf and the dwarf Kili feels something of the same, the whole lot of these stories coming off as filler in an effort to make time for three movies instead of just two. It feels like a stretch and brings a screeching halt to the momentum of the main story.<br/><br/>That said, the rest of the film is an excellent and expertly crafted adaptation. There is a definite sense of character growth, especially from Bilbo, who seems to struggle with the power of the ring and it's greed. We already know where this goes, but it is none the less fascinating considering who he was when we first met him. The dwarfs seem to almost take a back seat here. They are less prominent, with the exception of Thorin and Balin, who take front and center. That isn't to say they aren't entertaining, as they usually are every time they are on screen. Thorin is the real standout though, as he goes through similar changes as Bilbo, which lends them an interesting comparison in their mutual struggles. The actors are all excellent once again in their respective roles, with Freeman once again being the standout. Evangeline Lily is also a pleasant surprise in an original role as an elf created for the film. She adds a much needed feminine touch to an otherwise predominantly male cast. She proves herself to be a fine silver screen presence and hopefully this will net her some further film roles.<br/><br/>While the film does an excellent job of not simply being the middle film, something The Two Towers struggled with in the LotR trilogy, it is the action, set pieces, and effects which are the true stars. This may not be a LotR movie, but it's close. We almost immediately start out with a bang and it rarely lets up. Of course, much of what happens early on, as exciting as it may be, pales in comparison to it's explosive and lengthy climax. Smaug is quite possibly the best creation of any of the film, Hobbit or LotR. He is as awesome as you could have hoped for and Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role. While effects have been applied to his voice to give it more boom, he does a fantastic job as the sneering, wise, and boastful dragon. Watching and listening to him face off against Bilbo is a delightful treat, and that is before we get to any fire breathing and chasing. What follows is a lengthy conclusion to the film that will excite and delight all. I have no qualms in saying that Smaug makes the entire film worth the admission of price. But don't go in expecting a solid conclusion. This is, after all, the second of a trilogy, so you can surely expect the film to leave you salivating for the next one.<br/><br/>While this new Hobbit film still doesn't reach LotR heights, it is superior to the previous film, especially when it comes to being an enjoyable adventure. It feels like it matters to the trilogy and delivers on being an epic. And I simply can't rave enough about Smaug. If you didn't enjoy the first film, you may find yourself feeling about the same here. But at least this one has a cool dragon."

","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is in my opinion a great movie. The best I've seen in a very long time. It has everything a good movie needs: epic scenes, a good storyline, cool characters and a bit of humor.<br/><br/>What I don't understand is that people keep comparing this movie to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Because you can't. See this movie as a whole new adventure, not as a sequel to The Lord of the Rings. People keep saying that it doesn't look like The Lord of the Rings at all, but that's the intention. Otherwise, it would become very prosy if everything was just the same.<br/><br/>So I'll say it again. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is a great movie. It looks beautiful, like everything in this movie. I think it's better than An Unexpected Journey. So go watch this movie, and don't let the reviews keep you from watching it. Because you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review, people. And please, stop comparing this movie to The Lord of the Rings."
"giovannigs88","8","1","6","1 February 2014"," Amazing movie for something still PG-13
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a major upgrade to the first Hobbit movie. Only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect 10 was several cliché lines especially with the Dragon. Sometimes it felt like the script had a time lapse and characters were using words and phrases I wouldn't necessarily attribute to people from ""middle-earth"" and it wasn't Tolkien like. However the entire cinematography was amazing, But like most Peter Jackson films, some of the action scenes became a jumbled mess and you can't even keep up with it. It does however keep your attention and for a movie 160 minutes long, you have to keep an audience attention and it did just that. <br/><br/>I love the Lord of The Rings Trilogy and I actually read those books (I did not read the Hobbit), I'll say I like Bilbo Baggins character so much more than Frodo's since he had similarities with Samwise Gamgee. Frodo was too melodramatic and too cowardly to the point it became annoying while Bilbo is more balanced between cowardice and bravery. <br/><br/>The plot development was captivating and the storyline shifting between several different characters in several different locations was done well. It gave me an anxious feeling, like I wonder what is going to happen next and it was never entirely predictable as most movies geared toward kids AND adults are. The filming of it, the pace of it as well as the dialog was perfect for a broad age of audience. <br/><br/>Great film, I can't wait for the next one."

","You've seen his King Kong. Now prepare for Peter Jackson's Donkey Kong. About an hour into the raucously entertaining middle slab of the Hobbit trilogy, having already tangled with hissing arachnids, a fearsome bear-man and sundry other perils, our posse of undersized heroes clamber into wooden casks and are lobbed into what's not so much an action sequence as an unrelenting pile-up of lunatic, barrel-based gags. As they rocket down-river, pursued by elves and orcs (who are simultaneously waging war in the branches above), oak cylinders fly at the camera, plunge down fizzing waterfalls and bounce off rocks to scatter servants of evil like skittles. As rousing and inventive as Kong's triple-T-Rex face-off, this multi-million-dollar flume ride is — with apologies — barrels of fun. And to think that at this stage in the last film, the dwarfs were still loading the dishwasher.<br/><br/>While An Unexpected Journey had plenty of bucolic charm, it did, for a Middle-earth film, feel oddly inconsequential. The Desolation Of Smaug remedies that. Moody, urgent and, for want of a better word, Ringsier, it's a much more satisfying film. If anything, it dispenses with early events with something approaching impatience: Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), the aforementioned bear-man, is left behind before we've really had a chance to savour his peculiar brand of beastly intensity (though no doubt he'll be back to claw up baddies in the Battle Of Five Armies), and the same goes for Mirkwood's hallucinatory boughs, which have the company tripping balls in a variety of amusing ways.<br/><br/>One problem with the former film was that it re-trod too closely the footsteps of the Fellowship: it was difficult to share Bilbo's awe at entering Rivendell, given that we'd already been there 11 years before. Here, you can feel Jackson's relief at having entirely new worlds in which to play. The forest domain of the Silvan Elves has beauty edged with menace, plus it gives Lee Pace (great as the dagger-eyed Thranduil) an amazing elk-horned throne. But the real standouts are Lake-town and Erebor, contrasting but equally stunning showcases of production design. The former, a fog-shrouded, Dickensian burg that we're informed ""stinks of fish oil and tar"", is a new, pleasingly earthy flavour for Middle-earth. Like Edoras in The Two Towers, it was largely built for real and bristles with detail. Kingdom-under-the-mountain Erebor, on the other hand, is the kind of mad location that could only exist on a Weta mega-computer, its centrepiece a stash of wealth so vast it would give Scrooge McDuck a quacking fit.<br/><br/>As Bilbo (a still spot-on Martin Freeman) and co. near their destination, the film gets increasingly busy, splitting the group in two and intercutting between those strands and Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who's off poking around the ruins of Dol Guldur. That storyline still hasn't quite caught fire (it basically amounts to the wizard yelling at a giant, evil ink-blot), and it could be argued that more screen time might have been usefully given to the dwarfs, who remain largely anonymous. Besides Thorin (Richard Armitage), whose facade of nobility is beginning to crumble, revealing baser motives beneath, the only one who gets much attention is Kili (Aidan Turner), vying with a returning Legolas (Orlando Bloom) for the attentions of auburn-haired elf ninja Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). As love triangles go, it's fairly rote — and might have been more dramatic were Kili not the one dwarf who looks like an elf anyway — but Tauriel, a character created for the film who's already got some Tolkienites raging, fits seamlessly into the world and gets to execute several pleasingly brutal orc-kills: at points, the film's one arrow-in-the-head away from turning into The Raid.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry and Ryan Gage give good sleaze in their brief appearances as Lake-town's venal Master and his aide, Alfrid. Luke Evans is surprisingly Welsh as hero-in-waiting Bard The Bowman. But the standout new character is, predictably, the titular beast. He's played Khan; now Benedict Cumberbatch draws on Shere Khan for his performance (vocal and mo-cap) as the blazing-eyed, honey-voiced, spike-helmed ""serpent of the north"". We've seen many a dragon on screen before, but nothing with this much personality: Smaug is a startlingly well-executed creation, toggling between arrogance, indolence and rage as he uses his wyrm-tongue to try to draw out Bilbo. And once he does, the film kicks into full throttle for an immense, half-hour finale that threatens to bring down the mountain itself. It's Jackson once more at the top of his game; God knows what he has in store for part three."
"zurnd","9","1","6","20 January 2014"," Do Not Talk To Me Of Dragon Fire!
","Okay, I have to admit, when I first heard that the Hobbit was going to be split into three movies, I was a bit skeptical. Why is Peter Jackson taking Tolkien's shortest book and chopping it apart like sushi? If he was doing that, he should have split each Lord of the Rings story into three movies. But I will admit, An Unexpected Journey was a fun, entertaining adventure, even if it dragged in a few sections, and The Desolation of Smaug, while it had a similar problem, ultimately proved to be a stronger film. Much like The Empire Strikes Back and Judgment Day before it, The Desolation of Smaug is one of those sequels that can be argued to be better or just as good as it's predecessor. <br/><br/>The second chapter of the Hobbit trilogy, like the first film, takes a good chunk of Tolkien's original tale and expands upon it, adding new characters, subplots and action to make the world of the Hobbit much more broad. All our favorite characters return as this flick picks up where the last left off. There's Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, Fili, Kili, Bofur, Bombur, Dopey, Sleepy, Happy, Doc....oh sorry, wrong movie...oh you get the picture. And Martin Freeman is just as believable as ever while portraying Bilbo, the wielder of the One Ring and the unexpected hero to save the dwarfs' behinds. Ian McKellan's Gandalf is spectacular as always and it was great to see him kick Necromancer rump in Dol Guldur. Then there's Orlando Bloom, putting on his elf ears once more and wielding his bow as Legolas, the wisecracking, showoff elf. He's accompanied by a female elf named Tauriel, who throughout the film, develops a bit of a relationship with dwarf Kili. Just imagine what the children will look like! <br/><br/>I also liked Doctor Who star Sylvester Mccoy as Radaghast, who is an expert at building bird nests on top of his head. There's also the quick and wise Thrandueil, Bard the Bowman, the skin changer Beorn, a couple of giant spiders and the giant lizard himself, Smaug. Portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness), Smaug is as intimidating as he is massive and no where near as ridiculous as his 1970s Rankin Bass counterpart. This Smaug is scary and sure to make all kiddies in the theater wet their underoos. Every time I heard that dark, raspy voice, I wanted to flee to the bedroom closet and snuggle with Mr. Cuddles. He's one of the greatest and scariest dragons ever portrayed on film. Hiccup, you and Toothless better avoid this dragon! <br/><br/>The look of the film is dazzling, from the golden piles in Smaug's chambers to the foggy, glowing glow of Laketown, to the claustrophobic, cluttered land of the elves. And Dol Guldur, home of Sau...I mean the Necromancer is like a spooky cemetery or haunted burial ground. And don't expect to get a happy ending with this flick. The ending to the Desolation of Smaug is as bittersweet as it is terrifying and let's hope that when There and Back Again arrives in 2014, all loose ends will be tied and Bilbo can return to his cozy little home at Bag End and overtime, turn into the dude from Alien 1. The Desolation of Smaug was fun, more fun than An Unexpected Journey, although that film is still worth a dozen views. Let's hope There and Back Again is the perfect conclusion to this awesome trilogy and leads into The Fellowship of the Ring just as well as Revenge of the Sith lead into A New Hope."
"ancoraa","7","1","6","18 January 2014"," Good, but too Many Changes
","I'm no purist, but major plot changes or unnecessary romance easily drives me up the wall. While Desolation of Smaug had many changes in it, many of them minor, I did feel them piling up. I will say that it was better than An Unexpected Journey, though the second installment has its fair share of flaws, too.<br/><br/>Good Aspects: Overall, the acting was spectacular. I was especially a fan of Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch's performances as Bilbo and Smaug. Also, some of the changes didn't bother me. However, these are only the scenes that help add some personality and give some character development. Thorin, Kili, Thranduil, and Bard all get some extra screen time to help develop their characters. Bilbo is always a fun character watch and I enjoyed every moment he was on screen; his scene with Smaug was my absolute favorite. As for Smaug, he looks amazing and Cumberbatch does a superb job voicing him. Gandalf's scenes at Dol Guldur are also welcome, as we get more of an explanation on why he wasn't with the dwarfs and Bilbo for most of the story. While I felt there was too much CGI, it still looks gorgeous. Mirkwood looks menacing, the scene with the butterflies was beautifully done, and I loved how Lake-town looks. <br/><br/>Negative Aspects: I don't really understand how Legolas and Tauriel advance the plot. I'm actually okay with Tauriel, but she really doesn't do much for the story. And the Kili/Tauriel romance is annoying and forced. As for Legolas, I would have been one-hundred percent fine with him making a few appearances in Mirkwood; I was fine with him helping capture the dwarfs. But the extra time he got, going to Lake-town with Tauriel and such, was unneeded. Some of the scenes act as filler, which I found very annoying. The barrel scene was over-the-top, and making it more similar to what happened in the book would have been a much better decision. Another unnecessary scene was a chase scene with Smaug and the dwarfs, which made the dragon look rather incompetent.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this movie. They made many changes to it, and while I'm fine with some of them, others are unneeded."

"Laakbaar","7","1","6","1 January 2014"," Not as good as ""Unexpected Journey""
","It's impossible to deny that Jackson's team have produced another fast-paced, action-filled adventure movie that is visually astonishing because of its CGI effects. The scene in the treasure room with the dragon was particularly remarkable. The elf king was an interesting character. I was pleasantly surprised to see Fry in the movie, and I enjoyed his portrayal as the Lord of Lakeland.<br/><br/>However, I didn't particularly enjoy this 2nd Hobbit movie. I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the first one.<br/><br/>The orcs were suitably vicious-looking, but it soon became clear that this movie was like a video game where the main point was to kill as many orcs as possible in two minutes. They certainly seem easy to kill.<br/><br/>It was just three hours of chasing and noble speeches really. Most of Jackson's movies are like that, although ""Unexpected Journey"" transcended it. <br/><br/>Let me disclose that, although I am a science fiction fan, I am not into fantasy fiction and LotR. When I was younger, I tried several times to get into LotR, but without success. (I did read ""The Hobbit"" in high school because it was mandatory.) I find the LotR universe tedious and overly complicated. I did not really enjoy Jackon's LotR trilogy, although I sat through all three movies. I'd like to see a movie about the real medieval world for a change, rather than one filled with imaginary creatures. I'm tired of dwarfs and orcs.<br/><br/>However, unlike many of the reviewers here apparently, I very much enjoyed the first slower-paced more character-driven Hobbit movie. That was a movie that came close to reproducing the slower feel of the Original book. I was hoping this one would be as good as that...but it wasn't."

As a big fan of Tolkien's work, i like all of the added features from Tolkien's unreleased work and as the movie goes on you never want it to end. I think the movie is allowed to sway away from the source material as long as it is to the movie's benefit.

Unlike the first, which is all talk and more talk, Desolation of Smaug is a fun movie with visually stunning environment, great action sequences, engaging story, bad-ass elves(I'm talking about Legolas and Tauriel, of course, dwarfs, a hobbit, a wizard, and an awesome dragon.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen still stands out as Gandalf. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is now starting to feel the effects of the One Ring and Thorin (Armitage) is now showing his selfish nature. The surprise of all is Smaug who is voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's Sherlock, Star Trek Into Darkness). Even though he only provides the voice, Cumberbatch makes Smaug awesome. And if you have seen the trailer, well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Smaug is one the best (or probably the best) dragons on film. There also cool action sequences. What I like the most is the one with the barrels in the river. Trailer showed as just a walk in the park, but wait 'til you see the movie.<br/><br/>I really haven't read the book, but I am a fan of the LOTR Trilogy and this movie convinced me to read the book of The Hobbit. It's because I really want more after I saw the film. The only downside, for me, with this movie is the growing relationship between Kili and Tauriel. I really don't buy it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is in the same level, or in a bit lower level, with the LOTR Trilogy and I can't wait for the last film: There and Back Again."

"zenitsky-872-664469","7","1","6","16 December 2013"," Big fan....now here are some issues I had....
","These are my observations after having seen the film, and yes, they do contain spoilers. Read at your own discretion. I'm a huge fan of LOTR, and really loved the first Hobbit film last year. That being said, here are some issues I had with this second film. And let me state at the top: I fully understand that this is Jackson's film based on Tolkien's work and is not meant to be a literal translation from the text.<br/><br/>Firstly, some characters, specifically Gandalf and Legolas, are venturing into superhero status in this film, and it is not a good thing. Clearly they both survive this trilogy and make it into LOTR, so their survival is never in question, but neither character in this movie displays any sense of fear or vulnerability. Remember that great scene in Return of the King where Gandalf basically prepares Pippin for death? Or how about that scene in The Two Towers where Legolas loses his faith and laments that the men and boys defending Helms Deep are too young and too old, and that they'll never win? We can feel for these characters because we would certainly be afraid if placed in the same situation. It was character development at its finest. In this film, however, any sense of this empathy was absent. Like I said, we know that Gandalf and Legolas survive these movies going in, but it almost seems like they know it too, if that makes sense, and their actions in this film verge on reckless.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this piggybacks on my first statement about vulnerability: We're 2/3 of the way into a trilogy involving more than a dozen good guys on a journey, not to mention a good bit of secondary good-guy characters, and all are being hunted by packs of brutal orcs, wargs, spiders, goblins, trolls and a vile fire-breathing dragon. Yet, no one dies. How are we, as the audience, supposed to understand what is at stake or what the odds are, if no good guy dies? Not a single one. This also robs the bad guys of any credibility. You can make the meanest, most disfigured, gruesome-looking baddies an audience has ever seen, but if they continually fail at accomplishing anything whatsoever, it's difficult to view them as anything more than minor bumps in the road. (Also, how many times did Smaug refrain from incinerating Bilbo and the dwarfs during the climactic scene? There were a few times where he could have hit them with a loogey and instead just decided it best to snarl at them.) <br/><br/>My third issue with this film is the blatant recycling of LOTR plot devices and even camera shots. In this film, we get a brand new female elf. In both movies she is beautiful and falls in love with a member of another species in an act of forbidden love. In both movies there is a scene where she uses herbs to heal a character who has been stabbed and there is an angelic shot of her doing so with a white background and pretty singing. Also, both movies have the exact same plot device surrounding the human hero having to live with something his ancestor did in the past. With Aragorn, his ancestor refused to destroy the one ring when he had the chance. With Bard, his ancestor was unable to kill Smaug when he had the chance. It's almost as if the writers forgot that we just saw the LOTR movies a decade ago, and decided to reuse plot points they liked and thought worked. I'm open to feedback. Obviously, you're free to disagree with me, but I had trouble getting past a lot of these issues."

","I think The Desolation of Smaug will polarize viewers on its action sequences: either you'll love them, and that in itself will make the movie a success, or you will, like me, find them far too dragged-out and unnecessarily embellished in comparison to that which was quite concise in the original story.<br/><br/>That being said, Jackson's fifth venture into the Tolkien Universe is still on form, if being fair. <br/><br/>Desolation of Smaug is an entertaining watch whose main flaw is its length. The Lord of the Rings worked as a twelve hour epic because there was simply that much story to be told. The Hobbit is really just a two hour movie drawn out and padded to feel more Rings-y. An unfortunate side effect of this is that the title role has been marginalized, in favor of some of the bigger characters. In the book, Thorin plays part of the sub-plot, not the main plot, but this role seems to have been swapped with Bilbo's, which is a shame because Martin Freeman is well cast as Bilbo and brings the right mix of sincerity and humor to the part.<br/><br/>In short, Jackson's expansions in the story don't add much except to pad the movie, which in more generic terms might be referred to as poorly edited. I'd say that with Desolation of Smaug, Jackson has not improved on the first movie but The Hobbit continues to faithfully represent what is in the book and is roughly as good as the book but the additions add up to nothing."
"skulduggery72","Null","1","6","14 December 2013"," Fairly good action film that could have been great!
","Its better that AUJ, but could have been a lot better. Once again Jackson spoils things by trying to make the Hobbit as epic and big (or bigger) than LOTRs. The good bits.The film starts well (Bree) and moves at a fast pace so no one can moan about it being slow or boring. The cgi is better and as usual Alan Lee and John Howe have made all the new locations look great. Beorn's brief scenes are good, Mirkwood is creepy and the spiders scene is excellent, here Bilbo gets to shine and rescue the dwarfs and having Legolas and the elves turn up to extend the action also worked well. The Woodland realm was good with a good performance from Lee Pace and again Bilbo saves the day by rescuing everyone. The Barrel escape is very good with some nice cgi and good action. Lake town looks great and Bard's extended role works well. I had no problem splitting the dwarfs up here as this gave Bard more screen time. Smaug looked great and was voiced amazingly. His scenes will Bilbo were great he really came across as a vain, powerful, sly, evil,intelligent dragon. Gandalf in Dol Guldur also worked well, it showed Gandalf using his magic very well and the confrontation with Sauron was great.<br/><br/>The Bad bits. Gandalfs pointless visit to the Nazgul tombs, it almost felt like it had been put it just so Gandalf wasn't off screen to long. Tauriel and Kili, this is a stupid addition to the story line, I had no problem with Tauriel as an action elf female killing orcs but for her to like a dwarf was to much. The way Kili looks to human has always annoyed me, now we know why, so an elf can fancy him!!! Their first scene in the elven prison was OK but it was the forced, cheesy healing scene in lake town that was painful to watch, the fact that it was a rip-off of Arwen healing Frodo made it even worse and afterwards when Kili woke up and was saying some drivel about love and he went to hold her hand- painful to watch. The ending with the dwarfs versus smaug using the forges,was way to over the top and after Smaugs intelligent intro with Bilbo this scene made him look stupid the way the dwarfs kept evading him. Like in AUJ you wonder how none of the dwarfs died in these scenes with Smaug and all his fire, and the part with e giant gold statue!!! This entire extended action scene with Smaug was my worst part of the film and left me feeling empty when leaving the cinema (Despite all the previous good parts mentioned above) It once again showed that Jackson thinks that every scene has to be action packed and over long to be good, he succeeded with the Extended spiders, barrels scenes and Dol Guldur but for me failed badly with this extended Dwarf - Smaug confrontation ending. Overall I feel let down again by Jackson, it was a good action film but doesn't come close to the LOTRs in any way. I'm scoring 7.5/10"
"japamo","9","1","7","17 September 2014"," As in ""An Unexpected Journey"", ""Desolation of Smaug"" Still Preserves the Novel's Inherent Spirit and Themes
","Despite ""Hobbit"" purists' frenzied accusation of director Peter Jackson's ""Hobbit"" movie trilogy's lack of stringent, precise loyalty to the source material, I believe such loyalty is unrealistic. No movie can exactly duplicate a novel's characteristics; if it attempts to do so, it becomes ponderous, sluggish and dull.<br/><br/>Take for example the scene near the beginning of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (hereafter ""Hobbit:DOS"") where Bilbo, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the dwarfs encounter the ursine, muscular shapeshifter Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) at his pastoral home. If ""Hobbit:DOS"" had copied the Beorn episode exactly from the novel, it would have become mired in redundant exposition, since Gandalf relates to Beorn the adventures he and his followers have already endured in order to enlist the surly loner's aid in their quest. Instead, ""Hobbit: DOS"" makes the Beorn sequence more economically streamlined and actually more meaningful. Although Beorn is no fan of dwarfs (which is why he angrily pursues them in his bear form), he decides to help them because they oppose the orcs and their confederates. Beorn hates orcs and their company even more, since they have decimated and enslaved Beorn's bear bretheren in the past (he waves a brawny, shackled arm as proof). Though some may complain that the admittedly fiercely charismatic and ""bada$$"" Beorn gets truncated, limited screen time, ""Hobbit: DOS"" manages, I think, to capture the sequence's intent in the novel, and even embellish and extend it to the imminent, encompassing evil of the Necromancer and his legions.<br/><br/>Throughout the novel's notable set-pieces - From Beorn , through Bilbo and the dwarfs' enchanted, perilous wanderings through the aptly named Mirkwood, through their battle with huge, voracious spiders, through their imprisonment in the Elvish citadel, through their gymnastically stunning and suspenseful escape from the citadel in floating barrels, to their initially furtive and demeaning but ultimately triumphant arrival in Laketown, to their journey to the Lonely Mountain to try to wrest the dwarfs' homeland from the unforgettable dragon Smaug – through all this, ""Hobbit:DOS"" continues to preserve each sequence's basic purpose and meaning in the novel despite some tweakings and deviations. Most of the deviations originate from implacable orc Azog the Defiler's (Manu Bennett) Ahab-like dogged pursuit of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) for causing his deformity, and from the elves' (namely Terminator-like warriors Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) enhanced presence and intercession in the dwarfs' quests. Except for what I felt was a gratuitous, inexplicable (if still affecting), growing relationship between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), these deviations and detours do not detract from ""Hobbit:DOS""'s deliberate but fluid, action-packed, and genuinely exciting and involving interpretation. Indeed, I felt the deviations emphasized the ""Hobbit"" novel's indirect reference to the looming threat of the Necromancer and its understated insistence that it is the duty of ALL Middle-Earth denizens (including the isolationist elves represented by Elvenking Thranduil) to face this pervasive evil.<br/><br/>Therefore, Jackson's ""Hobbit:DOS"" does have epic objectives above and beyond the dwarfs' quest. But again, I strongly disagree with the purists and other naysayers who argue that ""Hobbit:DOS"" gives short shrift to Bilbo, Thorin, and his band. Even though his transition from reluctant bourgeois homebody to committed adventurer, inspiration to the dwarfs, and even defender seems more abrupt in the movie, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) nevertheless makes his conversion convincing. As in the novel, Bilbo proves his worth and value to the group and even (horrors!) faces the beguiling, mellifluous, but monstrous and seemingly invincible dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) even without his ring of invisibility. He even persuades the dwarfs, who fearfully do not encounter Smaug in the novel, to show their true legendary courage and confront the dragon in their stolen lair – which I actually think is a logical, plausible improvement.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit"" novel touches upon themes of courage, self-reliance, greed, and the duty to resist evil in all its myriad forms. ""The Hobbit:DOS"" reflects these themes in its somewhat divergent, wildly dynamic and entertaining but still respectful cinematic presentation of Tolkien's vision and depiction of (as Balin (Ken Stott) would agree) that most remarkably daring and observant fellow Bilbo."
"rannynm","9","1","7","28 March 2014"," True to the Book!
","""The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug"" is the second installment of the three part series adapted from the best selling novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. A prequel to the epic trilogy ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Hobbit"" follows young Bilbo Baggins, played by Martin Freeman, as he accompanies Gandalf and the Dwarfs on a quest to rid their home of the evil dragon Smaug. In ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" the Dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf find themselves not only having to face the evil dragon that destroyed the Dwarf Kingdom, but they also have to deal with the threat of the Orcs, the Elves and the Necromancer. Thorin, the exiled Dwarf King is desperately trying to free his people of the dreaded Smaug, but greed begins to overtake him when he starts to focus his attention on a precious stone that is being guarded by the dragon. Will the Dwarfs and Bilbo be triumphant in their epic quest, or will they awaken a power greater and more evil than they could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't very impressed by the first Hobbit film that was released in 2012, but ""Desolation of Smaug"" is incredible. The stunning 3D visuals really bring the work of Tolkien to life and, I think the darkness of this film fits a lot better with the ""Lord of the Rings"" series than the first film did. I really like the fact that they are making three movies off of the one book because I think if they tried to cram everything into one movie it would be way too much. I love the soundtrack in this film. The film has some really beautiful visuals and they are capture the original feel of the Tolkien series while also throwing in some really fun and upbeat tunes.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Bilbo Baggins because I absolutely adore Martin Freeman. He is such a versatile actor and can play very serious roles while also bringing in playful and comedic qualities. Martin also plays Watson in the BBC series ""Sherlock"" which is one of my favorite TV shows and I just love everything he's in. He really embodies the character Bilbo and it's very interesting to see the way Bilbo changes from the last film. His character development is great and Martin Freeman does a phenomenal job taking on that role.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Bilbo encounters Smaug for the first time. The exchange between the two characters is very interesting because Smaug seems very curious about Bilbo and doesn't immediately attack like you expect and Bilbo does everything he can to distract Smaug by complimenting him and talking circles around him. The whole scene has a lot of suspense but it's also very playful. I also love the look of Smaug and the CGI for him is incredible. They capture his features in such a wonderful way. You can really tell what he's feeling by the faces he makes and the very human expressions he has.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 13+ because there is a lot of action, violence and suspenseful situations. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and it is definitely a must see if you are a fan of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

The plot was well-organized, the conflicts fit the movie well and tied together seamlessly, and the action and effects are stunning. Also, I have to say that Bilbo's character is played perfectly, along with the rising inner conflict he has with the One Ring. However, the affair between Keeley and the Elf Huntress didn't add anything to the film. Perhaps this will come into play in the third movie.

"melissatindle","10","1","7","31 January 2014"," A Great Addition to the Hobbit Trilogy!
","This addition to the Hobbit trilogy (directed by Peter Jackson) is amazing, even better than the first, An Unexpected Journey (2012). The action is heavily concentrated in this movie, more than the first. I recommend this movie over the first, but to understand the story you need to watch the first one. From the beginning with Thorin (Richard Armitage) and Gandalf (IanMcKellen) meeting to the scene with Smaug(BenedictCumberbatch) flying to Lake- town, this movie will surely be a favorite of mine forever. I cannot wait until the third movie, There and Back Again, comes out this December (2014). I also recommend the Lord of the Rings trilogy (also directed by Peter Jackson), as well as reading the three Lord of the Rings books and the Hobbit book, all four by J.R.R. Tolkien."
"burger1124","9","1","7","31 January 2014"," Jackson's Return to Form
","It took Peter Jackson two films to finally get back to the Middle-Earth we know and love. Let's just be grateful he did. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug silences all contenders as this season's rollicking, enormous spectacle, one which must be seen in the intended 3-D to appreciate in its fullness.<br/><br/>And about that 3-D. Oh, what glorious stuff it is. Better than perhaps any film this year (save Alfonso Cuaron's groundbreaking Gravity), Smaug uses its 3-D to enhance the story rather than simply embellish it. Even if you tend not to plunk down an extra few bucks for the surcharge, you'll be glad you shelled out for this one. More about the technical specs later, though. Let's talk story.<br/><br/>For those who have seen the first entry into the Hobbit trilogy, An Unexpected Journey, you know the story: a rather reclusive hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (played with wonderful quirks by Martin Freeman) is practically forced into a dangerous mission by his friend, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan). The mission involves traveling with a group of a dozen dwarfs, led by the hot-tempered man who would be king, Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), to reclaim their homeland under the faraway Lonely Mountain, a kingdom ruled now by the destructive dragon Smaug. Bilbo's task is to sneak into the dragon's layer to retrieve a precious stone, the wielder of which holds the right to reign under the mountain.<br/><br/>Running concurrently with the journey to the mountain is a subplot involving a disembodied evil force which has taken refuge in a very scary CGI ghost town. It seems this force is a Necromancer, threatening to come to life and conjure a dark army for himself.<br/><br/>An Unexpected Journey ended with the Lonely Mountain in sight for our heroes, and the second leg of their journey proves to be the more exciting adventure thus far. The first film was a disappointment for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the faithfulness to the book's tone. The Hobbit is lighter fare than The Lord of the Rings, with happier songs and a bit more comedy. It works well on the page, but the film suffered for it. With Smaug, Jackson returns to the darker, more somber tone of the Rings films. He also proves that he is still a master of pacing: the numerous action sequences are at turns terrifying and comical, but always entertaining and hardly ever superfluous. <br/><br/>Being less faithful to the source material may get one into hot water with Tolkien purists, and I imagine that the addition of a newly- invented character will incur the ire of many. Tauriel (Evangeline Lily), a female warrior elf, serves basically as the object of both dwarf Kili's (Aidan Turner) and elf prince Legolas' (Orlando Bloom) affections. Nonetheless, the addition adds another layer to the story and gives Legolas' father, King Thranduil, plenty of opportunities to inform Tauriel she is beneath is son. As Thranduil, Lee Pace provides a performance so campy and outrageous it would make Tim Curry proud, but for some reason, it works.<br/><br/>With Smaug, everything works. The acting and direction are still top- notch, but the scripting has finally caught up to them. All the teasing of the first film pays off when we finally get a glimpse of the terrible dragon Smaug in all his glory, and it is truly a thing to behold. Not since Jurassic Park has a reptilian creature been so downright awe- inspiring, and with a voice by Benedict Cumberbatch ( in full ""Khan"" mode), Smaug should rival Gollum as a fan-favorite.<br/><br/>There is so much to say about The Desolation of Smaug. The new characters, locations, and plot revelations are handled exceptionally well by Jackson. The score, again by the brilliant Howard Shore, is back to par with the Rings films (try listening to the Lake Town theme and not be impressed). The 161-minute run time flies by, and leaves us on a cliffhanger almost as fulfilling as that of The Two Towers. In short, The Desolation of Smaug is simply one of the best times you will have at the Cineplex all year. It is smart entertainment, and great popcorn fare is hard to come by these days."
"victorvoga","10","1","7","22 January 2014"," Simply amazing!
","The second movie of the future Hobbit trilogy was made with a lot of patience; 10 times better than the first one!

"bright-chen97","8","1","7","28 December 2013"," Middle Earth's magic is back for another 3 enjoyable hours
","Middle Earth perhaps was not meant to look 'real' on screen, and I don't think Tolkien even intended it to be a 'earthly possible' world when he created it. They say the human mind are hardwired to advance into the surreal with every imagination and artistic exploration they attempt. My point? Peter Jackson's creative team have made Middle Earth an unrealistic, but spectacular world for us to wish to be part of. My proof? Who here didn't wish that they lived as hobbits in Hobbiton when you see that cute, peaceful and lazy village, where all you do is eat, drink and laugh? Who didn't cried and star wide-eyed at Rivendell when the harps and angelic choristers greeted the majestic waterfalls and mountain valleys of the Elf haven? Middle Earth is officially the most sought after vacation or living spot that doesn't exist.<br/><br/>Now, enough with Middle Earth itself and talk The Hobbit. This review is wholly intended as a review of the entire series with whatever that is available thus far, with strong emphasis on the 'Desolation of Smaug'. I managed to keep Lord of the Rings out because I know haters of the Hobbit series will see this a extreme bias to review new movies with a universal legendary trilogy as support.<br/><br/>Wow...where to begin? This is my favourite movie of the year and it tunneled itself past several long-standing contenders for the top.<br/><br/>The movie kicks straight into the action with a sense of urgency that actually lacked in the first movie, with the dwarfs and Bilbo continuing on their quest to reach Arebor and retrieve treasure from the dragon Smaug and a certain specific gemstone that's of the most importance to Thorin, leader of the company.<br/><br/>'An Unexpected Journey' did its part to celebrate the old trilogy and welcome us back to Middle Earth with new and colourful characters, while also giving us back 'The' Wizard, the jolly and fun Gandalf the Grey (Sir Ian McKellen) and a new Bilbo (Martin Freeman) who managed to crawl into my brain, and portray the character EXACTLY to my imagination, with even more humour and emotion. The dwarf gang still kills it in this film, all with their funny moments and heroics. Orlando Bloom's Legolas returns as a heartthrob, only with more ommmph in his character, due to his slightly more tender age and untested nature, his return is rightly justified by the presence of his father in the movie, so the haters have one argument terminated. The imagined Lady-elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) surprisingly filled a gap in Tolkien's gender diversity and introduced raw tenderness and romance in a package of knives and explosive ass-kicking when time requires it, its a risky move, but all done in good reason and to give the movie more heart and a heroine character that Arwen and Eowyn delivered in The Lord of the Rings. This movie cast radiates a certain originality that only Middle Earth can provide us, which is only fitting for a marvelled novel. Radagast? I'll say at least he acts like a more normal wizard in this movie, helping Gandalf on his side-quest, which actually feeds more directly to the entire Middle Earth history, no spoiling here. :)<br/><br/>Locations? The beauty and natural majesty of New Zealand is not overstated or exaggerated in the first movie. 'An Unexpected Journey's goal to return you to Middle Earth in the smoothest method paid off with vistas and real-life landscapes of that tiny country in the South. The second movie? S**t's getting serious here, and locations reflected that, and the underbelly, or the less inviting parts of the Middle Earth begins to show. Let's start with Mirkwood...One of the creepiest scenes you will ever see, and spiders...yes giant spiders in perfect CGI magic from the wizs and witches of Weta Workshop, Elves's domain? Remember the wood-elves are less friendly than Rivendell and their area of the woods reflect that. Laketown is another cinematic achievement with immersive environments that makes you forget its all a set-piece location (yes, no off- putting 100% CGI here! large sets are built for Laketown), the Bard's lack of characterisation in the novel is expanded welcomingly in the movie, which showed him a bad-ass archer with skills rivalling the elves , while also a family man with kids. Once again, I applaud Jackson's team for creating a cast of multi-dimensional characters with layers to unravel and explore.<br/><br/>Finally, for those who groan that the dragon was 'shown' in the trailer...you ain't seen nothing yet, because I know as a fact that a nose, an eye and a growl is not everything that a dragon can bring to the table. And Smaug? He's HUGE! He's a perfect villain with a wit and a voice to match. Cumberbatch's voice radiates terror and almost a sense of torment on whoever hears the dragon speak, the whole cinema shakes, with a tiny squeak from me in response. I can tell you now that the ending WILL leave you yearning for more. <br/><br/>Yet, out of ALL this, the One Ring still shows itself, almost as an afterthought, but that's the point isn't it? Its symbol as desire for power over others is never truly shown in everyone, but it exists in everyone, once again the movie explores that through Bilbo.<br/><br/>On the whole, a viewing spectacle that delivers enjoyment for the entire three hours. Those expecting an echo of the critics' complaints for its length of runtime will be disappointed, I feel that a movie this long is long enough to truly immerse you into its story, and this movie did it perfectly and with an ending that still leaves you wanting more, the typical 90 minute quick-dose of cheesy action from Hollywood is no longer adequate, and it's time the word 'patience' is used. How does anyone expect character development, drama, action and emotional ride in 90 minutes?"
"polar66720","10","1","7","26 December 2013"," A true blue unique fantasy film for the ages!
","Once you come to accept the unnecessary spanning of the source material into 3 films.... You realize that despite some oddball moments and flaws, that this movie is a district entry in the line of the middle earth films to date. Whereas the Lord of the Rings trilogy was a moodier apocalyptic fantasy film, shot with the aesthetic, of a historical biopic, and An Unexpected Journey having a more laid back whimsical proper English air about it, The Desolation of Smaug is, in my opinion, a true full blown fantasy epic. With amazing cinematography and thick atmosphere to boot. And what fantasy film would not be full circle without a dragon.... And here we have one. The best one ever! Everyone, including myself, is scratching their heads at the night and day quality of most of the films CGI when compared to the pristine photorealism of Smaug. My theory, they had to a tighter deadline, or something, that left little time for polishing all the effects, so they decided if only one thing could be of the ut-most quality it would be Smaug. And for me that is a reasonable and fully justified excuse and as a result, Smaug the dragon is a modern masterpiece of cgi art........ While other CGI moments are..... will......... Kinda Blah! The only real complaint I have, without mentioning the forced silly love triangle of the film, is that the movie is called ""THE HOBBIT"" yet the main character Bilbo is treated like a supporting character. I don't know what the exact total would be, but i think our HOBBIT has way less screen time than the dwarfs. The real crime here is it is a complete undermining of a stellar performance by the stellar actor Martin Freeman. Kind of lame and it was a problem I had with An Unexpected Journey as well. Wish they had made him an actual main character. The thing that i find the most interesting about this movie, is really the reception its invoked. It is downright violently polarized. People who love this movie ""LOVE IT!!!!"" While those who do not are on a torrent of hate mongering to strip this movie down and pummel it to nothing.... There is no ""Meh :l"" Reviews about it. Maybe I'm still just caught up in the sheer amazing atmosphere and visuals (Not necessarily Visual FX'S that is) And could be making a bigger deal about it, but history has proved almost every time a movie's reception has been so black and white they usually endure more that most movies. ""Blade Runner"" mostly comes to mind here. In conclusion this is one of the greatest fantasy films ever made, the look, (again, not necessarily the Fx's but the ambiance and epic cinematography) and that huge mother of a dragon, sets it apart from it's middle earth predecessors, as well as all other fantasy films making it one of the most unique fantasy film epics of all time."

","Beware: Spoiler Alert!!! Having so anticipated this movie for months, I can only say it surpassed my expectations. I was in such awe, unable to peel my eyes from the screen. Let me just make this clear before I continue: I'm a great fan of Tolkien's works, having read the Hobbit and LOTR on several occasions and the Silmarillion. I love Peter Jackson's take on Middle Earth. And I understand that to take three movies out of a 310-page book, you have to make additions and delve deeper into certain aspects. Peter Jackson has obviously done just that with this movie. And just as with any adaptation, you can't please everyone. I found the locations in this film completely stunning! Beorn's home, the Elven Halls and the Dwarven Hall/Smaug's lair were especially breathtaking and marvelous. I admit I was skeptical at first of the addition of a new Elf character, Tauriel, even more so when it seemed she would be solely a love interest. But I was intrigued by what I had seen in the trailers. And after seeing the movie, I found myself even more intrigued. Even for her young age, she possesses something her elder's lack. She possesses an open-mindedness to see things in a broader light than Thranduil or Legolas. She recognizes that they cannot care solely for themselves, that there are others in this world. It was definitely refreshing to have another woman amidst so many men (well, technically not just men, elves and dwarfs too).<br/><br/>ThranduilÂ…..well, he was interesting. He comes across as a very haughty King, as he was meant to according to the book. Legolas He had plenty of his Leggy moments that we've all come to expect and love. I particularly enjoyed when he balanced upon the dwarfs' heads and used them as stepping stones. The Barrel Ride scene was very well done and was definitely a highlight, as well as comic relief, of the movie. The character I most anticipated was undeniably Smaug the Stupendous. And he did not disappoint! My heart was beating rapidly throughout the whole sequence between Bilbo and Smaug. I was delighted by how closely their dialogue followed Tolkien's! <br/><br/>In closing, I found this film so completely marvelous, stunning, and spectacular I cannot wait to see it once more. And I will impatiently wait a whole year and some for the third and final installment of the trilogy."

I would say Peter Jackson DO have his creativity and telling the story.<br/><br/>Overall, best part of the movie, Mirkwood was the most interesting part.

","I love The Lord Of The Rings films. They are probably my favorite series of films. I think in fact it might be better than Star Wars! I gave all the movies a A. 5 movies (Including This Film) I gave an A straight in a row. That is impressive that a series made me so entertained and so thrilled. Now The Mid Chapter of The Hobbit is here. The Desolution of Smaug is yet again one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>Our story continues as Bilbo and the dwarfs continue to the mountain as Gandalf departs from them. They encounter orcs, giant spiders, elves, and the greedy talking dragon Smaug.<br/><br/>The best thing about The Lord Of The Rings Series of films is the pacing. The pacing is always quite consistent slowing down when need and speeding up when needed. I always hear complaints from people that the pacing is too slow and long. Hello? Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit are suppose to be long and have a pace thats consistent.<br/><br/>Now I want to talk about the High Frame Rate 3D which is the technology used for the movie. At first, I didn't like it because the frame rate was so high and felt like a video game that someone else is playing and you're watching. But then, I realized that this made the 3D have more depth to it which I think made the film great.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom returns as Legolas and he has not lost his touch as he keeps the energy in him throughout.<br/><br/>Speaking of Actors in this film, Benidict Cumberbatch voices the greedy Smaug. First Khan, now Smaug. He is seeming to be one of the most promising actors of our time. His performance as Smaug is very convincing and the voice and the visual effects makes him one of the most magical movie characters of all time.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie that I think will be remembered as one of the great movie moments is The Giant Talking Spiders scene that takes place in the forest. Why? I think it has that special feeling that movies should have where you are amazed by the magic of technology.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug is a fantastic mid chapter in The Hobbit Trilogy of films and will make you crave for the next and final chapter.<br/><br/>95/100 A"

The plot was well-organized, the conflicts fit the movie well and tied together seamlessly, and the action and effects are stunning. Also, I have to say that Bilbo's character is played perfectly, along with the rising inner conflict he has with the One Ring. However, the affair between Keeley and the Elf Huntress didn't add anything to the film. Perhaps this will come into play in the third movie.

The pace of the movie was a lot quicker than ""An Unexpected Journey"" but I feel this second installment really deepened Bilbo's character.

"gerry_barnaby","10","1","8","13 December 2013"," Outstanding film, Best dragon design ever on smuag
","If I could say one thing about this film, it would be outstanding, the storyline was told brilliantly although there is a slight change in the story from the book in a curtain scene, but the dragon scene is just outstanding special effects. When I first saw the dragon on the trailer I did think at first oh this is going to look really cheesy but after seeing this film my jaw nearly hit the floor when the dragon reveals itself just the look alone is outstanding, Seriously it was like looking it to the face of pure evil, it can tell it was not cheaply done iver it just match the evil & arrogant nature. <br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch I can say what an outstanding performance for the voice of the dragon Smuag, he seriously bought out what Smuag would sound like in middle earth & seriously gave me chill's just watch this dragon on screen, im a big fan of dragon's the design & look was just perfect for the last dragon it show a demonic & evil look, special the way benedict voice give's the character of its own evil concept is just amazing, Benedict is the voice of the necromancer which the special effect were amazing as well.<br/><br/>Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel was nothing short of brilliant, her character as a humble humanity side to her but she is not woman to mess with as she seriously kick ass in this film, she not a character that in the book but its a welcome character to the film that really dose fit in.<br/><br/>A female Wood-elf from Mirkwood, Tauriel is the captain of Thranduil's guards. Her name means ""daughter of the forest"". When Tauriel was still small her Silvan parents were killed by Orcs; she was raised in Thranduil's halls and thinks of Legolas as an older brother. Tauriel is approximately 600 years old she fights like legolas which is awesome in this film.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as legolas, I this film show a different side of him before the fellowship of the ring , he seem to have this cold hearted demeanour about him which is a characteric's of his father King Thranduil played by Lee Pace who doesn't seem to care about the world outside he own kingdom, but legolas has a fondness to Tauriel I think its because there is something about her that changes he ways or the way she see thing's for the better, it noticeable in this film.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman return as Bilbo you come to see his character as become a lot more braver & courage in this film, I like the way you get to see him use the ring, which show's a lot more going on than we think, but you notice that the ring is changing him like it did with Frodo in lord of the rings. What make this character shine is the confrontation with Smuag ,wow what a performance really showing a believable scene when he was speaking with Smuag you could hear the fear in his voice, to be honest if you were being starred down by a dragon that looks like that , hell you would be scared as well. You will notice that this is a very darker & menacing side of the story of hobbit which really work's in show a dark evil has arisen & is drawing power again to burn the world down. A lot of people probably wont like the way it ended but I think it a perfect ending leave it on a cliff hanger, because it leaves you wanting to see that last film there & back again where I bet we will get to see a much darker story than this one.<br/><br/>I found this film better for character development as really brought out all the characters personality better, you kind of notice with Thorin Oakenshield play by Richard Armitage he attitude started to change as they got closer to the mountain it was like he was going the same way as he father. what I also like was the necromancer peter Jackson actually gave it a character & body in a spirit form of a dark misty cloud with extremely dark power which was good as it give a dark edge to the film other than the dragon. <br/><br/>This is a film u shouldn't miss at the cinema, this is one lord of rings film that is outstanding in every way possible, just down to the way the acting & special effect, the design & look of the dragon this film deserver's an Oscar, I only watched this film is 2D but I bet the dragon scene is amazing in 3D.This is a film I recommend to all lord of the ring's fans."
"woutfontane","8","1","8","18 December 2013"," DOS, Peter Jackson continues to surprise his audience
","After having read Tolkien's books twice, seeing the LOTR trilogy countless times and even watching AUJ a couple of times, I was still very surprised with what Peter Jackson did to this second installment. But don't get to excited about the 8/10, because part of my surprise isn't meant to be positive.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I entered the cinema with completely different expectations than I did more than a decade ago when The Two Towers came out. I remember being very excited en completely dragged into the plot in no-time back then. Yesterday, none of this excitement was there. This may partly be due me growing up, but mainly because of the expectations set by 'An Unexpected Journey'. With the weird (mainly slow) pacing and many deviations from Tolkiens story in AUJ, I was hoping Peter Jackson wouldn't screw up in this part. <br/><br/>First of all, the scratches in my 3D-glasses and the color-filters (I was blinking all the time) kept me from emerging into the plot for the gross of the film. But I will look beyond that when I discuss the story. <br/><br/>The opening scene with Peter eating a carrot (did you spot him?) made it very clear that this second part would be HIS interpretation and, again, quite different from the book. Furthermore, the flashback in the opening scene served as a fine introduction, adding cause to Thorin's quest and paying us a nice re-visit to Bree. <br/><br/>A lot has been said about some scenes from the book not getting enough screen-time and too much focus being on the ring or Gandalf's quest. I personally think some of the adaptations serve as a good set-up for the LOTR films. We see that the ring is affecting Bilbo as well and actually showing Sauron in it's weak form adds great suspense to the film. <br/><br/>For the implementation of Legolas and Tauriel, I hold a different opinion. I think it's great to add a strong female character, since AUJ missed out on this part completely. Evangeline Lilly is very well casted and a convincing elf. Still, the romance felt kind of forced into the plot. Legolas, however, should have been left out of this part. Apart from the fact that he isn't in the original story, this plot doesn't need another hero and his scenes feel forced to resemble the ones in LOTR. Moreover, he looks very different from the Legolas we come to learn and love. His age, eyes, and character are completely out of tone. <br/><br/>About the dwarfs, this part ignores the character development in the first scenes of AUJ (in Bilbo's house). The gross is just wandering along and adds nothing to the story. I understand that 13 different characters are a pain to develop, but then why spending all this time on doing so in the first place? I think they definitely deserved more attention and development in this part. <br/><br/>Beside these remarks, the movie looks absolutely stunning and the scores and decors are wonderful. I even left the cinema excited for the final part. <br/><br/>In summary: The Desolation of Smaug continues to deliver and doesn't fail to meet the expectations set by the first installment. Although there are even more deviations from the original story than in AUJ, most of these changes are beneficial to the suspense of the film. The only problem with the Hobbit films, in my opinion, is that Peter Jackson tried too hard to add LOTR features to the story. Although I like to see some for the sake of continuity between the two trilogies, and some are even funny, most of the times it feels forced and out of place. <br/><br/>So for movie standards a 9/10, but since Peter Jackson tried to measure it with LOTR, a 8/10 for LOTR standards."

","This movie was amazing!! Starts off right where the first one left off. So make sure you see the first one BEFORE you watch this one!! That is very important, or you will not know what is going on. Also remember that these Hobbit movies come before the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Good acting, some funny parts, good drama, good action sequences and amazing visuals about sums it all up!! The plot line was obviously predictable, but fun. It is a good movie for all ages 7 and up I'd say. If your child can handle intense action like with the dragon, and fighting, then take them to see it. If you like fantasy or Sci-fi, then you'll love it. I would recommend seeing it in 2-D (3D hurts my eyes), and seeing it on the big screen while you still can.

","While the first one took it's sweet time getting to the story, this just jumps right into the action. But get ready for characters that aren't even in the book, like Legolas. And the motion capture for turning Benedict Cumberbatch into the dragon Smaug is amazing. Peter Jackson knows the right people to do motion capture, as we all know from watching Andy Serkis as Gollum all these years. But really?! 3 hours?! That's stretching it wouldn't you say? Almost as stretched as butter scraped over too much bread. I didn't see this one in 3D, which is a real shame, because it seems I would have benefited a lot from it. Smaug breathing fire towards the audience would have looked amazing in 3D. Then again, the 3D is HFR, so probably not.

Even had they just stopped after beating a dead horse twice, for two 2 hour long sessions, it would've been better than had they continued on after this. The sense of mystery and dread I felt while Bilbo narrowly escapes death in the books, is completely shattered and replaced with tongue in cheek humour in these poor adaptations.
These movies are good if all you want is something on in the background that scarcely resembles a middle earth themed atmosphere. It's all there is for the Hobbit, so I just gave it a 1/10 and accept it."

","I enjoyed the filmic scenes set in the Shire and Rivendell in the first film along with the Gollum scene and a few others and mostly shrugged off the video game cut scenes. This film had less interesting locations and far more video game inspired scenes. I suspect I am a third of a century too old to be the target audience and while I am at times a gamer, I prefer my films to be films.<br/><br/>The poor casting and direction also seemed to show up more in this film. The dwarves were simply miscast and Legolas was the major casting / writing miscue on LotR essentially being a cartoon character. Here this is ramped up to 11. This is really a major problem in Jackson's work in general. He believes more is always better and is essentially a heavy metal director having little to no actual 'touch'. In LotR with better oversight, producers were on location and shooting scenes, and more Tolkien to guide him on a macho quest book this was less of a problem. In the gentler children's work with little guidance he is lost resorting to violence and sophomoric humor. There are occasions when the film works, but usually even these moments are stretched out to the point of boredom.<br/><br/>The ending is terrible. It feels like an unfinished film to make sure you see the last third of the money grab."

","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is the sequel to the 2012 film ""An Unexpected Journey"", and once again is directed by Peter Jackson, and stars Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage, with a ensemble cast that features Benedict Cumberbatch, Evangeline Lilly, Lee Pace, Luke Evans, Ken Stott, James Nesbitt, and Orlando Bloom. The dwarves, along with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey, continue their quest to reclaim Erebor, their homeland, from Smaug. Bilbo Baggins is in possession of a mysterious and magical ring.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is more exciting and engaging that it's predecessor. No looking having to worry about setting up the story and characters compared to the first film, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" can focus more on it's characters and and action set pieces. The adventure like feel from ""An Unexpected Journey"" is carried over, and there are still great variety in locations, although not as many that there were compared to the first film. However, I feel that becomes an advantage, as less locations means being able to flesh each one out more. There is also a sense of dread that runs throughout the movie as the main characters reach closer to their destination. It builds and builds until it all explodes in a great climax, which events that take place will be concluded in ""The Battle of Five Armies"".<br/><br/>Of course, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" does have it slow moments, but that to give the audience a breather from all the amazing action set-pieces. There are fast paced, energetic and at times over the top in the best of ways. It clear that everyone at the set were having a blast being in these scenes, and they are so much fun. That what surprised me too, at just how much fun this film can be at times, ironic since this is arguably darker in some aspects than ""An Unexpected Journey"". A big plus of not having to set up the story, but rather continue it. More time can be dedicated to the action.<br/><br/>The returning actors are still as brilliant as ever. Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage are given more dramatic material that works with both Bilbo and Thorin's character development. Ian McKellen is always a treat as Gandalf, and the actors behind the dwarves are given more to do. The whole ensemble cast is great, but undoubtedly the show stealer is Benedict Cumberbatch motion capture performance as the dragon Smaug. Smaug himself was built up since the start of ""An Unexpected Journey"", and the pay off is glorious. Smaug is an threatening, smart, and an unforgettable villain that will rank up as one of my favorite parts of the whole Middle Earth film series. Cumberbatch delivers all of the menace and intellect flawlessly, giving a performance that will be remembered as one of the highlights of his career.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the production values are top-notch. It still as lively and detailed as before, creating scenes that are both atmospheric and eye pleasing. It does have some minor issues. Some of the CGI, is once again obvious, and Howard Shore score, while good, is not as memorable as the first film. That doesn't overshadow how amazing the production value is though.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is a improvement over the first film. It is more fun, engaging, and memorable, with great characters aided by an amazing ensemble cast, with more exciting action scenes and dramatic tension."

","Frankly, there isn't all that much to say about Peter Jackson's latest epic. If you have yet to see An Unexpected Journey, absolutely do so before going out to see Desolation; it'll make more sense that way. Fans of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy will find some nice nods within the movie; Legolas, Sauron, and giant spiders are all back, and serve to tie the Hobbit trilogy closer to the LotR films, something the final film in the series will surely spend a good amount of time doing. The Desolation of Smaug is overall a darker, more serious affair than its predecessor, with less time spent on slapstick and more on exposition and action. Weta Workshop makes An Unexpected Journey's visual effects look conservative; Smaug in particular is a masterpiece of digital design and animation, and is easily the most realistic and fearsome dragon ever put to film. So really, if you have seen the prequel, this is a superior film in more than a few ways. If you have not, both films are well worth the combined 5.5+ hour runtime."

Tauriel reiterates a basic theme ""Are we not part of this world?"" When good people stand by, evil wins.<br/><br/>It was interesting to see Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in this film as it establishes his relationship with the dwarfs to create better story continuity. At the same time the continuity is lost as we never have that scene in LOTR when Legolas says to Gimli, ""Hey, I met your father.""

","Unfortunately, The Hobbit did not know what it wanted to be. It jumped between being the fun adventure that the book is to being a dark brooding setup for the LOTR trilogy. Far too many extraneous side stories found their way into this overly long and bloated children's story. The film should have been cut down to one 3 hour or, at the most, two 2 hour movies. Filling up some extra minutes with some Middle Earth backround information was ok, but a lot of extra junk that was unnecessary was thrown into this trilogy and especially into the Desolation of Snaug. In all honestly the best parts of these films were the stuff that was taken directly out of the book."

","If you've liked the other four Lord of the Rings/Hobbit films, you'll like this one, simple. I found it highly enjoyable and well-paced - not as meandering as 'The Fellowship of the Ring' or 'An Unexpected Journey'. It's not as good as 'The Two Towers', but does an good job of moving the story and characters forward.<br/><br/>It also has a great score - every time you hear that motif, you think of Sauron and the ring's temptation - and plenty of great visuals. It's pretty amazing how just watching a film can make you feel comfortable, as you recognize parts of Middle Earth/New Zealand. But most of all, it's fun - there's a bear, plenty of 'catch-me-if-you-can', a waterfall/rapids chase, some spelunking, some gold mining - oh, and a dragon!<br/><br/>It's good to see Legolas and some Elves, as well as men, helping out the Hobbit & the Dwarves. Gandalf has some good moments, but this is definitely Bilbo's film - and it's left on a nice cliff-hanger."

","After a lot of character building and exposition, it is time to meet some of the antagonists. The orc's obsession with the dwarfs is now explained as a part of an elaborate evil plan, we finally meet the dragon, which is an intelligent and articulate being, only driven mad by pride and greed. I quite liked the dragon and I wish the character would have been explored more. However, considering this is based on a children's book, any kind of depth in the story is a bonus. We also meet the humans, not some great kingdom, but a mere fisherman's village, far removed from the glory of the original Dale, and run by a corrupt ruler. Sauron makes his appearance, battling all kinds of magic users that seem to appear and disappear from various places as the story demands. We meet the ""not so good"" elf lord with a grudge on the dwarfs, as well.<br/><br/> Here things start to also go awry with the quality of the storytelling, but the special effects and the increase in tension keep the viewer entertained. It all starts to go more and more over the top, without any reason to. If you are a Tolkien purist or thrive on a believable plot with reasonable characters and events, here is where you will start to scratch your head and wonder where it all went wrong. Still good and fun, though."

","But you've got to go through the woods to get to the mountain to slay the dragon, and what a venture it is. I wouldn't want to face the giant, blood thirsty spiders who will argue with each other after bundling you up before they go for your blood. I wouldn't want to face the various creatures who also dread the dragon but refuse to help the dwarfs (lead by the handsome and fearless Thorin) and the ring wearing invisible Hobbit Bilbo Baggins. Anxious to tell wizard Gandolf about the ring, Bilbo simply says he's found his courage. He'll find a lot more than that before this adventure is over. <br/><br/>Even worse than these human looking creatures with dark souls filled with prejudices, there's also the demonic looking creatures who serve the dragon, a heroic female (Cate Blanchette) and a cursed creature whose form keeps changing against his will. It was established in the first film the judgmental prejudices between dwarfs and hobbits, bonded together because of a common cause, a metaphor if ever I saw one for a reason that humans must band together to fight the evil human dragons who threaten to destroy peace and freedom today.<br/><br/>There literally is a sequence where Bilbo and the dwarfs go over some dangerous falls in barrels, nifty action battle sequences, and of course, middle earth enemy #1, the dragon Smaug. I've had mixed feelings about these often loud fantasy franchises, whether too set in the world of the dark arts or so over the top with computer generated special effects. So I keep these in perspective and am overjoyed when like this, they are actually highly above average. It's difficult to realize where live action filming begins and computer generated effects begin, but as long as there's characters you genuinely root for, then I am in favor of them.

","Manny's Movie Musings: Part 2 of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy leaves part 1 in the dust with faster pacing, more interesting characters (Legolas, Galadriel, and Tauriel — played by Evangeline Lilly), more character development, better action sequences, and what we've all been waiting forthe dragon Smaug in all his evil and crazed glory. Whereas ""An Unexpected Journey"" was like an old man wheezing his last breaths, ""The Desolation Of Smaug"" felt like a youngster getting his second wind during a race. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug"" is the scene when Smaug is awakened and his gigantic, fearsome body is fully revealed. This movie suffers from the usual shenanigan found in the previous four Tolkien movie adaptations: characters who can kill dozens of enemies per battle and never seem to get harmed; they fall from great heights, get hit very hard by giant creatures, and they dust themselves off and keep fighting as if they were made of steel.

"davoshannon","7","0","2","28 December 2016"," Didn't expect much, but started to warm to the idea.
","A lot of the low scoring and negativity the Hobbit series is getting seems justified if ""The Unexpected Journey"" is the main thing seen. Which was my position prior to last night when I cautiously sat down to watch Smaug.<br/><br/>Then there are the Tolkien ""purists"" who like all zealots cannot tolerate deviation. To put that in context I read LotR in '69 or so, immediately smitten, live in a house called ""Rivendell"", etc., etc, so I'd own up to being a purist, but never a zealot.<br/><br/>Also love open world gaming, of which Skyrim would be the best I've played. Also mod the game a lot, and one of my favourite followers is Tauriel by a modder called m0ckin9bird.<br/><br/>So when Tauriel appeared my mood suddenly brightened. And when the gorgeous Evangeline Lilly did the first of her many sideways looks, it got even better, and I started to reconsider what Peter Jackson and his team were doing.<br/><br/>There's another review by H K Fauskanger (Norway) who presents this idea in a much more erudite fashion, however I was one of his unfortunates who read LotR before The Hobbit, so found the simple language and structure of the latter more than a slight disappointment despite reading it mainly for my kids.<br/><br/>Tauriel's appearance also seemed to mark a major improvement in the embellishment of the original story. Apart from the ridiculous one sidedness of elves v's orcs fights (OK, bad guys in Steven Seagal and Sly Stallone films are hopeless with their weapons, too). The storyline got instantly better, and much more engaging.<br/><br/>Tolkien hadn't seen much commercial success with the Hobbit when he started writing LotR, and to be honest there wasn't much with the latter for years (decades, even). So with academia and advancing years there was little chance of even considering upgrading the Hobbit to LotR standards.<br/><br/>But it's reasonable to hope P. Jackson & Gang can, and will, have a go. Which they've done. Because it's on the back of well earned commercial success with the later story, he's likely to be judged harshly for cashing in. Maybe an element of that - certainly in failing to control the CGI end back towards credibility - but I saw good embellishment and invention occurring after Tauriel came in.<br/><br/>No idea what Battle of the Five Armies will give. I've waited this long. But I'm reasonably hopeful on several counts after last night. Unfortunately it will necessarily involve a lot of combat, and unless the Orcs are prepared to wait until they have overwhelming force ratio (like Montgomery of Alamein) they won't have a chance against those in the CGI department!. Damnit, it's only a film!."

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","0","3","7 July 2016"," The trilogy is a whole
","The psychology of the characters is very often reduced to some simple sketches that are more part of the costume the actors wear, part of the characters and not something having any depth, any contradictory inner voice. Even the Hobbit himself is rather sketchy. He is predictable. He is in no way moved by deep sentiments that are expressed in a way or another on the screen. He does not have time to do this since he is absolutely all the time taken in a wild action that has no pause whatsoever, reducing the dialogue to nothing most of the time, grunts and growls most of the rest of the time, and here and there a few words often spoken in vain. <br/><br/>And that is the main characteristic of this trilogy. <br/><br/>It all starts with a Rune written on the Hobbit's door by the wizard on his first visit. This Rune is ""Fehu"" under its Germanic name or ""Feoh"" under its Anglo-Saxon name, and it is not reversed. But we are not explained the meaning of this Rune. The basic meaning is ""cattle"" which relates it to the post ice age agricultural evolution, the domestication of the wild bovines and thus the evolution of that new species that will provide food and comfort to human beings. It is easy to understand then that it means ""wealth"" and all that can be derived from that concept, such as '""fulfillment,"" not only the satisfaction of one's hunger, but also the satisfaction of all basic needs and further on the satisfaction of one's call to the wild and adventure. This is basic in the whole vision provided at the beginning, though it is not explained clearly and it is not explained again at the end when the Hobbit arrives home and finds out all his accumulated wealth has been sold to everyone who wanted it. Satisfied in adventure and fate since he fulfilled his destiny, he is totally ruined in his material possessions and his house has been legally and commercially looted. That's the kind of meaning we do not get and that's how we can say that this rune represents this motto: ""Every beginning has within it the seeds of its own end."" And the seeds can be the negation of the beginning, or its reversal because a Rune can always be drawn upside down, reversed.<br/><br/>In other words it is perfectly representative of the ambiguity of runic culture, the very culture Tolkien is looking for in his novel. This ""fehu"" rune is the symbol of the call to some fate that leads to a dragon through fire, seas, storms and all other dangers from armies and other species and the ""fehu"" destiny is to kill the dragon. The killing of Smaug was contained in that rune written on the Hobbit's door by this visiting wizard. I did not find one moment when this was explained. You can tell me that's the whole story. Sure. But in Tolkien's mind and in his creations, there had to be some pondering and understanding of the ambiguity of these missions and of their greatness in their being ambiguous, hence requiring at any moment, at any step a resourcing of oneself into the power of the mission, into the blood of the dragon. <br/><br/>But my main criticism is that action is made dominant. There is nothing but action, meaning danger and violence. Even the Orcs must have a mind and must have some psychology. They are reduced to an army of brutal and brutish automats, the perfect killers who cannot die, though on the screen quite many will die at high speed.<br/><br/>This insistence on the warlike aspect of the story erases the magic of the wizard and even the courage and imagination of the dwarfs and the Hobbit. Then it is all special effects that are supposed to be so striking that we are stunned into deafness, which explains why there is no dialogue. Why should there be in a story that is reduced to calamities and military fighting with in-between all types of other fighting, always for life, always to death. And the thirteen original dwarfs, squared up by the Hobbit who makes them fourteen, and the wizard who makes them fifteen, will only be ten left squared up to twelve by the Hobbit and the wizard. And that dozen is of course so symbolical of perfection that we cannot in any way hesitate: we have reached salvation though there is no prophet, no God, no Son of God, no Holy Virgin either. This parable of Christianity does not find the religious and ritual dimension it could not ignore in Tolkien's world. This film is alas absolutely deprived of any religious and spiritual dimension.<br/><br/>If you like special effects, that's your trilogy. If you like spectacular battles, that's your trilogy. If you like simple people who do not question the universe too much, that's your trilogy. And to make it square: if you like films that do not contain anything erotic, sexy or even simply fleshy, hence if you like puritanical human beings, that's your trilogy.<br/><br/>It does not matter if Tolkien is betrayed in this trilogy, since Tolkien's son made a tremendous amount of money. To defend himself he explained that he had donated a lot to various charities. Good for him. But Tolkien, his father, deserved a better service, more spiritual, more inspired by love, friendship and empathy instead of the light sprinkling of these seven and a half hours with rare and extremely superficial and evanescent references or simple allusions to such human feelings, certainly not actions or behaviors. The dragon is beautiful but he is absolutely unlovable, and actually unhatable because one cannot hate something one does not love.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","2","7 June 2016"," Peter Jackson bounces back from his mistakes and delivers a hugely entertaining fantasy epic.
","Tolkien would be bowing his head if he saw the second installment in Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. When there is only one book written by the legendary writer, Peter Jackson decided to adapt Tolkien's fantasy novel into three films. Not the wisest choice some may say, but hey, he makes the second installment extremely fun and entertaining. Peter Jackson ups the visual elements from the first in ""The Desolation of Smaug"" to create some truly stunning CGI and action sequences. He uses tons of creepy and terrifying creatures to fight off against dwarfs, elves, and of course, Gandalf while also having a great sequence with a scene-stealing, fire-breathing dragon. After successfully crossing over the Misty Mountains, Thorin and Company must seek aid from a powerful stranger before taking on the dangers of Mirkwood Forest--without their Wizard. If they reach the human settlement of Lake-town it will be time for the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to fulfill his contract with the dwarfs. The party must complete the journey to Lonely Mountain and burglar Baggins must seek out the Secret Door that will give them access to the hoard of the dragon Smaug. Jackson also dials-down on the weak humor and ends up replacing it with action. He appears to the geeky base whop truly love fantasy, not worrying too much about pleasing fans of the book. While one film would have probably been smarter, we get to see extended sequences of fantastic action and get tons of excitement in he wonderful world of Middle Earth that we all love."

","This, the second of 'The Hobbit' trilogy sees Bilbo, Gandalf and the Dwarfs continuing their quest to the Lonely Mountain although they part company with Gandalf early on. Their journey will take them into the Mirkwood where they must battle giant spiders before being captured by the Wood Elves. Following Bilbo's use of The Ring they escape their captors but soon find themselves battling Orcs again; they are aided by two elves; Tauriel and Legolas and get to the lakeside. From here they are taken to the town of Esgaroth by Bard the ferryman before continuing to the Lonely Mountain where they come face to face with the dragon Smaug. Meanwhile Gandalf goes to Dol Guldur where he learns that an ancient evil has been awakened.<br/><br/>This seems to be a 'love it or loathe it' part of the trilogy; largely because it has no real ending; just as the action involving Smaug appears to be reaching its climax the film ends leaving us waiting for the next film to learn what happens. This didn't bother me too much as the film was packed with action and left me wanting to see the finale. No time is wasted in setting up the story and the protagonists go from one perilous situation to the next with barely a moment for them to relax in between. The action is impressive; I especially liked the giant spiders and the fight against Smaug. There was some humour mixed in with the action but not enough to make things too silly. There is also a hint of romance between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili. The cast do a solid job; most notably Martin Freeman in the role of Bilbo Baggins. There are some weaknesses; most notably there isn't the sense of danger that there should be as the protagonists seem to be almost indestructible as they survive one danger after another while the apparently mighty orcs are easily slain of course this does mean it can be enjoyed by younger viewers. Overall this was a thrilling ride that left me keen to see the final film in the trilogy."

","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, Richard Armitage, Evangeline Lilly / Voices: Benedict Cumberbatch: Visually enchanting adventure about facing evil. Taking place immediately after the previous film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Gandalf the wizard approaches Thorin Oakenshield urging him to quest after the Arkenstone, which is guarded by a fire breathing dragon. He unites with the dwarfs who accompany him on this journey where they are pursued by massive ogres, tangle with giant spiders, are captured by Wood Elves, and finally land in the most impressive visual element in the film, which is the dragon Smaug's lair. It is filled with gold treasure with Smaug emerging from beneath from sleep. Peter Jackson brings forth the fantastic and a decent detailed screenplay yet it still settles for the pathetic cliffhanger that just seems to lead viewers onward for what might have made one movie as oppose to three. It also seems funny that the good guys can do little wrong in a fight while ogres are dropping like flies during battles. Martin Freeman plays Hobbit Bilbo whose courage reaches its heights when facing Smaug. Ian McKellen is compelling as the wise Gandalf whose own travels hits trouble. Richard Armitage plays the brave warrior Thorin. Evangeline Lilly steals scenes as a hot warrior elf who is as good a fighter as any. Benedict Cumberbatch voices Smaug the massive fierce dragon.

"t-viktor212","8","0","2","28 December 2015"," The desolation of smaug: extended edition
","I just had to go spoilerific here, it is difficult to talk spoiler-free about this particular chapter of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Because the previous film spent three hours around a relatively small amount of events, this movie had to deal with way more. Beorn, Mirkwood spiders, Lake-town, Smaug... and also a lot of the added material from other sources (LOTR novels) like Dol Guldur. This movie has certainly more plot complications than the previous ones, also more expansions to the original ""The hobbit"" book, but still manages to make no mistakes story- wise. Yet, there are plenty of strange criticisms to this movie.<br/><br/>The Relationship between an elf and a man had already been discussed in LOTR, so I don't see why a relationshp between Tauriel and Kili (Or Fili?) would be a huge problem. Another overused complaint is ""Terrible"" CGI. I think many viewers haven't seen ""Terrible"" CGI in their life, the one that looks really terrible and fake. For references, I propose to watch: the creature from 10.000 B.C., certain dinos from the Jurassic Park trilogy, the final train in Back to the future III, Early scenes in The Phantom Menace and... last but not least... oliphants from Lord of the rings: the Two Towers. A conftrontation between those CGI animations and this shows how CGI was well done in this film. <br/><br/>On the expansions in the extended edition: they worked well. The extended editions of the hobbit trilogy provide of a new subplot regarding a ring of the dwarfs, and the inclusion of Thrain in the Dol Guldur section was something I particularly appreciated.<br/><br/>My great problem (And the reason it's not getting a 9) is the ending: it was just bad to walk out of the theater two years ago with a such ending. I think the solution would've been to put the dragon entirely in the last movie. But, afterall, if you have 5 hours and 40 mins, you can watch The battle of the five armies right after the desolation of smaug thus having a proper ending to the story. Or just go and read the book."

"bryank-04844","8","0","3","22 August 2015"," The Desolation of Smaug' is a great second installment and loads better than the first film.
","And we've arrived in the 2nd year of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy with 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug', and let me tell you, it's a big improvement on the last film, which was released the same time last year. First off, we don't have to spend a half hour inside Bilbo's home with thirteen dwarfs eating, drinking, and singing songs about washing dishes and Bilbo's unhappy attitude. In this sequel things start off fast and to the point, which is sure to excite all audiences. Still, adapting J.R.R Tolkien's less than 300 page novel into three separate films might be a bit much, but damn if it isn't fun and highly entertaining this time around with a giant fire breathing dragon, some epic battles, a familiar elf, and an escape from orcs that I could watch 100 times in a row and never tire of. Just like the previous films set in Middle Earth, I expect another billion dollars for Jackson and co.<br/><br/>You might happy to know that this sequel is less than three hours, but barely, which is surprising given the shortness of the novel it's based on, but Jackson is adding a bunch of the appendices from Tolkien's universe. And while the last film dragged on quite a bit, Jackson this time around paces the film very nicely with great development with new characters and some intense action sequences.<br/><br/>'The Desolation of Smaug' focuses on Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs making their way to the Lonely Mountain in the underground kingdom of Erebor to have Thorin Oakenshield reclaim the throne from the frightening dragon named Smaug, which we saw at the beginning of the last film where the kingdom was destroyed and torched. Once again, Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarfs encounter many obstacles along their way, which hinder their advancement to the lonely mountain quickly.<br/><br/>Originally, Guillermo Del Toro was supposed to direct these films, but dropped out, however still has a credit in the film. But Jackson and his co-writers and producers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens decided to add a couple of new characters to the film, which were not in the Tolkien books at all. Perhaps to give a small romantic angle for our traveling companions. You'll be happy to know that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and fellow elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), a sexy female elf who is as skilled with a sword and bow as Legolas is, both have big story arcs here and whose romantic feelings are mixed with one of the dwarfs, specifically Kili.<br/><br/>Gandalf senses something wrong and leaves Bilbo and the dwarfs to travel the road alone for the time being, as Gandalf sets out to ultimately discover the one true evil that sets the 'Lord of the Rings' films in motion. Meanwhile the dwarfs and Bilbo head into the Mirkwood forest, where if you stray off path, you'll begin to have an acid-like trip and become lost forever. Add to that some giant spiders who enjoy dwarfs for breakfast, and you got yourself a little suspenseful scene. But the elves show up, but end up taking the dwarfs prisoner, but thanks to Bilbo the burglar and a big orc battle, the little band of men escape in one of the best escape scenes I've ever seen. I'm serious, this need to be some sort of ride at a theme park. It's that fun.<br/><br/>Th dwarfs and Bilbo end up at a once great town on the sea named Lake Town, where a jerk dictator (an excellent Stephen Fry) has taken control over the town and turned into a poor and poverty stricken city. Luckily a man named Bard (Luke Evans) smuggles the dwarfs in the town to help them on their quest, where Bard soon realizes he'll have to play a much bigger role in this trilogy. But that's not this time.<br/><br/>Here, we end up in the gold and rich kingdom of the dwarfs and we meet Smaug. This dragon is just incredible. He's voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and might be the scariest scaled character to ever grace the screen. His movements, motifs, and voice are purely terrifying. While Cumberbatch's voice is a little too modified digitally for me, it still is great.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman plays Bilbo very well again, and has a little more wiggle room here to see his decent into madness and obsessions with the ring and other riches, but ultimately shows how courageous he really is. Lilly does an impressive job here to as the elf while Bloom as Legolas is there to only shoot his arrow into orcs. And that he does very well.<br/><br/>While there are some suspenseful moments, we all know how this turns out, and being three movies long, we know the dwarfs and Bilbo won't be killed off, no matter how dire the situation is. This doesn't really take anything away from the movie, but it's always in the back of your mind. This 2nd installment ends on a big cliff hanger and will leave you in the theater yelling, 'Nooo"", as the prefect and vicious Smaug sets out to unleash his fiery evil and the orc population is growing rapidly.<br/><br/>The 3D is is okay at best, but is not necessary, and actually darkens the screen quite a bit, which I didn't care for, but there is more filmic look to this one, which was nice compared to the high frame rate of the first film. 'The Desolation of Smaug' is a great second installment and loads better than the first film. It's also the darkest yet, as nobody has a good outcome as of yet. Despite the abundance of too much CG, I cannot wait to see this again."

I'm less enthusiastic of the added excessive fluff to the story so they could stretch it out over the three installments to make more money.<br/><br/>The Hobbit could have been made in to a single (3) hour movie. There was no reason to make a (9) hour movie. I'd love to see some one edit the (9) hours down to (3) or (4) hours, much like The Phantom Edit did for The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>The same can be said for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy which is another (9) hours of fluff. Every thing else is awesome but the rest of it can be cut out.

This is what I remembered about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and more. They really do a good job at delivering more gruesome battles with the orcs and the elves, which I thought was the best part, offering the most heart pounding scene since the last LOTR film. But the one thing I was excited for the most despite not being very excited to begin with. But I felt excitement to see the dragon, Smaug. I rarely have seen a character receive so much build-up. But Smaug has a lot of that, so I was excited to see him. It wasn't until almost the end of the film before we get to witness him, and for all the build up, I was satisfied. Not on the same level as say, Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon. But he was evil and all the right ways, and had a very menacing voice to match. To me he is flawed, as a kind of typical villain. At least in this film, maybe he offers more in the next film, but as for this. He was very typical. Slow-moving, slow-talking, lot of talking, not much action. Acts intimidating but does nothing that stands out. He threatens kill but doesn't kill one person in the film. And some dialog was clichéd. But the part I like about Smaug is his design, and cunning behavior. So its a toss up with him. As a film, this was like I said pleasantly satisfactory.

"brando647","8","0","3","6 July 2015"," An Improvement Over the First HOBBIT Film
","I was excited at the arrival of the first Hobbit film in 2012. I was a fan of Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings films and the idea of revisiting his cinematic interpretation of Middle Earth was amazing. The first film, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, came and went and I found my interested failing. It wasn't a horrible film but it was painfully obvious that they had taken a single volume tale and stretched it beyond its limits to fill the time. But I hadn't given up completely. I returned to the theaters the following year for THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. This time around, it seemed to go a lot smoother. The second film in the Hobbit trilogy is a much stronger, more entertaining film than the first while still falling short of the awe-inspiring Rings series. When we last left Thorin Oakenshield and his company of fellow dwarfs, they had narrowly avoided death at the hands of the vengeful orc Azog the Defiler following their escape from the goblins under the Misty Mountains. We rejoin them on their quest to reclaim Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, as they're approaching the outskirts of the forests of Mirkwood. Their adventure in THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG will bring them into contact with giant spiders, woodland elves, a skin-changer, and the world of men before finally culminating in their arrival at the shattered dwarven kingdom under the mountain. And there, Bilbo Baggins will need to uphold his end of the contact by sneaking into the mountain and snatching the legendary Arkenstone from under the guard of a sleeping dragon.<br/><br/>My issue with the first film was the meandering pace of it all. It just sort of limped from one set piece to the next and, by the end of it all, we really hadn't accomplished much. The second film finally kicks into gear, introducing new characters that will actually serve a purpose in the climax of the series and not only bringing us to Erebor's doorstep but actually taking us inside. I haven't yet seen THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES but I can almost guarantee that this film will remain my favorite of the series. It contains more of the iconic scenes from the novel that I've been waiting to see since it was announced that Jackson would be adapting the story, namely the barrel escape (because I knew Jackson would jazz it up into a massive action sequencewhich he did) and Bilbo's introduction to the dragon, Smaug (which I knew Jackson would jazz up into a massive action sequence but hoped he wouldn'tand he did). As I expected, the movie's got the same boost of filler I'd come to expect from the last film but it all feels more natural and less forced. The action scenes are more exciting this time around and the sequences move along with a sense of purpose. The CG is still a problem and I would much rather have the traditional practical FX for the orcs but I'll just have to accept that we won't be getting them anymore.<br/><br/>Being that this is THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the main event is obviously the dragon we've come all this way to see. My complaints of the excessive CG still hold up here, as I would've loved to see a blend of practical and CG in bringing the legendary creature to life, but overall I can't complain. He was animated well and the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch seals it for me. Smaug was well worth the wait. I was happy to find that he was given ample screen time but I wish it would've focused more on the conversation between he and Bilbo as it was in the book instead of devolving into an overlong chase sequence through the dwarven halls. And, as much time as it took to get to the big finale, I was admittedly a bit disappointed when Jackson couldn't be bothered to close it out by the end of the movie, instead dragging the conclusion to the start of the third and final film. That was one more tease than I needed. Regardless, all of my complaints aside, I actually really enjoyed the second Hobbit film and it reinvigorated my interest in the franchise. I've come to accept that this new trilogy is no LORD OF THE RINGS but it's enjoyable enough. THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a fun adventure ride and, surprisingly, it never really feels bloated at its length. It's a great segue film into what will assuredly be a CG visual madhouse of a finale in the last film."

","If you're looking for a very intense and acion-packed movie, and like Peter Jackson, then you need to see this. This Hobbit was probably my favorite of all three, and I think it should have won a Award for it's great story, talented actors, and great special effects. I remember the night I watched it. I had popped a big bowl of popcorn, gotten some canned soda, and watched it. After seeing the giant spider scene, I knew this was going to be a good one. I loved the way they did the scene where Smaug awakens with Bilbo Baggins just a few steps away. It also reminded me of the very last scene in the first film, where a bird taps on the outside of the cave with a rock, and smaug's eyes open. Peter Jackson sure did a wonderful job at this intelligent, exciting sequel to the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and it's a one of a kind film. So, if you liked the book, and you liked the earlier Lord of the Rings films, then I would recommend this film out of all of the three Hobbit movies."

"arussell23","9","0","4","8 June 2015"," 'Desolation' ups the stakes, while gearing us up for a epic finale
","Once upon a time, there was a film series. It began with one film, that only covered a third of the novel it was based upon. Critics and fans alike were divided. Some enjoyed the film, while others loathed it. For better or for worse, a year later, the second film was released, covering another third of the book it was based upon. We started with An Unexpected Journey, now let us dive right into...<br/><br/>...The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The Desolation of Smaug continues the story of the 13 dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield, and Bilbo Baggins, as they get closer and closer to Erebor. Through their travels, they meet elvish kings, men of a lake town and finally come face to face with the formidable dragon, Smaug.<br/><br/>First things first. Let's talk about how good Smaug was in this film. Benedict Cumberbatch was phenomenal, doing great motion capture work and his voice sends chills down my spine each time I watch the film. The special effects used to create him looked amazing, I felt like he could have really been there. Smaug is definitely one of the biggest pluses towards the film.<br/><br/>Other things I enjoyed? Well, I enjoyed the music in the film, but that's a given. I did have one gripe with the music, and that was the non-return of Misty Mountains. That was the best song in the first film, and the fact that it wasn't continued as a theme of the dwarfs really bummed me out. The special effects were really good, for the most part. I can't remember exactly, but I know there's a few parts where the effects were a bit shoddy.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is as good as it was last time. Some newcomers to the party include Luke Evans as Bard the Bowman, and he does a really good job portraying the guy he's supposed to portray, Stephen Fry, who is a riot as the Master of Lake-town, and Lee Pace as Thranduil. Thranduil is probably my favorite out of the new characters, mainly because he's just so much fun. Pace overacts the character a bit, which is exactly what the character needed to make it more fun.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, again, great. I won't spoil, but in the forest scene, apparently they had to make everything they wanted to appear in color really bright so they could make the forest around them look as dark as possible. It's interesting how they went to that length to make it look so good.<br/><br/>Let's get to the negatives. Evangeline Lilly portrays Tauriel, a new character not in the book at all, and why Lilly does fine in her portrayal, it's her storyline that annoys me. I won't spoil it, but she gets into a relationship (sort-of, not really) with one of the dwarfs, and it feels so shoehorned in, I don't even feel anything good about their relationship. The difference between this relationship and one like Aragorn and Arwen, is that I actually bought that relationship and cared about if they were going to end up together and stay together. Tauriel and the dwarf seem so forced it's not even interesting.<br/><br/>I also didn't like how goofy the ending was. Sure, okay, I can accept running from the dragon and maybe even running around a lot because of that. But blocking fire using pillars? The whole scene where dragon fire lights up the room? MOLTEN GOLD? It's not all bad, it's actually kind of fun, but the logical side of me wonders how the hell that would work.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a step up from An Unexpected Journey. Although some of the ending is a bit goofy, and I dislike the love story, this is a solid entry to the Hobbit trilogy, and the last film is shaping up to be a very intriguing ending to this decent trilogy. The plot was good, the acting was good, the cinematography was on point, and the special effects were good. This is a great film to watch if you want some fun that doesn't take itself too seriously, while also taking itself seriously.<br/><br/>9/10 Grade: B+/A-"
"richardbutch","7","0","2","15 May 2015"," The Hobbit 2 Same As The Hobbit 1 - Too Much CGI
","As in The Hobbit 1 the CGI is great in this movie. The problem is in some cases they are not very believable. The dwarfs fall several stories in one scene, if it had been in real life the characters would have all died. Many of the special effects are way beyond belief to actually be able to happen. I know this is a fantasy but they need to scale back the CGI a little. I kept saying to myself WOW this looks great but its unrealistic. Other movies with CGI are doing the same thing. How about less CGI and more acting with emotions. At least the CGI was very detailed and life like. Having Smaug talk was a mistake IMHO. Can you imagine Godzilla talking in a movie ? Yes spend the money to make the special effects as great as possible but in a realistic possible way. I did not like the ending. Having to make an someone wait a year for The Hobbit 3 to finish the story is not the best way to go for a fan. I did not have to wait a year as I bought all 3 Hobbit movies on DVD and will watch The Hobbit 3 tomorrow night. I still like the movie but it could have been much better."
"Robert_duder","7","0","4","11 January 2015"," I'm not sure I get it....so meh to this instalment
","I'm a fickle Lord of The Rings fan. When I saw the original trilogy in theatres I found them long and boring and didn't really get what everyone was excited about. When I re-watched them later on, I began to understand and see this incredible world that Peter Jackson had created and the painstaking process of bringing the story and characters to life. So I was a changed man. Then came the first Hobbit and because I had become a fan of the series I really enjoyed it. I know it wasn't as good as the original trilogy and as many reviewers have said it felt like they focused on the spectacle and special effects and light on the story. It felt more like a video game at times but thank goodness Jackson still keeps his world in tact. So now comes Desolation of Smaug and I had heard that it was even better than the first so I had decent expectations. Desolation of Smaug (for me) was a further example of how they can show off their CGI skills and still not develop much of any characters or plot. Honestly, I found myself asking several times through this film...what exactly is going on? Why are they still walking and what is the point of all this? It doesn't seem that complex and yet I don't even understand why Bilbo is there. There are truly astonishing visuals in the film and once Smaug is revealed it definitely ups the ante and despite the fact that I'm annoyed he is nothing more than an animated dragon on a computer...the end scenes were the best.<br/><br/>The original trilogy created characters that won't ever be forgotten. The cast was beyond first rate. The cast for the Hobbit is okay at best. The characters aren't focused on at all and they are literally just there. The exception is Richard Armitage who came into the film as our hero Thorin Oakenshield. Armitage is good but he lacks the same chemistry that Viggo Mortensen had in the original trilogy. Still he plays his role well. Martin Freeman is the exception to all of this because he is an amazing character and perfect for his role. While I didn't think Bilbo was nearly as effective in this part as the first, he still is very good. The rest of the Dwarfs are all good and they play their roles well but they literally have no independent character. At least in the first one it felt like you could tell who was who but in this one, its barely noticeable. I was very excited that Orlando Bloom was returning to the series as Legolas but he didn't really seem like he had his heart in it. He had some great action scenes but once again...lacked depth. Evangeline Lilly joins the cast as Tauriel. She is a good character and the chemistry between her and Legolas is interesting. Ian McKellen's role is severely reduced in this film and I think that was a huge strike against it as well. McKellen's Gandalf is and always has been a huge part of this series and he is stunning in it so to have him missing hurt the film a great deal.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has set a bar for himself and this series that is astronomically high. Its too easy to sit back and pick apart all the negative things about this. The fact is, if you love this world that Jackson has created then returning to it will be terrific for you. The film is visually magnificent and Jackson builds two films towards revealing this magnificent dragon (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch who does a great job) and while I do hate CGI I understand why it is used and for the most part it is used extremely well. The flaw to the film is the lack of character development. Jackson forgot that he may have already established this world but these are new main characters that we have to get to know and fall in love with and he fails to deliver that for most of them. I am still anxious to see the final film with the expectation that this may be the last time we experience this world created by Jackson and helmed by him too. Regardless, this is the quintessential fantasy epic. 7/10"

","At a small inn in the town of Bree which borders the Shire, the dwarf known as ""Thorin Oakenshield"" (Richard Armitage) meets the wizard named ""Gandalf"" (Ian McKellen). While there Gandalf proposes to help Thorin obtain the ""Arkenstone"" which is the symbol of dwarf leadership and just happens to be in the possession of the dragon known as Smaug in his mountain lair where the dwarfs used to live. Obviously, since they cannot expect to simply kill Smaug and forcibly take the Arkenstone, Gandalf suggests that they send a burglar to steal it from him. This is where the Hobbit named ""Bilbo Baggins"" (Martin Freeman) comes in. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie was a bit more watchable than the previous film ""The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey"" due in large part to better CGI and action sequences. I especially liked the scenes involving the she-elf, ""Tauriel"" (Evangline Lilly) as she brought some feminine beauty to an otherwise male dominated cast. In any case, like its predecessor this particular movie adds elements to the story which the book did not contain so Tolkien purists might be a bit chagrined. However, like I mentioned in my review of ""The Hobbit-An Unexpected Journey"", this film was based on a relatively small book compared to the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and filler material had to be added if they were going to make 3 movies out of it-hence the number of action scenes and additional elements. Be that as it may this movie was enjoyable enough for the time spent and I rate it as slightly above average."
"caseynicholson","8","0","2","30 December 2014"," An Impressive Second Chapter in ""The Hobbit"" Trilogy
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is of course the second in Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, based on the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy book for young readers. The story is a prequel to ""The Lord of the Rings"" books and movies, but takes place some sixty years prior to that separate tale.<br/><br/>In the previous film, we were introduced to Bilbo Baggins, a.k.a. ""The Hobbit"", a.k.a. ""The Burglar"", who is conscripted into the service of a party of dwarfs and a mighty wizard, Gandalf the Gray, who together are seeking to reclaim the dwarfs' homeland from a mighty and fierce dragon who goes by the name of Smaug. This second film continues that story, picking up with the party being hosts of elves, and then continuing on its fantastic journey toward ""The Lonely Mountain"", the lost home of the dwarfs.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with an overall feel that is similar to its predecessor, but along the way the story picks up and things get far more interesting than the first film. Whereas the first movie is all journey and not much accomplishment, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" sees the party make its way to its destination, only to be left with a cliffhanger ending that sets up the third film quite well.<br/><br/>Without spoiling much, it's hard not to mention that the best part of this film is when Bilbo and company finally encounter Smaug. The dragon is featured prominently in the latter third of the film, and the special effects on the dragon himself are absolutely stunning. This was a film that certainly warranted having been seen in a theater, and if you have a large flatscreen television you certainly will be impressed with the graphics on Smaug. <br/><br/>Couple that with a developing storyline that is much more engaging than the first film, and ""The Desolation of Smaug"" is a thoroughly enjoyable movie experience. I feel good about giving it 8 out of 10 stars, and I can see how some might rate it even higher.<br/><br/>One note to Tolkien purists, though: the film certainly does expand on the book quite a bit, introducing scenes that are only mentioned in the book in a tangential way. The same goes with character development, as some of the characters from the book who are not even mentioned by their proper name now have much more developed story lines. For a Tolkien purist, the film may push the envelope a bit.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is a true delight for anyone who's simply looking for a fun, family friendly fantasy movie complete with dwarfs, dragons, elves and Hobbits. You should enjoy it immensely if you fit that description."
"orourkec-292-269155","8","0","2","21 December 2014"," Faulty, but I still say two thumbs up.
","Fortunately The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug is more confident and exciting, more character-focused and an improvement over its predecessor. I liked the first Hobbit film but I liked Desolation of Smaug better. I found the first Hobbit film good but this second part I found it very good. My favorite scene of the entire film was the river action scene. That scene wasn't exciting just like that - it was hell of an exciting one. However, I thought that Legolas' act in that scene was a little over-the-top and made him look a bit too much like a God-like being. I thought that the Elf- Dwarf love story including the love triangle was a nice subplot and that it was worth an addition to the Desolation of Smaug but I find it a bit of a pity that some people disapprove with it. That's what I think. Another thing I can't resist talking about in this review is the deadly, critical duel between Gandalf and Sauron. That scene was visually artistic and viscerally intense and surpasses the quality of the duel scene opposing Gandalf against the Belrog in the Fellowship of the Ring. Well done on that Jackson, really. This scene made me feel not only happy but proud as if I was the director who made that scene. I'm not sure why. I don't know if any of you guys knew or maybe just guessed and hinted about this since the first Hobbit film when it was revealed about the obscure forces surrounding Dol Gul Dur but I had no idea (nor did I even guess and hint at the possible idea that Sauron would be back in The Hobbit and that he may be the Necromancer one second) that the main antagonist from the Lord of the Rings trilogy would take part in The Hobbit movie until I saw him in the ignited fire light near the end of the movie. When I first saw him I was like ""What on earth!? Sauron ALSO takes part in The Hobbit!?"" And don't take me wrong, I wasn't exclaiming myself like that because I felt negative toward it but because it was so unexpected to me and a big surprise. It felt like a smash in my face. The way Sauron resurrected with his full powers was incredible. And the sinister score that shows up just as Sauron makes his first full spiritual appearance is so damn perfect. Also I thought that the physical aspect and visual design for the dragon Smaug was breathtaking and that the dialogue between Bilbo and Smaug was operated in a nicely smooth and efficient way. One thing that felt strange and frustrated me however was the scene where the Dwarfs battle against Smaug. Well, I felt so bored with that scene because it didn't feel gripping nor breathtaking at all and I found it such a pity. Another problem is that the movie is too long, but all in all I'm happy about Jackson's work in this motion picture and I congratulate him and that I think is the most important thing to think of even if Desolation of Smaug is imperfect (or any movies in general). My rating for the movie is 8.0/10. I read the plot of the second sequel and am curious to know what Sauron's plan is in the Battle of the Five Armies chapter. I haven't yet seen The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies but I'm looking forward to see it and I hope it will be really good or at least just good. I will definitely write another review for the third film after I finish watching it. Let's see what the third, last and decisive Hobbit chapter of the trilogy, before its ties to The Lord of the Rings, has to offer..."
"JTurner82","8","0","2","20 December 2014"," More frantic and action-packed with the occasional deviation.
","I don't know how one is supposed to turn a rather short book like J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT into a trilogy, but that's exactly what Peter Jackson has done. No stranger to Middle-Earth, having helmed the phenomenal LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, the best things that can be said about his re-imagining of this classic tale is that at least the production values and acting are on par with its predecessors. As with the aforementioned trio, THE HOBBIT was shot back-to- back in New Zealand, resulting in the release of one sequel per year. For better or worse, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY kicked off what would be an all new adventure, albeit on a rather sluggish pace, particularly its overlong dinner party sequence and character introductions that made up most of its first half.<br/><br/>Luckily those problems do not extend to the second part of the trilogy, here titled THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. Having already established the cast, the film picks up from where we left our heroes after being rescued from orcs by eagles. The pace is certainly tighter and less slow, although there still is the occasional lag. The film begins, oddly, with another prologue scene: this time a conversation between the battle-hardened dwarf prince Thorin (Richard Armitage) and the ever-wise Gandalf (Ian MacKellen). After that we cut back to where we last left the Hobbit and his dwarf companions. As before, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG really comes alive during the moments which readers are familiar with. Lots of new hazards await our heroes in the form of monstrous spiders, suspicious elves, more and more orcs, corrupt townsfolk, and ultimately, the titular villain himself.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the crowning jewel of this second part is the fated scene where Bilbo confronts Smaug the dragon in his treasure-laden lair. Like Gollum, the folks at Weta Workshop, through the wizardry of motion capture technology do a bang-up job of rendering this beast a truly dangerous, terrifying monster. Benedict Cumberbatch, too, deserves credit not only for performing the motion capture movements of the dragon (similar to Andy Serkis as Gollum), but for providing the beast with a rumbling, floor-shaking baritone that sends chills up one's spine. For audiences more familiar with Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman (Bilbo) as Watson, the scene, perhaps unintentionally, is also dryly amusing if you make the connection. Either way, Smaug is a real triumph, emerging as one of cinema's greatest dragons.<br/><br/>That said, DESOLATION OF SMAUG takes quite a while to get there, and as with its predecessor, it ultimately depends on whether the viewer is prepared to accept the changes and additions Jackson made from the book, appreciate the film at face value, or are prepared to grumble with disappointment. En route, the film zigzags back and forth between talky bits and CGI effects as well as other additions. The fight with the spiders in the Mirkwood forest is chillingly handled and builds to its climax with true terror, the arachnids themselves being the stuff of nightmares. There's also an extensive roller-coaster style escape in which our heroes escape downriver in barrels while dodging attacking orcs. For the most part this sequence is viscerally exciting, but there are a FEW moments when it gets a bit silly, particularly in the sometimes implausible choreography of the elves as they fight back against the attackers. There's an even lengthier showdown between the dwarfs and the dragon in the Misty Mountain which mostly works on a crowd-pleasing level (especially for audiences who want to see Thorin face off against the beast that destroyed his home), but may infuriate Tolkien loyalists expecting an untarnished adaptation what they see as a work of art.<br/><br/>Then there's the inclusion of two new characters, one of who is familiar to audiences of LORD OF THE RINGS, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and a skillful she-elf named Tauriel. While it's nice to see Legolas again, I'm not quite sure what Jackson is going for by including him in the incidents where the dwarfs are taken prisoner. There's also an implied ""love story"" subplot between the youngest of the dwarfs and Tauriel which, although not fatal to the film, is a curious addition nonetheless. We also see Gandalf and Radagast (Sylvestor MacCoy) trail a mysterious evil to stone ruins, which turns out to be the ghost of the major baddie from THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. This is obviously meant to tie THE HOBBIT to the more famous trilogy, which is quite understandable given that this is, after all, a prequel to LORD OF THE RINGS. Lake Town is also stunningly realized as a destitute but simultaneously seedy village with a corrupt mayor. Luke Evans also makes a very pleasing Bard, and the addition of his family brings a lot of emotional weight to his character.<br/><br/>In short, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG's length and additions will understandably annoy anyone expecting Jackson to adapt the novel more ""accurately"", but my ""criticisms"" are mostly just shameless nit-picking, because on the whole I really did enjoy THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. It's certainly more frantic than its predecessor and never boring. The only major drawback of the movie is its cliffhanger ending. This is intentional and meant to make audiences come back for the final film, but it's still done in a way that feels very abrupt. On that level, then, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is not meant to be a standalone film, but a two-parter in the same way that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS ended up being.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, Jackson's enthusiasm for the material still shines through even in places where it occasionally goes off the rails. While it may be in the shadow of its predecessor trilogy, it's nonetheless great to go on another adventure with Jackson, Weta, and company."

Unfortunately, many of the details that are included in the book are not shown in the movie or even worse are changed and edited with some completely new things. For example at the beginning of the movie Beorn didn't greet them in his house like that way and he doesn't look like the one that Tolkin described in the book, Legolas and Tauriel were not even mentioned in the original book. but the two things that disappointed me the most is when they were passing ""the mirkwood"" which was completely changed and edited (for example the Enchanted river was not even shown in the movie and the way that Wood-elves catched them was completely changed just like the scene with the barrels), same goes with their passing in the mountain, where scenes were completely changed and made up, Peter Jackson really went to far specially because they didn't fight the dragon in the mountain according to the original story!!! They ruined the original Tolkin's materpiece with bunch of unnecessary things and scenes that didn't take part in the book. Many of you who have read the original ""Hobbit"" will understand what am I trying to say and if you decide to watch this movie you will be really disappointed and it will disappoint you, just as ""An Unexpected Journey"" did (if you read the book already of course), but on the other hand if you are looking on the visual aspect this will really fascinate you and awake the imagination from the book you all had! :)"

It actually looked sort of ""real."" The dwarfs along with Bilbo are on a journey to get to the mountain where the dragon and his treasure lies. They travel through a forest filled with giant spiders. They are captured by Elves and escape traveling down a river in barrels while being chased by Orcs. They make it to Laketown and then find the secret door into the mountain. Then Bilbo is sent to find the Arkenstone and dodges the dragon before all the dwarfs get involved. Then it ends, set up for the third installment.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was good. But know there is no conclusion. So I think it would be best to watch this once the third part comes out so you have an ending."

","A great sequel, a little better than first work. 3 hours just flew. There is not much introduction (for it was responsible part one), he is immediately starting strongly and so runs until the end. Since I'm not a fan of Tolkien, this is purely from watching the movie aspect. It is clear that some things are invented and perpetuate unlike books (I have not read, but later commented with a friend). Some things are similar and makes a copy of the LOTR trilogy, but it should be keep in mind that the Hobbit was written before that (probably is?) And that made ​​the first Hobbit and then LOTR would you then fall off the LOTR copy of The Hobbit? Basically a great fantasy, I can not wait and the third part, I hope it could be the best part of the trilogy, but when it was Jackson failed with the return of the king."
"ToxicFuel","8","0","1","12 June 2014"," Very good movie, but too lengthy
","First off I have to say that I am a LOTR and Hobbit fan, so it's no doubt I would watch this movie and enjoy it. And I did! But there were also some flaws. Here's my review:<br/><br/>The movie starts off great. It does not take long at all to get into the action, whereas the first one was fairly slow until about 45 minutes in. However, the movie is very drawn out and could easily have been shorter. Some conversations and other content was unnecessary such as the river/barrel fight scene, which was also slightly corny.<br/><br/>And yes, the movie does not follow the book in plenty of ways, but you have to remember this is a trilogy so it will have different content.<br/><br/>Also, as usual, the movie has some very pretty scenery and other places. Lake-town and the Lonely Mountain was nicely done to me and looked very pleasing.<br/><br/>Really, the entire movie is quite enjoyable, and Smaug was very nicely done, especially with Benedict Cumberbatch voicing him. <br/><br/>All in all, good acting, great special effects, but could have been a bit shorter. A solid 8/10 for me."
"cleary-joshua","8","0","1","30 May 2014"," This doesn't suffer from feeling drawn out, and is even better than the first part.
","The second part of a trilogy can often be the hardest to get right. By this stage you've had your beginning, and you know your eventual outcome, so the second instalment is merely a task in setting each character up to be in the right place for the third. ""Back to the Future: Part 2"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are both great examples of films which have this task, but do it well enough that the film could be watched as a standalone movie, since they are both exciting enough to keep the viewer interested. ""The Two Towers"", the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, slightly fails in this respect as it feels very drawn out and uninteresting, as if it is just setting up for ""Return of the King"". Luckily, ""The Desolation of Smaug"" does not suffer from this at all, and is even better than the first part of this trilogy.<br/><br/>We pick up right where ""An Unexpected Journey"" left off, with the group of dwarfs and Bilbo (Martin Freeman) escaping from the Orcs with whom they had fought at the very end. Over the course of the film, the group travel towards, and eventually into, the Lonely Mountain, where the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) is sleeping. This is no easy journey for them, however, and on the way they encounter spiders, Elves (which sees a return of Orlando Bloom's Legolas) and Men, each of whom is some kind of hindrance to their quest. When they eventually reach and enter the Mountain, they are tasked with trying to steal the Arkenstone from Smaug, which doesn't quite go as they expected.<br/><br/>These different encounters usually involve an escape, and it is here when the film is most exciting, as there is often a lot of chaotic action going on. the use of CGI in the film is extremely prominent, and works very well in continuing the magical image of Middle Earth from the first film. Much like how the greatest part of the first film was Bilbo talking to the CGI Gollum, this film's best scene is an exchange between Bilbo and Smaug. Martin Freeman's talent is clearly on show here, as he acts masterfully in trying to find and steal the Arkenstone without waking the dragon.<br/><br/>As is slightly traditional with the second parts of trilogies, this film is noticeably darker than its predecessor, with Gandalf's storyline at the tombs taking an extremely dark tone. The ensemble cast continues to work so well with each other, and the group dynamic is one of the things which makes the film more enjoyable as an audience. Again, the film suffers from its own length, but not as much as the first film, since there are more interesting things going on here and less exposition. And while the film ends with an annoying cliffhanger, it's really the only way it should - with everything headed for disaster, and the audience wondering how on earth they're going to get out of it. It's immensely enjoyable, and I really can't wait for the third part."

"anthony-ohnstrom","9","0","5","6 May 2014"," Fantastic if viewed as a movie, nothing else.
","Forget about the book. Hundreds of angry book fanatics fans have already stated how this action adventure slaughters the the soul of Tolkien. One thing they all seem to forget though, you're supposed to rate a movie as a movie. How good of a movie was The HObbit DOS? It was actually an amazing film. Characters like Bilbo, Gandalf, Legolas and Thorin feel real and alive, the action though a little over done is enjoyable without a doubt and the CGI is almost flawless.<br/><br/>PROS: As stated above, the characters are likable, some even more than in lord of the rings. The pacing is spot on, unlike AUJ. The dialoges are clever and well, there's simply a lot of things Peter did right with the movie.<br/><br/>CONS. What book? There's also one or two dwarfes we have yet to hear say something, that's just weird...<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I personally loved the movie because I saw it as a movie and nothing else. There's a lot of dumb people who have given it one or two stars because they're either disappointed with it, or they don't agree with the direction Peter went. That does NOT mean the movie is worse than average though! Give it less than 4 and you're not good at reviewing movies if you ask me, that's just my humble opinion of course."
"BrickNash","8","0","1","28 April 2014"," Highly enjoyable film but the adventure stays in the book
","Having freshly watch this film in the comfort of my own home (I missed the cinema viewing) I have to be very honest.....I really liked it!<br/><br/>Much better paced than the first instalment and some really great performances all round.<br/><br/>Sadly again the film bears little resemblance to the wonderful book on which it was based. I honestly didn't recognise most of it bar the barrel scene and a few others which is a shame because the action overtakes what was supposed to be an adventure.<br/><br/>In saying that though, the film rips along and there is plenty to keep the attention.<br/><br/>The horrible dwarven makeup is much less apparent this time around and this adds heavily to the feel, although some of the dwarfs still look far too 'man' like for me and the CGI is once again over used but to better effect this time around depicting towns and views.<br/><br/>As much as I love the character, the crowbarring in of Legolas was more of a distraction than a welcome addition. Besides his completely unbelievable OTT combat skills his personality is completely different than what we know. People change yes but there is no trace of the cool skilled and warm elf that we know. Instead we get a moody, angry pain in the bum and while that is OK it would have been better served with a new and different face and character.<br/><br/>Going back to a positive note, special mention must go to Benedict Cumberbatch and Smaug, for the performance here is truly fantastic as is the CGI dragon itself. I felt sorry for Martin freeman though as he is meant to be the main character but hardly has any screen time at all. What he has though is excellent, I just wish there was more of it.<br/><br/>All in all it's a vast improvement over the first film but still not as good as any of the LOTR films.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the book on which it is based is barely recognisable in amongst all the made up filler but then again I thought the filler was pretty good. Being a sucker for a good love story the inter racial romance was quite enjoyable and there was plenty of nice lush things to look at and move the story along.<br/><br/>It's definitely apparent that we are not getting an adaptation of the book from this series at all. Why beggars belief as accuracy to source material in the comic, fantasy and sci-fi worlds are of utmost paramount and this is something that we all thought Peter Jackson knew and understood as he could have easily done the book accurately and well without almost completely re-writing it.<br/><br/>As a film though the Hobbit:DoS is a highly enjoyable adventure film with some rich characters and nice lore and is a very welcome addition in my collection, but if I ever want to properly visit the world and adventure that Tolkien wrote about then I'll have to read the book, for there it stays and it doesn't look like it will ever leave."

","It has it all- the romance, action, danger, adventure, lust, wisdom, comedy, passion, mystery. This film is far superior to the first of the trilogy (which almost never happens). The colors were gorgeous, great pacing throughout the film, and most of the characters are great. I will say, some of the dwarfs characters I find I don't really like. I do think that the play on the dwarfs is much too... childish, but then again I did read this book when I was a child, so I can still relate oddly enough. And I must say, Benedict Cumberbatch has one of the greatest voices of all time. Overall, there was never a dull moment for me, I enjoyed every bit. This is one movie I will be able to watch time and time again."
"p-jonsson","7","0","1","19 April 2014"," Not as good as the previous movie not to mention LOTR
","7 out of 10 stars would normally be considered quite okay and I guess you could say that this movie is quite okay. However, it has a reputation to live up to. As a movie in the Tolkien universe and with LOTR and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey this movie have a lot to live up to and, as far as I am concerned, it does not.<br/><br/>As an action/adventure/fantasy movie it is a quite okay movie. It has a lot of action of course, a lot of adventure and a lot of special effects. Of course everything plays out with the Tolkien universe as a back-drop. I guess it is rather superfluous to mention that the movie is based on the book The Hobbit by Tolkien. However it is here the problems start.<br/><br/>In my review of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey the first thing that I mentioned was that you should be aware of the fact that the movie did not follow the book in any great detail and that this was quite okay since the extensions were well made. Well, it should be no surprise that the first part of this statement is valid for this movie as well. Unfortunately, whereas the first movie felt like a fluid extension of the book this one feels like it is just full of fillers.<br/><br/>There are a lot of cool scenes and a lot of action but it really feels like it was just put in there as fillers to showcase the special effects. Speaking of special effects, quite a few of them where rather unimpressive I have to say. The scenes where the dwarfs went down the rapids in barrels frequently looked plastic and artificial. The scenes with Smaug was not too bad even though he was quite overused but the parts around the forges was just plain ridiculous. I know it is fantasy but come one, getting them started and producing tons and tons of molten gold in a few minutes not to mention riding on molten metal without getting burned was just silly.<br/><br/>On the whole I found it an enjoyable movie but I was expecting more."
"Beckerjeremey","10","0","7","17 April 2014"," An excellent movie
","First off, let me say that all these poor reviews of the movie are unnecessary. Directors are given creative freedom to interpret the story any way they choose, and following the book, word for word can just be just plain boring! They want the movie to be exciting, not dull, and so do I and a lot of other movie goers. I thought the movie was very entertaining. It did not drag on like some movies do. There was constant action and excitement. The one thing that did disappoint me was the end. They left me in suspense on what was going to happen with Smaug. I feel they let fans down because you give us a climactic end and then end it abruptly without a conclusion and now we have to wait for the next movie to know the outcome."

Nice to see Orlando back though.<br/><br/>My adult son loved it, and asked me If I had read the Hobbit. Yes I had forty years ago, but I wasn't impressed like many others were, calling it an adult fairy tale. But I loved the Lord of the Rings, and the first of this trilogy.

","They made the dragon way to small for what I was planning to see and I am also upset on how they made Legolas. He is suppose to be 60 years younger and looks so much older then He did in the lord of the rings. Have they never heard of make up? And going back to the dragon? He is buried under tons of gold but yet looks smaller then the dragon in ""The Never Ending Story"". I'm Sorry but there is something wrong with that. I was disappointed in the second Hobbit movie. If the last movie doesn't come out better I Believe it is going to ruin ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy together. There is also no way that Dragon could have flown after all that liquid gold was spilt all over him. I would have made his wings to weak to fly and gotten inside his wound and he wouldn't even want to move. All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!"
"ajvenigalla","7","0","5","14 April 2014"," A bad adaptation, but a good film
","The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, while definitely flawed and not up to the skill that The Lord of the Rings trilogy displayed, still served as a decent film adaptation of Tolkien's book (though three movies are a bit too stretched; two movies probably would have been enough; however, if the third movie delivers, then I won't complain too much). It did have some overuse of CGi and forced epic nature, but it wasn't the abomination that some detractors claimed it was (and neither was it the masterpiece that its most ardent fans said it was). <br/><br/>Now let me get to the plot summary: After the events of the previous film, the movie gives us a brief flashback to the events that happened before the journey, where Thorin (Richard Armitrage) is at an inn and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) meets him up there. It is here that Thorin is encouraged to go upon the quest and reclaim Erebor from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). Later on, the film cuts to 12 months later, where Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Gandalf, Thorin and everyone else is on their journey and they come upon the house of Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), in whose house they dwell while escaping from Azog and his forces. On the journey they encounter spiders, elves, and men, until they eventually come to the Lonely Mountain, to the Desolation of Smaug, and to their homeland in Erebor. <br/><br/>However, dark forces are awakening that were only hinted at before, and they will arise to cause great disaster that will threaten not only our characters but also the entire realm of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Now that i got the plot summary out of the way, let me get to the actual review of the film.<br/><br/>Is it the superb and masterful sequel that some claim that it is? Is it the bloated abomination of epic proportions that the detractors claim? Or are these two options only two of many different views of this film.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug fails in many ways as an adaptation and rendition of the original source. While the main journey is there, much subplot has been added into the film (Thranduil, Legolas, and that female character Tauriel (Evangeline Lily)), and there is more CGi and more action than ever was in An Unexpected Journey. However, if one is considering this as a film, then for the most part this movie succeeds as a nice, exciting action flick that has some pretty good filmmaking and serves as a good blockbuster entertainment that doesn't transcend heights and genre limitations like Lord of the Rings did.<br/><br/>The acting is really good, with Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman doing really good jobs as Gandalf the Grey and Bilbo Baggins. Freeman really captures the development of Bilbo and how he has changed from the previous film. And McKellen captures the character of Gandalf as he learns of the evil that is awakening. Richard Armitrage as Thorin is well-acted, showing how the quest impacts Thorin's heart, changing him from a person concerned for Bilbo to a person almost mad for the Arkenstone and consumed by his desire for Erebor and the wealth it contains. Evangeline Lily is pretty decent as Tauriel, though I find her to still be filler that was added just to make the story more ""female-friendly"" (not to mention that I personally didn't connect with the implied love triangle with her, Legolas, and Kili, one of the thirteen dwarfs) and Orlando Bloom is also pretty good in his role as Legolas (though his face looks a bit unnatural in contrast to the Lord of the Rings movies). Benedict Cumberbatch was also good as Smaug, though not the master everybody claims he is<br/><br/>The script also is pretty good, but the film did drag a bit near the middle, especially with the overload of action sequences in this film, all of which are pretty good but which are not great. Many of the scenes border on over-the-top and popcorn-style scenes, with dwarfs suddenly having skills that rival the finest Olympic athletes, elves doing acrobatics while fighting evil monsters, Tauriel using cool ninja-style moves while killing monsters, and more. For the heavy action fan and an admirer of today's action-packed blockbuster entertainment, this movie is heaven. But for those who preferred Lord of the Rings and don't like overloaded action, this film will drag (even though I admit that I didn't hate most of the action scenes in the film). And may I note that this film has an excess of computer-generated images in contrast to the happy marriage of practical and digital effects that has existed in so many great films, masterpieces and classic movies of modern times (Jurassic Park, Terminator 2, and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and many other films come to mind). While the CGi does manage to be good in the long run, there are instances where it looks fake, particularly in the ending where Thorin and all the dwarfs unleash a golden statue of a dwarf warrior and that statue melts and covers Smaug (the gold looked so laughably fake). <br/><br/>Overall, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, while a bit too overloaded with action and CGi as well as other pop-blockbuster elements of today, still serves as a nice action movie that both expands upon the merits of An Unexpected Journey and at the same time expands upon the demerits of the film. It works on the overall level as an action film set in Middle Earth, and despite its many flaws, there is just so much good work and effort put into this movie that it is near-impossible to compare this to other big-budget failures and punching-bags like the Star Wars prequel trilogy or Battlefield Earth. <br/><br/>It is not a perfect film, and neither is it a great film, but it is a good film. 3.5/5"
"julian-mumford","9","0","5","11 April 2014"," Highly enjoyable thrilling romp through Middle Earth
","Peter Jackson continues his pursuit of bringing Middle Earth to the screen in as much detail as possible, with this the difficult middle film of the Hobbit trilogy.<br/><br/>The first Hobbit film received a solid if not spectacular critical reception, with some complaints about the long set up and just ""too much singing"". Box office of $1 billion plus, suggested critics had been too harsh.<br/><br/>This film has no need for lengthy exposition so we are straight into the action as the group continue their quest towards the Lonely mountain and a confrontation with a fire breathing talking dragon with a penchant for shiny treasure.<br/><br/>All the regular cast members are present and correct, the production values and costumes are as usual top notch. with special effects arguably the best in the world courtesy of Weta workshops, we are in safe hands here.<br/><br/>Having dispensed with big feasts and washing up malarkey, this time Bilbo (Freeman) gets to meet giant spiders, Elves, Lake dwellers, many, many Orc's and of course the titular Smaug guarding the treasure trove.<br/><br/>The dwarfs are again acted by well known faces, including Thorin (Richard Armitrage), Balin (Ken Stott) and Kilin (Aidan Turner) all made dwarf size through a combination of effects and simple perspective and camera tricks. Ian Mckellen of course takes on the Gandalf role and Orlando Bloom gets to do his hero, swashbuckling thing, dispensing Orcs, like he has never been away. Which of course is odd, as he has not reached the point where the LOTR Fellowship is even a consideration.<br/><br/>It is well known that Tolkien stinted on female characters, so Jackson and writers Walsh and Boyle neatly side step this omission by creating a feisty female Elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilley), who is more than a match for Legolas. We even get a glimpse of romance and sexual tension with a possible, elf, dwarf love triangle in the offing.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman again anchors the enterprise with a comic yet human performance, it is difficult to imagine anyone playing this better. There are numerous action sequences including a thrilling barrel ride down a cascading river chased by despicable Orc's, with South Island NZ doubling beautifully for Middle Earth yet again.<br/><br/>Following the assistance of smuggler Girion (Luke Evans) we also get Stephen Fry as the leader of Lake town which seems an odd choice and arguably this sequence is weaker for this addition.<br/><br/>Overall a real return to form for director Jackson and the team, which places the series on firm ground for the final film. This is a rollicking adventure with thrills, spills, action, adventure and elements of humour whenever the going gets tough.<br/><br/>True, there are still many references to doom-laden scenarios that may mean little to non-Tolkien aficionado's but no matter, on whatever level you wish to approach the material, this is a resounding success.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Highly enjoyable thrilling romp through Middle Earth in company of the characters we have come to care about. This strips back some of the unnecessary fripperies and delivers on the original promise.<br/><br/>Highly recommended <br/><br/>Note** After watching both Hobbit 1 & 2 in 3D this will be the last time in that format. For this reviewer live action in 3D especially HFR, appears to expose the falseness of scenes. In future we will stay with 2D unless the whole film is CGI, where the true 3D benefits can be seen (i.e. Toy Story 3) - IMHO"
"mnkim","8","0","3","14 April 2014"," Great Adventure & Contradictions
","The Desolation continues the adventure with fights, shocks, humour and as usual great characters and fantastic scenery. Peter Jackson (appearing briefly on camera in Bree biting into a Carrot)has once again produced a masterpiece and yet? Wheareas the LOTR varied (as it had to) frequently from the book. The Hobbit: Desolation in particular bears little or no resemblance to the original story. Anyone hoping to tie this series in with LOTR should forget that notion. Both stories are excellent but there the relationship ends. Gandalf in this story is far more knowing about Saurons resurrection then he ever was in LOTR where his surprise at the extent of Saurons recovery (as told to him by Saroman) was very clear. While Sauron is gradually regaining his powers the Gandalf of LOTR would never have sought a direct confrontation with the evil one nor was that intended when he and his fellow wizards were sent to Middle Earth.I loved the film but to tell the truth it felt stretched. The scenes with Smaug were repeated over and over during the chase. Certain aspects were dragged out far longer than they needed to be. The Hobbit could and should have been made into two extended films but not three. That is only making it last for three movies harder. No doubt the final chapter will be great entertainment and I will enjoy it thoroughly its just that........?"

","Review: What an epic movie. I wasn't a big fan of The Lord Of The Rings movies and I thought that this movie was going to refer back to the other movies, but the storyline was pretty straight forward and easy to follow Gandalf explains the whole plot at the beginning so your able to enjoy the movie without trying to remember names and working out who is who. With that aside, Peter Jackson really did put together a movie spectacular, with fire breathing dragons, arrow shooting elves, ugly looking giant monsters and, of course, the harmless dwarfs. The whole film looked amazing, especially the attention to detail with the dragon, which looked believable. All of the sets looked great and there was a great mixture of characters which helped you along the two and a half hours epic. Anyway, this is a great movie which really does hype you up for the next instalment. Epic!<br/><br/>Round-Up: The way that the movie is advertised, I thought that it was going to be, mostly, about Bilbo Baggins and Gandolf, but it really does follows each character well and it doesn't concentrate any individual. Basically about a gang of dwarfs, fighting to claim back there kingdom but there are some elves and monsters thrown in to the mix. It was good to see Gandolf in his few scenes, but there isn't any Gollum, although you do hear his ""Precious"" every now and again. All of the characters put it great performances, which much have been hard because half of the characters are there to work with. The fighting scenes with the elves were excellent and very well choreographed. Honestly, I really haven't got a bad word to say about this film and I hope the next one is just as good or even better.<br/><br/>Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $950.5million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into The Lord Of The Rings franchise which is full of adventure, fantasy and epic drama. 8/10"

"t-hf","7","0","3","22 January 2014"," Definitely an improvement
","The Desolation of Smaug certainly improves over it's lacklustre-but-OK predecessor. I will say this for the movie, it boasts one of the most amazing CGI dragons that I have ever seen and some of the most rousing action that both builds suspense and moves along at a fun, swashbuckling pace. However, the film suffers from the same problems as the first film: there is just not enough plot to carry it's running time. When watching the film, one does sense a lot of needless subplots focused on characters that - no offence to them - we just don't care about. The Kili-Legolas-Tauriel love triangle for example, just doesn't hold enough interest. I will admit that long time fans will enjoy Legolas' appearance but it doesn't really add anything to a story that didn't contain the character in the first place. Another problem is that Gandalf barely gets any screen time in the already bloated movie, even though he is featured prominently on the poster. I know that Gandalf has a habit of leaving at random moments but come on, he could have been more central to the story.<br/><br/>On the light side, the visuals aren't nearly as disorientating as An Unexpected Journey, looks like Mr. Jackson has toned it down a bit. A high point for me was the barrel chase, which not only had some good visual effects but was an all round fun action scene. The cliffhanger also had me breathless. It was so beautifully orchestrated that it left me gasping to see There and Back Again. As for Ed Sheeran's ""I See Fire"" - I usually hate his music but his song ties up the movie perfectly, as does Howard Shore's trademark soundtrack. Overall, the film is a major improvement but is not without major flaws and I cannot wait to see what Jackson does with There and Back Again."

","After ""The hobbit: an unexpected journey"", the first part of the hobbit trilogy, the second movie is even more far away from the original story of the book. Don't get me wrong, it is very entertaining, just not what I expected. The story is the continuation of the first movie : Bilbo, the hobbit, in the company of 13 dwarfs and Gandalf the wizard are continuing their journey towards the lonely mountain and the stolen treasure, followed by a pack of orcs, attacked by elves and finally taking help from a human from the lake town. The special effects are brilliant, especially the dragon, who looks very real and horrible. The part when Sauron is taking the form of the eye in front of Gandalf wasn't that great, but I wasn't a fan of the idea of showing the Nekromad and his forces, from the beginning. Clever lines, not as funny as the ones from the first movie, but still very interesting. The love story between the elf and the dwarf was interesting too, surprisingly, as I believed, when I first heard of it being said by others who had already seen the movie, it will destroy the movie. The music was good too, epic and exciting, according to the mood of the film. The scenery was fantastic, gray and beautiful at the same time, especially that scene when Legolas is chasing the orc over the lake. All in all, a great movie, but not for the fans of the book, who will be disappointed if they expect the original story. P.S. The ending is a little bit sudden."

I did however read the Hobbit as a child and I must say I wasn't impressed, it was okay, maybe it was because I was a girl? Not sure. These movies however I love from beginning to the end. I am thrilled Peter Jackson is at the helm of these 3 Hobbit films. I was one who was thrilled that Jackson and the Lord of the Rings Films won the Oscar, in my opinion it deserved it. They are stunning stories, stories that keep me glued to the screen. When I am thinking of nothing but what is going on the screen you have captured me, its engrossing. I will again be very sad when this trilogy is over, I loved the first one and love this 2nd one. Wish Viggo Mortensen would of chosen to be in the film. Love the addition of Evangeline Lilly, and like an old friend loved seeing Legolas again! and the mention of Grimley, wonderful!"

","The Desolation of Smaug is a little less boring than the previous instalment, but it's really no better in terms of craft and narrative. Therere is one inspired action sequence in which the dwarfs and Bilbo escape from the elves in barrels. This sequence recalls Jackson's King Kong set pieces where he just builds ideas on top of ideas into an extended adventure. And that's it. Then it's all back to normal.<br/><br/>Whilst the Lord of the Rings were Oscar-winning technical marvels, the biggest issue I have with this and Journey is that the story is so mundane that we're left looking for a visual ""wow"" factor, and it's not there. The barrel sequence was so clever, I didn't care how the effects looked. The generic archery and dragon hunting wasn't creatively captivating, and it certainly wasn't visually so.<br/><br/>Overall it's entertaining and it's quite obvious the source material is so short that the crew had no choice but to embellish on the story. And add plenty of visual effects as filler to prolong this story across three films.<br/><br/>If you're seek an absolutely 100% accurate book to film translation you will be unhappy. But if you want to be entertained and can overlook this you'll have a nice time"

","I like sagas a lot, especially that ones which involve mythology, but I am not a huge fan of LORD OF THE RINGS. On the other hand, I am in love with THE HOBBIT. Since I watched THE HOBBIT – AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY in 2012, I have been astonished and became a fan immediately. What a fantastic movie! Some reviewers prefer to compare the book to the film. It is good to compare, however we must be careful. It is not right to say one is better than the other, because they have different kind of language. The screen players Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson and Guillermo del Toro did an amazing work, they do not follow the book entirely neither frustrate who expect sees the book inside the film. It is possible to remember the scene of film when you are reading the book and vice-verse, even though they are not the same. The elf Legolas is one of the characters whose participation was a choice of the screen players, because he does not exist in the book yet. A great idea! Although I consider Orlando Bloom's career not as good as people thinks, but he has done a not bad job as Legolas since THE LORD OF THE RINGS. It is time to go the cast, officially! I have lots of things to say about this topic, but two words could embody everything: ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! I am not going to analyse all of them, only three, because it would be an enormous review. It is clear as crystal that each actor and actress of this saga took his characters so serious and grew up with them. One of the actors does not need presentation: Ian Mckellen - a master in acting. He proves (he does not need to show anything, we know, we always knew) to be a perfectionist in every single scene. Martin Freeman - known by playing Watson in SHERLOCK (TV) – is a great actor, I have to confess I am a big fan of Sherlock and admire so much Martin in his work on TV, his performance never disappoint me. Richard Armitage (our King under the mountain) is another nice choice, he is really good at. I am pretty sure he is the tallest dwarf I have ever seen in my whole life, he became a giant in dwarf skin in minutes, if you know what I mean. There is an especial scene that I picked up to you just for you feel the vibe of the film: Bilbo surfing on the Dragon's fortune, or better, Bilbo sliding on the Smaug's treasure. It is unforgettable! Well, I don not want to stop writing, it is so many things that it should be said, but this review must end , so I finish it now and leave a tip for you: If you are addicted to elf, orc, sorcerer, wizard, dwarf, hobbit, enchanted mountain, duel, sword an many more strange creatures, run to the movies right now, it is an order!!!!!"
"FugitiveAmoeba","7","0","2","10 January 2014"," Entertaining but just not a great addition to the Middle Earth universe
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" feels all too familiar, because it is. Peter Jackson pretty much uses up all his tropes to breathe life into this unnecessary middle part of the trilogy based on a story that's been stretched too thin already.<br/><br/>The story picks up where the first Hobbit film left off, but it is a much darker film. Even the sprightly Bilbo Baggins has a certain nastiness to him, add to that the Necromancer, Mirkwood, and a new Orc Chieftain you have a grim tale to tell, but that's where Peter Jackson's latest effort comes up short. There is no tale to tell and the film, in a self-parodying fashion ends up being a walkathon.<br/><br/>New characters like Evangeline Lily's Tauriel are nice additions, but it all feels like filler especially when Jackson strays from source material with clichéd dialogue, contrived romances and predictable action sequences. Speaking of which, the stakes were never lower for our traveling company. There is no orc nor Morgul blade that the dwarfs and the surprisingly efficient Bilbo cannot overcome and if you rolled your eyes at the Goblin cave sequence in the first film, be prepared for more of the same in this one.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the production quality is top-notch and so is the music. The dragon - Smaug is very well crafted and voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch. The film, while long at over 160 mins involving mainly walking around, never feels boring. It just isn't a great addition to the Middle Earth universe and feels like a filler. But it does succeed in building up anticipation for the grand finale. 6.5/10"
"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","0","5","9 January 2014"," Not a Tolkien fanatic.
","A love a good fantasy novel and a great movie, but I have never been one to worship in the church of Tolkien; I've read the three volumes of Lord of the Rings and consider him a master storyteller, but they hardly changed my life and frankly after all these decades, these books really show their age. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy, maybe the finest work of movie fantasy next to STAR WARS and THE MATRRIX, so there was no way I would miss Jackson's version of THE HOBBIT. In my view, THE HOBBIT makes a good movie, but it's probably better if the viewer has not read Tolkien's original story, which is after all, a rather slim (by LOTR standards) children's book. While AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY set things up with a lot of introduction and exposition, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, lets the action rip, as the band of dwarfs, along with Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf race toward the Lonely Mountain and their eventual encounter with the fierce dragon, Smaug. <br/><br/>Lots and lots of liberties with the book have been taken as it was expanded to a three part epic. This has brought down upon Jackson and company the wrath of the church of Tolkien, who are quite vocal about such blasphemies as having the elf Legolas appear in the movie, when he doesn't in the book. That, along with a romance, seem to have driven the Hobbit devotees up the wall and across the ceiling. <br/><br/>They need to understand that any movie version of any literary work is simply a version of the story set in an alternate universe: it's the same characters, but they may well be doing different things. Just enjoy the ride for what it is. That is way Stephen King explained the changes made in UNDER THE DOME when it was adapted for CBS television. <br/><br/>For me, THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG contained the kind of great set piece scenes we go to the movie theater to see in the first place, especially the battle between the dwarfs and the Orcs as the former attempt to flee by floating down a river in barrels. Then there is Bilbo's climatic encounter with Smaug under The Lonely Mountain, a great use of CGI in combination with Benedict Cumberbatch's vocal contributions. Not to mention the encounter with the spiders in Mirkwood. All well worth the price of a ticket; and again all very different from the book.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things wrong with THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG: the pacing is uneven as the running time is stretched to nearly three hours; it's still hard to keep track of who is who among the band of dwarfs other than Thorin the leader; some of the romance is clearly just shoe horned into the story; a truly abrupt ending that leaves way too many loose threads; what's with Evnangeline Lilly's way too large Elf ears? And why does Thorin turn on Bilbo at one point, thus negating the moving final scene of AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY.<br/><br/>Still Peter Jackson does an magnificent job of creating a fantasy world that lives and breathes, a place that has a lot of history. Same with many of the characters, such as Lee Pace's Thandril, the Elf King, whom we sense have stories in their past that would make for an epic movie all by themselves. That goes for Ian McKellen's Gandalf, the original wise old wizard; it's great to see him back in the role that, along with Magneto, made him famous to millions worldwide. Martin Freeman, as Bilbo, more than holds his own against the other great talent on the screen. But I miss Christopher Lee's Sauromon and there is only a brief glimpse of Cate Blanchett's Galadriel. <br/><br/>So enjoy the movie for what it is, then read the book and do the same."

","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug carries on after our crew of Dwarfs and Bilbo are picked up by the Eagles. While the way the group meet Beorn isn't exactly like the it is in the book, it was interesting and keeps the continuity from the first film. I do like how they revealed the true identity of the Necromancer, and the addition of Legolas to the cast although he is never mentioned in the book. He is the only one that could have been around when this story played out, and of course is the son of the Elven king. Peter Jackson is doing a great job with the Hobbit Trilogy just as he did with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I can't wait to see the extended additions of these films to see the book better incorporated into the Movie. I highly recommend this Movie to all fans of Middle Earth."
"deacon_blues-3","8","0","3","7 January 2014"," Jackson's vision is a departure from Tolkien
","Unlike many other reviewers, I do not fault Peter Jackson merely because he departs from his literary source. A film is not a book. Jackson has a right to take wide latitude from the original to create his own vision of this or any other story. This being established, <br/><br/>I found this film to be a whole lot of fun and adventure! Yes, there are large differences between Tolkien and Jackson's telling of this story. But I believe those who detract from his films merely on this account are woefully short-sighted. <br/><br/>Jackson is making a small children's book into a massive epic retelling of monumental events in Middle-Earth history. Do the math; you can't get three immense films out of one small children's story book without cooking up some major inflations of Tolkien's quaintly narrated events. <br/><br/>LOTR is adult literature, but The Hobbit is not. Therefore the transformations involved in getting from book to cinema must of necessity be much more extreme. This accounts for most of Jackson's augmentations in the Hobbit films. <br/><br/>Another consideration is that this segment of Hobbit is much richer than the first. How can anyone fault him for ramping up the action sequences involving Beorn, giant spiders, the Necromancer, and Smaug? It would have been a waste to portray all those sequences on the quaint level of Tolkien's original narrative. <br/><br/>The one major detraction I cite Jackson for is all this nonsense about Tauriel and Kili. I understand that in cinema, romance is an essential element that needs to be included (but I still don't like it in the context of Tolkien!). But the concept of an Elf romantically attracted to a dwarf (and vise-versa) is thoroughly unacceptable! It would never happen in Tolkien, and it should never be countenanced in any film version of his works! But the effrontery does not merely stop there! The most shameful affront is the salacious banter between Kili and Tauriel about ""what he might have in his trousers!"" That is an inglorious disgrace that should never be tolerated in these adaptations! I hope Jackson has the good sense to eliminate or at least tone-down this plot thread in the final installment!<br/><br/>The other major departures to found in Desolation of Smaug are thoroughly excusable and mostly even improvements, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The barrel sequences actually make more sense than the original. The idea that elves would ignore that fact that barrels that should be empty are filled with something very heavy always bothered me in the original story. Jackson solved this in his version by having Bilbo launch the barrels himself. I also often wondered how dwarfs could be expected to survive in water-tight sealed barrels as they drifted through freezing river streams. Jackson solves this problem by keeping the barrels unsealed. I thoroughly enjoyed the barrel sequences, as over-the-top as it indeed is! The scene with Bombor's barrel bouncing around among the orcs is an absolute hoot! I laughed out loud through the whole thing! The battle sequences in this part were also far- fetched, but I found them a great romp of fun as well. Jackson loves to show off the battle prowess of elves, and I find this thoroughly in keeping with Tolkien's vision of the Eldar.<br/><br/>The dragon scenes, as extremely inflated and changed as they are, are also understandable to my mind. Why waste a perfectly good dragon by sticking to the constructs of Tolkien's children's narrative? It would have been a disservice to do less than Jackson did. <br/><br/>I must admit that at first the purist in me balked at seeing Bilbo visible to Smaug and the dwarfs running from Smaug inside Erebor, but I soon realized that it made perfect sense unless you were going to make the whole interior of the mountain one simple pitch black treasure chamber as Tolkien did. But such a decision on Jackson's part would have been contrary to the best qualities of the cinematic media. In the days when special effects were best only hinted at because they were too transparent to appear authentic it may have been justified, but when you have the full gamut of seamless effects at your disposal, why not take everything to the limit? After all, it's doubtful that this film franchise will ever be duplicated in the future, and Jackson, for all his excellent qualities as a filmmaker, has never cultivated the reputation of being a minimalist! perhaps someday a purist version of Hobbit and LOTR will be filmed, but I'm not holding my breath, nor do I recommend it to others!<br/><br/>All in all, I found this installment mostly satisfying along with bright hopes for the concluding segment next year. My one fear is that Jackson will insist on ending the story with an ill-advised wedding scene between Kili (who should by rights die in the battle of the 5 armies!) and Tauriel (MAJOR GAG! MAJOR CRINGE!)"

But to be honest, I really really enjoyed watching the movie. It's a long movie but for me, it ended too fast. Everyone did their best job.

","I loved this movie and the previous, even with all the mistakes and goofs throughout. But before I go into those, I thoroughly enjoy Peter Jackson's version of the Hobbit since I have read it several times before the first movie was actually in consideration of being made. So I grew up with Tolkien's stories and playing AD&D for many years. <br/><br/>I have high expectations of Peter Jackson and he did very well with the first movie, An Unexpected Journey. More expectations were set before going to see The Desolation of Smaug, and again - Peter Jackson did a superb job of giving me a great experience. With a couple exceptions, and here I go with those Issues I have...<br/><br/>This movie has only two major problems with me. The First, Orlando Bloom's face is CGI'd and given bright blue eyes. In the previous trilogy, Orlando Bloom was not CGI'd at all and his blue eyes were darker. <br/><br/>So there is a huge difference between Legolas of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, and anyone who knows Elves --- they don't change since they are immortal.<br/><br/>And then of course the ending. The ending sucked! And that's all I have to say about the Desolation of Smaug. Be Safe Out There!"

","If you like the saga you will like this movie a lot. If you are not a fan of fantasy worlds, you won't like it as much but it's still a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>One dilemma I have with these movies is their running time. I always think they could have been broken down into several shorter episodes and be much more enjoyable than the 3-hour movies they turn out to be. <br/><br/>This particular segment of the Hobbit's story is more transitional than the previous and the next, so the viewer might feel the beginning and the ending of the movie are lacking in ""introduction"" and ""closure"". This is why I argue the movie doesn't need to be that long, since the director is cutting it wherever anyhow.<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely outstanding and the action scenes are incredibly dynamic and original. The music is always beautiful, and wardrobe and make-up are as good as it gets. <br/><br/>Character development is given less importance in this title compared to the rest of the trilogy, and the storyline is more focused on the adventure itself. There's a few new colorful characters, but, again, not greatly developed just yet in the saga. <br/><br/>It is, all in all, a great movie to watch, specially in theaters. The problem is that we can't help but to compare it to the other Lord of the Rings titles, which are overall, in my opinion, better than this one."

It feels a bit like the Star Wars prequels: it's made by the same skillful people but it's just not as good as the original, there's something missing. What the film is very good at is serving up pure eye-candy. The attention to detail in the costumes, props, sets and VFX is mind-boggling. Howard Shore again provides the score but besides hints of the LOTR theme it's just not that memorable. If you've seen the other LOTR films you're not gonna skip this one so I don't need to convince anyone I guess.

","This is a good film - but it's not as magical as the LOTR. It feels like it's gone a bit to PJ's head. That he has full liberty to change whatever he wants to increase the length of the story. eg. - you have Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly fighting orcs in Lake Town, or to put it another way 2 made-up characters (a female to create female interest/a love triangle and Orlando just because PJ likes him / thinks the fans like him) fighting orcs that were never in the book until the end. The barrel ride in the book had Bilbo on top of sealed barrels quietly floating down the river to Lake Town. Bilbo opens the lid after 2 days to find some very grumpy dwarfs. Here we have open barrels, a 20minute action scene featuring the above 2 elf characters and more orcs. LOTR changed some things but often to fit it all into 3x 3 films - this is the opposite and on a whole new level! Also the editing to keep cutting to Gandalf's scenes halfway through Bilbo, the dwarfs and the dragon fight reminded me of Return of the Jedi's climax - but ROTJ was a perfect edit. Here it's really ham fisted cutting right in the middle of a chase scene. In ROTJ they cut when there was a convenient quiet point (Luke hides/rests, them big doors closing on Endor, the space attack failing). Here it's just jarring. Also, in the back of people's mind is the fact Gandalf journeyed for weeks to get there so it seems so badly edited to even construe that all of this is happening at the same time. Also, in ROTJ the storeys influenced each other (turning off that energy shield). Here the storey's aren't relevant to each other - at least within the context of the film. It's a mess. Really disappointed how this trilogy is panning out PJ. Some fan boys and people that haven't read the book will rave about the wonderful orcs and action - but that's not the book. Save it all for the final battle in film 3."

","The theater in which I saw The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug seated over 300 people and it was completely filled, not an empty seat in the house. What did that cause? Humidity, claustrophobia, and distractions. The viewing experience mirrored the film we were watching. Though it improves from the first chapter, The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug feels suffocating and prolonged, the tone becomes an object of ridicule (who knew the legacy of the-end-of- the-world trilogy that was Lord of the Rings would be reduced to the unserious nature of The Hobbit trilogy?), and extremely cheap (remember when Fellowship of the Ring won Best Cinematography, clearly Desolation of Smaug forgot).<br/><br/>The film does benefit from the short-lived presence of Gandalf played magnificently by Ian McKellen, but even his lines have evolved from deep thoughtfulness to reactions of slapstick comedy. McKellen has a charm as Gandalf that Marlon Brando created with The Godfather that soothes the viewer, that is what makes these characters iconic.<br/><br/>The hours of set building, CGI construction of Smaug, costume designing, and make-up work seek through the emaciated screenplay and the farce tone. If There and Back Again retains the same tonal treatment, maybe the studios should submit it to the Golden Globes as a Comedy/Musical with a nostalgic campaign of the original trilogy<br/><br/>Grade: C+<br/><br/>Rating: 5"
"HelenMary","7","0","3","31 December 2013"," Peter Jackson's done it again... brilliant but long
","The second installment in the Hobbit story had a lot to live up to, first in terms of The Lord of the Rings, and secondly The Unexpected Journey. This sees the band of dwarfs and Bilbo (with ring) get to The Lonely Mountain to try and claim it back from Smaug the dragon. They go via Mirkwood and so we meet the elves and get introduced to Legolas (Orlando Bloom, who's a little less elf-sylph-like around the face in this one...) Adventure and fun ensues. There's orc-slaying a-plenty with a never ending supply of elvish arrows in the quiver, a barrel of laughs as dwarfs make a getaway and lots of dwarvish physical humour especially at the expense of the fat dwarf and I always get a giggle from Nesbitt's antics and his silly hat (Bofur, the dwarf). Even Stephen Fry does an almost unrecognisable star turn in this film as the hideous Master of the Lake Town. Richard Armitage (Thorin) has the most acting range, possibly, in terms of the adventure-party and his voice caries the gravitas of his Dwarf-King-in-Waiting status. There's a little romance, which is rather touching, but the star of the show is Smaug the dragon, beautifully realised and brilliant CGI - flawless. Wizard Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) has a relatively small role in this film, which is a shame but he does do some fierce battle with Sauron/the Necromancer. However, the main (non CGI) star I think is Martin Freeman as Bilbo; I love his little gestures and comedic timing and characterisation of the Hobbit, especially when he's in a quandary. <br/><br/>Once again the special effect that allows hobbits and dwarfs to stand short next to men is really clever and I struggle to get used to seeing familiar (tall) actors made to look small but that is dwarfed (pardon the pun) by all the CGI which I really do get tired of, although it was less in your face and obvious than the last film; I realise it is necessary but sometimes it LOOKS less convincing. Overall this is enjoyable, accomplished and an entertaining part of the overall story for a Middle Earth fan, and it has all the elements you would want from a Hobbit story. I haven't read the book for a long LONG time so can't remember how close it sticks to the book but much of it rang bells. No matter, I know it was done by a fan of Tolkien and someone who would want to do it justice (note Peter Jackson's cameo in the opening scene) and he's done an excellent job. Again. I think I preferred the story of the first and it was more exciting (gripping/suspenseful) but this was a better film and the SFX were largely better. I preferred the first one over all in terms of opinion coming away, as I felt this one dragged a bit and got a bit bogged down, and it could have been shorter.<br/><br/>For this film to make sense, I imagine you'd have needed to see the first of the films. Not a film for arachnophobes, as an aside."

","The special effects were good. It has a lot of action in it. It's part of the series and the plot doesn't really work as a stand-alone movie. It's open-ended so it's a bit disappointing. Gandalf goes off on an adventure of his own and intends to meet Bilbo and the dwarfs later but doesn't. Bilbo goes into the mountain to retrieve the Arkenstone but doesn't manage to get it and tells the dwarfs this, but then nobody says anything further about the matter. They all battle the dragon in a very long fight scene but are unable to defeat it and it flies off to attack the town. It would have worked better as a stand-alone movie if the adventurers (erroneously) believed that they had killed the dragon, and if they retrieved the Arkenstone, and Gandalf then rejoined them to celebrate."

Basically after the opening, seeing how Gandalf the Grey (Sir Ian McKellen) recruited dwarf Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) to join a fellowship to reclaim the dwarfs' lost kingdom of Erebor, the story continues where the last left off, where hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), Gandalf, Thorin and the rest of the dwarfs, Balin (Ken Stott), Dwalin (Graham McTavish), Fíli (Dean O'Gorman), Kíli (Being Human's Aidan Turner), Dori (Mark Hadlow), Nori (Jed Brophy), Ori (Adam Brown), Óin (John Callen), Glóin (Peter Hambleton), Bifur (William Kircher), Bofur (James Nesbitt) and Bombur (Stephen Hunter) have crossed over (and under) the Misty Mountains. They are chased by orcs and find shelter in the house of skin-changer Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt), and after Gandalf leaves the company the other continue into Mirkwood, following the instruction that they must stay on the path, of course this becomes difficult, and giant spiders slow them in their tracks, but Bilbo with his sword he names Sting and the help of elves Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), son of Elven King Thranduil (Lee Pace), defeat these foes. The elves put the group into cages, but Bilbo using the One Ring he took from Gollum releases them, and at the riverbank they meet bowman Bard (Luke Evans) who for a price agrees to smuggle them on his barge of barrels into Lake-town, where they hope to find a range of better weapons before they reach the Lonely Mountain, where the feared dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) lays waiting, but of course the company are unwelcome by the Master of Lake- town (Stephen Fry). After agreeing that they will give the town a high amount of the riches from inside the cave of the dragon, and some other little bits and pieces of argument or fighting, they are allowed to continue on, and eventually they reach the top of the Lonely Mountain, and Bilbo decodes the message of the wall of how to open the door, and he as the ""burglar"" is the one that must enter the dragon's lair and find the Arkenstone. Gandalf meanwhile travelled with fellow wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy), but he is alone in the orc-ambushed Dol Guldur, where he engages with the dark evil called the Necromancer (also Cumberbatch), but his true identity is revealed, it is in fact the evil force of the dark lord Sauron, returned to Middle Earth, and after battle the wizard ends up captured. Bilbo clambers his way into the caves, and through the millions of golden treasures and jewels, looking amongst them for the distinctive Arkenstone, of course he cannot escape waking Smaug, the large dragon may not be able to see him with the ring on, but he senses his presence, and the hobbit does his best to convince him he is not stealing anything, but ultimately the dwarfs come to save him when the situation becomes too dangerous. They manage to trick Smaug into using his fiery breath for opposite effect, and they think they have killed him by drowning him in a a vat of molten gold, but in fact he shakes this off, and in rage the dragon escapes the mountain and starts flying towards Lake-town, Bilbo watches as the beast makes his way to wreak havoc, and in devastation all he can say is ""what have we done?"", this is the cliffhanger. Also starring Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Ryan Gage as Alfrid and Lawrence Makoare as Makoare. Freeman still remains likable as the slowly becoming confident and reliable hero, McKellen is still wonderful as the wise wizard prepared to do anything to protect his shorter friend, and many of the supporting cast members bring a little something to their characters, but best, as he is so unrecognisable, is the voice of Cumberbath as dragon Smaug, he is so dark and booming, it is admittedly not as sweeping as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was, but the special effects are still amazing, the scene between Bilbo and Smaug is the most engaging part, and there are the action packed sequences to keep you happy, a most worthwhile fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up/Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Good!"

","This year's biggest (literally) pleasant surprise. After the long, slow start to chapter one had dampened the ardour of many a Middle Earth fan, I had more modest hopes for what could be achieved eking out yet another three hour behemoth from the middle chapters of Tolkien's modest children's tale and Peter Jackson has exceeded every one magnificently. Bold, energetic, funny, frightening, tense, and immensely spectacular. The clear aim now is to take The Hobbit as a skeleton structure that will be fleshed with all the immense back-story, parallel tales and grim foreshadowing of what is to come that it can withstand. It's a brave, and somewhat indulgent move, but it's coming together here with a bravura confidence that was sometimes lacking from part one. This is now just a dwarf's whisker from Lord Of The Rings greatness."

","Follows the book almost all the time. Peter Jackson put a little love story in it, while the book barely has any female characters at all. Orlando Bloom has a little place in it as well as Legolas, we can see a new Legolas, why he became what he was in the Lord of the Rings, why he hates dwarfs so much. Actors and actresses play well, Peter Jackson did a great job in directing this movie as well. Big LotR fans will love this movie as well, though some people might start to find this movie a bit long with a bit too much repeating throughout the movies. All of all I give it an eight. I like LotR and this was a great movie as well, recommend it to everyone, even if you haven't seen the Lord of the Rings itself, for after all the Hobbit is before the Lord of the Rings in time."

It also made me wonder how long I was going to watch the movie for because two hours passed and they (the main characters) were still no where near to where they wanted to be. The ending was unexpected, I didn't know the ending was the ending, and neither did the people in the theater too. We sat there for a good few minutes in darkness wondering if that was it until the credits started rolling. I wished it had more of an ending, but what can I say, there must be another part to this movie coming. There is still a lot to this story to be continued and truths to be told. Overall an 8.5, not 10 because of the ending, it left me at a cliffhanger."

","The adventure continues and just like the Lord of the Rings, Two Towers, this ""middle"" movie kinda leaves you unsatisfied. Mostly because you know what is just around the corner! Maybe two movies could have been better, as in LOTR, but if you love these movies you put up with the ""middles"" and feeling unsatisfied a bit! Martin Freeman (Bilbo) continues to carry this character just fine. I had my doubts at first but when I saw The Hobbit, I was sold. He IS Bilbo Baggins now just as Elijah Wood IS Frodo. The other actors play their parts exceedingly well, too. Will anyone ever be able to re-make these movies with others? I think NO unless they wait a generation or so.<br/><br/>As a reader of the books, I see that many small, rather important details are left out mostly due to necessity of time restraints. And to me this does not take away from the enjoyment of the story. Although, IMO, there are more missing details from the Hobbit tales than from LOTR. Again, this does not take away from my enjoyment of the flicks.<br/><br/>I love that Orlando Bloom (Legolas) is still doing great skateboarding-type moves, too. I cracked up at that. The addition of Evangeline Lilly is perfect as she is as much an Elf-like beauty as Liv Tyler. All the actors including the usual suspects (Ian, Richard, Andy, etc.) do a stellar job in portraying their fantasy characters. An enjoyable ride through Middle Earth..."

","This film was never going to be equivalent to the Lord of the Rings, yet unfortunately that is why I have found fault in it. The epic scales of LOTR could never be matched in the Hobbit, and though the second adventure of the dwarfs did increase in action and thrilling suspense, with Smaug's presence being graciously welcomed, it feels far too childish in comparison to LOTR. Perhaps my growing tastes have influenced my review, in that growing up with LOTR and growing older tastes when the Hobbit was released meant I couldn't appreciate it with the same fervour a child would. However it feels that these films seem to garner a lot more humour, and lack the subtlety with which was found in LOTR, not that this is a bad thing, some viewers might find the light heartedness necessary, but for me I feel it detracts from the story. Once again, this film feels like it is lengthened unnecessarily, and the source material extrapolated to create a far more expansive universe than there should be, at a push this could be a duology, not a trilogy."

"paul_haakonsen","8","0","6","28 December 2013"," Spiders? Run! Orcs? Run! Dragon? Run! Sure was a lot of running here...
","""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is actually the best of all the movies in the Lord of the Rings universe. Well, at least I think so. ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" was nice, but ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is just a tad better, and especially better than the movies in the first trilogy.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie, are unfortunately, much as in the previous movie, where only two-three of the dwarfs are actually given time on the screen and show that they are more than mere extras. It is a shame, because all thirteen dwarfs would have something individual and unique to bring to the movie aside from just being extras and fillers.<br/><br/>There is a lot of running in this movie. Basically the movie is one long chase. The group are chased by spiders, they run; they are chased by orcs, they run; they are chased by a dragon, they run. Despite all this cat and mouse chasing, then the 161 minutes the movie runs for come and go in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>This is indeed a movie with special effects, and there is nothing spared. There has been paid a lot of attention to the effects, and it has really paid off nicely. The spiders were really interesting and nicely animated, well aside from the talking that is. And Smaug himself and his vast hoard of treasure and trinkets, well that makes it worth watching the movie for that alone.<br/><br/>If you enjoy sword and fantasy, then of course you are familiar with the work of Tolkien. But translating a relative small book into a movie in three parts? Well, there is a lot of fillers, surely, but so far it is working out nicely enough. Perhaps not having read Tolkien's books is actually in your favor. Just enjoy the movies for the high fantasy that it is and don't pay too much attention to how true (or not) the movies are to the books.<br/><br/>As for the people on the cast list, well the casting department has done a nice job, as usual.<br/><br/>And as it was with the previous four movies, then it is grand to see the places brought to life, especially after having spent numerous years of playing Lord of the Rings Online.<br/><br/>""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is great fun, an adventure for just about everyone."
"ooppssee","9","0","3","27 December 2013"," I like the total series of LOTR
","Hi, I am fancylive and I love the series of LOTR...I mean from start to the last one "" The hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013)..And that's ultimately what The Desolation of Smaug is. No beginning, no end, lots of middle. To that end, I suspect one's affinity for this installment will correlate directly with how much of a mark the preceding film made. Beginning with a flashback (within the flashback that is the entire trilogy), we learn how Ian McKellen's wizard Gandalf first crossed paths with princely dwarf Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) in the lead-up to this saga's central quest, retrieving a lost gem that rightly belongs to the dwarfs from the dragon Smaug. From there, we rejoin our band of dwarf questers, and the titular Hobbit whose story we're ostensibly following, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman).<br/><br/>Whether outrunning giant wolves, outwitting giant spiders, or outthinking slightly tall elves, Smaug is essentially one long chase sequence punctuated by conversations as it ticks down to the title's promised conflagration. In that sense it marks a slight step up from its predecessor, given that An Unexpected Journey was saddled with a treasure trove of exposition and explication that's largely unnecessary here. And so we get an experience that, at it's best, engages on a visual, sensory level. The returning cast is still great, and it's also nice to see Orlando Bloom return as his Rings hero Legolas, the elf archer (although his role here is largely extraneous).<br/><br/>Where the film falls down, then, is exactly where the first one did. It's simply too much time spent servicing too little. I've made note before of how Tolkien's original tome is a breezy 300-page confection, and the miscalculation the adaptation makes, under Jackson's auspices, is in trying to take those 300 pages and spin them into a nine-hour behemoth. Now, part of this is simply the seams between ""art"" and ""commerce"" showing through. The various stakeholders in the Hobbit screen rights fought the equivalent of their own ""War of the Ring"" to see the book brought to screen, so they were damn sure going to squeeze every last dollar out of it they could.<br/><br/>And why make one flick, or even two, when you can just as well make three movies, and three times the coin? After all, there were three hugely-successful Lord of the Rings movies, right? Naturally. But what's seemingly been forgotten is that, for as mammoth a production as the Rings trilogy was, and for as long as the individual entries ended up being, each movie adapted one book. Only one book. Thus, in the process of spinning prose into celluloid, lots of little digressions and details got left out in service of the all-important need to maintain the pace and propulsion necessary to make a worthwhile filmic experience.<br/><br/>With the Hobbit movie series, on the other hand, we have an entirely different set of problems brought about by the decision (command?) to expand Tolkien's relatively lightweight book outward times three. Put simply, there's simply not enough story to make the process work feasibly. And so Jackson, et al, have been forced to forage through the various appendices, sidelights, assumptions, and implications that Tolkien peppered his various Middle Earth works with to pad, pad, pad out the running time and get us to that preordained 160-minute mark (with 160 more yet to come twelve months hence).I like all the character of these movies.... outstanding one...thanks for bringing on,,hats of ptv sports live, The main character I missing allot..but anyway this is the way how its going on<br/><br/>regards Fancylive"
"drystyx","6","0","3","26 December 2013"," A TV series atmosphere
","Jackson, fortunately and unfortunately, set the bar high with his sequel trilogy of ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>Here, we have a story that probably 95% of this present day generation know about, and about a third know almost every detail, so we're actually dealing with a ""rendition"" of a ""fairy tale"" in ways.<br/><br/>First of all, many characters, notably Gandalf, Bilbo, and Legolas, are household words, and are known to appear in the sequel.<br/><br/>There may come a day, fifty years from now, when half the people will not know this, and may see these ""prequels"" first, but even then, it will be very well known. We know these certain characters will survive, just as TV regular characters survive.<br/><br/>So, it appears that Jackson is giving these certain characters an ""observer"" effect, much like Eastwood in HANG EM HIGH and Burr's added in character in GOZILLA.<br/><br/>These characters are like the ""stable"" personalities of TV series title characters, who observe what guest stars do. One could say that Gandalf is Columbo, Bilbo is Sugarfoot, Legolas is Bronco, and so forth.<br/><br/>This story is the second of a trilogy, which is usually the action packed one with less direction. However, here, we have direction with less accomplishments.<br/><br/>I don't think it's a spoiler to let people know that the resolution with the dragon comes first, and then the huge war. I was disappointed that this film didn't end with the resolution with the dragon, and save the war for last.<br/><br/>That is the way Jackson deviates from the usual pattern. He is using this entire film to ""lead up"" to further events. Almost nothing is resolved here, and many subplots are laid in store for the final.<br/><br/>It is a very good film, but the bar is high on these films, and I wanted more. I have no problem with the added bits, like the she elf romance. At first, I thought it was a mistake to make Legolas so important, because we know he's in no danger, but it appears to be Jackson's way of saying that he doesn't want his ""fate"" to interfere with the story, and that he wants us to observe with him.<br/><br/>Radagast makes a brief appearance, but he is purposely made into a cameo character here, as if to downplay him. For those who missed the ""Unexpected Journey"", there was a definite symbolism accorded to Gandalf and Radagast as members of a bygone generation, with Gandalf representing the sixties and early seventies hippie movement, the pot smoking activists, and Radagast symbolic of the younger brother of Gandalf, the child of the late seventies, lost as a rebel without a cause.<br/><br/>The ineffectiveness of Radagast here, or at least his appearance seeming to be without meaning, is an obvious symbolic gesture by Jackson, who accords the proper praise to the activist generation. It doesn't mean Radagast is useless. It only means that he appears to be during this phase. Hopefully, he will get his chance in the end.<br/><br/>This entire film is a ""set up"", but doesn't live on its own. It really needs more. I think ""trilogies"" are a bit dishonest. It's trying to make us buy 3 books instead of one, to further one's own sales, but it is common in the modern world.<br/><br/>I watched this in 3D, and was happy that Jackson didn't abuse the 3D the way a horror movie geek would. He uses it for a purpose, not just to play games with people. I'm happy about that. It's effective this way, and artistic.<br/><br/>I disagree with the use of a film to simply set up the next film, but it is entertaining, and does give us the characters we realize will make war inevitable. The elf king and river town king are both greedy and selfish on a believable scale. Of the two, the elf king appears the worse of the two, and the one you could never deal with. We see this with the way he honors (or dishonors) a promise to a prisoner.<br/><br/>Obviously, since the film is a ""set up"" film, it really shouldn't be as lengthy as it is. However, Jackson isn't making this for us today. He's making this for ""prosperity"", to be appreciated 50 years from now, 300 years from now."

","I went to this movie and spent A LOT of money for the privilege of watch 3d of a story I have loved for over 40 years. Granted it is a tough area in the story plot line, but the lack of time continuity, which lends realism and anticipation to events, likely ended up on the floor to make way for some of the more ""amazing"" techniques and special effects. Essentially I feel the only 3d I truly saw that stood out was bumble bees and butterflies. Hardly worth the entrance fees. Seeing this in 2 d would have been just as good. As for the techniques, I don't play video games for a reason. I don't like the ""graphics"" and the glaring points I saw this, made the filming even less real. Also the conversation and acting was stilted and disjointed in many scenes. This is a joiner movie for the first Hobbit and continuing into Hobbit 3 and then to Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Better to put into the movie what the actors are thinking or how it is affecting the plot rather than long looks where the person watching has to guess what is going on, opposed to one who has read the book and may know what is going on. Of course the last bit gets exciting and boosts my estimation of the rest of the movie up quite a bit. However I shall be seeing the finale movie in 2d and possibly at home."
"sohansurag","7","0","2","24 December 2013"," All Hail Smaug!
","If you thought Peter Jackson's idea of stretching out a children's book into a trilogy was a bad idea, think again! Had it not been made so, we would have missed out on some of the best entertainment for 3 years. Without much ado, The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug, sequel to last year's The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey, is one of the best movies I have seen/experienced this year and undoubtedly stands to be the best in the series so far.<br/><br/>The Desolation Of Smaug starts off exactly where Unexpected Journey left off, well not exactly per se. Following a short Peter Jackson cameo you are thrown into a flashback where Gandalf convinces Thorin to reclaim his kingdom and from there on you are put into 3 hour roller coaster ride filled with much more exhilarating action and adventure than the original, but testing your bladders a bit. But that was expected from a Peter Jackson movie, wasn't it? And I am sure, we'd get much more to see in an extended cut soon enough. Nonetheless sitting through Desolation felt like a breeze with little boredom to pull you out of it.<br/><br/>The Desolation of Smaug doesn't shy away from packing quite a lot of action and adventure. Sprinkled with characters old and new, this is fantasy at its best fueled by J R R Tolkien's masterful literature along with some additions from Hollywood's skilled screenwriters. Yes, The Desolation of Smaug, for obvious reasons adds to the story and features characters and sequences which was never in the book. Peter Jackson has taken the liberty to do so and it does wonders, more than its prequel. While the original, despite being a visual grandeur, came just a bit short on drama and characterization, Desolation transcends them to some degree.<br/><br/>Martin Freeman reprises his role as Bilbo Baggins and he seemed, still, the best option for the role, his obsession with the ring growing stronger than ever as he builds his courage more and more for the quest. As does, Ian McKellan playing the ever powerful, heartwarming Gandalf, his presence in the movie was felt and every time I saw him walk across a narrow ledge, I yearned him to yell ""You, shall not pass!"" one more time. Unlike the reckless ruckus from the first, this time around the Dwarfs are given much more of a personality and most of them stood out especially Killi who shared a bit of romance with Evangeline Lily's Tauriel, the wood elf. And talk about elves, Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lily makes for a splendid duo, kicking orc butts like never before. Richard Armitage's Thorin too was given a much needed boost showing his inner struggles to forgo anything to reclaim his kingdom.<br/><br/>Let's allot a paragraph for the ultimate attraction Desolation offers, shall we? Yep, Smaug! If you've thought that they showed too much of Smaug in the previews believe me when I say you haven't seen nothing. Smaug, brilliantly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, is one of the wonders this movie's got to outbid. I agree I have slain my fair share of dragons in Skyrim, but to my surprise, Smaug wasn't anything like it. It's the spectacle that we'd been waiting for since we saw its gargantuan eye teased in the first and it delivers a sequence that'll forever be etched in all of LOTR/ Tolkien fans. I was totally in love with the Bilbo-Gollum encounter from the first, but this surpasses it on all levels.<br/><br/>Treading on lands far from Shire, our heroes are put into visually rich locales, be it Mirkwood or Laketown, everything had an uncanny authenticity. The CG and art that's been put into the movie is on par with The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy albeit a bit better. There were indeed some CG here and there that felt clumsy and coming from WETA, its kind of unforgivable. The IMAX experience was worth every penny and I suppose that's exactly why the level of immersion was delivered. Howard Shore's score does perfectly sync with the visuals but I'll need to listen to it more to comment on it more.<br/><br/>The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug is, first and foremost, an action adventure movie and Peter Jackson has done a great job in setting things up for the grand finale next year. Unlike the first, which took its own sweet time to set the heroes on quest, Desolation puts you straight in to the thick of all action and it was the indeed best way to end this year. The Hobbit series might not be known as much as the epic LOTR, but its charm is bound to make you love and cherish it."

Which are Beorns Home,Spider Scene, Time in Mirkwood getting tricked by Elf Magic. An then just increases the unnecessary time like long time in Laketown. Inside Erebor fighting a dragon. Oddly Dol Guldor was a important Mission in The hobbit which Peter did a great job.

"TinyDanseur27","8","0","2","21 December 2013"," Thoroughly enjoyable if seen with no expectations for plot loyalty.
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is thoroughly enjoyable if you go in without any expectations. Just the fact that they've broken up the book The Hobbit into three separate movies gave me the notion to expect the worst in terms of staying loyal to the plot line. With this in mind, I found this second installment of The Hobbit to be quite entertaining. The writers use the original story of The Hobbit as a basic framework, and then expand on it with added characters, sub-plots, and action scenes. All of these additions, though unnecessary to the original story, add some color and pizazz to The Hobbit that makes for an entertainment-packed film. There is action, suspense, witty dialogue, comedy, and even a little romance. As long as you can view this movie as a completely separate entity from the book, what's not to like?<br/><br/>My only real criticism with this film (and the first Hobbit film), is that the special effects team went a little overboard with the action sequences. What were complex battle scenes and stunts that looked realistic in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, are now obviously computer- generated, video game-like scenes that go on a bit longer than is necessary. Do audiences require so much stimulation these days? Is having Legolas shoot orcs while balancing on a dwarf's head while floating down a river really required? In these moments I was taken out of the fantasy. Although fun to see, they just aren't believable, and personally I want at least a tiny element of realism in this fantasy- filled film.<br/><br/>Other than that though, I recommend fantasy and LOTR lovers alike to see The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The two hours and forty-one minutes goes by pretty fast. Get lost in Middle Earth."
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","2","20 December 2013"," An improvement over An Unexpected Journey and a return to form for Peter Jackson
","""If you awaken that beast, you'll destroy us all!""<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has awakened my interest for the resolution of this franchise after a somewhat disappointing first installment. Being a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was disappointed with An Unexpected Journey and found the film long, tedious, and boring. The last 40 minutes of that film were what kept me interested for what Jackson could do in this sequel. I honestly didn't remember much about An Unexpected Journey, but I was glad that The Desolation of Smaug began more promising than its predecessor, and as the story unfolded my memory began to freshen up a bit. One of the issues I had with the first film was that the comedy didn't work too well and I really couldn't differentiate most of the dwarfs. The dilemma was solved here because there were several funny moments to lighten up the mood, and the dwarfs were developed much better and had distinct personalities with more meat to their characters. The film really picked up when Legolas and Tauriel entered the picture. I think Tauriel was my favorite character in this film considering how much I like Evangeline Lilly (sorry but being a huge Lost fan she will always be Freckles to me) and how well she executed each action sequence. The film has a couple of great action sequences, but the one that stood out above the rest was the barrel scene. It is honestly one of the best and funnest action scenes of the year. I was pleased with this film and would've given this a higher grade if it weren't for the overlong running time that did feel a bit tedious once again. The cliffhanger at the end worked really well for me as it definitely left me hooked for the final film of the franchise.<br/><br/>Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the 13 dwarfs led by Thorin (Richard Armitage) continue their journey to Lonely Mountain to try to reclaim their kingdom. The film picks up right where the first one left us, as they were approaching the Mirkwood Forest while the orcs were right behind their backs. Their journey to Lonely Mountain is not an easy one as they have to face all sorts of threats before arriving at their destination to try to reclaim the throne that was taken away from them by the gold digging dragon, Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). In the forest they first have to deal with giant spiders, but Bilbo who now possesses the ring is able to rescue them. Then they are captured by elves where they run into Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). Bilbo comes to the rescue yet again, but this is just the beginning of a long journey as the enemy seems to be getting stronger each minute that passes and he begins to become more self aware about the effects of the ring.<br/><br/>To say that The Desolation of Smaug is visually stunning is an understatement considering we have already seen what Peter Jackson can do with Middle Earth. Being the huge fan of Tolkien that he is, the attention to detail and love for his book translates to the big screen perfectly. The build up to the final confrontation with Smaug is full of thrills and excitements and the dragon is carefully crafted here. The face off of words between Smaug and Bilbo is also very well done. There are several scenes that worked masterfully here, but unfortunately there was simply too many things going on at times and the film felt overlong, although I must admit that the waiting does pay off. I was glad the characters were developed much better this time around and I was drawn into their world. This is an improvement over An Unexpected Journey and hopefully Jackson will end the trilogy with a bang. This was an exciting and thrilling adventure that sets the table for what is coming next."

","This chapter of the Hobbit story is very well made. The cinematographic effects are once again a top performance of the makers.<br/><br/>But still I cannot detach from a feeling that the story goes on too long.<br/><br/>This movie would overwhelm when it would be at least 45 minutes shorter, and yes, the encounter with Smaug is thrilling at first but the longer he is in view the more boring he gets. And when he finally starts to act (fly away) it's all over.<br/><br/>The characters are well done but certainly not as charming and emotionally connecting as the fellowshipmembers.remember the death of Boromir ? Maybe too many dwarfs and orks and too few of all other creatures.<br/><br/>All in all, well made , but overlong, and therefore denying itself a topscore. A movie that when seen once,is enough, unfortunately."
"matthewssilverhammer","7","0","4","20 December 2013"," Misguided and overlong, yet fun and impressive
","Each decade Hollywood gives us a middling series of prequels to a cultural phenomenon, and the innate problem with prequels is our lack of surprise because of the knowledge of the fate of the characters. The latest Hobbit isn't immune to these problems, but at least its prequels are more successful than others (ahemStar Wars), and it's difficult to deny the pull this world has on my attention. Jackson's fabulous realization of Middle Earth, the impressive spectacle, and fun set pieces are enough to recommend this otherwise misguided and overlong epic. Like the other Middle Earth movies, ""Desolation"" is essentially a road trip movie in which nothing is easy and every turn is filled with a ubiquitous ""darkness"". The themes of power and pride are still potent, but other than a few moments of much-needed humor, the dialogue is mostly either expositional and boring, or completely pointless and boring. On top of that, it is filled with drive-you-crazy moments of cheesy happenstance coincidences. However, the casting is strong as ever, especially Bilbo, Gandalf, Thorin, and the perfectly realized Smaug. Even if most of these characters are too often either quiet or totally absent in this chapter, their presence is still felt and needed. The biggest problem is the editing; not because of the length, but just to trim the fat a bit (a love triangle? Really?) But honestly, reviews are pointless. You are either going to see these films or you aren't; fans will like them, haters won't. For me, there is enough to like in this world to keep me coming back for morebut barely."

","The action in this installment was more plentiful than the first. There's not as much character development, and while the focus shifts toward a few of the main characters and dwarfs at times, for me there just wasn't as much empathy for the characters. That doesn't mean it wasn't fun, just not as introductory as the first ""Hobbit"" movie, but that's to be expected in a sequel. I loved the additional character written in for Evangeline Lilly as an elvin warrior who falls for a dwarf. I also loved the scenes with Legolas (Bloom) and think if Tolkien had written enough, he could star in his own movie because it is so entertaining to watch him dismantle orgs. The special effects, dragon, scenery, characters, etc. are all breathtaking and worth catching in IMAX if possible. There were some things in the movie that didn't make complete sense to me and felt out of place, but it felt like Jackson was just trying to wrap up some things that take place in the book and couldn't find a better way to slowly unravel the details so they felt a bit rushed or strange.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, this one is worth seeing, and I'm planning on catching it again to better take it in, and this time without the naps. If you liked the previous movies, or like suspenseful, sci-fi, fantasy, etc. Don't miss out on this one."

","As Peter Jackson stated, this movie as well as the others is ultimately waiting to find its place on a DVD/bookshelf, a detail not to be forgotten when sharing comments. Unlike most other theater rendez-vous, this is not a fast-food opus aiming to be seen one time for all.<br/><br/>But if such aim surely suited Tolkien's LOTR trilogy, how could it work with The Hobbit, a little book which never wore so vast an ambition ? <br/><br/>Mostly, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy was a scale extension of the Hobbit, both of them beginning at Bag End and ending in a great-scale war against orcs. So, how should we bother to have two of the same ? <br/><br/>Somewhat, Fate put that paradoxal temptation in Peter Jackson's way. Like Tolkien, PJ had to further the adventure because of his first success. That means attempting to surpass LOTR as if it was a first draft.<br/><br/>Will it be a successful enterprise ? Will it reach limits or suppress them ? IMO, some limits were already in sight, because Tolkien never really succeeded to create a resilient & self-sustaining fantasy world further than a theater for neverending battles against an evil force perpetually fueling them like they did in his obsessional Silmarilion. So, Peter Jackson, as movie-maker, may as well end being trapped himself in that obsession. That's why, in my opinion, the more important is to see if he will escape it, and how.<br/><br/>What we already have in the new trilogy is an escapism in a new generation of technology, and a challenge for story-filling skills.<br/><br/><ul><li>About CGIs : For years now, lots of people are used to complain about them as if they were alienating movie-making : George Lucas and most contemporary blockbusterers fell into that trap ; does Jackson stay on its edge ? Much more than a draft, An Unexpected Journey was already a CGI-feast : we got the Trolls, Gollum, the Goblins, Azog and the Great Goblin, BUT a significant portion of people complaining about CGIs. In Desolation of Smaug we get Beorn, the Spiders, Bolg, Sauron, Smaug and even a little bit of Thranduil that is more CGIs, while the complain about CGIs has decreased, among the critics as well as among the public. Innovative CGI getting into a routine after only one year, that is indeniably a progress in terms of movie-making.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>About storytelling : for the first time, what we have is a single book turned into a trilogy. LOTR had already been a revolution in the way that P Jackson shot together 3 movies, that had never be done before. But THIS is a new revolution, maybe even more important for the history of movie-making, because it shows how ONE book can be turned into THREE movies, thus respecting all of their contents and adding environmental bits. </li></ul><br/><br/>How many books can be converted that way ? So far, nobody knows, but the main fact may be that nobody was caring about such a question before. That may be a progress for movie adaptation, because for decades we got used to a 2-hours standard movie-making that had mutilated lots of literature masterpieces, and now we happen to know now that those cuts may not stay as a fatality : a book converted in 3 films can be a commercial success, adding its short life in theaters to its longer life in DVD-shelves.<br/><br/>P Jackson allowed himself to ADD NEW ELEMENTS, 'filling the hoes' to a book already existing. Had it been done before ? Probably not in the 2-hours standard movie-making, where the main purpose was to determine what had to be cut, and not what had to be added.<br/><br/>Then, whether the ads are approved or disapproved, nobody can avoid the fact that those adds are here in the first place and maybe for the first time in movie-making history.<br/><br/>Erebor the Mountain of Gold opened this new Gate in AUJ. Then, Azog the Defiler added his own profanation of the ancient habits in movie-making. In Desolation of Smaug, the gate is now wide open, and see what we get : <br/><br/><ul><li>A young dwarf recognizing a She-Elf as some star he thought inaccessible for ages to come. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A leader dwarf standing where nobody ever stood in any dragon story : on a dragon snout </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A dragon fascinated by a golden dwarf as tall as him </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A red dragon turned golden dragon and stupidly hating it, for his own demise...</li></ul><br/><br/>And all this is just a glimpse into a new world which may be NOT part of Tolkien's world, but which is surely part of OUR world now. Those new allegories existing for ages to come.<br/><br/>Do we lose here, or do we earn ?"
"seawolfvii","7","0","2","12 December 2013"," Very good but lacking the greatness of the literary prowess of Tolkien
","Overall the movie was good even very good, 6.5 to 7 stars. I really enjoyed the actors, settings, scenes, and some of the CGI etc, but I left lacking the positive feelings/emotions that the last 2 hours and 41 minutes were well spent. I think the writers were more interested in making a name for themselves than adding to the legacy of the J.R.R. Tolkien series. There was simply too much embellishment where none was needed. The original storyline was brilliant, to change it to become your own Mr. Jackson (writers and the rest of you) detracted from what could have been great. I'm sure in the movie industry there are the investors other business people who push for more thrill (which these days translates to CGI) to increase the target audience thereby increasing the ROI. Okay sure, I get it, movie making is a businessbut this movie could have been really great for Tolkienists, fantasy buffs, modern movie goers, from old to young, women and men alikeinstead I think you sold out to pay for the ridiculous $200 million production cost (which is still baffling given the excessive CGI) turning an 8 or 9 star movie into a paltry homage to a great book and great writer.<br/><br/>I watched ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" the day before I saw The Hobbit Part 2 to kind of sync movie with movie. I enjoyed the first Hobbit movie quite a bit but had a hard time syncing the first with the secondthe transition was vague. I think they were trying to link this second Hobbit movie to the first LotR movie (Fellowship of the Rings)? It seemed awkward at best. I also watched The Hobbit (cartoon) created by Rankin/Bass in 1977 just because I recall being fond of it when I was a kid and I wanted to remember some of what the characters said/did in the cartoon version perhaps with expectations of a more enjoyable Desolation of Smaug through modern movie magic. <br/><br/>Let me start with the pronunciation of the dragon's name. I'm sure Americans mispronounce ""Smaug"" and if Mr. Tolkien intended it to be ""Sma oog"" then I apologize but I liked the cartoon version which was more like ""Smog."" If you say each pronunciation with a deep dragonesque voice, 'Smog' sounds much more frightening (and endearing, unless you live in a big city). The heavily aspirated ""au"" makes it sound like a pre-pubescent teenage boy with a heavy southern (US) accent (Ma name is Smaug, I live in Arabarn. Why dontch'all come over to air house fer supper). Mr. Boone has long gone from this world (RIP) but I really liked his voice as Smaug in the cartoon version, though to his credit (and probably sound mixing) Mr. Cumberbatch did a splendid job as well.<br/><br/>I got the impression that Bilbo was ""invisible"" with much of his conversation with Smaug. Perhaps it was the fact the book said as much. And perhaps writers of The Hobbit 2 were trying to show the magnificence of Smaug and the insignificance of Bilbo so his ring was off the rest of the scene(s). The literary power of Smaug describing himself was less than impressive in this movie. Why would they compare his hide to iron, because modern movie goers relate more to iron than shields? The literary version was much better, ""My armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws spears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death.""<br/><br/>And the melting statue which liquefies (or didn't cool) almost instantly bathing Smaug in goldoh my *sigh*. Yes, Smaug looked cool as a gold dragon. Maybe this scene was for chemists (you know attract a wider audience) showing how the melting point of gold is much lower than that of iron. And I'm sure one could draw some literary semblance there. Smaug had become too greedy he was gold likening him to King Midas, but why? Again *sigh*.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays a brilliant Legolasbut his character isn't even in The Hobbit. Did they have a contractual agreement to put him in, or was he so popular in the first three LotR series they felt the movie needed more movie star cache to help pay for the bloated budget? I liked him as a LotR character, he plays a great elf. You want to include him because there were many woodland elves in the book, I'm sure he could be one of them. But to create those atrociously long CGI scenes (hunting orcs, barrel riding, fighting in town, chase scene out of town with Legolas' riding a horribly CGI'd horse), enough with the excessive CGI elf fighting. Yes we are supposed to hate orcs (secretly I like some of them, hee hee). But there were probably 100's of orcs coming out of every crack and crevice and basically two people killing most of them over the course of tens of miles with a little help from the ""em-barrelled"" dwarfs (pulling weapons out of their cracks and crevices I guess).<br/><br/>I love today's fighting females, villains and heroines! And I enjoyed seeing Tauriel in the movie. Ms. Lilly does a great job and her Albertan beauty serves the female elf role well. And it was nice to see the blossoming love between her and Kili to say little of the nice addition of mixed-race relations to a modern movie. There are so many talented and beautiful actresses out there. But again, she wasn't even in the book, creative license you sayokay.<br/><br/>My list is long of grievances but to be fair my list of congratulatory remarks is also long. Let me sum it up by saying, 'Well done, could have been better, stop CGI-ing everything, movie goers don't drink or eat before going to the movie2 hours and 41 minutes is a near impossible stretch to endure with even the most formidable of bladders.'"

Tolkien in his letters noted how Sauron casts just ""a fleeting shadow"" over the pages of The Hobbit; in Jackson's movie the shadow is darker and deeper.<br/><br/>Entire new subplots are freely created and added to the story. The Elf Tauriel and her unlikely infatuation with one of the Dwarfs is clearly meant to add a love story where the book has none, and have at least ONE strong female character its was nice to see Orlando bloom back his actions scenes were brilliant.bilboa bagins brings a kinda warmth to the story of trying to be a hero.<br/><br/>you know waiting for the dragon to come along was well worth the Wait as the first film teased because the action scenes story and and thing of smegal the way his character was done thing 100 times better with the dragon this was highlight of a terrific movie that the left you spellbound is nothing short of brilliant, full of detail that can only be appreciated on the, I'll award Jackson's re-imagined ""The Hobbit"" 9 an half stars."

","After all this time, I still have in mind how great it was to see the 3 LOTR-films. The big battle scenes, all the settings, creatures and characters.....wonderfully crafted fantasy movies after Tolkiens books, which I red. The first part of the Hobbit was leaving me then already with a ""ok, nice"" feeling. Because somehow I'm maybe not fanatic enough to go on and on with Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs and the tales of the little Hobbits. Seems nothing new or unexpected could come after the first 3 LOTR-movies. Time passed by and Hobbit part 2 comes out...who ran into cinema again..? ME. Why ? I don't know. It was just again about Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs, a Dragon and the tales of the little Hobbits. What did I expected....stupid me. So, what can I say...a absolute must for real fans because it is well made. For myself, I'm pretty sure now that all other Hobbit-related movies by Peter Jackson will be seen at best only at home on a rainy week-end. I'm getting saturated.

","I like Peter Jackson. I like long movies. I like the Tolkien subject matter of LOTR or Lord of The Rings. This is not any of the above correctly. I just finished watching LOTR and it holds. It is one of the greats and I have the extended version which is the only way to take this in. This 2nd part of the Hobbit movie is worth the price of a ticket for nearly 3 hours of entertainment. But it is not a classic now nor will it hold its own over time. It currently rules the movie theaters quite well because quite frankly there isn't too much quality out there. Oh a good movie comes and goes now and again but not enough of them for my likes. Now as to this move: It appears that there is so much to fight over and about in middle earth and those fights last too long and are over done. You cannot help but wonder how lucky the fighters are because if they made one mistake, there would be NO second chance. They never make enough mistakes. Furthermore, I hate when you see a good movie that is based on Sci-Fi or a comic book adventure lets say and then when something that is unbelievable takes place and suspends your common sense, everyone is quick to point out its only a movie and in this world that is what happens. Cop out is how it comes across to me. At least don't make it so blatant. These Dwarfs should have died about 50 times already. Now, as to this dragon. Smart, egotistical, arrogant, powerful and the ruler of all he surveys until you push his buttons and he then acts like an angry drunk in a bar. Furthermore, he talks so much gibberish in general that he should apply for a teaching credential or a PHD at the least on saying so much without making sense. I have no doubt he can fly fast, breath fire and wreck havoc, but too talky for my tastes. This movie is part of a 3 part movie release strategy that when done will bring in billions of dollars. They must have lined up around the block and begged to invest in these movies. That is my point. It is a money machine and at the same time is trying to please the audience. All I am saying is it is overdone on being a first class movie as the marketing would have you believe. Why it didn't reach the LOTR quality is frankly because the money took precedence. It happened with King Kong too. Jackson was pressured while being humored to get it done and the movie suffered for it. I couldn't figure out how someone who loved the original King Kong and who had money and connections could blow a chance to make it immortal like the first one. Money & time as in return on the money won out. Also, this writing team is talented but a word of warning. That doesn't mean everything they write about will be a first class hit. These three movies were shot all at once and then someone just took a editing knife and sliced it into threes. Yes, go see this movie because for the time and the ticket price, it works. But it is not a can't wait to see again type movie just like the first one isn't either. Yes I will see the last segment because I will need closure for the series. It is my hope that people in the movie industry who have resources do not forget or forsake their first love which was movie making and cut corners and make this a too money centered business. Easy on the drinks when you go to a theater because of no bathroom breaks. Popcorn recommended and favorite candy for a premium experience"
"bakchu","7","0","3","15 December 2013"," Entertaining, but stretching choices not always convincing
","I'm writing this as a Tolkien reader who was, on the whole, very happy with Jackson's adaptation of ""The Lord of the Rings"". LotR is a voluminous and complex work that calls for an epic adaptation of considerable length - which Jackson delivered. It wouldn't be a good idea trying to compress the plot of LotR into a single movie of two or three hours, and so the ""trilogy"" approach worked fine. Now, ""The Hobbit"" is a different case. A much shorter, simpler book, lighter in tone and meant for children - though some would say that it's still a rather dark example of a children's book, containing elements of tragedy. Jackson is making this book into a film trilogy of approximately the same length as ""Lord of the Rings"" - of course this isn't possible without stretching the story considerably and adding new material not found in the book. In the first part of Jacksons' ""The Hobbit"", I found this stretching approach not bothering. The slow pace at which the story unfolded allowed for fine renditions of famous and beloved scenes such as the arrival of the Dwarfs at the home of poor, bewildered Bilbo, or his encounter with Gollum. I'm also fine with the expansion of the role of Radagast (who is merely mentioned in passing in the book) which makes sense to me.<br/><br/>But now, in the second part, I think the stretching partly goes too far, and it's not always stretched where most fitting. For example, I would have liked to see the company wander longer in Mirkwood before the troubles with the spiders start. Tolkien lets them travel in the forest for many days, probably weeks - their provisions running low, they get hungry and quite desperate. There's also a scene not in the movie which would have fitted well, Bombur falling into an enchanted stream and afterwards having to be carried for a while in constant slumber... In the movie, Mirkwood is over too quickly. It's as if they go into the forest, are lost for a short time, but quickly get ambushed by the spiders and then captured by the elves. The oppressiveness and gloom of Mirkwood isn't really developed. Which is a shame, as there's so much time... On the other hand, the movie is spending quite some time on a completely new character, a female wood elf called Tauriel, which, given the almost entire lack of female characters in Tolkien's book, is understandable, but still doesn't blend very well with the story. Also, the attempt of creating a stronger connection to ""The Lord of the Rings"" by showing the identity and growing strength of the ""Necromancer"" in Dol Guldur in a rather blunt way is understandable, but in my opinion it could have been done a bit more restrainedly. - However, this is an entertaining movie, and the actors are splendid. Martin Freeman's Bilbo is much more interesting and complex than Elijah Wood's Frodo was, Ian McKellen still a superb Gandalf, Richard Armitage's Thorin is charismatic, and all the other dwarfs are well chosen. Smaug is, I daresay, perfect. Although, speaking of Smaug - this movie ends very abruptly with Smaug flying towards Laketown. Whilst the first part ends naturally in a moment of respite, this one feels more like cut off in the middle than a cliffhanger. I think here the decision of making three instead of two parts is showing after all."
"Bruce722","8","0","3","15 December 2013"," Cliff hanger ending was weak.
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug was a really good movie with great visuals and it continued telling an amazing story. The increased action of this film over the previous one will surely get most people's attention and will probably make most younger people actually like it more. The special effects were also a bit better, in my opinion, and the dragon sequence at the end was just amazing. My only real probably with the film is the ending. That just isn't a good place to leave the film hanging. Obviously you should look at all of these films as one large movie broken up into three parts but the reality is that the third part won't be available to see until next year which makes this movie stand alone, in a sense. When considering that the entire movie seemed to be building to a climax that never occurs, it feels a little anticlimactic."
